Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Kentucky State \nTrooper Cameron Ponder of Rineyville, Kentucky.\n  I believe many people watched or saw with horror the news that spread \nacross this country that another one of our public service officers was \nkilled this week. Only 31 years old, Cameron was shot and killed during \nan on-duty traffic stop earlier this week.\n  Known by his peers and in the community as an athlete, Cameron was an \nall-State performer in track and was the kicker on the football team in \nhigh school. After graduating from North Hardin High School near Fort \nKnox, Cameron joined the U.S. Navy, turning down a track scholarship.\n  More personally, Cameron was a son, an uncle, and a fiance. Cameron \ngraduated from the Kentucky State Police Academy in January and had \nbeen a trooper for less than 9 months.\n  Among the many condolences that have been shared are those of his \nformer Navy colleagues, who talked about his devotion to our country.\n  While Cameron was taken far too soon, his commitment to service and \ncommunity has not gone unnoticed. I join with all of Kentucky's Second \nDistrict in sending prayers to Cameron's family, friends, and his \nKentucky State Police brethren. We will miss him and are thankful for \nhis service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6079-5", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6079-H6080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CLIMATE CHANGE AND PUBLIC HEALTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, there was a time when climate change was a \nconcern for future generations, a time when we focused on predicting \nthe possible problems and brainstorming the possible solutions, a time \nwhen the threat was real, but we still had time to act. We had not come \nface-to-face with our tipping point.\n  That time has passed. President Obama put it best when he said: ``We \nare the first generation to feel the impacts of climate change, and the \nlast generation that can still do something about it.''\n  The time to act is now, and the call to action cannot be any clearer. \nDespite the fact that more than 12,000 peer-reviewed scientific studies \nare in agreement that climate change is real and humans are \nsignificantly to blame, my colleagues continue to debate its validity. \nWell, if the devastating global and environmental threats aren't proof \nenough, let me share some of the negative impacts climate change is \nhaving on our air quality and public health now.\n  Simply put, climate change and air pollution make a dangerous pair. \nIn fact, air pollution is among the most serious, indirect health \neffects of global climate change. The same power plants that release \nharmful carbon dioxide into our atmosphere also create dangerous levels \nof soot, smog, and ground-level ozone. The result is a combination of \nozone and fine particles that can have devastating health impacts. In \nall, 147 million people in the U.S., nearly half of this Nation--our \nNation--are breathing unhealthy air. And the news is far worse in \nBeijing, where a new study claims that the air in Beijing is so \npolluted, breathing it does as much damage to the lungs as smoking 40 \ncigarettes a day. That is simply unacceptable.\n  To make matters worse, the warmer temperatures from climate change \nare only increasing the frequency of days with unhealthy levels of \nground-level ozone. If emissions of air pollutants remain fixed at \ntoday's levels until 2050, warming from climate change alone could \nincrease the number of red ozone alert days by 68 percent in the 50 \nlargest Eastern U.S. cities.\n  Studies have also linked breathing and ozone pollution to an \nincreased risk of premature deaths and difficulty breathing. If there \nare no changes in regulatory controls, the CDC predicts up to 4,300 \nadditional premature deaths in the United States by the year 2050 from \ncombined ozone and particle health effects.\n  The good news is that air quality has improved dramatically in many \nAmerican cities over the past 40 years due to the Clean Air Act. The \nClean Air Act has a track record of cutting dangerous\n\n[[Page H6080]]\n\npollution and has prevented more than 400,000 premature deaths. In \nfact, it has helped to cut ground-level ozone by more than 25 percent \nsince 1980 and reduced mercury emissions by 45 percent since 1990. If \nthat isn't enough, the economic value of these improvements is \nestimated to reach almost $2 trillion by the year 2020.\n  The recently announced Clean Power Plan offers us the opportunity we \nneed to continue to better protect public health. It is projected to \ncontribute to significant ozone pollution reductions, resulting in \nimportant benefits including avoiding up to 3,600 premature deaths, \n90,000 asthma attacks in children, and 1,700 heart attacks.\n  However, the continued effects of climate change and our inability to \nact are impairing our continued progress. Climate change is creating \nconditions that make it harder for us to clean up our air and reduce \npollution. Without addressing one problem, we eliminate our progress on \nanother.\n  Unfortunately, Members of this body use every opportunity possible to \nattack the Clean Air Act and now the Clean Power Plan. These \nunprecedented assaults block, weaken, or delay a host of long overdue \nclean air safeguards. As my colleagues continue to stand in our own \nway, we are harming the environment and ultimately hurting ourselves.\n  Mr. Speaker, climate change is a direct threat to humanity, and it is \ntime we reexamine how we can think about it, talk about it, and respond \nto this growing problem. We may be part of the problem, but we also \nhave the unique opportunity to become part of the solution.\n  I think Pope Francis put it best when he said: ``Yet all is not lost. \nHuman beings, while capable of the worst, are also capable of rising \nabove themselves, choosing again what is good, and making a new \nstart.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to heed these wise words and make a \nchoice to act on climate change to protect our health. We cannot afford \nto wait any longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6080-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FEDERAL CONTRACTORS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNevada (Mr. Hardy) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in order to express my deep \nconcern and disapproval of how the Obama administration has continued \ntheir assault on Federal and private contractors.\n  Since taking office, the President has signed a total of 13 executive \norders that directly focus on Federal contracting, all of which \nestablish new labor requirements and impose additional financial \nburdens on contractors. When you also include the 16 new regulations \nthat have been created from these orders, a large portion of \ncontractors who were once able to compete for Federal contracts are now \nbeing forced out due to these new hurdles.\n  In fact, the number of small contractors who submit bids for Federal \ncontracts have declined by more than 100,000 since 2013. This is \nunacceptable. While these mandates range from forcing contractors to \nprovide additional employee benefits to being required to report \nadditional information during the bidding process, the one thing that \neach of these new directives has in common is that it will make it more \ndifficult for small contractors to compete for Federal contracts. A \nprime example is the executive order known as the Fair Pay and Safe \nWorkplaces, which the President signed in July 2014. While intended to \naward Federal contracts only to responsible contractors who have not \ncommitted recent labor violations, the actual outcome will lead to \nadditional reporting requirements, increased administrative costs, and \nthe potential for a contractor to be blacklisted from bidding on \nFederal contracts while they prove that they are innocent from the \naccused infraction.\n  Mr. Speaker, by using executive orders to bypass congressional \nauthority, this is nothing more than an attempt by this administration \nto implement their agenda without regard for the negative impact it \nwill have on businesses and industries. But, unfortunately, this agenda \nextends beyond Federal contractors. The recent National Labor Relations \nBoard ruling in the Browning-Ferris Industries case, which is more \nwidely known as the joint employer decision, will have a massive impact \non the business relationships between contractors and their \nsubcontractors, franchisors and franchisees, and other contract labor \nrelations.\n  In one politically motivated decision, the NLRB completely redefined \nthe definition of ``joint employer'' when they determined that a \ncompany could be held liable for a labor violation committed by a \nsubcontractor or a staffing agency that they hired, even if this \ncompany doesn't have direct supervision over those workers.\n  This sharing of responsibility is nothing more than an attempt to \nforce both parties into collective bargaining, but the result will be \nmuch worse. Franchisors may decide that it is in their best interest to \nassert more authority over their franchisees to make sure that labor \nviolations are less likely to occur, but then other franchisors may \ndecide it is more cost effective to end their relationship as a way to \navoid potential issues. Essentially, the same results could occur with \ncompanies who hire staffing agencies or independent contractors to \nprovide them with temporary employees or contractors who hire \nsubcontractors to perform skilled labor.\n  As a small business contractor for more than two decades, I \nunderstand the unique relationship between a contractor and a \nsubcontractor. In the end, the joint employer decision will disrupt \nthis relationship and potentially discourage future contract \narrangements.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask for my colleagues to join with me in demanding \nthis administration to stop continually adding burdens to our Federal \nand private contractors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6080-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6080-H6081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RACISM AND VOTING RIGHTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, I rewatched recently one of my favorite \nmovies. ``Selma'' tells the story of the fight to register voters in \nSelma, Alabama, culminating in the march from Selma to Montgomery, led \nby Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1965. Spoiler alert: After being \nturned around, threatened, beaten, tear-gassed, and killed, Black \npeople got to vote in America.\n  A young and handsome John Lewis is depicted in the pivotal role of \nthe community organizer who helps lead the movement. Another spoiler \nalert: John is a Member of this body and serves with distinction from \nthe State of Georgia.\n  It is among the highest honors of my life to know John Lewis and to \nwork with him. In fact, I have marched with him and gotten arrested \nwith John Lewis outside this Capitol Building in our fight for \nimmigration reform.\n  I highly recommend the movie, and I want every citizen--and every \nperson who lives here and hopes to become a citizen one day--to watch \nand learn from the movie ``Selma.'' It is a moment in history when \nvoting and citizenship were literally life-and-death struggles--and it \nwas only 50 years ago.\n  And just yesterday, the NAACP completed a historic 1,000-mile march \nfrom Selma to Washington to remind us how we must always stand up to \nbullies and official inaction using nonviolence and community \norganizing and empowerment techniques.\n  The way to respond to racism is to vote. I have been thinking a lot \nabout that recently as the Republican Presidential field of candidates \nhas fallen in line with a bully who spews racism and is leading among \nhis party's primary voters.\n  What can Americans do when the tail wagging the dog of the Republican \nParty is saying that most Mexicans are murderers and rapists?\n  What can we do as a nation when candidates blame unrest in reaction \nto police violence in Baltimore and Ferguson on Mexican and Central \nAmerican immigrants.\n  What can we do when thousands of people cheer when a candidate \nproposes building a great wall of America on our southern border, and \nthe response from other candidates is to say that we should build \nanother wall opposite Canada as well?\n  Well, in the movie ``Selma,'' Oprah Winfrey didn't just get mad; she \nfought\n\n[[Page H6081]]\n\nback by making sure she could register to vote. We have all learned \nwhat the Republican Party seems to be forgetting: Appeals to a narrow \nRepublican electorate with over-the-top racism and below-the-belt \nimmigrant bashing will not get you to the White House.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  President Romney--oh, I'm sorry. Governor Romney got more White votes \nthan any candidate in the history of the United States, but he couldn't \novercome the demographic reality that the country is more diverse and \nso are its voters.\n  Appeals to racism and immigrant bashing are creating a predictable \nbacklash in the neighborhoods of my district in Chicago. People are \ncalling and coming into my office, asking what they can do to push \nback.\n  Very specifically, those who are not yet citizens are asking: How do \nI become a citizen? Those who have not registered to vote are asking \nhow to get that done.\n  In Latino and Asian communities and in every community that thinks \nthat calling most Mexicans ``rapists'' is not the kind of political \nrhetoric that should go unchallenged, people are becoming citizens.\n  My office in Chicago is known as a place to go if you want \ninformation on the citizenship process. In total, more than 50,000 \nAmerican citizens have come to our office for help in figuring out the \nprocess.\n  The demand for information on citizenship has grown so much in my \ndistrict that, this Saturday, from 9:00 to noon, at the Instituto Del \nProgreso Latino, I will join my staff and local advocates and the local \noffice of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for a free \nworkshop on applying to become a citizen.\n  Not only will people get help in understanding the process, but we \nwill also help them figure out if they qualify for a fee waiver so that \nthe $680 application fee that people have to pay is not a barrier.\n  Think about it. There are roughly 8.8 million immigrants with green \ncards who have lived in the U.S. for 5 years or more or who have been \nmarried to a U.S. citizen for 3 years or more, and they can pass a \nbackground check and qualify for citizenship today.\n  So what I am proposing is that, instead of renewing your green card, \nif you are one of those 8.8 million people, and you get it for $450 for \n10 years, you apply for permanent citizenship, with a fee waiver, and \nbecome a citizen for free. That is right.\n  Apply for citizenship, and you can vote for whomever you want to vote \nfor. You can even vote against the guy who called your whole ethnic \ngroup ``rapists,'' ``murderers,'' and ``drug dealers.'' That kind of \nugly, un-American attack is moving people to apply for citizenship and \nmoving citizens to become voters.\n  Mr. Speaker, today is Citizenship Day, and there are hundreds of \ncitizenship workshops and activities across the country. I am looking \nforward to meeting with the hundreds of people who will be working \ntowards their citizenship this Saturday in Chicago.\n  The way to respond to racism is by voting, and in Latino and \nimmigrant communities, we are getting that message loud and clear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6081-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           OZONE REGULATIONS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reject a \nproposal from the Environmental Protection Agency that would increase \ncompliance measures in dealing with ozone. This proposal has been met \nwith bipartisan opposition in Pennsylvania from local, State, and, yes, \nFederal elected officials.\n  As a result of these regulations, three counties in my district--\nErie, Centre, and Clearfield--would fall out of compliance with Federal \nlaw. This comes at a time when Pennsylvania's ozone emissions have \ndeclined for decades.\n  Let me repeat that. This comes at a time when the ozone emission \nlevels in Pennsylvania have been in decline for decades. This is an \nEPA-Obama administration political solution in search of a problem.\n  The new regulations would trigger an implementation procedure for \ncounties which would make State and local officials answer to the EPA \nfor basic permitting and planning decisions.\n  The regulations would threaten the State's ability to open new \nmanufacturing facilities and, by the way, the jobs that would go with \nthat. They would threaten the State's ability to expand current \nbusinesses and invest in new roadways.\n  They would also threaten agriculture through restrictions on animal \nfeeding operations due to emissions from animal waste, along with \nlimits on pesticide use.\n  This proposal comes at a time when ozone emissions across \nPennsylvania have been in decline, again, for decades. With the State's \neconomy still on the rebound from the Great Recession, now is the wrong \ntime for new, stringent, and, I would argue, unnecessary rules from the \nEPA that could kill jobs.\n  The fact is, Mr. Speaker, this proposal is the latest in a series of \noverreaches by the EPA, including the Clean Power Plan, which was \nannounced earlier this summer by President Obama.\n  That plan will work hand in hand with these proposed ozone limits to \nkill good-paying jobs and to stifle economic development in \nPennsylvania and across the Nation.\n  Furthermore, recent studies have called into question the claim that \nozone levels lead to health issues, including asthma, especially among \nchildren.\n  With that in mind, these proposed regulations, which could be the \ncostliest in the history of this Nation, may not have any impact on the \nhealth of our citizens.\n  There is still time for the EPA to reconsider the stringent \nregulation proposals for ozone and coal power plants.\n  As the Representative of a largely rural district which depends on \nagriculture, I understand how important it is that we be good stewards \nof the environment.\n  However, that stewardship must be balanced with the protection of \nindustries and jobs, which have powered our communities for \ngenerations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6081-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6081-H6082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DROUGHT AND WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the devastating \nwildfires that are sweeping throughout the Western States and, \nparticularly, in much of California.\n  Last week, we had over 22 wildfires at one time that were in various \nparts of California. Because of the incredible 4 consecutive dry years, \nwhat once was a seasonal issue now seems to be year round.\n  Obviously, the drought conditions facing California played a big role \nin the ability to manage these wildfires, and the devastation that has \noccurred as a result of that has been great.\n  These last 4 years have been among the driest 4 years we have had, \nclimatologists say, in 1,200 years in California and in the Western \nStates.\n  Over 70 percent of California is facing what is considered to be \nextreme and exceptional drought conditions, which are among the highest \ncategories that you can face under drought conditions.\n  California is not new to managing wildfires. It is part of living in \nthat State as well as in other Western States, but these dry conditions \nover the last 4 years have made it worse; therefore, we need to try to \nfigure out different ways to address this.\n  The Rough fire in Fresno County, which is part of the county I \nrepresent, has burned over 140,000 acres. Yesterday, finally, we got up \nto 67 percent contained.\n  This fire has lasted over a month, and it has closed one of our great \nnational parks, Kings Canyon National Park. Last week, when I was home, \nliterally, ashes were raining on our communities. Governor Jerry Brown \nhas announced a state of emergency for northern California.\n  The Valley and Butte fires have been significant, affecting both \nCongressman McClintock's and Congressman Thompson's districts.\n  Congressman Thompson has lost over 600 homes, and the fires are \nthreatening thousands more. He has stayed\n\n[[Page H6082]]\n\nthere to protect his district and assist with the fires. At this point, \nthe Valley fire is only 30 percent contained. The Butte fire has taken \n233 homes.\n  As a result of these devastating fires, sadly, two firefighters have \nlost their lives, three civilians have been killed, and four \nfirefighters have been hospitalized due to receiving severe burns. \nLiterally, we have thousands and thousands of men and women who are out \nthere manning these fires.\n  So the question is: What should we do about it as these numbers, \nsadly, continue to rise?\n  We need to better manage our forests. We need to help alleviate and \ncut down on the fuel that is there through the brush that has made \nthese fires spread incredibly fast in conditions that were never \nforetold. Wildfire suppression and better managing our forests is a key \nto doing this.\n  The funding that we provide for natural disasters, like to FEMA for \nhurricanes and for earthquakes, ought to go toward putting out these \nfires.\n  We have exceeded over $1 billion in the U.S. Forestry Department's \nbudget, and we have completely overrun our ability to provide funding.\n  Currently, money the U.S. Forest Service has allocated for forest \ncleanup in order to prevent fires is being used to put the fires out.\n  We must put our political differences aside and pass legislation that \nwill alleviate this crisis in Western States and in California.\n  In addition to getting legislation passed that will provide funding \nfor putting fires out, we need to put legislation together that would, \nin fact, in the future, manage our forests better.\n  In July, I, along with Congressman Valadao, introduced legislation, \nthe Western Water and American Food Security Act.\n  This is part of a larger effort to deal with this issue. This \nlegislation is the first step toward passing a bill that will provide \nadditional tools for California to manage drought. This bill addresses \na number of solutions to fix California's broken water system.\n  They include improved operations that are governed by the latest \nscience, which will allow us to move more water when water is available \nin the system; additional water storage capacity; increased water \nrecycling and reuse; improved water efficiency; and a conveyance \nsolution that minimizes the use of an ecosystem as infrastructure and \nthat balances the water needs for all of California.\n  This is but one of the tools that we need to address. We have \nlegislation in the House, and we have legislation in the Senate. This \nfall, I hope we will be able to work together in a bipartisan fashion \nto pass this important legislation.\n  Certainly, these wildfires tell the public--and the public tells us--\nthat we must do something about this. It must be a priority that we get \nsomething signed into law this year, before the rainy and snowy seasons \nbegin. Lord knows, we hope it rains and snows this winter.\n  People in California, people in our valley, which has been ground \nzero for the drought impacts, and people in the West want Congress to \nact.\n  I urge my colleagues to take the appropriate action and pass much \nnecessary legislation affecting the drought conditions in California \nand in the Western States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6082-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6082-H6083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DAVID C.

Mr. Speaker, throughout our lives here on Earth, God \nplaces in our path certain people who influence our lives, who help \nshape who we are, and who ultimately help us to understand our purpose.\n  A couple of years ago, I met someone whose optimism, faith, and valor \nin the face of difficulty has had a great influence on me, on my \nfamily, and on our entire community.\n  I met Mr. David Hyde in 2013, who at that time was a small business \nowner in Cartersville, Georgia. At that time, I was a relatively \nunknown candidate for Congress, who was promoting the idea that \nAmerica's days are still ahead of us if we define where we are going \nand aggressively set a course to get there. David quickly became a \nsupporter and a friend.\n  Although many had lost hope in restoring America's greatness, David \nwas a breath of fresh air. His patriotism was inspiring; his optimism \nwas infectious; and his energy invigorated me with a willingness to \nfight on.\n  David and I share a vision: to restore our struggling Nation to one \nthat is free, safe, and full of opportunity. We both believe that we \ncan turn the tide and give our grandchildren a nation better than the \none we inherited, but, of course, it will take a lot of hard work.\n  Within 2 weeks of our introduction, David was given the news that he \nhad esophageal cancer and that it was rapidly spreading. Now, after \nnearly 2 years of, quite literally, putting up the fight of his life, \nthe cancer is quickly taking David's life. The time my friend has left \nwith his wife and children is no longer measured in months or weeks, \nbut in days.\n  In realizing that any day could be David's last, I recently asked: \nDavid, if you had the ability to speak to the American people, what \nwould you say?\n  Mr. Speaker, in response to that question, David sent me the \nfollowing words of encouragement to give to the people of this great \nNation. David wrote:\n\n       I recently had the honor of going to lunch with a friend \n     just days before he shipped off to join the Navy.\n       As we sat enjoying our meal, I saw in the eyes of my friend \n     a young man who was proud to be given the opportunity to \n     serve his country.\n       The more we talked, the more he reminded me of another \n     young man who, 35 years earlier, had also left home and \n     family to join the Navy. The similarities between the two of \n     us were not lost on me, and it reminded me of all that \n     America held for a young man like me back then.\n       While my vision of sailing the high seas and protecting the \n     land of the free may have been somewhat jaded by the old \n     black and white movies I grew up watching, the dream of doing \n     something that really mattered was alive and real to me. \n     While America may have gotten off course, the goal of why we \n     served has never changed.\n       We have lost many of the freedoms we once held, but I \n     believe we are not so far from those days that, with hard \n     work, sacrifice, and turning our eyes back to God, they \n     cannot be restored.\n       My life is a living example of God's restoration powers.\n       It doesn't appear God will heal my sick body, but I know \n     that, in the land I am soon going to enter, I have already \n     been granted a new body--a perfect one--which I will have for \n     eternity. That, my friends, is restoration.\n       Just as He will restore me, I believe He can restore our \n     Nation to the greatness it once saw, but it will only be \n     possible if we turn our affections back to Him. The road to \n     restoration is not easy, as I can personally attest. It is \n     hard, painful, and discomforting. But when your eyes are upon \n     God, not your problems, the path is much easier to endure.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n       He has set out a clear plan with guidelines that aren't \n     hard to follow. As our Founders understood, we may have some \n     battles to overcome and a wilderness to cross, but we must \n     not be paralyzed by fear of the unknown, for it is ``In God \n     We Trust.''\n       When leading the Israelites from bondage, Moses had to lift \n     his rod over the Red Sea in complete trust before God parted \n     the waters for safe passage. He trusted God and forged on.\n       Although he faced insurmountable odds, the fear of the \n     unknown didn't stop Joshua from forging on.\n       During the darkest hours of the American Revolution at \n     Valley Forge, Washington didn't give up, but dug in and put \n     his faith in the providence of God.\n       Leaders who are willing to do what is difficult or even \n     what seems to be impossible are the ones who carry the team \n     forward.\n       We must honor God and know that his plans for us include \n     only one thing, His glory. If we are in it for Him, we win. \n     If we are in it for ourselves, we lose.\n       Just as my young friend went out to serve in the U.S. Navy \n     without a clearly defined path or step-by-step guidelines, \n     but fully relying on his authorities to lead him, we must \n     know that, if we are to return to our country's traditional \n     values, we need to study our history, find men and women \n     willing to adhere to those founding principles, and tighten \n     ourselves for a brighter future led by our intelligently \n     chosen authorities.\n       Who is your leader?\n       My best advice, as a man looking backwards with 20/20 \n     vision, is to decide now whom you will serve and proceed in a \n     manner worthy of your calling.\n       David C. Hyde, Jr.\n\n  Thank you, David, for these words of inspiration and hope. God bless \nyou, my friend, as you forge ahead in faith and trust in God almighty.\n\n[[Page H6083]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6083-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                              NO SHUTDOWN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Nolan) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, we have 6 \nlegislative days until the Government of the United States shuts down \nfor lack of funding.\n  Why? It is because the Republican leadership here in the House has \nfailed to bring forth critical appropriations bills to fund the \ngovernment. As a result of that, we are faced with the need to pass a \ncontinuing resolution to fund the government; yet we have leading \nMembers of the Congress here threatening to shut down the government \nrather than to put forth on the House of Representatives here a \nbipartisan bill for a continuing resolution to fund the government.\n  Instead, we have partisan after partisan after partisan legislative \nmeasures brought before the House here under closed rules that the \nleadership knows isn't going to go anywhere, but it is introduced for \nthe perceived notion of partisan gain.\n  The hard simple truth is that the American people want the Congress \nto put their partisanship aside and to go to work, start fixing things, \nfinding common ground, rebuilding the middle class, creating jobs, and \nrestoring the American Dream. They surely don't want another government \nshutdown that puts people's jobs, families, our government, and our \nnational security at risk.\n  Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, the Congress of the United \nStates needs to come to Washington and to go to work. If the Congress \ndoesn't do its job and get its work done, then Congress shouldn't get \npaid. The working men and women of America don't get paid when they \ndon't come to work, why should the Congress get paid?\n  That is why I have introduced the No Government No Pay Act to \nprohibit Members of Congress from getting paid during a shutdown of the \nCongress' own creation--because people in this country, they don't want \na shutdown.\n  They want to see the Congress go to work, find common ground, fix \nthings, get things done, rebuild America with a transportation bill, \nnot another kick-the-can-down-the-road, short-term fix. They want jobs \nwith good-paying benefits, not a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement \nthat sends their good-paying jobs overseas.\n  The American people want accessible health care for our veterans, as \nindeed they should be receiving, not a trip to ``kingdom come'' every \ntime a veteran needs some medical care.\n  The American people, they want to see protection from Social Security \nand for Medicare and the recognition these are not entitlements, that \nthese are benefits that people worked hard for and started paying for \nthe first day that they ever went to work. They surely don't want to \nsee those benefits turned over to Wall Street and to the big insurance \ncompanies.\n  Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, if the Congress doesn't go to \nwork, it shouldn't get paid.\n  More importantly, the Congress needs to go to work and bring these \nmeasures under open rules before the full House of Congress because \nthat is how you find common ground, that is how you get things done, \nthat is how you fix things in America.\n  The American people want it; they deserve it, and they have every \nright to expect it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6083-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PROTECTING LIFE BY DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Jenkins) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, like the majority of the \nAmerican people, I was disgusted and angered by the recent videos \nshowing Planned Parenthood officials apparently willing to sell the \ntissues and organs of aborted babies. That is right; I said ``babies,'' \nnot a glob of tissue as some would suggest.\n  I have always been unapologetically pro-life, and the mere thought of \nsuch horrific actions is beyond words. That is why I come to the floor \ntoday to urge my colleagues to support the Defund Planned Parenthood \nAct, which will cut all Federal funding for Planned Parenthood until \nthe House conducts a complete and full investigation into the \norganization's abortion practices.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation will reallocate Federal funds \ncurrently being used to fund Planned Parenthood's abortion services to \ncommunity health centers and other clinics that help provide \npreventative care to women without performing abortions.\n  Women's health is extremely important, and it is my belief that the \nfunding currently being used to fund Planned Parenthood's abortion \nagenda will be better used by helping our local clinics provide vital \nwomen's health services without promoting the malicious practice of \nabortion.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the majority of my constituents in the \nThird Congressional District of West Virginia want to see a culture of \nlife promoted in Washington, not a culture of barbarity and lack of \nrespect of life.\n  My constituents deserve to know that their taxpayer dollars are going \nto organizations that represent their values and beliefs, not to \norganizations that are determined to push their own agenda that goes \nagainst the will of the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the passage of Defund Planned \nParenthood Act of 2015 and to promote the sanctity of life and listen \nto the American people and my constituents when they say they have had \nenough of their hard-earned tax dollars being spent to promote Planned \nParenthood's pro-abortion agenda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6083-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6083-H6084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Veasey) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address a very important \nissue that continues to trouble the American people, and that is the \nRepublican obsession of denying a woman and families' access to certain \nhealthcare services like birth control.\n  Republicans' outdated views on family planning do nothing to empower \nwomen and nothing for families in their success in the 21st century. \nThe latest round in the Republicans' battle against women's access to \nhealth care is, yet again, an attempt to eliminate Federal funding for \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  This debate has been riddled with lies and deliberate misinformation \ndesigned to shock the American people, while needlessly demonizing one \nof the Nation's leading women's healthcare providers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think it is time that we talk about a few things and \nclear up some issues and talk about the facts in this. Since its \ninception, Planned Parenthood has empowered millions of women \nnationwide by providing affordable access to contraception. Cutting off \nfunding would cripple Planned Parenthood's ability to provide this \ncrucial service for our Nation's women.\n  The two primary sources of Federal funding for Planned Parenthood \ncome from two programs, Medicaid and Title X Family Planning. These \nprograms were created as a safety net to provide low-income individuals \nwith access to critical medical services that they would otherwise be \nforced to forego due to their high cost, such as birth control.\n  Together, these programs account for over 40 percent of Planned \nParenthood's operating budget. Stripping these dollars would severely \ndecrease Planned Parenthood's ability to provide care for 2.7 million \npeople that they serve every year.\n  Let me tell you what this means. This means millions of the Nation's \npoor women would not only be at risk of losing affordable contraceptive \nservices and counseling, but also their access to breast and cervical \ncancer screenings, as well as testing and treatment for STDs.\n  It is important to understand that, for those who are uninsured, this \nis the only way to get this lifesaving care. This would mean 400,000 \nfewer pap smears for women, 500,000 fewer breast exams, and 4.5 million \nfewer STD tests and treatments nationwide.\n  Let me be clear. It is not just Democrats' districts that will be \naffected. If you go outside of the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, these \nsmaller cities and suburban areas and rural areas, those are Republican \ndistricts; they\n\n[[Page H6084]]\n\nhave low-income women, and they will be cut off from this funding and \nthis treatment.\n  All this is at risk because of Republicans' objections to Planned \nParenthood providing safe and legal access to abortions. This is less \nthan 3 percent of what this organization does. In accordance with \nFederal law, no Federal funds go to cover abortion services.\n  Another faulty argument made by Republicans is that the Nation's \ncommunity healthcare centers could absorb the work that Planned \nParenthood currently does.\n  I love community health centers, and I appreciate the work that they \ndo because they really do serve the underserved, but the idea that \nthese facilities would be able to provide adequate services to nearly 3 \nmillion additional people who would suddenly be without care is simply \nunimaginable.\n  Community health centers rely on other sources for affordable care to \nalleviate the strains of residents' needs, sources like Planned \nParenthood. This is not imagined. I have seen it in the State of Texas.\n  I have visited community healthcare centers in the district that I \nserve, and they are very overwhelmed as a result of the void for \nhealthcare services purposely created by the Republican State \nlegislature. One of the things you always hear Republicans hollering \nabout is how much they want to save taxpayers money.\n  Let me tell you something. What happened in my State of Texas in \n2012, Governor Rick Perry and the Republican State legislature banned \nPlanned Parenthood from participating in the Medicaid Women's Health \nProgram, a joint initiative that saved Texas millions of dollars in \nMedicaid prenatal and delivery costs through the prevention of \nunplanned pregnancies.\n  Today, 30,000 fewer women are receiving that care, Medicaid claims \nare down by 26 percent, and Texas taxpayers are now paying the full \nprice to support the State's community health centers. Republicans \nwasted lots of money.\n  Where does that leave us today? I will tell you a lot of these \nantiabortion groups and their political allies have created this \npartisan debate by releasing a series of deceitfully edited \n``undercover'' videos casting Planned Parenthood in a negative light.\n  Let me tell you that these videos are a sham; they are lies, and they \ndo absolutely nothing to help increase access to the critical services \nthat Planned Parenthood provides for women.\n  Documents and testimony submitted to the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee during a wasteful and unnecessary investigation show that \nabsolutely no evidence exists to substantiate claims that Planned \nParenthood violated the law in any way. In fact, their fetal tissue \ndonation program is not only compliant with Federal law, but goes well \nbeyond the law's requirements.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to cease their fruitless \nfight against birth control--because we know that this is really what \nthis is all about--and Planned Parenthood and women's health and get to \nthe job of governing.\n  We all want women to have access to the health care they need to stay \nhealthy for their family because, let me tell you, in my family and in \nfamilies around the country, that if mom is not healthy, the rest of \nthe family is not healthy.\n  That is why I choose to put people before politics and stand with \nwomen, families, and all the people of Texas and America in my support \nof Planned Parenthood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6084-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1045\n                       OUR STRATEGY AGAINST ISIS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Jolly) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago this month, the President of the \nUnited States addressed the Nation proposing his strategy for a war \nagainst ISIS. He struggled with what the mission was. Were we as a \nnation engaging to degrade ISIS, to defeat ISIS, to destroy ISIS? And \nthen the question arose in this body, at what level do we engage? Do we \nconsider an Authorization for Use of Military Force, something that is \nproper under our constitutional authority?\n  Yet 1 year later, we have not considered an Authorization for Use of \nMilitary Force. We have not had the debate over what is the role of \nthis body and our current foreign policy and our current national \nsecurity strategy against ISIS. The only portion that we were willing \nto touch was the request to arm and train Syrian rebels; and this body, \nI believe wrongfully, authorized and appropriated half a billion \ndollars--$500 million--to train Syrian rebels. Yesterday, we heard from \nthe top commander of our forces in the Middle East that there are \neither four or five individuals engaged as Syrian rebels confronting \nISIS--$500 million, five people.\n  The President's strategy against ISIS has failed. ISIS continues to \ngrow geographically, continues to be enriched. Russia's hand is \nstrengthened. Iran has increasing leverage every single day. Mr. \nSpeaker, the architects of terror today are emboldened. But they are \nemboldened not only by the failure of this administration's policy; \nthey are emboldened by the failure of this Congress to do our job.\n  Where are we in this debate? Where is this Congress on whether or not \nwe are going to consider an Authorization for Use of Military Force? \nWhere are we today on the $500 million that has now trained five \npeople? Do we stand behind that decision as a body? I hope we do not.\n  The bigger question we have to ask, and it is a hard question: Are we \na nation at war today with ISIS or are we not? If we are, are we \nwilling as a nation to accept the human and economic consequences that \ncome with conflict?\n  The frustration you hear in my voice is the frustration we hear in \nthe voices of the American people across the Nation every single day. \nIt is a frustration about what this body does not do. We should be \nhaving a debate over the Authorization for Use of Military Force. I \ndon't know how that debate turns out.\n  Nobody wants to go into conflict. We don't get to choose the threats \nthat come our way. We only choose our response, and 1 year later we \nhave no response. All this is through the lens of an agenda that we \ncontinue to fail to do.\n  Let's give voice to the American people on issues like border \nsecurity and immigration reform, on transportation, on a budget that \nfinally balances. The frustration is not that we haven't achieved these \nthings; it is that we haven't even engaged in a legislative fight to \nbegin to advance the agenda that is right for the American people.\n  We are elected to be custodians of the public trust, and we fail that \npublic trust every day we fail to consider the issues that are of most \nsignificance to the American people, to honor the constitutional \nresponsibility we have under article I. We have spent the last 2 years \ncloaking ourselves in the article I authority of the Congress every \ntime the President overreaches, and we have rightfully done so; but \njust as we cloak ourselves in the article I authority, we have to \nrecognize article I brings responsibility.\n  We have failed to honor the responsibility that we have under article \nI. We have an obligation to have a very hard debate about whether or \nnot we are a nation at war with ISIS and whether or not we are doing \nanything in the face of the President's failed policy to actually \nconfront the audible threat of terror of a regime that wishes to bring \nharm and destroy the United States of America. This body has failed to \nengage in that debate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask with the utmost conviction of this Member but, \nfrankly, the people who give me the honor to represent them in this \nHouse. Let's give voice to the American people. Let's give voice to the \npeople that we represent here in this body, and let's finally have that \ndebate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6084-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6084-H6085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WE CANNOT STAND IDLY BY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to denounce the unjust \nsentence of almost 14 years that was handed to human rights activist \nLeopoldo Lopez in Venezuela. Leopoldo is pictured here in this poster \nwith his slogan, which says, ``Wanting a better\n\n[[Page H6085]]\n\nVenezuela is not a crime.'' Liberate Leopoldo.\n  Sentenced along with Leopoldo as human rights activists were Cristian \nHoldack, Angel Gonzalez, and Demian Martin, three students whose charge \nsheets include public instigation, damages to property, and arson--all \nfalse charges. Their crimes were nothing more than standing up to the \nregime--the corrupt, illegitimate regime--of Nicolas Maduro in \nVenezuela and demanding a better country that would have respect for \nhuman rights, that would have freedom of the press, and that would have \nfree and fair elections and other universally recognized rights.\n  As this says, demanding a better Venezuela is not a crime, except it \nis in Venezuela. Democracy advocates are harassed; they are abused; \nthey are imprisoned; they are beaten; and some are even killed--yes, \nkilled. We cannot stand idly by while democracy and due process are \ntrampled on in our own hemisphere.\n  Democracies like Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Chile should join the \nU.S. in advocating for democracy and stability for Venezuela, and \nfreedom for the many political prisoners who are languishing in \nMaduro's gulags. I urge the Obama administration to immediately \nsanction the judge, prosecutors, and those who led this politically \nmotivated kangaroo court against Leopoldo Lopez, against these \nstudents, and against so many.\n  The President can use the power granted to the executive branch when \nwe passed here in the U.S. House of Representatives and in the United \nStates Senate the Venezuelan sanctions legislation last year. The \nPresident must act. Mr. Speaker, let's hope that he does.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to denounce so many human rights violations that \nare occurring throughout the hemisphere, whether it is in Venezuela or \nmy native homeland of Cuba. As the Pope prepares for his historic trip \nto Cuba this weekend, he should meet with those people, like the \npolitical prisoners who share common interests of peace and justice \nwith the Catholic Church. The church stands for liberty; it defends the \nfreedoms of oppressed people, the freedoms to pursue one's goals and \ndreams without having to live in fear.\n  The Castro regime stands for the complete opposite. It stands for \noppression, for violence, for hatred, for injustice, and I would urge \nHis Holiness to meet with those who truly defend the values for which \nthe church stands; people like this young man, a graffiti artist, a \nyoung man who has only known Communist Cuba as his government. His name \nis El Sexto. It means the sixth one, in reference to some other \ncharges.\n  El Sexto has been behind bars for nearly 9 months. He has been on a \nhunger strike to protest the brutal Castro regime. What did he do? This \nis what he did. He had a picture of two farm animals, and he put the \nnames of Fidel and Raul on them. For that, he has been imprisoned with \nno contact with the outside world.\n  In January, another young man, a Cuban rapper named El Dkano, was \nsentenced to a year in prison just because he used music to criticize \nthe Castro regime, a regime which has not unclenched its fist against \nthe Cuban people.\n  Yesterday, pro-democracy leader Jorge Luis Garcia Perez, also known \nas Antunez, and 10 of his activists of the organization National Civic \nResistance Front announced that they have begun a fast in an attempt to \nget a meeting with His Holiness to raise the plight of the suffering \nCuban people.\n  These are just a few of the prisoners, Mr. Speaker, who have received \nharsh sentences after President Obama signed and announced this ill-\nfated deal with the Castro regime on December 17.\n  Reports indicate that the Castro regime is planning on releasing more \nthan 3,000 prisoners in advance of the Pope's visit to Cuba, and you \nwill think, hey, that sounds like a good idea, but let's remember this: \nMany of those prisoners should have never been in jail in the first \nplace. By the way, political prisoners like El Sexto, for doing an \nartwork, will not be included in that number. No political prisoners \nwill be freed, but that is not anything new, Mr. Speaker.\n  In 1978, Fidel Castro released almost 3,800 political prisoners ahead \nof Jimmy Carter's visit; in 1998, Fidel Castro released 300 prisoners \nahead of Pope John Paul's visit; in the year 2011, Raul Castro released \nnearly 3,100 ahead of Pope Benedict's visit; yet the Castro regime has \ndetained an unprecedented number of Cubans this year. With all of these \npeople being freed, this year, there has been an unprecedented number \nof arrests in Cuba of political activists.\n  We can be sure that before the Pope's visit, during the Pope's visit, \nand after the Pope's visit, more innocent Cubans will be detained--like \nEl Sexto--by the regime and thrown into Castro's gulags. This tactic is \nnothing new, and it is not indicative of a change of policy by the \nevil, despotic, sadistic Castro regime. It is just a political \npropaganda farce.\n  Will the Pope see this cynical move for what it is? We shall soon \nsee, Mr. Speaker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6085-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6085-H6086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 INVESTIGATIONS INTO PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I am here this morning to speak about \nthe investigations into Planned Parenthood and to the sale of fetal \ntissues. We are beginning this process in our Committee on Energy and \nCommerce; and we are approaching this in a thoughtful manner, beginning \nthese investigations as we look at life rights and focus on the lives \nof these unborn children and the mothers who have gone through this \nprocess.\n  It is so interesting to me, as we have this discussion of fetal \ntissue sales and what all has transpired in the selling of these \ntissues, that we look to science. What science has shown us is that \nthese are not blobs of tissue; these are babies.\n  This weekend, I had the opportunity to go to a baby shower, and a \nvery excited grandmother showed me the sonogram, the picture of her \nunborn granddaughter already named and being celebrated. As we looked \nat it, we could distinguish these features of this child yet unborn, \nbut this child fully formed and developing and sleeping in her mother's \nwomb.\n  There was great excitement to celebrate this arrival, and we know \nthat this is a fight worth having and a process worth ending as we look \nat the selling of these fetal organs and what has transpired.\n  Now, everyone is familiar with what happened with Kermit Gosnell in \nhis house of horrors, and we know there was a conviction, but what we \nhave learned is those convictions are very rare. We have moved now to \nthe video footage that The Center for Medical Progress released, and we \nsee that this is absolutely sickening, abhorrent.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  These videos have raised a lot of suspicion about what has transpired \nin these Planned Parenthood affiliates and clinics and questions as to \nwhether they have systematically and repeatedly broken laws.\n  Obtaining informed consent for fetal tissue donation, how was that \napproached? Killing infants born alive after an attempted induced \nabortion, who are the persons entitled to legal protection here?\n  As you look at a botched abortion and you have a child born alive, \nall of a sudden you have got two patients there that you are \nconsidering.\n  Dr. Deborah Nucatola, Senior Director of Medical Services for Planned \nParenthood Federation of America, describes harvesting human tissues. \nIn one of the videos, she talks about crushing this part or the other \npart of the baby in order to get a good specimen.\n  To listen to her callous description and her casual manner is \nsickening, but it also may violate some of the Federal laws which \nprohibit alteration of abortion procedures to obtain fetal tissue.\n  In another video, a technician says:\n\n       I'm sitting here and I'm looking at this fetus, and its \n     heart is beating, and I don't know what to think. I don't \n     know if that constitutes it's technically dead or it's alive.\n\n  Imagine that. This baby, if it had arrived in a hospital with a NICU \nand doctors surrounding it, there would\n\n[[Page H6086]]\n\nhave been a rush to make certain that life was saved.\n  And God bless those NICU specialists who work with these preemie \nbabies. We have all spent time with them and are grateful that they are \nthere.\n  The cheap veneer of the left, the defense of abortion as a matter of \nreproductive choice, is wearing thin. Reproductive rights?\n  As I said, let's talk about life rights. Let's discuss life rights. \nIt is Constitution Day, the right to life, liberty, pursuit of \nhappiness.\n  We have got several bills that our Members are bringing forward, \nwhich I will submit for the Record, along, Mr. Speaker, with those \nDemocrats that voted for the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002, \nwhich was passed in this House by a voice vote.\n\n                        Planned Parenthood Bills\n\n\n      H.R. 3134, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 (Black)\n\n       Bill would impose a one-year moratorium on all federal \n     funding to Planned Parenthood or any of its affiliates while \n     investigations are conducted unless they certify they will \n     not perform abortions or provide funds to other entities that \n     perform abortions.\n       Restriction does not apply in cases of rape, incest or \n     woman's health concerns.\n\n\n  H.R. 3429, the Prohibiting the Life-Ending Industry of Fetal Organ \n                Exchange Act or the Pro-LIFE Act (Yoder)\n\n       This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit \n     the transfer of fetal tissue in exchange for valuable \n     consideration, including payments associated with the \n     transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, \n     quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue.\n\n\n      H.R. 3494, the Protecting Infants Born Alive Act (Blackburn)\n\n       Draft legislation I have authored to strengthen and improve \n     the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002.\n       The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 became law on \n     August 5, 2002 and requires that any reference to person, \n     human being, child or individual include every infant born \n     alive.\n       * Both Ellmers and Blackburn bills will ban any provider \n     proven of violating either of these existing laws from \n     participating in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP and will allow \n     states that suspect any violation of these existing laws to \n     ban those suspected from the state's Medicaid program.*\n\n\n      H.R. 3495, the Women's Public Health and Safety Act (Duffy)\n\n       The bill amends the Medicaid law to allow states the \n     flexibility and discretion to be able to exclude abortion \n     providers like Planned Parenthood from Medicaid. States that \n     have tried to defund Planned Parenthood have been blocked by \n     the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n     assertion that states must fund Planned Parenthood under what \n     is known as the ``free choice of qualified provider'' \n     provision in Medicaid. Since the release of the undercover \n     videos by Center for Medical Progress three states \n     (Louisiana, Alabama and Arkansas) have sought to terminate \n     Planned Parenthood's Medicaid contracts and are now embroiled \n     in lawsuits.\n\n\n  H.R. 3504, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act (Franks)\n\n       Bill mandates that infants born alive during abortions are \n     legal persons entitled to all the rights and protections \n     allowed to other legal persons, including needed medical care \n     and attention. This legislation requires the same care for a \n     child born alive during an abortion as a naturally premature \n     baby born in a hospital. Any violation to this rule is a \n     federal offense and must immediately be reported to law \n     enforcement.\n       The bill also provides for criminal penalties for providers \n     who fail to provide care to baby.\n\n\n H.R. XX, the Protect Infants from Partial-birth Abortion Act (Ellmers)\n\n       Legislation will bolster the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act \n     of 2003.\n       The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 amends the \n     Federal Criminal code to ban partial-birth abortions except \n     in the interest of the life of the mother\n\n\n            H.R. 3515, Smith Dismemberment Abortion Ban Act\n\n       The Born Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-\n     207) passed the House by voice vote and the Senate by UC. The \n     following is a list of Democrats who were serving when these \n     votes took place.\n\n\n                          Democratic Senators\n\n       Tammy Baldwin *, Barbara Boxer, Sherrod Brown *, Benjamin \n     L.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate \nNational Citizenship Day.\n  America would not be the great country that it is without its \nimmigrants. One of our greatest strengths is our Nation's diversity--\nthe ability of this country to absorb and integrate the most \nentrepreneurial minds that this world has to offer and to make them our \nown. In fact, immigrants or their children have founded more than 40 \npercent of Fortune 500 companies.\n  However, there is a dangerous anti-immigrant sentiment perpetuated by \nthose who fail to recognize the strength derived from our diversity. \nEven today, laws are being proposed to deny the constitutional right of \ncitizenship to those born in America. Proposals like these are both \nappalling and un-American.\n  In Congress, we must continue to fight against these anti-immigrant \nproposals and to push for comprehensive immigration reform, and we must \nwork to ensure that every person who is eligible for naturalization \nunderstands the process that it takes to become a U.S. citizen and has \na voice in our great democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6087-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING JEFF HERRALA\n\n  (Mr. EMMER of Minnesota asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota.

Mr. Speaker, thousands of Americans are on Capitol Hill \ntoday to attend the Rally for Medical Research and to demand increased \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health.\n  The NIH supports 400,000 American jobs. In fact, 82 percent of its \nbudget supports research conducted in every State in this Nation, and \nevery dollar of NIH funding generates $2.21 in local economic activity.\n  The effects are, obviously, not only economic. Thanks in large part \nto the National Institutes of Health, deaths from heart disease are \ndown 50 percent over the last 40 years, deaths from cancer are down 20 \npercent since 1991, and the cure rate for childhood cancer is now 80 \npercent.\n  From 1997 to 2003, Congress doubled funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health, but, since then, it has fallen by 25 percent when \naccounting for inflation.\n  Just yesterday, the National Cancer Institute released a report that \nidentifies research that won't be conducted unless Congress restores \nits purchasing power with sustained annual funding increases over the \nnext decade. We must not let that happen.\n  I urge this House to give the NIH the resources it needs to conduct \nthe work our Nation deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6087-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SERVING OUR SAVIOR\n\n  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. FOXX.

All the work is \nperformed by volunteers, who build 70 to 80 ramps each year.\n  Since the organization's inception, more than 700 ramps have been \nbuilt. Serving our Savior does not charge for their ramps. Instead, the \norganization allows the recipients to pay what they can, and if they \nare unable to pay, funds are provided by Serving our Savior.\n  This ministry is a wonderful example of the difference a small group \nof people can make in its local community, and I applaud their selfless \nwork on behalf of those who need a helping hand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6087-7", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6087-H6088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CONFECTIONERS\n\n  (Ms. SPEIER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, there is an old saying that says you can \ncatch a lot more bees with honey than with vinegar. It turns out that \nthat is true in business, too.\n  The confectioners industry employs a whopping 55,000 busy worker bees \nin the United States--that is 55,000 people who are working directly in \nthe confectionery industry--and indirectly supports another 400,000 \njobs in other industries from retail to trucking.\n  Every confectionery job created in the United States supports another \nseven; but Congress continues to maintain an unbelievably wrongheaded \npolicy that is destroying these jobs.\n\n[[Page H6088]]\n\n  The Department of Commerce found that protectionist provisions in the \n2008 farm bill destroyed three jobs for every job they saved.

Madam Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to a Billings \nresident, a World War II veteran, and a fabled member of the Army 10th \nMountain Division K Company, Chuck Hauptman.\n  Seventy years ago, the young lieutenant was crawling on his belly up \nMount Belvedere under the cover of darkness. The K Company was charged \nwith leading the allied assault on the Germans through the minefields--\nset up along the steepest peak--and driving the Germans out of Italy.\n  On one February night, they battled snow, darkness, vertical climbs, \nfreezing temperatures, and booby traps, all while under the heavy \nmachine gun fire of the Nazis.\n  The K Company was in combat for 110 days against Nazi forces in the \nItalian Alps. During this time, Lieutenant Hauptman was shot and \nwounded in battle while assaulting a machine gun nest. Like many young \nmen, he went back to battle.\n  It is easy to forget the young men who were sent to the battle in \nWorld War II. We look at our veterans and the aging today of our World \nWar II veterans.\n  Remember, as our young men go to battle, that our Nation asks our \nyoungest men and women to go to battle and fight for this country, and \nwe should never forget the sacrifice.\n  When we go to war, we send our Nation's best. I am proud to recognize \nChuck Hauptman as one of our Nation's best. He represents the best of \nMontana, the best of our country, and the best of our youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6088-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                5,000 ROLE MODELS OF EXCELLENCE PROJECT\n\n  (Ms. WILSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, almost a half century ago, \nwhile serving as an elementary school principal in Miami, I sensed a \nvoid in the lives of the boys who were always being sent to my office \nbecause of disruptive behavior.\n  The one thing they all had in common was the lack of an adult male to \nlove them and guide them along life's often tricky paths. I founded the \n5,000 Role Models of Excellence Project to rescue these boys of color \nfrom futures fueled by drugs, poverty, or prison.\n  The 5,000 Role Models of Excellence is recognized by President \nObama's My Brother's Keeper initiative. It is an in-school program in \nFlorida's public schools. These boys have earned more than $10 million \nin college scholarships, and so many have returned and now serve as \nrole models to the 10,000 boys now in the program.\n  There are 109 chapters in Miami-Dade County schools, the fourth \nlargest school district in the Nation, 30 chapters in Pinellas County/\nSt. Petersburg schools, and 10 chapters in Duvall County, Jacksonville, \nFlorida.\n  Please welcome the Miami Northwestern Senior High School chapter who \nare up in the gallery today.

His vision and foresight allowed him to take advantage \nof new technologies, giving high priority to innovative and cost-\neffective methods to better serve members.\n  Don has created programs to help alleviate or minimize outage \nshortage during extreme weather and other natural disasters. In \naddition, Don helped to build a robust network of fiber optic services \nto assist the rural membership in staying up to date with an \nincreasingly connected world.\n  Don has been an active and effective spokesman here at Capitol Hill \nand back in the Missouri State House.

Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of long-suffering \nairline passengers. All of us know that air travel is becoming more and \nmore uncomfortable.\n  At a time when airlines treat passengers so poorly, subjecting us to \ndecreased legroom, cramped planes, more\n\n[[Page H6089]]\n\nseats in each row, charging extra fees for luggage or snacks, and many \nother inconveniences, many people are understandably upset that a CEO \nof a major airline will receive a golden parachute with up to $20 \nmillion in compensation and free first-class airline tickets for life.\n  The airline industry is expected to double its profits this year as \ncompared to last year, and even though the fuel prices have dropped 50 \npercent, ticket prices have barely budged, but what has changed is \nsmaller seats and less legroom.\n  Since 9/11, the traveling public has complied graciously and \npatiently with all the new regulations, but once they board the \nairplane, they are squeezed at every side.\n  I will soon be introducing legislation that improves the flying \nexperience for the flying public.

Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to express great concern about \nthe Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. This is a rule that is going \nto have a substantial impact on lower-income and middle-income savers, \nthe men and women and the families that we want to get good advice from \nadvisers so they can save and plan for their retirement. This rule is \ngoing to make it harder for American families to save for that eventual \nday of retirement.\n  For decades, my constituents in Wisconsin have been served by well-\nregulated financial institutions, and they include the mutually owned \ncooperatives and the fraternal membership organizations. These \norganizations only do well if they serve their customers and their \nclients well, and if they don't serve them, the clients walk down the \nstreet, and they go somewhere else.\n  This Department of Labor fiduciary rule is going to take the advice \naway from folks who need the most advice when they are saving. It is an \nidea that Washington knows best and that people with full disclosure \ncan't make the right decisions for their families.\n  This rule is a disaster, and my concern is less people are going to \nsave, which means more people are going to be reliant on the Federal \nGovernment. That is a wrong approach. Let's not let this rule go \nthrough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6089-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n  (Mr. BERA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, in 6 legislative days, our government will \nshut down. This is a bad idea.\n  Last time the government shut down, our economy lost more than $20 \nbillion, $4 billion in tax refunds were delayed, 20,000 veterans \ndisability claims per week were delayed, and $140 million in small \nbusiness loan applications were not processed. If you look at the \nanalysis, over those 2 weeks, 120,000 fewer jobs were created. This is \na bad idea.\n  In Sacramento County, my home community, thousands of employees of \nthe VA, Department of the Interior, and other agencies were threatened. \nThis hurts American families.\n  It doesn't have to be this way, Mr. Speaker. We could come together, \nput together a budget, keep the government open, and get people back to \nwork. That is what we are sent here to do.\n  Let's work together, Democrats and Republicans.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my \ncolleague Mr. Dent to thank and honor a Berks County innovator for his \nleadership and dedication to the community.\n  Mr. Speaker, DeLight Breidegam, Jr., passed away last week at the age \nof 88. He was cofounder and chairman emeritus of East Penn \nManufacturing. Under his leadership, East Penn grew to be Berks \nCounty's second largest employer.\n  The company is nothing short of an American success story. East Penn \nbegan as a dream of the Breidegam family following World War II. \nDeLight frequently cited the shortage of batteries during the war as \nthe spark to start the business. Along with his father, they soon \nstarted their battery business in a small, one-room creamery. Since \nthen, the Breidegam family has been committed to producing batteries.\n  I had the good fortune to meet with DeLight about a month ago.

Our Federal labs funding Federal research, \nfunding for our universities, our national parks.\n  When you hear about something like our national parks closing, many \npeople think, okay, maybe it means I delay our vacation. What does it \nmean to the thousands of people who live in Estes Park and our \ncommunities in Grand County, supported almost entirely by Rocky \nMountain National Park, which millions of Americans enjoy every year? \nIf they curtail their season by several weeks, they can't afford the \nrent for their store and can't afford to put their kids through \ncollege.\n  I also want to draw attention to the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. After 50 years as one of our country's most successful recreation \nand conservation programs, funding needs to be reauthorized by \nSeptember 30 or it could be lost forever.\n  There are so many things we could be discussing with only 14 days \nuntil a government shutdown.

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on \nRules, I call up House Resolution 420 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 420\n\n       Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this \n     resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule \n     XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the \n     Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of \n     the bill (H.R. 348) to provide for improved coordination of \n     agency actions in the preparation and adoption of \n     environmental documents for permitting determinations, and \n     for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill \n     shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. \n     It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the \n     purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule an amendment \n     in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules \n     Committee Print 114-26. That amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute shall be considered as read. All points of order \n     against that amendment in the nature of a substitute are \n     waived. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute shall be in order except those printed in the \n     report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this \n     resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the \n     order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member \n     designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall \n     be debatable for the time specified in the report equally \n     divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, \n     shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject \n     to a demand for division of the question in the House or in \n     the Committee of the Whole.

At the conclusion of consideration of \n     the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report \n     the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been \n     adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House \n     on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the \n     bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made \n     in order as original text. The previous question shall be \n     considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to \n     final passage without intervening motion except one motion to \n     recommit with or without instructions.\n       Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in \n     order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 758) to amend \n     Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to improve \n     attorney accountability, and for other purposes. All points \n     of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The \n     bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against \n     provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question \n     shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any \n     amendment\n\n[[Page H6091]]\n\n     thereto to final passage without intervening motion except: \n     (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the \n     chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recommit.\n       Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time on the \n     legislative day of September 24, 2015, for the Speaker to \n     entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though \n     under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or his designee shall \n     consult with the Minority Leader or her designee on the \n     designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this \n     section.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for \n1 hour.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, \nI yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. \nPolis), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include extraneous materials on House Resolution 420 currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, where are the jobs? The question \nresonates throughout our Nation. It is the driving force behind every \nsolution the Republican majority has offered to this body and every \nsolution this administration has rejected.\n  I am pleased to bring forward this rule on behalf of the Committee on \nRules. This rule provides for consideration of H.R. 348, the RAPID Act, \nand H.R. 758, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2015.\n  The Committee on Rules met on this measure yesterday evening and \nheard testimony from a Republican member of the Committee on the \nJudiciary and two Democratic members of the Committee on the Judiciary. \nThe Committee on Rules solicited amendments for both these measures, \nbut no amendments were submitted for the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, \nmaking the rule closed. There were 11 amendments submitted for the \nRAPID Act by both Republican and Democratic Members. This rule makes 10 \nof those in order. Let me repeat that: 11 amendments submitted, and 10 \nof those amendments are on the floor. Both the RAPID Act and the \nLawsuit Abuse Reduction Act went through regular order in the Committee \non the Judiciary, including robust amendment debate.\n  This rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and \ncontrolled by the chair and the ranking member of the Committee on the \nJudiciary for each piece of legislation.\n  I appreciate the hard work of the Committee on the Judiciary \nchairman, Mr. Bob Goodlatte, and his full committee and subcommittee \nstaffs in bringing forward these key reforms. It would take more than \n60 minutes to list all the ways Republicans have worked to encourage \neconomic growth and create jobs in the 114th Congress. We have worked \ntirelessly to pass litigation reforms that would promote access to \ncourt and ensure the cost of litigation isn't being used to force \nsettlements.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of the RAPID Act because men and women across \nthe Nation are ready to go back to work. Republicans are committed to \ngiving job creators the confidence to take projects off the drawing \nboard and onto the worksite.\n  A 2012 U.S. Chamber of Commerce study of proposed projects in just \none sector of the economy, the energy sector, found that if a modest \nnumber of these projects were allowed to move forward and begin \nconstruction, the direct and indirect economic benefits would be \ntremendous--hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars \nannually.\n  Hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars are in the \npipeline, and Republicans believe we should streamline the approval \nprocess so that these projects are either approved or denied, not left \nlanguishing year after year after year.\n  Americans need jobs now. They have bills to pay and families to feed. \nThe RAPID Act is one of a number of solutions offered by House \nRepublicans that would break down unnecessary Federal barriers and \nallow employers to break ground on the projects that offer Americans \njobs and economic growth.\n  The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, NEPA, was designed for \nan important purpose, one that should be preserved. The Committee on \nthe Judiciary has done important work exploring the original goals of \nNEPA and hearing from experts in the field and academic scholars. The \nfacts are clear: The NEPA process we have today is far removed from \nwhat the authors intended. It is normal for the review process to take \nyears and years, and in some cases over a decade. Imagine how the world \nhas changed in the past 10 years. It is absolutely mind-boggling that a \nreview process for any project would take a decade.\n  We live in a world where technology has made the impossible possible. \nThere is no excuse for relying on old methods or overly complex \nregulatory frameworks. It is time for Federal regulators to stop tying \nup capital and prioritizing endless paper pushing over job creation.\n  We can do better as a nation. Our economy and our families depend on \nus doing better.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for \nyielding the customary 30 minutes.\n  I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 348, the RAPID Act, is an attempt to limit \nflexibility and eliminate the public's role in environmental review and \ndecisionmaking processes. H.R. 758 would force judges to impose \nsanctions against any claim that appears to lack support or involve a \nnovel legal theory.\n  These are no doubt important issues to debate and discuss, and we \nwill have that time on the floor, but I want to address what this body \nis failing to address. Though the subject matter of these two bills \ncouldn't be different, neither one of them relates to the fact that we \nare 6 legislative days before a job-killing, money-wasting shutdown of \ngovernment.\n  Now, when we hear 6 legislative days, let me translate that for \nnormal days that Americans have. That is actually 14 days. We are 14 \ndays until we risk the government shutting down. Of the next 14 days, \nCongress is only scheduled to work 6. Now, by the way, we should thank \nPope Francis for that, because before Pope Francis scheduled his visit, \nCongress was scheduled to work 4 of the next 14 days.\n  Now, if everything were going wonderfully and this body was a model \nof keeping the government open and fulfilling its responsibilities, I \nthink the American people would say: ``Well, guess what, Congress. You \ndeserve a vacation.'' But that is not what I hear from my constituents. \nThey are not saying that we should be on vacation 8 out of the next 14 \ndays when we are facing a government shutdown.\n  Not only are we facing a government shutdown now, but we are 76 days \nafter the expiration of the Export-Import Bank, which already has lost \nat least 500 jobs here in our country. We are 41 days until authorizing \nlegislation to maintain our Federal highway systems expire. We have \nalready passed that deadline twice and done short-term extensions.\n  In my August townhall meetings--and I had a number of them across the \ndistrict--I do not recall any of my constituents telling me their \nfamily's top concerns are we start eliminating environmental reviews \nand public health standards.\n  While we are wasting unconscionable time on issues when we are only 6 \nlegislative days or 14 real days from a shutdown, we wonder why this \nbody is losing popularity every day among the American public and will \ncontinue to.\n  To my friends across the aisle, I want to work with you. My \nDemocratic colleagues want to work with you. We want to work to avoid a \ngovernment shutdown. We want to work with you to reauthorize the \nFederal highway bill.\n  These are not Democratic or Republican principles. Both parties \nbelieve in a Federal Government; both parties believe in highways and \ninvestment in infrastructure. So let's do that. I think we should do \nthat all 14 days, or at\n\n[[Page H6092]]\n\nleast 12 of the next 14 days rather than 6, but at least let's get to \nwork and do it.\n  I think we share many of the same domestic and foreign policy \ninterests, and hopefully we can agree upon our priorities. The average \nAmerican family in my district and across our country has no interest \nin grandstanding on display. They have no desire to send their hard-\nearned dollars in taxes to a body that continues to govern crisis by \ncrisis, sometimes after the fact.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  So I implore my colleagues to use the next 14 days--or, if they want \nto take 8 of them off, 6 days--to consider the threat we are facing and \nthe hardship a shutdown would cause in districts like mine that rely on \ntwo major universities to receive Federal funding; Federal labs; \nnational parks that support countless local businesses that would close \nif the Federal Government is closed; the Centers for Disease Control, \nwith a strong presence in Fort Collins; and the many other secondary \nand tertiary effects that a Federal shutdown would have.\n  Let's find a way to avert it. There is still time. Let's not wait \nuntil it is 2 days or 1 day or zero days or negative 1 day or just \nhours remaining on the countdown clock. Let's pass a bipartisan bill to \nfund government. Let's reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. Let's make a \nlong-term commitment to our Federal highway system and infrastructure \nto keep our economy growing.\n  After we fulfill these basic needs, these self-created crises that \nCongress is presented, then let's have a discussion about limitation of \nirregular lawsuits or eradication of environmental reviews on public \nprojects. We can have our disagreements. We can debate them. But let's \nget our priorities right.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, we just got back after spending time in our districts, \nand I know, in my case, one of the reasons that we are back today \ndealing with regulatory issues is just a couple of examples that just \ncontinue to come up in conversations.\n  There were always questions about, frankly, what are we doing in \nWashington, what are we not doing in Washington, but there was a common \ntheme when I went to small business, factories, and when we do \nroundtables. The common theme was: Why is Washington constantly keeping \nme from doing what I can do or need to do in my business? Why are we \ncontinuing to get regulation after regulation after regulation that \nkeep us from expanding our business?\n  I had a businessowner tell us in a roundtable that right now there \nwere several businesses he knew that would be willing to hire upwards \nof 20, 30, 40 folks, but right now they are bound by the caps that they \nfind under the healthcare law. They don't want to go over a certain \nnumber--that magic 49. They don't want to get involved in other areas \nthat are keeping them constricted to this point.\n  So when we look at these packages of bills that we are looking at, \nfrankly, we are looking at everyday moms and dads; we are looking at \nbusinessowners; we are looking at the folks who are the economic \nengines of the United States; and we are saying the government should \nnot be the inhibitor of your company. The government should not be the \npart that is stopping you from creating jobs, from getting that next \nbig idea, from having that next product that hits the market that takes \nus to that different level or hiring that next person who has that \nspark, that creative energy to say: ``Here's the next idea that changes \neven how we are here today.''\n  So when we deal with this and we look at it, the question really is: \nWhat drives jobs? The House majority, the Republican majority, \nconstantly has looked at what it means to be an entrepreneur and to \nhave people that you employ. What does it mean? It means giving someone \na chance.\n  This summer, I had the awesome fun or joy, if you will, of watching \nmy son get his first job. He started to work at a grocery store, and I \ncan remember at first he was all excited. He went through all the \nprocess and he got that job. The best day was when he actually came \nhome after working and he was tired, but yet it was payday. He came in \nand he looked at me and he said: ``Dad, I got my paycheck.''\n  And for a moment, regardless of how much that check was--this is not \na story about seeing taxes for the first time; my son has lived in my \nhouse and he understands the burden of taxes, so it was not any of \nthat--it was just the joy in his eyes that someone had given him a job \nand that he went to work. It was that pride of having money that he \ncould spend. There is a new person in the economic engine.\n  That is why we continue to bring these bills forward, so that \ngovernment can be out of the way and be its proper role, not the \nroadblock to job creation. When we do that, then the people of the \nUnited States can look at this House Republican majority and know our \nbest interests are with those who get up every day looking to make life \njust a little bit better.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will \noffer an amendment to the rule to bring up legislation to reauthorize \nthe Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters), the ranking member of \nthe Financial Services Committee.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I first would like to \nthank the gentleman from Colorado for the time to speak on this \nimportant issue.\n  I rise today in opposition to the previous question in order to give \nHouse Members an opportunity to vote on reauthorizing the charter of \nthe Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is well past time to end the ideologically driven \nshutdown of the Export-Import Bank that has prohibited this critical \nagency from continuing to support United States businesses and their \nworkers.\n  For almost 2 years, Democrats have been sounding the alarm that a \nshutdown of the Ex-Im Bank would be devastating for American businesses \nand their workers. Since Republicans in Congress let the Bank's charter \nexpire in June, companies around the country have been preparing to lay \noff employees, and many have stopped expansion plans because they now \nlack the critical financing tools that Ex-Im provides.\n  In fact, just last week, General Electric announced that, due to the \nGOP shutdown of the Ex-Im Bank, more than 500 jobs will be shipped to \nplaces like France and China. Last month, Boeing told its workers that \nit expected to cut as many as several hundred jobs at its southern \nCalifornia-based satellite factory after a multimillion-dollar contract \nwas scuttled due to uncertainty about the future of the Export-Import \nBank.\n  Republican obstructionism is also having a direct impact on countless \nsmall businesses around this country, many of which are set to lose \ntheir Ex-Im-backed insurance policies in the coming weeks.\n  Mr. Speaker, a majority of this House supports reauthorizing the \nExport-Import Bank, but if we don't give Members the opportunity to \nvote up or down on reopening the Bank's doors today, the self-inflicted \nshutdown of the Ex-Im Bank may continue for months on end.\n  If that scenario plays out, the damage to our businesses, their \nworkers, and our economy will only get worse. The consequences for \naverage taxpayers would get worse as well. Because the Bank generates \nincome through fees it charges for its services, failure to reauthorize \nthe Bank means throwing away billions of dollars that would otherwise \nbe transferred to hardworking American taxpayers. Accordingly, we \nshould reauthorize the Bank. If we did, we could raise billions of \ndollars in profit for U.S. taxpayers over the coming years. The House \nshould take a position.\n\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, we have too many Republicans, our friends on\n\n[[Page H6093]]\n\nthe opposite side of the aisle, claim they support small businesses. \nThey want to do everything that they can to get rid of the regulatory \nobstacles to small businesses being able to grow and expand. They talk \nabout this with community banks. They talk about this with all kinds of \nbusinesses. But look what they are doing.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. They have absolutely stood in the \nway of reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank.\n  And where does that place this country? It places us in a position \nwhere we cannot compete with other countries who fully support the \nexport opportunity. So I would ask my colleagues to please vote on this \nbill at this time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Heck), a leader in the effort to reauthorize the \nExport-Import Bank.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous \nquestion so that we might indeed take up legislation to reauthorize the \nExport-Import Bank. Because I think the gentleman from Georgia has it \nexactly right, the question before this Chamber, before this Congress, \nbefore the President, before the American people is: Where are the \njobs?\n  Now we know where the jobs, in part, have come from over the last 8 \nyears. In fact, about 1.5 million of them have come through the \nactivity of the Export-Import Bank, where they supported $200 billion \nin exports spread out across 7,300 companies. And we know where the \njobs have not come from since July 1, when the charter of the Export-\nImport Bank expired, at which time there were 116 deals frozen, \nconstituting $9.3 billion in activity.\n  Who were they?\n  Norwest Ingredients is a company in my home State that sells mint \nflavoring for the manufacturers of candy and oral care. The company \ncurrently employs about a dozen employees. It is a small business.\n  Without Ex-Im, many small businesses like Norwest aren't going to be \nable to extend terms to foreign buyers, and they will have to ask for \ncash in advance. When they do, they will lose their business to other \ncountries who have export credit authorities.\n  By way of reminder, every single developed nation on the face of the \nEarth has an export credit authority right now, except the United \nStates of America.\n  Combustion Associates in California, they spent 3 years closing a \ndeal for a new power project in Nigeria that would generate $39 million \nin revenue and create 30 new American jobs. The deal is on hold, along \nwith two other projects that would have been worth nearly $50 million \nin revenue and 100 jobs.\n  GE, the gentlewoman from California shared the sad news of the 500 \njobs that are leaving these shores as a consequence of our failure to \nreauthorize the Ex-Im.\n  Digital Check, an Illinois company, sells check scanning equipment to \nclients in nearly 100 countries. Tom Anderson is the family-run \ncompany's chief executive. He says: We're losing now a quarter million \nin sales in British markets and around $300,000 in India. And that \nhalf-million-dollar hit is causing the company to reevaluate whether \nthey will suspend, altogether, their scanner leasing services.\n  FirmGreen--Steve Wilburn, president of FirmGreen and, I might add, a \nproud and highly decorated marine--laid off 10 of its 17 employees last \nyear because the company lost $60 million in contracts during our \nlatest period of uncertainty.\n  They are now, right as we speak, right as we are attempting to answer \nthe question of where are the jobs, competing for a $300 million \nproject in the Philippines, and it hinges on securing export credit \nfinancing from the Ex-Im. Without it, that business is going to likely \ngo to a South Korean rival and, with it, the 400 jobs he would have \nadded.\n  Boeing, again, the gentlewoman made mention of layoffs in El Segundo, \nCalifornia. That was not the first but the second satellite sale to a \nforeign company and country that we lost as a consequence of the \nuncertainty surrounding the Export-Import Bank.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. The outgoing CEO, Mr. McNerney, said: ``We \nnever would have considered that before this craziness on Ex-Im. We \nlove making and designing airplanes in the U.S. We are now forced to \nthink about doing it differently.''\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the House, we have now moved beyond the \ntheoretical and the abstract. We are now in the phase of this debate \nwhere real people with real jobs and real families are losing their \nlivelihood. The question is right: Where are the jobs? The answer is: \nIn reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank.\n  Defeat the previous question so that we might do what a majority of \nthis body wants to do, which is continue to compete in a global \neconomy.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I continue to I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the will of the majority is being thwarted in \nthis House, the people's House. Mr. Boehner, our Speaker, said when he \ntook his office as Speaker that the House worked best when the House \nwas allowed to work its will. Mr. Speaker, let the House work its will.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  We are about to take a vote on whether this House should move to \nreopen the Export-Import Bank and save thousands--thousands--of jobs \nthat Speaker Boehner has admitted will be lost without our action.\n  The Export-Import Bank is a critical tool that supports job creation \nhere in America by helping American businesses compete in foreign \nmarkets--in other words, making goods here with American workers and \nselling them abroad. That is what we need to be doing. The Export-\nImport Bank facilitates that happening. It has over 300 votes out of \n435 on this floor, but we cannot vote if it is not brought to the \nfloor.\n  When the Speaker and majority leader allowed the Bank's authorization \nto expire in June, they did so with the full knowledge that a \nreauthorization has the votes to pass and will pass with strong, \nbipartisan support if brought to the floor. Now, we have a chance to \ndefeat the previous question and bring that bill to the floor today.\n  Now, I want to say, Mr. Speaker, to some of my colleagues who may be \nnew, that voting down this rule, defeating the previous question is a \nvote to open the Export-Import Bank.\n  Now, I know some of you will say: Well, it is a procedural vote. My \nparty makes me do this.\n  Well, if you have that answer, look in the eye those who are losing \ntheir jobs and say: I had to do this for my party, not my country, not \nthe competitiveness of America, not for American jobs, not for American \nbusinesses, but I voted for the previous question for my party.\n  Sometimes, my friends, party demands too much. When you raise your \nhand, it is to defend the Constitution and laws thereof, but in a real \nsense, it is to defend and make America better.\n  Let's refuse to engage in what Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue \ntoday called a ``unilateral disarmament in the face of other \ngovernments' far more aggressive export credit agencies.''\n  Let me repeat that. That is Tom Donohue, president of the Chamber of \nCommerce. The Republican Party used to be a party of business, the \nparty that wanted to grow jobs. We talk about that all the time.\n  Well, my friends on the Republican side of the aisle, you have an \nopportunity to do that on this upcoming vote. Don't do as Tom Donohue \ntoday said you might do, a ``unilateral disarmament in the face of \nother governments' far more aggressive export credit agencies.''\n  Last week, General Electric announced it would be moving 500 jobs \nfrom New York, Texas, South Carolina, and Maine to Europe and China \nbecause of the failure of this Congress to\n\n[[Page H6094]]\n\npass the Export-Import Bank reauthorization. There are over 300 votes \nfor that on this floor.\n  The American people think we are dysfunctional. They are right. They \ndon't trust us because they don't think their board of directors is \ndoing the job they sent us here to do. They are right. They are angry. \nThey are anxious.\n  Let us for once, this day--we haven't funded the government yet; \nhopefully, we will get that done--but at least this day, given the \nopportunity on this previous question, say that we are going to make \nAmerica competitive and we are not going to unilaterally disarm.\n  This is something the Business Roundtable wants us to do. It is \nsomething the Chamber of Commerce wants us to do. It is something the \nNational Association of Manufacturers wants us to do. It is something \nthat organized labor wants us to do.\n  In the face of unity of purpose, in the face of a majority of votes \non this floor, party regularity still says: Tough. Tough. Yes, there \nmay be 300 votes on this bill, but we are not going to allow it to come \nto the floor.\n  Ladies and gentlemen in your offices or on this floor, America \nexpects you to do better. America expects you to be responsible. \nAmerica does not want you to be simply partisan. America does not want \nyou to be cowed by a small minority of this House and by radical groups \noutside this House who threaten Members they will spend a million or $2 \nmillion or $3 million to defeat them in a primary.\n  America wants us to do the right thing. America wants us to have the \ncourage of our convictions. America expects this House to reflect the \nmajority opinion, not be dictated to by a small minority.\n  Mr. Speaker, allow your Members to vote against the previous \nquestion. If you do so, we will bring to this floor the reauthorization \nof the Export-Import Bank; and, ladies and gentlemen of this House--and \nall Americans ought to know as well--it will pass.\n  Bring the Export-Import Bank bill reauthorization to this floor so \nAmerica can continue to be competitive and create jobs here in America. \nThat is what our constituents want us to do.\n  Vote against the previous question.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are about to take a vote on whether this house should \nmove to reopen the Export-Import Bank and save thousands of jobs that \neven Speaker Boehner has admitted will be lost without our action.\n  The Export-Import Bank is a critical tool that supports job creation \nhere in America by helping American businesses compete in foreign \nmarkets.\n  When the speaker and majority leader allowed the bank's authorization \nto expire in June, they did so with the full knowledge that a \nreauthorization has the votes to pass--and will pass with strong \nbipartisan support--if brought to the floor.\n  Now we have a chance to defeat the previous question and bring that \nbill to the floor today.\n  Let's end the uncertainty that has already caused businesses to hold \nback investment in job creation and to move American jobs overseas.\n  Let's refuse to engage in what Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue \ntoday called a ``unilateral disarmament in the face of other \ngovernments' far more aggressive export credit agencies.''\n  Last week, general electric announced that it would be moving 500 \njobs from New York, Texas, South Carolina, and Maine to Europe and \nChina because of the failure to keep the export-import bank open.\n  Congress has a responsibility to help grow jobs here--not send them \noverseas.\n  It's time to reopen the export-import bank.\n  Defeat this previous question.\n  Bring the export-import bank up for a vote.\n  And let's complete the task that America's workers and their \nemployers have asked us to do for months.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would inquire of my friend: Do \nyou have any more speakers? Or are you prepared to close?\n  Mr. POLIS. We have a lot of Democrats that want to talk about keeping \ngovernment open. I hear no Republicans here.\n  With good respect to my friend from Georgia, where are the Republican \nideas to keep government open?\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Well, I am trying to get an answer to a \nquestion. That means you do not have any more speakers on this. Are you \nready to close?\n  Mr. POLIS. We are ready to use all of our time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. POLIS. May I inquire of the Speaker how much time remains on both \nsides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado has 9\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Georgia has 23 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. POLIS. May I inquire of the gentleman from Georgia if he plans to \nuse his 23 minutes?\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. That is why I was asking the gentleman from \nColorado if he is prepared to close. I have no other speakers.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I will use our 9 minutes. I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, shortly, I will be offering an \namendment to the rule. The amendment will waive the two-thirds \nrequirement to consider a rule on the same day as reported from the \nRules Committee on the legislative days of September 24 and September \n25, 2015.\n  This will provide the flexibility necessary during the Pope's visit \nto ensure the House completes its business on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Again, I think it is clear. We have had many Democrats coming to the \nfloor talking about what we should be doing. I think the gentleman from \nGeorgia might be the only Republican in the Chamber. Maybe there is one \nother in the back. I don't have my glasses on.\n  We have a lot of ideas for keeping government open. Mainly, let's \npass a continuing resolution to do it now. Let's work more than 6 days \nout of the next 14. Let's stay here until we can keep government open, \nuntil we can reauthorize the transportation and infrastructure bill.\n  It sounds obvious to me; yet there just didn't seem to be any \ninterest from the other side. No Republicans have approached me about \nkeeping government open. I hope you do, Mr. Speaker. I hope you \nencourage your colleagues to. There is no one here in the Chamber \ntalking about what we can do to avoid a job-crushing government \nshutdown, which we are 14 days away from.\n  Instead, we are talking about unrelated bills. Now, I don't deny that \nthese bills deserve their day in the sun. I just question whether, when \nwe are 6 legislative days from a job-crushing shutdown, it is the time \nto discuss whether we should amend requirements set out by the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, or NEPA, that would reduce the role of public \ninput and turn the idea of NEPA on its head by eliminating any illusion \nof objective or scientific analysis by allowing private sponsors to \nwrite parts of their own environmental reviews.\n  Now, look, we can discuss that. I am strongly for reforming the NEPA \nprocess. As an example, if we can make it easier to site renewal energy \nprojects, I am a sponsor of a bill to expedite the NEPA process for \nsolar and wind infrastructure projects.\n  Look, there are people who support this terrible bill in its current \nform; I completely understand that, but this bill does nothing to avert \na job-destroying government shutdown that we are only 6 legislative \ndays from reaching.\n  Now, the gentleman from Georgia mentioned this, what we call a \nmartial law amendment. With this amendment that he is proposing with \nthis rule--we just got notice of it last minute here on the floor--he \nis offering an amendment that will allow any bill to be brought up \nunder martial law next week.\n  Now, in honor of Pope Francis' visit, I hope that they have a bill \nthat they plan to bring to the floor under martial law to reduce our \ncarbon emissions and finally do something to impact climate change, \nwhich I hope that Pope Francis will be addressing.\n  I also hope that, under martial law, they will bring forward a bill \nto replace our broken immigration system with a humane system, with a \npathway to citizenship that replaces the chaos we have, with the rule \nof law, border security, and a pathway to normalization and citizenship \nfor hard-working, aspiring Americans who are already here.\n  Now, I am not going to bet the ship that that is what they are going \nto do\n\n[[Page H6095]]\n\nwith this martial law, but the fact of the matter is, from a process \nperspective, we--myself, my colleagues, and I think most of the \nRepublican rank and file--simply don't know what they are going to do \nwith that authority.\n  This is going around the normal rules of the House to establish a \nmechanism to avoid the normal process, avoid the normal process through \nRules Committee and, through martial law, bring some sort of bill. I \nhope it is an immigration reform bill. I hope it is a climate change \nbill. I don't think it is.\n  Based on what we are seeing this week, it will probably be some NEPA \nbill or some--I don't know--some other bill that doesn't avoid a \ngovernment shutdown to the floor of the House.\n  Maybe it will be a bill that is a Republican funding bill that will \nhave a Presidential veto threat over it. That doesn't avoid a shutdown. \nRemember, the only way we can avoid a shutdown is the House, the \nSenate, and the President of the United States are on the same page for \nlegislation to avoid a government shutdown.\n  Let's give them the benefit of the doubt, and we will be back next \nweek, and I will hold my criticism. I hope it is an immigration reform \nbill. I hope it is a climate change bill.\n  I hope we honor Pope Francis by bringing forward two of his top \npriorities in a week that is appropriate, and if that is the case, I \nwill support martial law for those two efforts, and I hope that that is \nwhat we will do.\n  I will withhold judgment until we see what the Republicans attempt to \ndo with this procedural bypass of our normal mechanisms that they have \nscheduled for next week.\n  Look, these are bad bills under this rule. They are bad bills today. \nThey would be bad bills if they were appropriate to consider. I believe \nthey are inappropriate to consider in light of a job-crushing \ngovernment shutdown occurring in 6 legislative days.\n  The RAPID Act, which would turn the idea of NEPA on its head, is a \none-size-fits-all approach. It is not the right approach to NEPA \nreform.\n  There are thoughtful, bipartisan ideas that we could put together \nafter we avoid a government shutdown. I am happy to do that.\n  The LARA Act is even worse. Our country tried a similar framework to \nLARA in the eighties and early nineties, and there is broad consensus \nthat the experiment failed. Instead of reducing lawsuits, there was an \nexplosion of litigation, causing delays and wasting judicial resources. \nWhy on earth are we giving these failed ideas a second try?\n  The LARA Act would have prevented landmark decisions like the Brown \nv. Board of Education, which desegregated schools; Griswold v. \nConnecticut, which established constitutional protections for right to \nprivacy; and Loving v. Virginia, which ended bans on interracial \nmarriage.\n  Rather than ``preventing abuse,'' this bill would actually promote \ncivil rights abuses and weaken the courts' ability to crack down on \npeople who seek to discriminate illegally at work or school or at the \nvoting booth, and Congress should not pass this bill, now or ever.\n  I think it is particularly offensive, when a job-crushing government \nshutdown is looming, to even be talking about these other items rather \nthan discussing how we can avoid a job-crushing government shutdown.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure I am clear. These issues we should \ndiscuss. Natural resources. The World Health Organization estimates \nthat 2 million people a year are killed because of air pollution. But \nputting forth these bills now does nothing to eliminate or deal with a \njob-crushing government shutdown.\n  Over just 16 days in 2013, our country lost $24 billion in economic \ngrowth, hundreds of thousands of Federal workers were furloughed, \ncontractors and subcontractors were not paid. It is an avoidable \nscenario. It is a crisis created by Congress. We wonder why people \ndon't like Congress. It is a crisis of our own making.\n  Why are we threatening the critical, everyday services Americans rely \non, the millions of people that work for contractors and subcontractors \nof the Federal Government?\n  A small-R republic is a system of governance in which people exert \ninfluence over their elected officials, and those representatives are \nsupposed to listen and act upon those requests.\n  We need to listen to the American people and take the responsible \ncourse, Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to join me on this \ncommonsense mission before it is too late.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule and the underlying \nlegislation. We need to reinstate a legislative agenda that aligns with \nthe desires and wills and aspirations of the American people and \nAmerican businesses.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me be clear, just to clear up a couple of things \nhere. One, let me be clear that nothing in this rule or the amendment \nwaives the normal Rules Committee hearing process.\n  It simply provides us with the flexibility to consider bills on the \nfloor sooner while the Pope is here. It does nothing to waive the \nnormal committee process for bills that should go to Rules, just to \nclear up that.\n  I do appreciate the gentleman from Colorado's concern about our \nspeakers and the fact that he was counting today. I was glad to see \nthat he had three people come to speak on the rule that had nothing to \ndo with the bills in the underlying rule. So that was pretty \nimpressive.\n  I will stand with one person speaking on the rules and the truth of \nthe fact that regulatory burden has a crushing role on business. I will \nstand, one, by myself all day.\n  And then in just a few hours, when we discuss this in the debate \nprocess, we will have plenty of people to discuss the actual bills \nthemselves.\n  So let me close up by talking about what we are here for. My friends \nacross the aisle want to portray House Republicans as being against \nthings and against people.\n  Yes, it is true we have said ``no'' to bad policies and priorities of \nthe administration. We have refused to turn a blind eye to those who \nexploit our legal system.\n  We have said ``no'' to the Federal regulators who are indefinitely \ndelaying projects that would put Americans back to work.\n  We have said ``no'' to the tax more, spend more, save less, Big \nGovernment, job-killing machine that is crushing the American spirit \nand our economic growth.\n  But this majority says ``yes'' to solid, principled legislation that \nprotects Americans' personal and economic liberties. Later today, we \nwill say ``yes'' to life.\n  We will vote to protect the babies born alive despite the efforts to \nabort them. Regardless of the circumstances in which a baby is born \nalive, they are a person just like you or I. To fail to recognize their \nhumanity is to deny our own.\n  This House majority says ``yes'' to fiscal responsibility, ``yes'' to \nthe commonsense principle that our Nation should have a budget and \nactually stick to it.\n  We say ``yes'' to responsible oversight efforts because we \nunderstand, as our Founding Fathers did, that Americans' rights and \nliberties are only safe while the Federal Government is held within the \nbounds of the Constitution.\n  We say ``yes'' to free market principles because we recognize that \neconomic growth is rooted in the ingenuity of America's entrepreneurs, \nnot government programs.\n  We have replaced government with growth and regulations with reform. \nWe have restored transparency and trust. We have given our Nation \nreason to believe that one day our children won't be looking for a job \nbecause government has crushed them. They will be creating jobs.\n  House Republicans have heard the cries of the American people, and \ntoday, tomorrow, and every day to come we will continue to fight for \nthem. We will fight so that they can realize their hopes, their dreams, \nand their ambitions.\n\n\n              Amendment Offered by Mr. Collins of Georgia\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I offer an amendment to the \nresolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Add at the end the following:\n       Sec. 4. The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a \n     two-thirds vote to consider a\n\n[[Page H6096]]\n\n     report from the Committee on Rules on the same day it is \n     presented to the House is waived with respect to any \n     resolution reported on the legislative day of September 24, \n     2015, or September 25, 2015.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado will state his \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, does this amendment to the rule mean that \nMembers of this body will have less than 24 hours to review any bill we \nconsider next week?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will not interpret the meaning of \nthe pending proposition.\n  Mr. POLIS. Well, Mr. Speaker, I believe the meaning is very \nstraightforward. That is exactly what it means.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n      An Amendment to H. Res. 420 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     1031) to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United \n     States, and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill \n     shall be dispensed with. All points of order against \n     consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be \n     confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally \n     divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority \n     member of the Committee on Financial Services. After general \n     debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the \n     five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in \n     the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of \n     the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report \n     the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been \n     adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on the bill and amendments thereto to fmal passage without \n     intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or \n     without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and \n     reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then \n     on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately \n     after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of \n     rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 1031.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime, and I move the previous question on the amendment and the \nresolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion on the amendment and on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6096-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6096-H6109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3134, DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD ACT \nOF 2015; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3504, BORN-ALIVE ABORTION \n            SURVIVORS PROTECTION ACT; AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Ms. FOXX.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members\n\n[[Page H6097]]\n\nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 421 provides closed rules \nfor consideration of H.R. 3134, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act, and \nH.R. 3504, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.\n  Today, Madam Speaker, we provide for consideration of two vital \npieces of legislation addressing one of the most important issues of \nour time.\n  On many previous occasions, my colleagues and I have spoken on the \nissue of abortion and the tragedy it is that unborn children are not \nsafe and protected.\n  We are not here today, though, debating the policy of abortion on-\ndemand. We are debating specific legislative reactions to horrific \nwrongs that have come to light: the deliberate dismemberment of unborn \nchildren to receive compensation for their organs and other body parts \nand the failure of abortion facilities to care for children born alive \nduring failed abortions. Even some who support elective abortion agree \nthat those practices are barbaric and must be stopped.\n  The horrific reality of these practices in the abortion industry have \nbecome clear over the past few months, as undercover videos have been \nreleased of Planned Parenthood's leaders and affiliates discussing \npainstakingly dismembering unborn children for compensation.\n  In these days of 3-D ultrasounds and high-definition screens, it is \nimpossible to hide the humanity of these child victims. They have \nfingers and toes, heartbeats, and organs developed enough that tissue \ncollectors will pay $60 a specimen for them.\n  In light of the serious questions raised by these videos, the House \nCommittees on Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, and Oversight and \nGovernment Reform have each launched investigations.\n  While Planned Parenthood does not receive direct Federal funding for \nabortions, these investigations are warranted, as a recent report from \nthe Government Accountability Office shows that the organization \nreceives an average of $500 million taxpayer dollars each year for \nother lines of business. Money is fungible, and the Federal funds that \nPlanned Parenthood receives ultimately subsidize their abortion \nservices.\n  Given the serious allegations that have been raised about Planned \nParenthood's abortion practices related to the procurement and sale of \ntissue and organs from aborted, unborn children, it is appropriate for \nCongress to pass H.R. 3134, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act, placing \na 1-year moratorium on all Federal funds while Congress conducts its \ninvestigation.\n  No organization that performs divisive practices like abortion, \nparticularly in such a gruesome, profitable manner, should receive \ntaxpayer dollars, and this legislation advances that principle.\n  In addition, the examples of Kermit Gosnell's convictions for \nmurdering children born alive at his house of horrors and separate \nreports of unborn children may have been born alive or ``intact'' prior \nto being sold to tissue collectors have exposed the need for \nstrengthening the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act.\n  The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, which became law in 2002, \nextended critical legal protections to babies who are born alive after \na failed abortion attempt. That bill passed the House Judiciary \nCommittee with only two dissenting votes and was passed by the Senate \nby unanimous consent.\n  The legislation before us today, H.R. 3504, the Born-Alive Abortion \nSurvivors Protection Act, goes one step further to protect these \nvulnerable lives by requiring healthcare practitioners present at the \ntime of birth to administer professional skill, care, and diligence to \npreserve the life and health of the child.\n  This small, but important, step ensures the protection and \npreservation of precious, newborn life by providing for criminal \npenalties when that life is lost as a result of negligence.\n  These tiny, precious, vulnerable lives deserve the protection \nafforded all other persons under the law, and this bill ensures that \ntheir lives are protected.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Madam Speaker, I commend this rule and both the underlying bills to \nmy colleagues for their support.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina, my good friend, Dr. Foxx, for yielding me the customary \n30 minutes.\n  I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in very strong opposition \nto H.R. 3134 and H.R. 3504 and in very strong opposition to the \nunderlying closed rule.\n  Today, the House should be debating a bill to keep the government \nopen before funding runs out at the end of the month. We have just 6 \nlegislative days before there is a government shutdown--6 legislative \ndays--and instead of tackling this, we are once again debating another \nRepublican attack on women's health.\n  In 6 legislative days, the government might shut down; and I am \nworried because, judging from recent events within the Republican \ncaucus, the right hand doesn't know what the extreme right hand is \ndoing. They can't seem to get along with each other, and I am afraid \nyet there will be another catastrophe and everything will come to a \nhalt, and the people that will suffer will be the people of this \ncountry whom we are supposed to represent.\n  Madam Speaker, in fact, the Republicans were in such a hurry to waste \nour time with this destructive legislation that one of the bills we are \nconsidering, H.R. 3504, had no hearings--not one, none--no markup, and \nthis is the first time we are seeing the bill--and no amendments, by \nthe way. Nobody can offer an amendment. It is totally closed.\n  Whatever happened to regular order? This process, Madam Speaker, \nstinks, and it is indefensible.\n  Of all the measures that have come before the Rules Committee, more \nthan 75 percent have completely ignored regular order and were rushed \nto the floor without a legislative hearing and markup, denying the \npeople's elected representatives the opportunity to hear the experts \nand speak up for their constituents. Well, when you look at the \npolitically motivated legislation that regularly comes before this \nbody, I guess it is easy to see why. This is not how the people's House \nis supposed to work.\n  Late last night, the Republican majority of the Rules Committee took \nanother shortcut through a process called self-executing that let them \nslip an amendment offered by Mrs. Ellmers into today's legislation to \nredirect funding away from Planned Parenthood facilities. Under regular \norder, this amendment would have required three waivers--three. It \nwould require three waivers from the committee to be considered on the \nHouse floor.\n  On top of that, the Ellmers amendment would have also violated \nsection 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act, which prohibits the \nconsideration of legislation that exceeds a committee's allocation of \nbudget authority. But the Republican-controlled Rules Committee said: \nWho cares? We are in charge. We don't care about the rules. We don't \nwant to be fair. We don't want to be open. We don't want to be \ntransparent. We are in charge, and we can do whatever we want.\n  Madam Speaker, this is just another attempt by the House majority to \nshut out debate on important issues and ignore the House rules when it \nis convenient for them. During this Congress alone, 118 waivers have \nbeen granted; 115 of those waivers, 97 percent, have been for \nRepublicans. Instead of the House Rules Committee, we should be known \nas the House Break-the-Rules Committee, because that is all the Rules \nCommittee seems to do. It breaks rules, goes around rules, and tries \nall kinds of trickery to be able to force legislation to the floor that \nlimits debate and doesn't allow Members to offer amendments.\n  This legislative process in this House has become a joke. It is \nshameful, and this is not serious legislating.\n  With one bill after another, Republicans have repeatedly hurt our \ncountry's most vulnerable families, and\n\n[[Page H6098]]\n\nthese bills today are just the latest chapter. This is nothing new.\n  One of the first acts of the Republican House majority in 2011 was to \ndrive us to the brink of a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood. \nIn October 2013, Republicans did shut down the government by insisting \non defunding the Affordable Care Act. Now, 2 years later, they are \nright back to threatening a Republican government shutdown over Planned \nParenthood.\n  H.R. 3134, the so-called Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015, is a \nbad and a backward-thinking bill. In the 114th Congress, the House has \nalready taken four anti-women's health votes and today sets the stage \nfor us to take two additional votes to restrict women's access to \nwomen's health care. Incredibly, this is already twice the number of \nanti-women's health votes than at this same point in the 113th and \n112th Congresses--and this Congress is not even half over.\n  In this Republican Congress, facts don't matter. We don't talk about \nfacts. They are inconvenient and they are a nuisance--especially when \nthey get in the way of their extremist political agenda.\n  The fact is that Planned Parenthood plays a critical role in \nprotecting and providing access to critical health services for both \nwomen and men. One in five women has relied on a Planned Parenthood \nhealth center for care in her lifetime, and Planned Parenthood serves \n2.7 million patients each year. One of the most important statistics \nthat my Republican friends like to ignore is that more than 90 percent \nof what Planned Parenthood does nationally is preventive care, \nincluding cervical cancer screenings, breast cancer screenings, and \nfamily planning--not abortion services.\n  I just came from a luncheon a few minutes ago where we were honoring \nindividuals who were leaders in the cancer prevention field, people who \nhave advocated that it is important for all of us to be able to get \ncheckups on a regular basis in order to prevent cancer; and here we are \nabout to vote on a bill that, if the Republicans get their way, would \nlimit and would eliminate access to lifesaving cancer screenings for \ncountless individuals across this country.\n  What are you thinking? This is not the way we should be proceeding.\n  Add to this the fact that Planned Parenthood clinics are often one of \nthe few affordable healthcare options available for many women--nearly \n80 percent of women using Planned Parenthood clinics have incomes at or \nbelow 150 percent of poverty--and it is easy to see why a majority of \nAmericans don't think Federal funding should be eliminated. In one \nrecent poll, 63 percent of voters, including 72 percent of \nIndependents, do not agree with my Republican friends that Federal \nfunding for Planned Parenthood should be eliminated.\n  Madam Speaker, we have also heard very little from my friends on the \nother side of the aisle about the consequences that defunding for \nPlanned Parenthood would have for families across the country. One of \nthe biggest myths perpetrated by Republicans is the idea that our \nNation's community health centers--which I love, adore, respect, and \nsupport--could somehow magically pick up the slack overnight if Planned \nParenthood is defunded.\n  For the millions of low-income women who depend on Planned Parenthood \nclinics, this scenario would mean the loss of affordable and accessible \ncontraceptive services and counseling, as well as breast and cervical \ncancer screenings and testing. The idea that our community health \ncenters could, overnight, suddenly step up and cover millions of new \npatients is simply wrong and shows a fundamental misunderstanding by \nRepublicans of how our country's healthcare system works.\n\n  In fact, the Guttmacher Institute recently found that, in 21 percent \nof counties with a Planned Parenthood health center, Planned Parenthood \nis the only safety net family planning provider. The report also \nstates: ``In two-thirds of the 491 counties in which they are located, \nPlanned Parenthood health centers serve at least half of all women \nobtaining contraceptive care from safety net health centers. In one-\nfifth of the counties in which they are located, Planned Parenthood \nsites are the sole safety net family planning center.''\n  This makes clear just how devastating it would be for these \ncommunities to recklessly cut funding for these vital health services \nfor the people who need them most.\n  Everyone here in this Congress, every single one of us, with the snap \nof our fingers, can get health care; but with today's bills, \nRepublicans seem to be saying that for families who are poor or who \nlive in rural areas or where this is the only option for preventive \ncare where they live are simply out of luck. Talk about cruel.\n  Madam Speaker, I have a recent article from the Health Affairs Blog, \ntitled, ``Planned Parenthood, Community Health Centers, and Women's \nHealth: Getting the Facts Right.'' It says: ``a claim that community \nhealth centers readily can absorb the loss of Planned Parenthood \nclinics amounts to a gross misrepresentation of what even the best \ncommunity health centers in the country would be able to do were \nPlanned Parenthood to lose over 40 percent of its operating revenues \novernight as the result of a ban on Federal funding.''\n  I will enter the full article into the Record.\n\n               [From Health Affairs Blog, Sept. 8, 2015]\n\nQuantifying Planned Parenthood's Critical Role in Meeting the Need for \n                 Publicly Supported Contraceptive Care\n\n                          (By Jennifer Frost)\n\n       Over the past few months, legislative attempts to defund \n     Planned Parenthood have flared at both the federal and state \n     levels; these moves are clearly an attempt to shutter Planned \n     Parenthood health centers, potentially depriving women of the \n     contraceptive services and counseling, sexually transmitted \n     infection (STI) testing and treatment, and breast and \n     cervical cancer screening that they provide.\n       Although proponents of closing Planned Parenthood argue \n     that other providers would be easily able to fill the hole \n     torn in the safety net, credible evidence suggests this is \n     unlikely. In some areas, Planned Parenthood is the sole \n     safety-net provider of contraceptive care. And even where \n     there are other safety-net providers, they, on average, serve \n     far fewer contraceptive clients than do sites operated by \n     Planned Parenthood.\n       As this debate swirls, the Guttmacher Institute received a \n     request from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) regarding \n     the publicly supported contraceptive care provided by Planned \n     Parenthood health centers across the country. To respond, \n     Guttmacher staff conducted special tabulations of our \n     Contraceptive Needs and Services 2010 report (the most recent \n     year for which these data are available).\n       Our analysis shows unequivocally that Planned Parenthood \n     plays a major role in delivering publicly supported \n     contraceptive services and supplies to women who are in need \n     of such care nationwide. In two-thirds of the 491 counties in \n     which they are located, Planned Parenthood health centers \n     serve at least half of all women obtaining contraceptive care \n     from safety-net health centers. In one-fifth of the counties \n     in which they are located, Planned Parenthood sites are the \n     sole safety-net family planning center.\n       Further, the average Planned Parenthood health center \n     serves significantly more contraceptive clients each year \n     than do safety-net centers run by other types of providers, \n     such as federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) or county \n     health departments. As a result, Planned Parenthood centers \n     serve a greater share of safety-net contraceptive clients \n     than any other type of provider. And, Planned Parenthood \n     sites are more likely to make contraceptive care quickly and \n     easily accessible to the women who need it.\n\n\n                   contraceptive care by the numbers\n\n       Below are the key takeaways of Guttmacher's findings \n     related to Planned Parenthood's provision of publicly \n     supported contraceptive care.\n       Planned Parenthood health centers serve a considerable \n     proportion of all clients obtaining contraceptive care from \n     safety-net health centers.\n       In 2010, 36 percent of the 6.7 million U.S. women receiving \n     contraceptive care from safety-net family planning health \n     centers were served at Planned Parenthood centers. And there \n     are some areas of the country where women rely particularly \n     heavily on Planned Parenthood: In 18 states, Planned \n     Parenthood health centers serve more than 40 percent of women \n     obtaining contraceptive care from a safety-net family \n     planning health center. In 11 of those 18 states, Planned \n     Parenthood serves more than half the women obtaining \n     contraceptive care from a safety-net health center.\n       Planned Parenthood health centers often serve most or all \n     of the safety-net contraceptive clients in their county.\n       In 68 percent of counties with a Planned Parenthood site \n     (332 counties out of 491), these sites serve at least half \n     the women obtaining publicly supported contraceptive services \n     from a safety-net health center. And in 21 percent of \n     counties with a Planned Parenthood site (103 counties), \n     Planned Parenthood serves all of the women obtaining publicly \n     supported contraceptive services from a safety-net health \n     center.\n\n[[Page H6099]]\n\n       The majority of women who need publicly supported \n     contraceptive care live in counties with a Planned Parenthood \n     health center.\n       Almost two-thirds (64 percent) of the 19 million women in \n     need of publicly supported contraceptive services and \n     supplies live in counties with a Planned Parenthood health \n     center. Moreover, 30 percent of these women live in counties \n     where Planned Parenthood serves the majority of those \n     obtaining publicly supported contraceptive care from the \n     family planning safety net. (Women are considered to be in \n     need of publicly supported contraception if they have ever \n     had sex; are aged 13-44; are able to become pregnant; are not \n     pregnant, postpartum, nor trying to become pregnant; and \n     either have a family income below 250 percent of the federal \n     poverty level or are younger than age 20.)\n       Planned Parenthood health centers serve a greater share of \n     safety-net contraceptive clients than do any other types of \n     providers.\n       Although Planned Parenthood health centers comprise 10 \n     percent of publicly supported safety-net family planning \n     centers, they serve 36 percent of clients who obtain publicly \n     supported contraceptive services from such centers. By \n     contrast, centers operated by health departments serve 27 \n     percent of safety-net contraceptive clients, FQHCs serve 16 \n     percent, sites operated by hospitals serve 8 percent, and \n     sites operated by other agencies serve 13 percent.\n       On average, Planned Parenthood health centers serve many \n     more contraceptive clients per year than do other types of \n     safety-net providers. Planned Parenthood health centers serve \n     an average of 2,950 contraceptive clients per year, many \n     times more than any other type of publicly supported health \n     center. By contrast, those operated by hospitals serve an \n     average of 770 contraceptive clients, health departments \n     serve an average of 750, FQHCs serve 330, and centers \n     operated by other types of agencies serve 680 contraceptive \n     clients each year.\n       Planned Parenthood health centers are more likely to \n     facilitate women's timely access to a wide range of \n     contraceptive services and supplies.\n       Planned Parenthood sites are considerably more likely to \n     offer a broad range of contraceptive methods than sites \n     operated by other types of agencies. Specifically, 91 percent \n     of Planned Parenthood health centers offer at least 10 of 13 \n     reversible contraceptive methods, compared to between 48 \n     percent and 53 percent of sites operated by other types of \n     agencies.\n       Moreover, Planned Parenthood sites are particularly likely \n     to help women who choose oral contraceptives to get their \n     pills without having to make an additional trip to a \n     pharmacy: 92 percent of Planned Parenthood health centers \n     offer oral contraceptive supplies and refills on-site, as do \n     86 percent of health department sites. Considerably smaller \n     proportions of sites operated by FQHCs and other types of \n     agencies--37 percent and 55 percent, respectively--do so.\n       Finally, women are often able to get the care they need \n     more quickly from Planned Parenthood than from other types of \n     safety-net providers. Sixty-three percent of Planned \n     Parenthood health centers offer same-day appointments, \n     compared to between 30 percent and 40 percent of sites \n     operated by other types of agencies. And the average wait for \n     an appointment at a Planned Parenthood health center is 1.8 \n     days, whereas wait times at sites operated by other types of \n     agencies range from 5.3 to 6.8 days.\n\n\n                             looking ahead\n\n       We cannot predict whether or to what extent health centers \n     operated by other providers could fill the significant gap in \n     the family planning safety net that would be created if \n     Planned Parenthood health centers were defunded--and \n     therefore lost to the communities they serve. Certainly in \n     the short term, it is doubtful that other providers could \n     step up in a timely way to absorb the millions of women \n     suddenly left without their preferred source of care and \n     whether those providers could offer the same degree of \n     accessible, quality contraceptive care offered by Planned \n     Parenthood. (Indeed, Texas offers a cautionary tale; the \n     state's family planning program for low-income women served \n     far fewer women after Planned Parenthood health centers were \n     cut out of the effort.)\n       What we do know is that women nationwide rely on Planned \n     Parenthood health centers for the contraceptive services and \n     supplies they need--and for women in many areas of the \n     country, losing Planned Parenthood would mean losing their \n     chosen provider and the only safety-net provider around.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Here are some more facts.\n  For every patient served by a community health center today, nearly \nthree residents of low-income communities remain without access to \nprimary health care. By voting for a sudden cutoff in funding, we would \ncreate an immediate healthcare access crisis for millions of women, \nplacing an enormous strain on community health centers and other \nproviders.\n  Community health centers offer women's health services as part of \ncomprehensive primary care programs. They simply cannot put their other \nresponsibilities aside. With so many of our Nation's community health \ncenters already struggling to meet the needs of our most vulnerable \ncommunities, the last thing we should be doing is trying to make their \njobs harder.\n  Now, on top of all of this, Senator McConnell has already said that \nSenate Republicans do not have the votes to pass this bill and it will \nnever reach the President's desk. So what are we doing here? This is \nnot a rhetorical question. We are literally, as I said earlier, 6 \nlegislative days away from another government shutdown; and instead of \ntalking about how we are going to keep the doors open, how we are going \nto do what the people of the country have sent us here to do and keep \ngovernment running, we are wasting time with this politically driven \nlegislation that does nothing to make the country better.\n  Madam Speaker, the other bill before us, H.R. 3504, is not a simple \nrestatement of the current born-alive law, by the way, which passed by \na voice vote in 2002, no. Just so my colleagues understand, this bill \nfundamentally interferes with the sacred doctor-patient relationship \nand undermines doctors' clinical judgment and tells them how to provide \nmedicine, or else they will face criminal penalties.\n  Madam Speaker, this bill is a solution in search of a problem. We \nalready have strong Federal and State laws to protect babies born \nalive. The bottom line is that these anti-women's health bills would \nlimit women's access to safe, legal, reproductive health care.\n  Congress should be governing responsibly and working to solve the \nreal issues our country is facing. We should be focused on growing our \neconomy and creating jobs. I think you may have forgotten that that is \nan important priority of the American people because my friends never \nlike to mention the word ``jobs.''\n  But we ought to be focused on creating jobs. We ought to be \nprotecting access to health care, increasing college affordability, and \nbuilding a better future. Instead, 30 conservative House Republicans \nhave decided to take government funding hostage, and that is what we \nare here for.\n  The American people deserve better.\n  Finally, let's be clear. Let's all kind of clear the air and be \nhonest about one thing. The debate we are having today really isn't \nabout the quality of care provided by Planned Parenthood. That is \nreally not what is at the heart of all this. This is an effort by my \nfriends on the Republican side to kind of pursue their agenda of \ncriminalizing and outlawing abortion in every circumstance.\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side have been very vocal about \nthe fact that they want to criminalize abortion, even in cases of rape \nor incest. They would make a woman who is a victim of rape or incest a \ncriminal. They would criminalize the doctors. That is what this is all \nabout, trying to force their narrow agenda down the throats of the \nAmerican people.\n  I would say to my colleagues that we ought to reject this and get \ndown to the business of governing this country. This is not what we \nshould be doing here today. This is an insult, I think, to women. This \nis an insult to the good people who work at Planned Parenthood who \nprovide excellent care to millions of people across this country, and, \nquite frankly, it is an insult to the American people that, with 6 \nlegislative days left before you shut the government down, this is what \nyou choose to bring to the floor and not a bill to keep the government \nopen.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, if my colleagues would like to use \nparliamentary terms like ``regular order,'' ``self-execute,'' or \n``waivers'' to hide from debate over the gruesome practices of \nabortionists, that is their prerogative.\n  They ignore what one key Planned Parenthood abortionist said: ``We've \nbeen very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so \nI'm not gonna crush that part. I'm gonna basically crush below, I'm \ngonna crush above, and I'm gonna see if I can get it all intact.''\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Republicans will continue to bring the truth to Americans and prevent \ntaxpayer dollars from going to organizations that dismember children.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. \nByrne).\n\n[[Page H6100]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Madam Speaker, by now, we have all seen the appalling \nvideos which depict Planned Parenthood officials talking about how they \ncrush babies in certain ways to preserve certain organs and then \nbargaining over the price of those organs.\n  I want to be crystal clear. The loss of any human life is a tragedy, \nbut the casual nature in which the Planned Parenthood officials talk \nabout killing a baby is simply heartbreaking and appalling. It is \nunconscionable that any American could be that cold and callous.\n  Let me tell you about the Planned Parenthood clinic in my hometown of \nMobile, Alabama. They were cited by the Alabama Department of Health \nfor performing two abortions on a 14-year-old girl in a span of 4 \nmonths without their complying with State laws that require the \nreporting of possible sexual abuse. This is the type of organization we \nare talking about.\n  Congress cannot simply sit on the sidelines and wait for someone else \nto respond. These egregious actions require a response.\n  Madam Speaker, I do not believe the Federal Government should be \nspending a single penny on Planned Parenthood, and H.R. 3134 would make \nthat a reality. I urge my colleagues to support this rule.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I just want to say to my colleague from North Carolina that I am not \nhiding behind procedural rules.\n  In fact, in the way that my Republican friends have brought this bill \nto the floor, you won't allow us to debate amendments. We can't. You \nhave stifled debate.\n  So I guess I would ask you: What are you afraid of? Why can't we have \na more open process on legislation that didn't even go through the \ncommittees of jurisdiction? You ought to open this place up. A little \ndebate is not a bad thing. A little openness is a good thing.\n  Madam Speaker, I include for the Record the report by the \nSubcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Democratic members and \nstaff, basically that refers to the heavily edited videos that my \ncolleagues refer to.\n  I will just read one line here:\n  To date, the committee has received no evidence--underline ``no \nevidence''--to substantiate the allegations that Planned Parenthood is \nengaged in the sale of fetal tissue for profit.\n  Furthermore, the committee has received no evidence to support the \nallegation that fetal tissue was procured without consent, that Planned \nParenthood physicians altered the timing, method, or procedure of an \nabortion solely for the purposes of obtaining fetal tissue, or that \nPlanned Parenthood physicians performed intact dilation and evacuation \nin order to preserve fetal tissue for research.\n  Thus far, the investigation has revealed that PPFA requires all \naffiliates to ensure compliance with all State and Federal laws and \nthat specific PPFA guidance requires affiliates to ensure that \nreimbursement for fetal tissue is limited to actual cost.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                              Committee on Energy and Commerce\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2015.\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Democratic \n         Members and Staff\n     From Committee on Energy and Commerce Democratic Staff\n     Re Update on the Committee's Ongoing Investigation of Planned \n         Parenthood Federation of America\n\n                            I. Introduction\n\n       This memorandum serves as an update on the Committee's \n     ongoing investigation into claims regarding the alleged sale \n     of fetal tissue by affiliates of Planned Parenthood \n     Federation of America (PPFA) to tissue procurement \n     organizations (TPOs). The review has included bipartisan \n     briefings by Planned Parenthood officials as well as \n     representatives from StemExpress, Novogenix Laboratories, and \n     Advanced Bioscience Resources--three TPOs that partner with \n     Planned Parenthood affiliates and other healthcare providers \n     to collect specimens to supply to researchers working with \n     fetal tissue.\n       In addition to these briefings, the Committee has received \n     documents and written responses to a series of questions it \n     posed in writing to PPFA regarding its ``practices relating \n     to fetal tissue collection and sale or donation.'' To date, \n     the Committee has received no evidence to substantiate the \n     allegations that Planned Parenthood has engaged in the sale \n     of fetal tissue for profit. Furthermore, the Committee has \n     received no evidence to support the allegations that fetal \n     tissue was procured without consent, that Planned Parenthood \n     physicians altered the timing, method, or procedure of an \n     abortion solely for the purposes of obtaining fetal tissue, \n     or that Planned Parenthood physicians performed intact \n     dilation and evacuation in order to preserve fetal tissue for \n     research. Thus far, the investigation has revealed that PPFA \n     requires all affiliates to ensure compliance with all state \n     and federal laws and that specific PPFA guidance requires \n     affiliates to ensure that reimbursement for fetal tissue is \n     limited to actual costs.\n       The Committee received evidence that the individuals making \n     these unsubstantiated claims misrepresented themselves in \n     order to gain access to Planned Parenthood personnel and \n     facilities, and that the videos released by the Center for \n     Medical Progress (CMP) are incomplete, selectively edited, \n     and intentionally misleading.\n\nII. There Is No Evidence That Planned Parenthood or Its Affiliates Have \n                   Violated any Federal or State Laws\n\n\n A. PPFA Requires All Affiliates to Comply With All State and Federal \n  Laws, Including Laws Pertaining to the Donation of Fetal Tissue for \n                                Research\n\n i. PPFA Guidance to Affiliates Regarding Human Fetal Tissue Donation \n     Specifically Advises That It Is Illegal to Receive ``Valuable \n  Consideration'' for Fetal Tissue, and Requires Affiliates to Ensure \n               that Reimbursement Represents Actual Costs\n\n       The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 established the legal \n     standards governing fetal tissue donation. The law states, \n     ``It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, \n     receive, or otherwise transfer any human fetal tissue for \n     valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate \n     commerce.'' The law further provides: ``The term `valuable \n     consideration' does not include reasonable payments \n     associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, \n     preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal \n     tissue.''\n       Current PPFA guidance on fetal tissue donation tracks \n     federal law, and it clearly and explicitly prohibits \n     affiliates from receiving valuable consideration for fetal \n     tissue. The guidance also requires affiliates to ensure that \n     reimbursement represents actual costs incurred by the \n     affiliate. The current PPFA guidance, revised in May 2015, \n     provides as follows:\n\n       Federal law prohibits the payment or receipt of money or \n     any other form of valuable consideration for fetal tissue, \n     regardless of whether the program to which the tissue is \n     being provided is federally funded or not.\n       There are limited exceptions that allow reimbursement for \n     actual expenses (e.g. storage, processing, transportation, \n     etc.) of the tissue. If an affiliate chooses to accept \n     reimbursement for allowable expenses, it must be able to \n     demonstrate the reimbursement represents its actual costs. \n     PPFA recommends that an affiliate consult with CAPS \n     [Consortium of Abortion Providers] about steps to take to \n     document and demonstrate actual cost. [emphasis in the \n     original]\n       The guidance also advises affiliates that ``there are \n     federal, and frequently, state laws that govern these \n     activities, as well as ethical considerations. Great care \n     must be taken to assure that these programs are above \n     reproach in all respects.''\n       In a briefing with Committee staff, Dr. Raegan McDonald-\n     Mosley, the Chief Medical Officer of PPFA, explained that \n     PPFA accredits its affiliates. Affiliates are autonomous \n     legal entities, with their own separate boards, executive \n     personnel, and legal counsel.\n       Dr. McDonald-Mosley further described how PPFA oversees its \n     affiliates and verifies their compliance with its fetal \n     tissue donation guidance. Each affiliate is independently \n     responsible for ensuring compliance with the guidance, as \n     well as with all applicable state and federal laws.\n       PPFA oversees its affiliates through an accreditation \n     process, whereby each affiliate is reviewed at least once \n     every three years. Affiliates are evaluated on a range of \n     hundreds of possible elements of performance, including, as \n     of 2013, compliance with PPFA's fetal tissue donation \n     guidance. Accreditation involves both offsite reviews of \n     affiliate documentation as well as onsite reviews that \n     include interviews with staff and direct observation of \n     patient care. Non-compliance with PPFA required standards may \n     affect an affiliate's accreditation status and result in \n     actions that jeopardize that affiliate's ability to continue \n     to use the Planned Parenthood trademark.\n       Although the precise language of PPFA's fetal tissue \n     guidance has been revised over the years, affiliates have \n     always been required to ensure that their tissue donation \n     programs are in compliance with all state and federal laws, \n     including the prohibition on receiving valuable \n     consideration. For example, an earlier version of the \n     guidance from 2001 provided to the Committee instructs \n     affiliates that federal laws ``forbid the payment or receipt \n     of valuable consideration for fetal tissue. However, they \n     permit `reasonable payments associated with the \n     transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, \n     quality control, or storage' of fetal tissue.'' This guidance \n     was reissued to affiliates in 2011.\n       Several years ago, PPFA undertook an effort to revise their \n     Manual of Medical Standards and Guidelines (the Manual) by \n     removing those sections not directly related to clinical \n     care. According to Dr. McDonald-\n\n[[Page H6101]]\n\n     Mosley, the Manual is a desk reference for clinicians for \n     directing medical care. It is intended to assist \n     practitioners in providing regular care for a patient and is \n     revised on a two-year cycle. As a result of this revision \n     effort, the fetal tissue guidance was separated from the \n     Manual and is now a standalone document. It is distributed to \n     affiliates through the PPFA intranet. Dr. Deborah Nucatola, \n     who is PPFA's Senior Director for Medical Services and has \n     had primary responsibility for the Manual since July 2009, \n     explained to Committee staff that guidance on fetal tissue \n     donation was removed from the Manual as part of this process \n     to streamline and remove non-clinical information.\n        As of November 6, 2013, affiliates are now permitted to \n     facilitate fetal tissue donation without prior approval from \n     PPFA. PPFA distinguishes between ``core services,'' which all \n     affiliates are required to provide, such as well-women visits \n     and education and prescribing for all FDA-approved methods of \n     contraception, and services which are voluntary or optional \n     for affiliates to offer. Earlier versions of the fetal tissue \n     guidance instructed affiliates to ``submit a written request \n     to initiate an aborted tissue and/or blood donation program \n     to PPFA for review and approval.'' According to PPFA, it \n     ``implemented this policy change as part of a broader effort \n     to reduce the administrative burden on affiliates and support \n     affiliate service expansion.\n       This overhaul affected other services besides facilitation \n     of tissue donation; PPFA no longer requires prior approval \n     for an affiliate to offer certain other non-core services.''\n\n   ii. PPFA Guidance to Affiliates Includes Additional Requirements \n Pertaining to Fetal Tissue Transplantation Research, Although This is \n                          Not Required by Law\n\n       Federal law imposes additional requirements on providers \n     and on researchers when the donated tissue is used in \n     federally funded research involving the transplantation of \n     human fetal tissue for therapeutic purposes. Under the \n     statute, human fetal tissue may be used in federally funded \n     research on the transplantation of fetal tissue if the \n     attending physician declares in writing 1) that the woman's \n     consent for abortion was obtained prior to requesting or \n     obtaining consent to donate the fetal tissue for research; 2) \n     that the timing, method, or procedure used to terminate the \n     pregnancy were not altered in order to obtain the tissue; 3) \n     that the abortion was performed in accordance with applicable \n     state law; and 4) the woman has been fully informed of the \n     physician's interest, if any, in the research, and of any \n     medical or privacy risks associated with the tissue donation.\n       According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the \n     federal government has not funded any fetal tissue \n     transplantation research since 2007. The federal rules \n     relating to the timing and method of abortion are therefore \n     not applicable to any recent fetal tissue donations in the \n     United States. However, PPFA's fetal tissue donation guidance \n     nonetheless incorporates these requirements as recommended \n     practices for affiliates. The 2015 PPFA guidance provides:\n\n       Federal law establishes additional requirements applicable \n     whenever the research involving fetal tissue is conducted or \n     supported by the federal government. PPFA recommends that \n     these requirements be adhered to without regard to whether \n     the tissue donation program is federally supported or not. \n     These requirements are:\n       1. That the client's consent to donate not be sought until \n     after she has decided to have an abortion and has signed the \n     consent form for the abortion.\n       2. That the client acknowledge that the blood or tissue is \n     being donated as a gift and that she will not be paid.\n       3. That the client acknowledge that she has not been told \n     and that she has no control over who will get the donated \n     blood and/or tissue or what it will be used for.\n       4. That there will be no changes to how or when the \n     abortion is done in order to obtain the blood or tissue.\n       The guidance further instructs affiliates that ``It must be \n     documented that no substantive alteration in the timing of \n     terminating the pregnancy or of the method used was made for \n     the purpose of obtaining the blood and/or tissue.''\n       Similarly, earlier versions of the PPFA guidance required \n     the clinician to make a notation that: ``[a]borted tissue was \n     donated,'' ``[c]onsent for the abortion was obtained prior to \n     requesting or obtaining consent for the tissue donation,'' \n     and ``[n]o substantive alteration in the timing of \n     terminating the pregnancy or of the method used was made for \n     the purpose of obtaining the tissue.'' Previous versions of \n     the guidance also required specific language in consent forms \n     used for tissue donation. These versions were issued under \n     the previous system, in which affiliates were required to \n     seek service approval from PPFA for tissue donation programs.\n       Appended to PPFA's May 2015 guidance is a recommended \n     sample consent form, which prompts the patient who is \n     donating tissue to affirm the following statements:\n\n       Before I was shown this consent, I had already decided to \n     have an abortion and signed a consent form for it.\n       I agree to give my blood and/or the tissue from the \n     abortion as a gift to be used for education, research, or \n     treatment.\n       I understand I have no control over who will get the \n     donated blood and/or tissue or what it will be used for.\n       I have not been told the name of any person who might get \n     my donation.\n       I understand there will be no changes to how or when my \n     abortion is done in order to get my blood or the tissue.\n       I understand I will not be paid.\n       I understand that I don't have to give my blood or \n     pregnancy tissue, and this will not affect my current or \n     future care at (affiliate name).\n       Earlier versions of the guidance included a substantially \n     similar consent form, although use of the consent form was \n     required rather than recommended under the previous system of \n     service approvals by PPFA, and substantive deviations from \n     the consent form required approval from PPFA Medical \n     Services.\n\n\n  B. There Is No Evidence that Planned Parenthood Affiliates Knowingly \n      Received Valuable Consideration in Exchange for Fetal Tissue\n\n       The Committee has received no evidence that any Planned \n     Parenthood affiliate or employee ever received any ``valuable \n     consideration'' for donated fetal tissue. The information and \n     the documentary evidence received by the Committee support \n     Planned Parenthood's assertions that the few affiliates that \n     have participated in fetal tissue donation comply with the \n     requirement to limit reimbursement to reasonable payments \n     associated with facilitating tissue donation.\n       In an August 27, 2015, letter to congressional leaders, \n     PPFA President Cecile Richards listed the reimbursement rates \n     at affiliates that are currently or were recently \n     participating in fetal tissue donation. At present, only two \n     out of PPFA's 59 affiliates are participating in fetal tissue \n     donation, and only one affiliate is receiving any \n     reimbursement for costs. An additional four affiliates \n     facilitated fetal tissue donation for research in the past \n     five years. The California affiliate that is currently \n     participating receives a reimbursement of $60 per tissue \n     specimen from a TPO. The other four affiliates, which had \n     participated in fetal tissue donation programs in the past \n     five years, either sought no reimbursement or had \n     reimbursement rates ranging from $45 to $55 per tissue \n     specimen. The letter states, ``[i]n every case, the \n     affiliates report that these amounts were intended to recover \n     only their costs, as allowed under the federal law and our \n     guidance.'' The evidence received by the Committee during the \n     course of this investigation supports this assertion.\n       The May 2015 tissue donation guidance notes that affiliates \n     ``must be able to demonstrate the reimbursement represents \n     its actual costs.'' Dr. McDonald-Mosley explained that the \n     way that each affiliate determines cost is fact-specific to \n     that affiliate. Dr. Nucatola stated that fetal tissue \n     donation is not a revenue stream for affiliates, and that \n     reimbursement should generally be reasonable for the impact \n     it has on the clinic.\n       Both the statute governing fetal tissue donation and \n     Planned Parenthood's May 2015 guidance on pregnancy tissue \n     donation outline the exceptions for reimbursement. The types \n     of costs that may arise for clinics facilitating tissue \n     donation include staff time to identify patients who are \n     interested in donating fetal tissue, staff time spent \n     explaining fetal tissue donation and securing consent, staff \n     time spent drawing maternal blood samples, space in the \n     pathology lab, storage of supplies, sterilization of \n     equipment, and other related costs.\n       In a briefing with the Committee, Cate Dyer, the Chief \n     Executive Officer of StemExpress, stated that it is her \n     understanding that the valuable consideration requirement \n     applies to all fetal tissue her company obtains. The \n     contracts between StemExpress and two Planned Parenthood \n     affiliates state, ``The reasonable costs associated with the \n     services specified in this Agreement shall be fifty-five \n     dollars ($55.00) per POC [product of conception] determined \n     in the clinic to be usable.'' According to Dyer, the \n     reimbursement covers the space and storage at the Planned \n     Parenthood facility, particularly within the lab and \n     pathology departments, sterilization of equipment, and staff \n     participation in consent and facilitating involvement in the \n     clinic. Additionally, clinic staff is also involved in \n     obtaining maternal blood samples for StemExpress, so that the \n     company can screen for infectious diseases. Dyer stated that \n     she believed Planned Parenthood is losing money on fetal \n     tissue donation, given the amount of staff time involved and \n     space StemExpress takes up at the clinics.\n       In a briefing with Committee staff, Dr. Ben Van Handel, the \n     Executive Director of Novogenix Laboratories, confirmed that \n     at the affiliate where Novogenix has a contract, Planned \n     Parenthood set the price of $45 for services rendered on a \n     per specimen basis. The contract between Novogenix and the \n     Planned Parenthood affiliate states, ``Novogenix will \n     reimburse [the Planned Parenthood affiliate] for reasonable \n     administrative costs associated with the identification of \n     potential donors, as well as the obtaining of informed \n     consent.''\n       Similarly, in a briefing with Committee staff, Advanced \n     Bioscience Resources (ABR) confirmed that the reimbursement \n     rate at the Planned Parenthood affiliate with which they \n     partner is $60 per patient product of conception. it The \n     contract between ABR and the Planned Parenthood affiliate \n     states:\n\n       [Affiliate] will provide, and ABR will pay the reasonable \n     costs for, services and facilities . . . associated with \n     obtaining consents\n\n[[Page H6102]]\n\n     and with the removal of fetal organs and tissues from POCs \n     [products of conception], and their processing, preservation, \n     quality control, transportation, and storage; including \n     appropriate space in which ABR employees can work, disposal \n     services for non-used portions of cadaveric materials, and \n     for seeking consent for donation of tissues and organs from \n     appropriate donors, and maintaining records of such consents \n     so that verification of consent can be supported.\n\n\n C. There Is No Evidence That Planned Parenthood Physicians Conducted \n        Intact Dilation and Evacuation To Preserve Fetal Tissue\n\n       To date, the Committee has received no evidence that any \n     physician employed by Planned Parenthood affiliates has \n     performed an ``intact'' dilation and evacuation (D) to \n     preserve fetal tissue for research. CMP claims suggesting \n     that Planned Parenthood physicians are violating the Partial \n     Birth Abortion Act in order to preserve fetal tissue for \n     research appear to have no basis in fact.\n       There are three primary methods of surgical abortion: D, \n     induction of labor, and hysterotomy. D is the only method \n     available at Planned Parenthood facilities. In a briefing \n     with Committee staff, Dr. McDonald-Mosley stated to the \n     Committee that the confusion over ``intact'' fetuses is the \n     result of deceptive video editing by CMP, and that she \n     believes that the ``intactness'' that Planned Parenthood \n     staff are referring to is the intactness of the tissue and \n     specific organs. She noted that during most procedures, such \n     as a D, the fetus is not delivered intact. She stated there \n     is no evidence that Planned Parenthood staff are removing the \n     fetus in an intact manner.\n       Similarly, Dr. Nucatola explained that it would be rare for \n     a patient to be sufficiently dilated to deliver an intact \n     fetus. When questioned whether it was possible to do a D \n     resulting in an intact fetus, she stated that while possible, \n     no Planned Parenthood physician would intentionally perform \n     such a procedure because to do so would be illegal.\n       Representatives of all three TPOs also stated to the \n     Committee that the donated fetal tissue specimens they \n     receive do not include intact fetuses.\n\n\nD. There Is No Evidence That Planned Parenthood Physicians Altered the \nTiming, Method, Or Procedure Solely for the Purpose of Obtaining Fetal \n                          Tissue for Research\n\n       To date, the Committee has not obtained any evidence that \n     Planned Parenthood physicians altered the timing, method, or \n     procedure of an abortion solely for the purpose of obtaining \n     fetal tissue for research. The law requires physicians to \n     certify that ``no alteration of the timing, method, or \n     procedures used to terminate the pregnancy was made solely \n     for the purposes of obtaining the tissue.'' Although this \n     section of the law applies only to federally funded research \n     involving transplantation of human fetal tissue for \n     therapeutic purposes, Planned Parenthood has voluntarily \n     incorporated the principles of the law into its tissue \n     donation guidance. The PPFA May 2015 guidance instructs \n     affiliates that ``[i]t must be documented that no substantive \n     alteration in the timing of terminating the pregnancy or of \n     the method used was made for the purpose of obtaining the \n     blood and/or tissue.''\n       There are limited methods of abortion. At Planned \n     Parenthood affiliates, there are two methods of an early \n     abortion: (1) a medication abortion, and (2) surgical \n     abortion involving mechanical or manual aspiration. For \n     abortions after approximately 13 weeks gestation, the only \n     surgical abortion method available at a Planned Parenthood \n     facility is D A physician's decision about which method to \n     use is made in consultation with the patient.\n       PPFA has not identified any cases in which changes in \n     methods for abortions were made for the purposes of fetal \n     tissue donation. It is reasonable for providers to make small \n     adjustments in technique for clinical reasons, and such small \n     adjustments would not constitute a change in method or \n     procedure. As is common across the medical profession, \n     techniques are different for each physician, and physicians \n     commonly make clinical judgments to adjust their approach in \n     the course of a surgery.\n       Dr. Nucatola confirmed that changing the position of the \n     fetus is not a change in the method or procedure; instead, it \n     often needs to be done for patient safety. Although she does \n     not personally change the position of the fetus in her \n     practice, she believes that some physicians may need to \n     convert the fetus to breech position in order to perform the \n     abortion procedure safely; it is a matter of skill and \n     experience.\n       All Planned Parenthood staff emphasized that patient safety \n     is their top priority. Dr. McDonald-Mosley stated, ``The \n     ultimate goal is the safety of the patient.'' Dr. Nucatola \n     said, ``Patient safety comes first.'' PPFA's August 27, 2015, \n     letter reiterated the same message: ``Our patient's health is \n     our paramount concern.''\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. These heavily edited videos that my friends keep on \nreferring to, again, I think is just a cover for what really is behind \nall of this, and that is their attempt to criminalize and outlaw \nabortion in all circumstances.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York \n(Ms. Slaughter), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on \nRules.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I thank my colleague, Mr. McGovern, for yielding me \nthe time.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today in defense of Planned Parenthood, an \norganization that for nearly 100 years has been the only accessible and \naffordable health care for millions of Americans, men and women.\n  Yet again, we find ourselves debating a bill that has no chance of \nbecoming law, that attacks women and their healthcare decisions, and \nthat distracts from what we should be doing: a budget to keep the \ngovernment funded, which the majority shows no interest in moving \nforward.\n  Instead, we are rehashing old bills that we have seen many times \nbefore. These Republican broadsides fly in the face of the millions of \nwomen across the country and undermine the health and well-being of \npoor and rural women, who, in most cases, have no place else to turn \nexcept to Planned Parenthood for basic medical treatment.\n  Need I remind the Chamber that one in five American women has relied \non a Planned Parenthood health center for care in her lifetime, as my \ncolleague said, more than 90 percent of which is for preventive care: \ncervical cancer screenings, breast cancer screenings, and even HIV \ncounseling?\n  There is no other medical procedure so furiously debated. Do we spend \nyears here debating whether men can get vasectomies during their \nreproductive years? Maybe we should do that because, obviously, we have \ncloaked ourselves in the medical field so that we can make those \npriceless decisions that people should make for themselves. Do we \nthreaten to shut down the government over access to Viagra? No, we \ndon't.\n  This week, I received an email from a local Planned Parenthood \naffiliate about a woman who, when she was 19 years old, went to Planned \nParenthood to get a prescription for birth control. During a routine \nscreening, the doctor found a cluster of abnormal cells that could have \nturned into life-threatening cancer.\n  The woman wrote: ``Early detection and treatment . . . allowed me \nlater in life to have a healthy baby who is the light of my life. \nPlanned Parenthood is the provider I know and trust. Why should \npoliticians tell anyone where they can and cannot go for care? Planned \nParenthood was there for me when I needed affordable, quality health \ncare, and I don't know what I'd have done without their services.''\n  That is what is at stake. In spite of these pleas, Republicans \ncontinue their obsession with attacking women's health--I would think, \nby now, they would know better--and co-opting the most personal \ndecisions of a woman's lifetime.\n  Legislatures across the country, including this one, waste valuable \ntime in pretending to be doctors instead of doing their jobs. \nLegislators do not spontaneously become medical professionals upon \ntheir elections.\n  These constitutionally protected decisions are for women with the \nadvice of their doctors, their families, and anyone she wants to \nconsult, be it her priest or rabbi or pastor.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. What terrible decisions there are to be made between \nmedical personnel and the patient. I don't want anybody to have to say: \nI have to wait until Louise Slaughter gets here because Congress has \nthe last word in whether we live or die.\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North \nCarolina (Mr. Hudson).\n  Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, this debate is not about any one \norganization that receives tax dollars. This isn't about Republicans \nversus Democrats. It is not even about pro-life versus pro-choice. The \nissue before us today, Madam Speaker, is about defending the most \nvulnerable among us.\n  It is about a fundamental question: Will we allow and, indeed, give \nthe people's money to an organization that takes a tiny baby outside \nthe womb--with a beating heart, with lungs that function--and takes a \nscalpel and cuts open the head so that the brain can be extracted and \nsold for profit?\n  That is gruesome--I am sorry--but watch the video. Or are we going to\n\n[[Page H6103]]\n\nsay: Let's suspend the funding to this organization while we \ninvestigate? That is a reasonable position.\n  Any organization that receives Federal funds and that is being \ninvestigated for breaking the law ought to have its funds suspended.\n  My wife, Renee, and I are expecting our first child in just a matter \nof days. So this is an issue that is very personal to me.\n  I would just say to my colleagues: Let's support this legislation and \nmake sure that no baby is ever again cut into pieces and sold for scrap \nparts in this country.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Matsui), a member of the Committee on Energy and \nCommerce.\n  Ms. MATSUI. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule and to stand \nwith millions of American women and men who receive essential health \nservices from Planned Parenthood.\n  These attacks against Planned Parenthood threaten access to health \ncare across this country, particularly for low-income women and men who \nalready face barriers to access.\n  For many of our Nation's underserved populations, Planned Parenthood \nis the only source for vital services, such as contraceptive services \nand counseling and breast and cervical cancer screenings.\n  If the majority succeeds in its effort to defund Planned Parenthood, \nmillions of Americans will be stripped of access to health care, in \nturn, creating hardships for American families.\n  More troubling still is the majority's willingness to shut down the \ngovernment in order to deny health care to millions of women. Women's \nhealth should not be used as a bargaining chip for political messaging.\n  I urge my colleagues to put aside partisan politics driven by \npurposefully misleading videos. Attacking Planned Parenthood is a \ndangerous distraction to the real issues facing American women and \nfamilies.\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nUtah (Mrs. Love).\n  Mrs. LOVE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3134, to defund \nPlanned Parenthood, and H.R. 3504, which requires that babies born \nalive during abortions get the same medical treatment as any other \nchild.\n  It is crucial that we stand for those who cannot speak for \nthemselves: the unborn. These bills are critical to curtailing the \nhorrific practices that include harvesting fetal tissue while babies \nare still alive.\n  We, as Americans, value human life. We are fighting terrorists in \nIran because we value the lives of people. Fighting for the unborn is \nno different.\n  I demand a full investigation into Planned Parenthood's donation of \nfetal tissue and the removal of taxpayer funding for the organization.\n  My colleagues will try to distract, distort, and divide us into \nthinking that this is all about women's health issues. This is, in \nfact, about saving American lives.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that Black Americans make up 12 percent \nof the population and that the fetuses that are being aborted make up \n78 percent of who is being aborted.\n  We must act to protect life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I \nknow my job. Please do yours.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nVermont (Mr. Welch), a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n  Mr. WELCH. I thank the gentleman.\n  Madam Speaker, there are two issues that are very contentious: \nabortion and fetal research. I support the right of a woman to choose. \nI support medical research that is legal under our laws so we can get \ncures for diseases like Alzheimer's and diabetes. I also respect those \nwho disagree with me, but this bill is terrible.\n  Here is why: It is unfair to women who are not part of this debate \nand whose access to Planned Parenthood is about getting preventive \nhealth care, 16,000 women in our State. The second reason is that this \nbill, as designed, is destructive to the institution we represent.\n  Here is how it is designed: One, take the money away and then \ninvestigate. In a fair society, we do it the opposite way.\n  Second, it eliminates access to care for innocent people, who have \nnothing to do with this, as I mentioned, 16,000 in Vermont.\n  Three, it is a prelude to the shutdown, resorting to the tactic of, \nunless you get your way, we are shutting down the entire government.\n  Four, it is part of the ``dump the Speaker'' campaign, as though, if \nthe Speaker resists a shutdown, his job should be taken away.\n  Bad for women. Bad for the institution.\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I stand today in support of the \ninnocent and the unborn. I strongly believe now is the time for \nCongress to stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves.\n  The videos that have been released that expose the appalling acts \ncommitted by Planned Parenthood are horrifying.\n  These are despicable acts that are on par with the sickest of \ncriminals who are behind bars, and that is exactly where these people \nbelong: in prison, behind bars. These videos have given everyone \ninsight into the inexcusable and horrific culture at Planned \nParenthood.\n  Taxpayer funds should never be used to fund or to offset the cost of \nproviding abortions; and it is especially unacceptable when these \nillegal and horrific practices, like the selling and trafficking of \nunborn fetal tissue, are happening.\n  As a father and a grandfather, I believe we must seek justice for \nthese crimes that have been committed.\n  I urge Federal law enforcement to execute a full criminal \ninvestigation into these alleged actions by Planned Parenthood.\n  These two bills being debated today, of which I am a cosponsor, are \nthe necessary next steps. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation and to support life.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).\n  Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, let's be clear. This is not a debate about \nabortion. There are different points of view on that question, but it \nis a settled question by the U.S. Supreme Court. Those who want to make \nthis about something that it is not need to look at the legislation \nthat they are supporting.\n  This is about whether or not families have access through Planned \nParenthood to preventative health care, to lifesaving cancer \nscreenings, to basic health care that ought to be available in every \npossible way. This bill would have an extreme and devastating impact on \naccess to those fundamental services that Planned Parenthood provides.\n  Here we are, 7 legislative days before this government shuts down; \nand what is preoccupying the floor of the House of Representatives \ntoday? An ideological debate that everyone on both sides of the aisle \nacknowledges will not become law.\n  Everyone acknowledges it will not become law, but we are taking time \nto pander to some of the voices that simply oppose women's healthcare \nchoices instead of taking up the questions that the American people \nsent us here to do. Where is the budget? Where are the budget \nnegotiations? Where is the discussion about roads and bridges?\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nAlabama (Mrs. Roby).\n  Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, no taxpayer should be forced to fund an \norganization that aborts more than 350,000 unborn babies every year. \nThis is a commonsense truth that even pro-abortion activists have a \nhard time arguing.\n  Guess what--they changed the argument. They pretend that abortion \ndoesn't exist and that Planned Parenthood is the only place where low-\nincome women can get health care. Taking away taxpayer funding from \nPlanned Parenthood means denying women access to health care, they say.\n  That is untrue, and anybody spreading that should be ashamed. There \nare more than 13,000 federally qualified and rural health centers \nthroughout this country offering low-cost health care\n\n[[Page H6104]]\n\nto women. They outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics 20 to 1.\n  If this was really about making sure women had access to health care, \nwe could all agree right now that supporting these community health \ncenters is the right thing to do; but that is not what this is about.\n  It is because community health centers don't perform abortions; \nPlanned Parenthood does. That is what this is about. It is about \npreserving a pipeline of funding to the Nation's largest abortion \nprovider. We all get this. Let's drop the phony women's health charade.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut (Ms. DeLauro).\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule and the \nunderlying bill. With this bill, the majority has declared war on the \nhealth and well-being of millions of women.\n  Planned Parenthood serves 2.7 million Americans every year with \nlifesaving services, like pap tests, breast exams, screenings for \nsexually transmitted infections. For many low-income families, Planned \nParenthood is their only option.\n  The majority claims that other clinics can take up the slack, but \njust listen to Dr. Mark DeFrancesco, the president of the American \nCongress of OB/GYNs: ``If Planned Parenthood went away, there are a \ngood number of patients just in my service area that no longer will \nhave a doctor. If they start calling my office, it is going to be `we \ncould take you, but it might be 2, 3 months down the road.' And if they \ncall other places, it might be `we can't even take you.' ''\n  This bill creates chaos, and in that chaos, people's lives will be \nput at risk. This bill is spiteful; it is mean spirited, and it is \ncruel. It tells millions of low-income Americans: Forget your health. \nYou can just die.\n  Enough is enough. I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, there are many more options for women's \nhealth care than the discredited abortion provider, Planned Parenthood.\n  While Planned Parenthood is only approximately 665 clinics, federally \nqualified health centers, FQHCs, and rural health centers, RHCs, \nprovide over 13,000 publicly supported locations, providing \nalternatives for women's health care. This means there are 20 federally \nfunded comprehensive care clinics for every one Planned Parenthood.\n  This bill does not change the availability of funds for women's \nhealth. It simply establishes a safeguard so that the Nation's largest \nabortion chain is not the one providing such services.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nLoudermilk).\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, there comes a time when we must face \nthe truth, regardless of how disgusting or offensive that truth is. As \nmuch as we dislike where we are and the shame the harvesting of baby \nparts has brought on our Nation, we are the ones who must face this \ntruth and take action.\n  Some who oppose this bill and other actions this Congress may take \nstate that defunding this or other organizations will not completely \nstop these horrific acts, and that may be true.\n  Did our involvement in World War II against Hitler end anti-Semitism? \nNo, it didn't. Did our government's decision to take out Osama bin \nladen end terrorism? No, it didn't. How many innocent lives were spared \nbecause we did take action?\n  The question before us is not whether our actions will stop this \nevil, but if this government will continue to fund it, sanction it, and \ntolerate it.\n  For years, William Wilberforce fought against the evil of slavery, \nand he challenged his fellow countrymen with these words: ``You may \nchoose to look the other way, but you can never say that you did not \nknow.''\n  If we know the truth, which we do, and decide not to respond, we \nwill, in part, share the blame, share the responsibility, and share in \nthe judgment.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in \nopposition.\n  These bills today are the direct result of a series of videos that \nhave been found to be purposefully misleading, alleging misdeeds that \nnever happened that will result in the punishment of millions of women \nwho have absolutely nothing to do with it.\n  In many areas of this country, Planned Parenthood clinics are one of \nthe few affordable healthcare options for women.\n  During the Senate debate on defunding, a letter was introduced from \nCalifornia's community health centers, stating in no uncertain terms \nthat defunding the Planned Parenthood clinics would place untenable \nstress on the community healthcare providers, but our Republican \ncolleagues are indifferent to the experts.\n  Truth, as usual, is the first casualty when they wage their cultural \nwars; and all that matters is the theater, their bizarre kabuki \ntheater, of ritualized outrage.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule and on the underlying \nbill.\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith).\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I thank Virginia Foxx, who is \na tremendous leader for life and a great leader in this Congress, for \nyielding.\n  Mr. McGovern said we are wasting our time. Mr. Kildee talked about \npandering, which I think is an insult.\n  I would just like to ask Mr. McGovern: Yes or no, has the gentleman \nwatched the videos?\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Yes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Yes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. The gentleman has?\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Yes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Okay. It is disappointing then that the \ngentleman is not moved to compassion over the terrible inhumanity \ndisplayed on those videos by the Planned Parenthood personnel.\n  Madam Speaker, human dismemberment is a painful and absolutely \nfrightening way for anyone to die, but in Planned Parenthood clinics \nacross the country, such violence against children is commonplace.\n  Subsidized by half-a-billion dollars annually, Planned Parenthood \nkills a baby every 2 minutes, snuffing out the lives of over 57 million \ninfants since 1973, a staggering loss of life, a staggering loss of \nchildren.\n  Madam Speaker, now, because of undercover videos by The Center for \nMedical Progress, we know Planned Parenthood is also trafficking in \nbaby parts, turning babies into human guinea pigs while making the \nabortion industry even richer than before.\n  Although much of the media continues to ignore this scandal, Planned \nParenthood's meticulously crafted facade of care and compassion has \nbeen shredded. Caught on tape, Planned Parenthood's top leadership, not \ninterns or lower-level employees, show callous disregard for children's \nlives while gleefully calculating the financial gain.\n  This begs the question: Do Americans really know what horrors are \ndone to children in Planned Parenthood clinics? Have congressional \ncolleagues and has President Obama watched the videos yet?\n  In one clip, Dr. Deborah Nucatola, senior director of Planned \nParenthood Federation of America's Medical Services and a late-term \nabortionist herself says on camera:\n\n       We have been very good at getting heart, lung, liver \n     because we know that, I am not going to crush that part. I am \n     going to basically crush below, I am going to crush above, \n     and I am going to see if I can get it all intact. . . . I \n     would say a lot of people want liver; and for that reason, \n     most providers will do this case under ultrasound guidance, \n     so they will know where they are putting their forceps.\n\n  In other words, crush the baby to death, but do it in a way that \npreserves organs and body parts for sale.\n  Planned Parenthood's medical directors council president, Dr. Mary \nGatter, appears on the video nonchalantly talking about utilizing \n``less crunchy'' abortion methods, again, to preserve body parts.\n  Regarding the price tag for baby body parts, she says, ``Let me just \nfigure out what others are getting and, if this is in the ballpark, \nthen, it is fine. If it is still low, we can bump it up,'' that is, the \nprice. ``I want a Lamborghini,'' she says.\n\n[[Page H6105]]\n\n  Planned Parenthood's national director for the Consortium of Abortion \nProviders, Deborah VanDerhei, says, ``We are just trying to figure out \nas an industry''--abortion is an industry--``how we are going to manage \nremuneration because the headlines would be a disaster''--concern for \nmaking money and avoiding bad press, no concern whatsoever for the \nchild victim.\n  Holly O'Donnell, a tissue procurement technician for StemExpress, a \nbiotech company that partners with Planned Parenthood, says some women \nundergoing abortions did not give consent for these baby body parts to \nbe trafficked.\n  She says on the video, ``Pregnancy tests are potential pregnancies, \ntherefore, potential specimens.'' They think of the pregnancy test as a \nway of getting more specimens, so it is just taking advantage of the \nopportunity.\n  O'Donnell also says how her supervisor told her to cut through the \nface of a baby in order to get brain tissue. ``She gave me the scissors \nand told me that I had to cut down the middle of the face. I can't even \ndescribe what that feels like,'' she says on tape.\n  H.R. 3134, made in order under this rule, authored by an \nextraordinarily caring and compassionate Member of Congress, Diane \nBlack of Tennessee, places a yearlong moratorium on funding for Planned \nParenthood and redirects withheld monies to other facilities that \nprovide women's health.\n  Madam Speaker, the videos have also brought into sharp focus the fact \nthat some babies actually survive abortions.\n  Dr. Savita Ginde, vice president and medical director of Planned \nParenthood Rocky Mountains, confesses:\n\n       Sometimes we get--if someone delivers before we get to see \n     them for a procedure then they, the baby, are intact.\n\n  That means born alive. That means born alive.\n  ``The fetus just fell out,'' she says. It just fell out. It, the \nbaby, fell out. What happens to that baby? Tragically, we know what \nhappens. They are killed, and some of their organs are stolen.\n  The second bill made in order by the rule--the Born-Alive Abortion \nSurvivors Protection Act, authored by pro-life champion Trent Franks--\nsimply says any child who survives an abortion must be given the same \ncare as any other premature baby born at the same gestational age. The \nnew bill builds on the landmark Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of \n2002, authored by Steve Chabot, by ending important enforcement \nprohibitions.\n  I would remind my colleagues that it was just 2 years ago that the \ninfamous Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell was convicted of \nkilling children, as well as women in his clinics, but children who \nwere born alive after an attempted abortion.\n  The grand jury report describes his practice--and I read the entire \nreport; you ought to read it--Gosnell had a simple solution for \nunwanted babies he delivered. He killed them. He didn't call it that. \nHe called it ``ensuring fetal demise.'' He called it ``snipping.''\n  Support these two bills, I say to my colleagues.\n  Mr. Speaker, human dismemberment is a painful and absolutely \nfrightening way for anyone to die but in Planned Parenthood clinics \nacross the country, such violence against children is commonplace and \nusual.\n  Subsidized by half a billion taxpayer dollars annually, Planned \nParenthood kills a baby every two minutes, snuffing out the lives of \nover seven million infants since 1973--a staggering loss of children.\n  Now, because of undercover videos by the Center for Medical Progress, \nwe know Planned Parenthood is also trafficking in baby body parts--\nturning babies into human guinea pigs while making the abortion \nindustry even richer than before.\n  Although much of the media continues to ignore this scandal, Planned \nParenthood's meticulously crafted facade of care and compassion has \nbeen shredded. Caught on tape, Planned Parenthood's top leadership--not \ninterns or lower level employees--show callous disregard for children's \nlives while gleefully calculating the financial gain.\n  Which begs the question: do Americans really know what horrors are \ndone to children in Planned Parenthood clinics?

Regarding \nthe pricetag for baby body parts she says: ``let me just figure out \nwhat others are getting, and if this is in the ballpark, then its fine, \nif it's still low, then we can bump it up. I want a Lamborghini.''\n  Planned Parenthood's National Director for the Consortium of Abortion \nProviders Deborah VanDerhei says ``we're just trying to figure out as \nan industry . . . how we're going to manage remuneration because the \nheadlines would be a disaster''. Concern for making money and avoiding \nbad press--no concern whatsoever for the child victim.\n  Holly O'Donnell, a tissue procurement technician for StemExpress, a \nbiotech company that partners with Planned Parenthood says some women \nundergoing abortions did not give consent: ``. . .'' there were times \nwhen they would just take (the body parts) what they wanted. And these \nmothers didn't know. On the video, Ms. O'Donnell says: ``Pregnancy \ntests are potential pregnancies, therefore potential specimens. So it's \njust taking advantage of the opportunities.''\n  O'Donnell also tells how her supervisor told her to cut through the \nface of a baby in order to get brain tissue. ``She gave me the scissors \nand told me that I had to cut down the middle of the face.

Or at least I hope he would.\n  Mr. Speaker, the videos have again brought into sharp focus the fact \nthat some babies actually survive abortion.\n  Dr. Savita Ginde, Vice President and Medical Director of Planned \nParenthood Rocky Mountains confesses that ``Sometimes, we get--if \nsomeone delivers before we get to see them for a procedure then they \n(the baby) are in intact . . .'' A fetal tissue broker describes \nwatching a ``fetus . . . just fell out.''\n  It just fell out. It, the baby, fell out, she says. And then what \nhappened to that baby?\n  Tragically, we know what happens to these victimized babies--they are \nkilled and some have their organs stolen.\n  So the second bill made in order by the rule--The Born Alive Abortion \nSurvivors Protection Act (H.R. 3504)--authored by pro-life champion \nTrent Franks, simply says any child who survives an abortion must be \ngiven the same care as any other premature baby born at the same \ngestational age. The new bill builds on the landmark Born Alive Infant \nProtection Act of 2002 authored by Steve Chabot by adding important \nenforcement provisions.\n  I would remind my colleagues that it was just two years ago the \ninfamous Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell was convicted of \nmurder for killing children who were born alive after an attempted \nabortion. The Grand Jury report described his practices, ``Gosnell had \na simple solution for the unwanted babies he delivered: he killed them. \nHe didn't call it that. He called it ``ensuring fetal demise.'' The way \nhe ensured fetal demise was by sticking scissors into the back of the \nbaby's neck and cutting the spinal cord. He called that ``snipping.''\n  Gosnell's grisly after-birth abortion practices were only exposed \nwhen he was investigated for illegal drug charges and, in the words of \nthe Grand Jury ``the search team discovered fetal remains haphazardly \nstored throughout the clinic--in bags, milk jugs, orange juice cartons, \nand even in cat-food containers. Some fetal remains were in a \nrefrigerator, others were frozen.''\n  Last week Gianna Jessen an abortion survivor, told the House \nJudiciary Committee:\n   ``My biological mother was seven and a half months pregnant when she \nwent to Planned Parenthood, who advised her to have a late-term saline \nabortion.\n   ``This method of abortion burns the baby inside and out, blinding \nand suffocating the child, who is then born dead, usually within 24 \nhours.\n   ``Instead of dying, after 18 hours of being burned in my mother's \nwomb, I was delivered\n\n[[Page H6106]]\n\nalive in an abortion clinic in Los Angeles on April the 6th, 1977. My \nmedical records state: ``Born alive during saline abortion'' at 6 am.\n   ``Thankfully, the abortionist was not at work yet. Had he been \nthere, he would have ended my life with strangulation, suffocation, or \nleaving me there to die. Instead, a nurse called an ambulance, and I \nwas rushed to a hospital. Doctors did not expect me to live.\n   ``I did. I was later diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy, which was caused \nby a lack of oxygen to my brain while surviving the abortion. I was \nnever supposed to hold my head up or walk. I do. And Cerebral Palsy is \na great gift to me.\n  Gianna asked the committee,\n   ``If abortion is about women's rights, then what were mine? You \ncontinuously use the argument, `If the baby is disabled, we need to \nterminate the pregnancy,' as if you can determine the quality of \nsomeone's life. Is my life less valuable due to my Cerebral Palsy?\n   ``You have failed, in your arrogance and greed, to see one thing: it \nis often from the weakest among us that we learn wisdom--something \nsorely lacking in our nation today. And it is both our folly and our \nshame that blinds us to the beauty of adversity.''\n  Gianna Jesson's reminds us that we have a duty to protect the weakest \nand most vulnerable.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let me just state three facts here: We \nknow that these videos that have been mentioned have been selectively \nedited; we know for a fact that 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood \ndoes is preventive care, including screenings for cervical cancer, \nnothing to do with abortion; and we know for a fact, because it is the \nlaw, that no taxpayer dollars can be used to pay for abortion.\n  Having said that, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon \n(Ms. Bonamici).\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the \nunderlying bills. This closed rule makes in order misguided legislation \nthat would seriously limit access to crucial healthcare services, like \ncancer screenings, and limit access to contraception that would prevent \nunwanted pregnancies.\n  We are talking about defunding Planned Parenthood? How \ncounterproductive. In my home State of Oregon, more than 72,000 \npatients were served by Planned Parenthood in 2013 alone. We are \ntalking about real women and men who received compassionate, preventive \ncare. I have heard from Oregonians like Stacy, who went to Planned \nParenthood and got a lifesaving cancer screening when she had no \ninsurance.\n  It is unfortunate that the House is using its limited time to debate \nlegislation that harms women, but it is downright irresponsible to even \nconsider shutting down the government over access to these vital \nservices. There is no evidence that Planned Parenthood has broken any \nlaws.\n  We have seen proposals like this before. It is time to end these \nattacks on women's constitutional reproductive rights. I urge my \ncolleagues to reject this rule and other legislation that limits access \nto vital healthcare services.\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  My colleagues have asked for an investigation into The Center for \nMedical Progress, which released these videos. The Center for Medical \nProgress does not receive half a billion in taxpayer dollars every \nyear; Planned Parenthood does. It is the role of Congress to exercise \noversight on those who receive taxpayer dollars. It is also appropriate \nfor Congress to cease funding a scandal-ridden organization.\n  It is extremely interesting to hear my colleagues across the aisle \ntalk about investigating the creators of these videos. If only there \nwas such enthusiasm for oversight on other issues, such as ObamaCare \nimplementation, immigration executive orders, and Hillary Clinton's \nrefusal to share her actions on Benghazi.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nher remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I would not be here on the floor to \nlend suspicion to the faithfulness of anyone, but as evidenced by what \nwe have been hearing from our friends on the other side of the aisle, \nthis is nothing but a politically charged debate and an undermining of \nwomen's health care.\n  We made it very clear in the Committee on the Judiciary that Roe v. \nWade is the law of the land. We know that because the Texas Supreme \nCourt, in 2014 and 2015, rolled back the Texas law that was going to \nclose a number of clinics evidencing and providing for women's health \ncare. Planned Parenthood provides for 378,000 pap tests and 487,000 \nbreast exams. 87,000 women found out they had cancer through Planned \nParenthood.\n  As it relates to the fetal tissue, we know that there are laws in \nplace that do not allow the sale of such, but we also know the fetal \ntissue research has generated spinal cord, neurological research and \ncures.\n  Therefore, let me say to my colleagues, the law of the land is Roe v. \nWade. This is a protracted political fight, and I would only say, ask \nthe person who filmed these particular videos. He stole the identity of \nhis high school classmate to do this underhanded work. That shows you \nthat this is a political effort.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Rule and the \nunderlying bills.\n  I strongly oppose this latest attempt by the Republican House \nmajority to defund Planned Parenthood and undermine women's right to \nmake their own choices regarding their reproductive healthcare.\n  Instead of spending time fueling a politically-charged attack on \nAmerica's leading provider of reproductive health care services for \nwomen, and attempting to roll back women's constitutionally protected \nrights, this House should be advancing legislation that will reform our \ntruly broken immigration and criminal justice systems.\n  We are brought here today to examine the practices and procedures of \nPlanned Parenthood. Yet, tellingly, the Majority has failed to reach \nout or obtain any direct information or witnesses from Planned \nParenthood.\n  The bills before us are offered not for the purpose of exposing any \nwrongdoing of Planned Parenthood, but simply to sensationalize \nopposition to abortion and serve as a political decoy to shut down our \ngovernment.\n  The United States Supreme Court ruled over 40 years ago, in Roe v. \nWade (410 U.S. 113 (1973)), that a woman's constitutional right to \nprivacy includes her right to abortion.\n  Since this landmark decision, abortion rates and risks have \nsubstantially declined, as have the number of teen and unwanted \npregnancies.\n  Restricting all access to reproductive and women's health services \nonly exacerbates a woman's risk of an unintended pregnancy and fails to \naccomplish any meaningful overthrow of Roe v. Wade.\n  In recent years, state policymakers have passed hundreds of \nrestrictions on abortion care under the guise of protecting women's \nhealth and safety. Fights here in Congress have been no different.\n  In my state of Texas a law that would have cut off access to 75 \npercent of reproductive healthcare clinics in the state was challenged \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014 and 2015.\n  On October 2, 2014, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional \na Texas law that required that all reproductive healthcare clinics that \nprovided the full range of services would be required to have a \nhospital-style surgery center building and staffing requirements.\n  This requirement meant that only 7 clinics would be allowed to \ncontinue to provide a full spectrum of reproductive healthcare to \nwomen.\n  Texas has 268,580 square miles, only second in size to the state of \nCalifornia.\n  The impact of the law in implementation would have ended access to \nreproductive services for millions of women in my state.\n  In 2015, the State of Texas once again threatened women's access to \nreproductive health care when it attempted to shutter all but 10 \nhealthcare providers in the state of Texas.\n  The Supreme Court once again intervened on the behalf of Texas women \nto block the move to close clinics in my state.\n  It seems every month we are faced with a new attack on women's access \nto reproductive health care, often couched in those same terms.\n   And in fact we are here today supposedly to talk about the safety of \nmedical care provided by Planned Parenthood.\n   But we know that's not really the case.\n   If my colleagues were so concerned about women's health and safety, \nthey would be promoting any one of the number of evidence-based \nproactive policies that improve women's health and well-being.\n   Instead, they are attacking Planned Parenthood in a back-handed \nattempt to ban abortion.\n   That is their number one priority. This is certainly not about \nprotecting women's health, it's about politics.\n\n[[Page H6107]]\n\n   Just as the 1988 Human Fetal Tissue Transplantation Research Panel \n(or the Blue Ribbon Commission) sought to separate the question of \nethics of abortion from the question of ethics of using fetal tissue \nfrom legal elective abortions for medical research when laying the \nfoundation for the 1993, NIH Health Revitalization Act (which passed \noverwhelmingly with bipartisan support), we must separate the personal \nviews of abortion from the legal issues of federal compliance.\n   Namely, the NIH Health Revitalization Act prohibits the payment or \nreceipt of money or any other form of valuable consideration for fetal \ntissue, regardless of whether the program to which the tissue is being \nprovided is funded or not.\n   A limited exception, and crux of the applicable issue of legality, \nlies with the provision allowing for reimbursement for actual expenses \n(e.g. storage, processing, transportation, etc.) of the tissue.\n   Planned Parenthood repeatedly maintains and supports that their \naffiliates involved with fetal tissue research comply with this \nrequirement.\n   In fact, of the 700+ affiliate health care centers across the \ncountry, only 4 Planned Parenthood affiliates currently offer tissue \ndonation services and of those 4, only 2 (California and Washington) \noffer fetal tissue donation services--that's 1 percent of all Planned \nParenthood service centers.\n   The California affiliate receives a modest reimbursement of $60 per \ntissue specimen and the Washington affiliate receives no reimbursement.\n   It is worth noting that fetal tissue has been used for decades.\n   Since the 1920's researchers have used fetal tissue to study and \ntreat various neurological disorders, spinal cord injuries, diabetes, \nimmune deficiencies, cancers and life-threatening blood diseases.\n   One of the earliest advances with fetal tissue was to use fetal \nkidney cells to create the first poliovirus vaccines, which are now \nestimated to save 550,000 lives worldwide every year.\n   The most widely known application in the field of human fetal tissue \ntransplantation has been the treatment of Parkinson's disease.\n   Many of our other common vaccines, such as polio, measles, chicken \npox, rubella and shingles, have been developed through the use of fetal \ntissue or cell lines derived from fetal tissue.\n   When looking at the 1 percent of health care providers involved in \nfetal tissue donation and research, and no clear credible proof of \nillegal activity, it is obvious that attacks on Planned Parenthood are \nwholly misguided.\n   Planned Parenthood has one of the most rigorous Medical standards \nand accreditation processes in the country.\n   It is the only national provider that has developed a single set of \nevidence-based Medical Standards and Guidelines that define how health \ncare is provided throughout the country.\n   Guidelines are developed and updated annually by a group of \nnationally-renowned experts, physicians, and scientists, including \nmedical experts from Harvard and Columbia.\n   Planned Parenthood affiliates must submit to accreditation reviews \nthat include 100 indicators (or high level areas of review) and over \n600 individual Elements of Performance (or measures for review). Half \nof these relate to the provision of medical care and patient safety.\n   Planned Parenthood has strict requirements regarding compliance with \nall federal, state, and local laws and regulations. A specific area of \ncompliance is with mandatory reporting laws and regulations regarding \nreporting in instances where the welfare of a minor is endangered.\n   All staff with patient contact are rigorously trained regarding \ncompliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations governing \nservice to minors.\n   Violations of mandatory reporting regulations are subject to \ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n   It is no secret that the Center for Medical Progress is an extreme \nanti-choice organization with a goal of outlawing legal abortion \nprocedures in this country.\n   To achieve that goal, they have shamelessly targeted Planned \nParenthood and the funding that provides healthcare services to \nmillions of women every year.\n   They continue to use deceptive tactics and secret videos to try and \nundermine Planned Parenthood.\n   Just like Live Action, the Center for Medical Progress is not a \ngroup that can be taken credibly.\n   The Center for Medical Progress is simply recreating a history of \ndoctoring and manipulating video intended to create misimpressions \nabout Planned Parenthood.\n   It is a coordinated effort by anti-choice forces--not only on \nPlanned Parenthood or a woman's right to choose, but on women's health \ncare across the board.\n   At the same time, national media is reporting about a major \ncoordinated push by anti-choice groups and Members of Congress to \ndefund Planned Parenthood.\n   This coordinated effort to defund Planned Parenthood is an assault \non all progressive health care, service, and advocacy organizations who \naim to provide vital care and services to women and men across this \ncountry.\n   The public is standing by Planned Parenthood, which plays a vital \nrole in defending women's health and rights.\n   Hundreds of thousands have already spoken up, including leading \ngroups and communities such as the growing voice of our millennial \ngeneration.\n   My colleagues should be doing more to connect our youth and women to \nservices that help them reduce their risk of unintended pregnancies and \nSTD's, and improve their overall health through preventative \nscreenings, education and planning, rather than restricting their \naccess to lawfully entitled family planning and private health \nservices.\n   I urge all Members to vote against the rule and the underlying \nbills.\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. May I inquire of the gentlewoman from North Carolina \nhow many more speakers she has on her side?\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I am expecting one more speaker that I am \ntrying to accommodate. However, if the gentleman is prepared to close, \nthen I will do my best to do that also.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I am going to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question. If \nwe do, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up legislation \nthat would treat wildfires like similar major natural disasters and \neliminate the need to transfer funds from forest management and \nconservation programs for fire suppression. It is time to make \ncommonsense changes to the Federal wildfire budget.\n  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous materials, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Roby). Is there objection to the \nrequest of the gentleman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, the bills that the rule will make in \norder that are before us today, these bills and others are ongoing \nattacks that are part of the Republican drumbeat for a government \nshutdown over women's healthcare choices. It isn't enough to attack \nwomen's health. Republicans are now willing to take down the entire \nFederal Government in their political attacks.\n  As I mentioned at the outset in my opening statement, the facts are \nthe facts; and I know for some of my colleagues, they are inconvenient \nand they like to avoid talking about them, but the reality is that \nthese videos that my colleagues are referring to have been selectively \nedited.\n  We also know that 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does is \npreventive care: cervical cancer screenings, important lifesaving \nprocedures that benefit women. They do preventive care that benefits \nmen as well.\n  It is also important for my colleagues to realize that there are no \nFederal funds, no taxpayer dollars that go to fund abortion. That is \nillegal. That is the law of the land. That is the Hyde amendment.\n  To shut down these important preventive healthcare services, to kind \nof advance this agenda that my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have, which is to criminalize abortion under all circumstances--\nincluding, many of my colleagues advocate no exceptions even for rape \nor incest. A young girl who was a victim of rape or incest would be a \ncriminal if she had an abortion.\n  This is all about taking away a woman's right to choose. That is what \nthis is all about. Planned Parenthood happens to be the pawn, the \nlatest pawn in this debate.\n  It is interesting. I watched the Republican debate last night. It was \nreally quite entertaining. I heard Donald Trump and Marco Rubio and Ted \nCruz say that they would be open to putting civil rights activist Rosa \nParks on the $10 bill, but Republicans might be surprised to learn that \nRosa Parks sat on the national board of Planned Parenthood Federation \nof America, the organization that my Republican friends, including the \npeople who invoked her\n\n[[Page H6108]]\n\nname last night, are now trying to defund.\n  This is about preserving access to good, quality health care, and I \nreally regret the fact that this has become such a political wedge \nissue in this Congress, but I get it. I know where my colleagues are \ncoming from. That you would take up the time of this House to do this, \nwhich the Senate won't take up and which the President wouldn't sign \neven if they did, at a time when we have 6 legislative days left before \nthe Federal Government shuts down, I don't know what my colleagues are \nthinking.\n  Part of what your job is is to keep this government running; and \ninstead of doing that, we are doing these rightwing message bills that \ndon't even go through regular order, that committees of jurisdiction \ndon't even have a chance to consider, when every Member, Republican or \nDemocrat, is told you can't even amend any of this stuff no matter what \nkind of idea you have.\n  This whole process is disgraceful. We need to get our priorities in \norder here. We ought to protect women's healthcare services; we ought \nnot to be defunding an organization like Planned Parenthood, which does \ngood work all across this country; and we ought to be bringing a bill \nto the floor to keep this government running.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the \nprevious question and vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Last evening when I spoke on this legislation in the Committee on \nRules, I mentioned that this is a very emotional issue for those of us \nwho value life so much. One of my colleagues has already spoken to the \nfundamental issue of life, but I think we always should have time to \ntalk about our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution.\n  Particularly as it relates to this issue, it is the Declaration of \nIndependence which says: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, \nthat all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator \nwith certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, \nand the pursuit of Happiness--That to secure these Rights, Governments \nare instituted among Men.''\n  Madam Speaker, that is what we are talking about here today. We are \ntalking about what our government should be doing in the light of \nknowing that the most vulnerable among us are being destroyed, and that \nwithout life, there is nothing else.\n  Our colleagues keep saying there are things that are more important \nfor us to be debating today. Madam Speaker, I would purport that there \nare few things more important than this debate over the trafficking of \nhearts and other body parts of unborn children, some of whom may have \nbeen born alive.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that this \nlegislation is part of a war on women, but in reality it is designed to \nstop the war on children that is going on in abortion facilities across \nthis country.\n  Large majorities of Americans believe their tax dollars should not go \nto fund abortions. They felt this way even before learning that, during \nthose abortions, children are dismembered and sold piece by piece. It \nis unfathomable that we have to debate stopping the provision of tax \ndollars to organizations participating in such activities. It is also \nunbelievable that we do not immediately pass, by unanimous consent, \nlegislation ensuring that children born alive, breathing and crying, \nlike each of us was on our first day outside the womb, deserve the same \nmedical care that any child born in a hospital would receive.\n  What is heartening, in the face of this contentious debate, is the \nprinciple that the truth always comes out. Abortionists can no longer \nhide in the dark back rooms of their facilities and sell unborn \nchildren piece by piece under an illusion that no one will ever know \ntheir crimes.\n  Our debate today and the videos that have been released have \nshattered that darkness and exposed the callousness of the abortion \nindustry toward life and the consequences of accepting abortion on \ndemand as acceptable. Both of these bills, the Defund Planned \nParenthood Act of 2015 and the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection \nAct, contain commonsense provisions addressing the barbaric actions \nthat have come to light in the abortion industry, and I commend the \nunderlying bills in this rule providing for their consideration to all \nof my colleagues for their support.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:\n\n  An Amendment to H. Res. 421 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     167) to provide for adjustments to discretionary spending \n     under section 251(b)(2) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985 to support wildfire suppression \n     operations, and for other purposes. The first reading of the \n     bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against \n     consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be \n     confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally \n     divided among and controlled by the chair and ranking \n     minority member of the Committee on the Budget, the chair and \n     ranking minority member of the Committee on Agriculture, and \n     the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     Natural Resources. After general debate the bill shall be \n     considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All \n     points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At \n     the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the \n     Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with \n     such amendments as may have been adopted The previous \n     question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and \n     amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 167.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What it Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous\n\n[[Page H6109]]\n\n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Karen L.

Mr. Speaker, as the dean of the Illinois delegation, I \nask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Illinois, the Honorable \nDarin LaHood, be permitted to take the oath of office today.\n  His certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest \nand no question has been raised with regard to his election.\n  The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from \nIllinois?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER. Will Representative-elect LaHood and the members of the \nIllinois delegation present themselves in the well.\n  All Members will rise, and the Representative-elect will please raise \nhis right hand.\n  Mr. LaHOOD appeared at the bar of the House and took the oath of \noffice as follows:\n  Do you solemnly swear that you will support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic; that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; \nthat you take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or \npurpose of evasion; and that you will well and faithfully discharge the \nduties of the office on which you are about to enter, so help you God.\n  The SPEAKER. Congratulations, you are now a Member of the 114th \nCongress.\n\n\n  Welcoming the Honorable Darin LaHood to the House of Representatives\n\n  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nGutierrez) is recognized for 1 minute.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, Darin LaHood is a central Illinois native \nwho was born and raised in Peoria, Illinois. He comes to the U.S. \nCongress after serving over 4 years in the Illinois State Senate. \nBefore that, he was a State and Federal prosecutor; an assistant United \nStates attorney; an assistant State's attorney in Cook County in the \nnarcotics unit; and a felony prosecutor in Tazewell County. He is known \nfor his work fighting terrorism and making America safer.\n  On a personal note, Darin's dad was former Member of the House Ray \nLaHood.\n  I would just like to hasten to add that I can't think of a Member of \nthe House that I love or care for more than Ray LaHood. And I just want \nto say to his son, everybody keeps saying: Who is the new Congressman? \nEverybody says: Well, that is Ray LaHood's son. Well, pretty soon--I \nwant to make everyone know--he is going to be known for a lot more than \nthat. But what a wonderful beginning.\n  I yield to my colleague from the State of Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. I thank my colleague.\n  I don't have much to add. We are glad to have Darin here as a new \nMember of the 114th Congress. Obviously, he is joined by his dad. Also \nwho we had hoped was going to be here--but I know he is watching--is \nformer Minority Leader Bob Michel, who is really part of the LaHood \nclan, and we think of him as we swear in Darin.\n  Darin has already hit the ground running, and I can speak for all my \ncolleagues here, Darin, that we will do all we can to help you be \nsuccessful.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say that I can't \nwait to work with him. And I know very soon that former Congressman Ray \nLaHood is going to be known as his father.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to now welcome the gentleman \nfrom Illinois (Mr. LaHood).\n  Mr. LaHOOD. I thank Speaker Boehner for swearing me in today.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is a true honor to be here. I am humbled and honored \nto be a part of this body. And I want to thank my colleagues--\nCongressman Shimkus, Congressman Gutierrez, and the rest of the \nIllinois delegation--for being here today. I look forward to working \nwith them and being a productive Member of this body.\n  I would just like to thank my constituents that voted for me in this \nspecial election. We worked hard over the last 6 months in this race, \nand I am proud to be entrusted with the responsibility that 710,000 \npeople gave me in my district in Illinois. I am proud of that district, \nand I am proud of my record in the State Senate. Again, I look forward \nto bringing the values that I have had in Illinois to this body.\n  I also want to thank my family. The family is the pride and joy of \nwho I am. I have my three boys up here today--McKay, who is 13; Teddy, \nwho is 8; Lucas, who is 11--and my wife Kristen, who is in the gallery. \nI couldn't do this without her.\n  Kristen, please stand up.\n  I guess I would just say that I look forward to working hard in this \nbody, to meeting my colleagues, doing a lot of listening, and doing a \nlot of learning to be the best Member of Congress I can be.\n  I also want to thank my mom and dad and my extended family for being \nhere.\n  I am proud to be the son of Ray and Kathy LaHood and the values that \nthey instilled in me: faith, family, working hard, remembering where \nyou came from, doing the best job you can for the people you represent, \nand staying grounded in your district.\n  I couldn't be prouder to be here today with the legacy in this \ndistrict going back to Abraham Lincoln; and Bob Michel for 38 years, \nwho I am sorry couldn't be here today. When I think about Bob Michel \nand think about 71 years ago he began his service to this country on \nthe beaches of Normandy and spent 38 years in this body representing \nPeoria, and then he, during his time when Reagan was here, ushered in \nReagan's values to help change this country, to have that legacy means \nso much.\n  I know I have got a lot to learn. I look forward to hitting the \nground running, being the best Member of Congress that I can, and \nworking hard for my district.\n  Thank you very much.\n\n\n                      Announcement by the Speaker\n\n  The SPEAKER. Under clause 5(d) of rule XX, the Chair announces to the \nHouse that, in light of the administration of the oath to the gentleman \nfrom Illinois (Mr. LaHood), the whole number of the House is 435.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Roby). The gentleman from Colorado will \nstate his parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, does this martial law amendment mean that \nany bill next week can be brought up without the 24-hour notice that we \nnormally have to read a bill directly to the floor?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will not interpret the pending \nproposition.\n  Mr. POLIS. Well, Madam Speaker, that is the plain language of this \namendment.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, 5-minute voting will \ncontinue.\n\n[[Page H6111]]\n\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the adoption of the \namendment to House Resolution 420 offered by the gentleman from Georgia \n(Mr. Collins).\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. POLIS.

Pursuant to House \nResolution 420, the bill is considered read.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                H.R. 758\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act \n     of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ATTORNEY ACCOUNTABILITY.\n\n       (a) Sanctions Under Rule 11.--Rule 11(c) of the Federal \n     Rules of Civil Procedure is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``may'' and inserting \n     ``shall'';\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``Rule 5'' and all that \n     follows through ``motion.'' and inserting ``Rule 5.''; and\n       (3) in paragraph (4), by striking ``situated'' and all that \n     follows through the end of the paragraph and inserting \n     ``situated, and to compensate the parties that were injured \n     by such conduct. Subject to the limitations in paragraph (5), \n     the sanction shall consist of an order to pay to the party or \n     parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred as a \n     direct result of the violation, including reasonable \n     attorneys' fees and costs. The court may also impose \n     additional appropriate sanctions, such as striking the \n     pleadings, dismissing the suit, or other directives of a non-\n     monetary nature, or, if warranted for effective deterrence, \n     an order directing payment of a penalty into the court.''.\n       (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act or an \n     amendment made by this Act shall be construed to bar or \n     impede the assertion or development of new claims, defenses, \n     or remedies under Federal, State, or local laws, including \n     civil rights laws, or under the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) \nand the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) each will control 30 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 758, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 758, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, would restore \nmandatory sanctions for frivolous lawsuits filed in Federal Court. Many \nAmericans may not realize it, but today, under what is called rule 11 \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, there is no requirement that \nthose who file frivolous lawsuits pay for the unjustified legal costs \nthey impose on their victims, even when those victims prove to a judge \nthe lawsuit was without any basis in law or fact. As a result, the \ncurrent rule 11 goes largely unenforced, because the victims of \nfrivolous lawsuits have little incentive to pursue additional \nlitigation to have the case declared frivolous when there is no \nguarantee of compensation at the end of the day.\n  H.R. 758 would finally provide light at the end of the tunnel for the \nvictims of frivolous lawsuits by requiring sanctions against the filers \nof frivolous lawsuits, sanctions which include paying back victims for \nthe full costs of their reasonable expenses incurred as a direct result \nof the rule 11 violation, including attorneys' fees.\n  The bill also strikes the current provisions in rule 11 that allow \nlawyers to avoid sanctions for making frivolous claims and demands by \nsimply withdrawing them within 21 days. This change eliminates the free \npass lawyers now have to file frivolous lawsuits in Federal Court.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  The current lack of mandatory sanctions leads to the regular filing \nof lawsuits that are clearly baseless. So many frivolous pleadings \ncurrently go under the radar because the lack of mandatory sanctions \nfor frivolous filings forces victims of frivolous lawsuits to roll over \nand settle the case because doing that is less expensive than \nlitigating the case to a victory in court.\n  Correspondence written by someone filing a frivolous lawsuit, which \nbecame public, concisely illustrates how the current lack of mandatory \nsanctions for filing frivolous lawsuits leads to legal extortion.\n  That correspondence to the victim of a frivolous lawsuit states, ``I \nreally don't care what the law allows you to do. It's a more practical \nissue. Do you want to send your attorney a check every month \nindefinitely as I continue to pursue this?''\n  Under the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, those who file frivolous \nlawsuits would no longer be able to get off scot-free; and, therefore, \nthey could not get away with those sorts of extortionary threats any \nlonger.\n  The victims of lawsuit abuse are not just those who are actually \nsued. Rather, we all suffer under a system in which innocent Americans \neverywhere live under the constant fear of a potentially bankrupting \nfrivolous lawsuit.\n  As the former chairman of The Home Depot company has written, ``An \nunpredictable legal system casts a shadow over every plan and \ninvestment. It is devastating for start-ups. The cost of even one ill-\ntimed abusive lawsuit can bankrupt a growing company and cost hundreds \nof thousands of jobs.''\n  The prevalence of frivolous lawsuits in America is reflected in the \nabsurd warning labels companies must place on their products to limit \ntheir exposure to frivolous claims.\n  A 5-inch brass fishing lure with three hooks is labeled ``Harmful if \nswallowed.'' A Vanishing Fabric Marker warns it ``Should not be used . \n. . for signing checks or any legal documents, as signatures will . . . \ndisappear completely.''\n  A household iron contains the warning ``Never iron clothes while they \nare being worn.'' A piece of ovenware warns ``Ovenware will get hot \nwhen used in oven.'' A hair dryer warns ``Never use while sleeping.''\n\n[[Page H6113]]\n\n  A cardboard car sun shield that keeps sun off the dashboard warns \n``Do not drive with sun shield in place.'' Not to be outdone, a giant \nYellow Pages directory warns ``Do not use this directory while \noperating a motor vehicle.''\n  Here are just a couple of examples of frivolous lawsuits brought in \nFederal court in which judges failed to award compensation to the \nvictims:\n  A man sued a television network for $2.5 million because he said a \nshow it aired raised his blood pressure. When the network publicized \nhis frivolous lawsuit, he demanded the court make them stop.\n  Although the court found the case frivolous, not only did it not \ncompensate the victim, it granted the man who filed the frivolous \nlawsuit an exemption from even paying the ordinary court filing fees.\n  In another case, lawyers filed a case against a parent, claiming the \nparent's discipline of his child violated the Eighth Amendment of the \nConstitution, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment by the \ngovernment, not private citizens. One of the lawyers even admitted to \nsigning the complaint without reading it.\n  The court found the case frivolous, but it awarded the victim only \nabout a quarter of its legal costs because rule 11 currently doesn't \nrequire that a victim's legal costs be paid in full. The Lawsuit Abuse \nReduction Act would change that.\n  In his 2011 State of the Union Address, President Obama said, ``I'm \nwilling to look at other ideas to . . . rein in frivolous lawsuits.''\n  Mr. President, here it is: a one-page bill that would significantly \nreduce the burden of frivolous litigation on innocent Americans.\n  I thank the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Congressman \nLamar Smith, for introducing this simple, commonsense legislation that \nwould do so much to prevent lawsuit abuse and to restore Americans' \nconfidence in the legal system. I urge my colleagues to support it \ntoday.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I was duly impressed with the statement and position of my chairman, \nbut I find it hard to believe it is on this bill because this bill is \nnot a bill that should be passed.\n  This bill is an affront to the judges of this country, to the \nJudicial Conference, and to the American Bar Association.\n  The American Bar Association, a conservative organization, has come \nout against it. The Judicial Conference, made up of predominantly \nappellate judges, headed by Chief Justice Roberts--mostly of \nRepublican-appointed judges--came out against it because it is not \nnecessary.\n  It will clog the courts with unnecessary litigation, cost money, and \nmake it more difficult to get your cases disposed of. It is just \nunnecessary.\n  Indeed, it would amend rule 11, but in such a way that it could have \na serious deleterious effect on civil rights claims as well as to \nincrease the volume and cost of litigation. If this House were a court \nand not a legislative body, rule 11 sanctions could apply here.\n  These concerns are not hypothetical. They are based on actual \nexperience. From 1983 to 1993, there was a version of rule 11 that this \nlaw would reinstate.\n  So all you have to do and all any legislative body ought to do is go \nback and look at what happened in history. These rules were in effect \nfrom 1983 to 1993, taking a judge's discretion away.\n  Judges can order sanctions. They can make sure that those cases that \nwere brought up about reading a phone book and having a wreck are out, \ngone. They can do that.\n  This takes their discretion away, and they have got to give costs and \ncompensation to the other side's lawyers. And then there are hearings \nand all of that stuff.\n  Presently, the court has discretion, and there is a 21-day safe \nharbor provision where an attorney can withdraw or correct any alleged \nsubmissions that were wrong.\n  This requires the courts to award reasonable attorneys' fees and \nother costs. It does not leave it to the discretion of the court.\n  Currently, such awards are entirely at the court's discretion, and \nthey are limited to deterrence purposes, not for the compensation of \nlawyers.\n  Simply put, H.R. 758 will have a deleterious impact on the \nadministration of justice for these reasons:\n  First, civil rights. Think about Brown v. Board of Education. When it \ncame before the court, it was a novel case, and a judge in certain \nplaces, especially in the South in 1954, might have said: Sorry, \nlawyer. You are out of here.\n  The judge would have had no option under this but to grant costs \nagainst the attorney who brought the case, Mr. Marshall, and we might \nnot have ever had Brown v. Board of Education.\n  Civil rights cases comprise 11 percent of Federal cases filed, but \nmore than 22 percent of the cases in which sanctions have been imposed \nfor civil rights cases. H.R. 758 would restore this problem. Just \nimagine that result. There are other cases that are similar.\n\n  The legal arguments in landmark cases where certain novel arguments \nare made that are not based on then-existing law would be affected. \nLitigation would be prolonged and may be too expensive to continue.\n  Secondly, H.R. 758 will also substantially increase the amount, cost, \nand intensity of litigation. Experts in civil procedure are virtually \nunanimous on this point.\n  By making sanctions mandatory and having no safe harbor, the 1983 \nrule spawned a ``cottage industry'' of litigation. There were financial \nincentives to file rule 11s.\n  Prior to the 1983 rule taking effect--this really gets me--there had \nbeen only 19 rule 11 proceedings over the course of 45 years, but in \nthe decade that this rule was in effect, which this bill wants to \nreinstate, there were 7,000 proceedings in 10 years--11 in 45 years and \n7,000 in 10 years. So we are talking about a lot of litigation and \nclogging up of the courts.\n  One-third of all Federal lawsuits were burdened by these satellite \nlitigations that came about because of this rule. It strips the \njudiciary of discretion, and it utterly ignores the thorough process by \nwhich the Federal court rules are usually amended.\n  H.R. 758 overrides this judicial independence by removing the \ndiscretion to impose sanctions and to determine which sanctions might \nbe appropriate. It circumvents the painstakingly thorough Rules \nEnabling Act process that Congress itself established 80 years ago.\n  The 1993 amendments to rule 11 have been a tremendous success. That \nis what this would throw out. As documented by the Judicial Conference \nof the United States, these amendments resulted in a ``marked decline \nin rule 11 satellite litigation without any noticeable increase in \nfrivolous filings.''\n  H.R. 758, however, would undo this. That is why the American Bar \nAssociation and the Judicial Conference oppose it.\n  It is also opposed by the Alliance for Justice, the Center for \nJustice & Democracy, the Consumer Federation of America, the Consumers \nUnion, and Public Citizen.\n  This is a deeply flawed bill that addresses a nonexistent problem. We \nhave this bill, and we have a bill on abortion. It seems like today's \nactions in Congress are Shakespearean, first, ``kill the lawyers,'' \nbut, this time, it is ``kill the judges.'' The other one is ``kill the \ndoctors.''\n  Congress knows the answer. We can tell the judges what they need to \ndo because they are not doing it, and we will tell the doctors what \nthey need to do, and we will tell the women what they need to do. \nUnfortunately, that is what we have come down to, a bad bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to say to the \ngentleman from Tennessee that no judges have to find a frivolous \nlawsuit to be a frivolous lawsuit. They have that discretion in every \ncase.\n  But once they find it to be a frivolous lawsuit, it is injustice to \nnot award attorneys' fees under rule 11 to those who have been wronged \nby being the victims of a frivolous lawsuit.\n  What about the burden on the court?\n  When the mandatory rule 11 sanction provision was in effect for \nalmost 10 years between 1983 and 1993, the number of rule 11 court \nproceedings was easily manageable by the courts.\n  The number of rule 11 court proceedings during that time amounted to \n7.5 reported rule 11 cases per Federal district court per year, or one \nreported decision for each Federal district court\n\n[[Page H6114]]\n\njudge per year, one per judge per year. That is not an unreasonable \nburden on our Federal judiciary to see justice done.\n  Quite frankly, if that were done more often today, we would see a lot \nfewer frivolous lawsuits to begin with and, therefore, fewer requests \nfor attorneys' fees.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nSmith), the author of the legislation, the former chairman of the House \nJudiciary Committee and the current chairman of the House Science, \nSpace, and Technology Committee.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte) for bringing this legislation to the House \nfloor.\n  I appreciate all of his efforts to do so, and I appreciate his taking \nthe initiative on this and on so many other issues as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, known as LARA, is just \nover one-page long, but it would prevent the filing of hundreds of \nthousands of pages of frivolous lawsuits in Federal court.\n  For example, frivolous lawsuits have been filed against The Weather \nChannel for failing to accurately predict storms, against television \nshows people claimed were too scary, and against fast food companies \nbecause inactive children gained weight.\n  In other cases, prison inmates have sued alcohol companies, blaming \nthem for a life of crime. A teacher sought damages from her school \ndistrict based on her fear of children. A father demanded $40 million \nin compensation after his son was kicked off the track team for \nexcessive absenteeism. There are many, many more examples.\n  Frivolous lawsuits have simply become too common. Lawyers who bring \nthese cases have everything to gain and nothing to lose under current \nrules, which permit plaintiffs' lawyers to file frivolous lawsuits, no \nmatter how absurd the claims, without any penalty whatsoever. \nMeanwhile, defendants are often faced with years of litigation and \nsubstantial attorneys' fees.\n  These cases have wrongly cost innocent Americans their reputations \nand their hard-earned dollars. They amount to legalized extortion \nbecause defendants must settle out of court rather than endure a more \nexpensive trial.\n  According to the research firm Towers Watson, the annual direct cost \nof American tort litigation now exceeds over $260 billion a year, or \nover $850 per person.\n  Before 1993, it was mandatory for judges to impose sanctions, such as \norders to pay for the other side's legal expenses when lawyers filed \nfrivolous lawsuits.\n  Then the Civil Rules Advisory Committee, an obscure branch of the \ncourts, made penalties optional. This needs to be reversed by Congress.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  As Chairman Goodlatte noted, even President Obama has expressed a \nwillingness to limit frivolous lawsuits. If the President is serious \nabout stopping these meritless claims, he should support mandatory \nsanctions for frivolous lawsuits to avoid making frivolous promises.\n  LARA requires lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits to pay the \nattorneys' fees and court costs of innocent defendants. It reverses the \nrules that made sanctions discretionary rather than mandatory.\n  Further, LARA expressly provides that no claim under civil rights \nlaws would be affected in any way, and I trust this will address the \nconcerns expressed by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen). I would \nlike to direct his attention to page 2 of the bill, lines 18 to 23, \nwhich explicitly protect civil rights lawsuits.\n  Opponents argue that reinstating mandatory sanctions for frivolous \nlawsuits impedes judicial discretion. This is patently false. Under \nLARA, judges retain the discretion to determine whether or not a claim \nis frivolous. If a judge determines that a claim is frivolous, they \nmust award sanctions. This ensures that victims of frivolous lawsuits \nobtain compensation, but the decision to find a claim frivolous still \nremains with the judge.\n  A report earlier this year from the Administrative Office of the \nUnited States Courts found that civil lawsuits increased by tens of \nthousands last year. Such an increase makes this legislation necessary \nin order to discourage abusive filings, which further strain court \ndockets with lengthy backlogs.\n  The American people are looking for solutions to obvious lawsuit \nabuse. LARA restores accountability to our legal system by reinstating \nmandatory sanctions for attorneys who file these frivolous lawsuits. \nThough it will not stop all lawsuit abuse, LARA encourages attorneys to \nthink twice before filing a frivolous lawsuit.\n  I want to, again, thank Chairman Goodlatte for bringing this much-\nneeded legislation to the House floor, and I ask my colleagues who \noppose frivolous lawsuits and who want to protect hard-working \nAmericans from false claims to support the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act.\n  Now, furthermore, Mr. Speaker, similar bills to this have passed in \nthe last several Congresses, and I hope this legislation will be \napproved today.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for Mr. Smith, as I do \nfor Mr. Goodlatte, but I would submit that the rule of construction, \nnothing in this act or an amendment made by this act, shall be \nconstrued to bar or impede the assertion or development of new claims, \ndefenses, or remedies under Federal, State, or local laws, including \ncivil rights laws or under the Constitution of the United States.\n  That is the same thing as the committee having--if they would have \naccepted the amendment that we offered to specifically exempt civil \nrights laws. That was not accepted.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. COHEN. I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. This particular rule of construction was a \nbipartisan effort led by Bobby Scott, a former member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, to avoid the problem that you are concerned about, and that \nis that this bill in any way would seem to dampen or prohibit civil \nrights legislation.\n  Again, this rule of construction was put in there to address the very \nproblem that the gentleman is concerned about.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, at the same time, I would submit the rule of \nconstruction is not the same thing as if the committee would have \naccepted the amendment offered that said specifically civil rights laws \nwould not be affected by this because you could still offer a rule 11 \nunder this. It just says nothing in this action will be construed to \nborrow or impede the assertion.\n  It doesn't borrow or impede the assertion of a new claim, but it \ndoesn't say the court cannot find a rule 11 violation and then the \nmandatory imposition of costs would take place. It doesn't do what you \nare submitting, I would suggest.\n  The bottom line is the court felt that this wasn't necessary. The \ncourt said, in all those cases he talked about that seem so absurd--I \ndon't understand--and particularly as lawyer--why a lawyer would waste \nhis time doing it because there is no chance of success and no chance \nof remuneration in cases like that.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nCartwright), who can explain easily and in a very facile fashion why \nthose arguments are not good.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I will say, with due deference to \nrespected colleagues from Virginia and Texas, this is a misguided piece \nof legislation.\n  I speak as not only a Member of this House, but also as somebody who \nhas practiced civil litigation for the last 25 years. I have \nrepresented companies, consumers, defendants, and plaintiffs in all \nsorts of civil litigation; and I have done this before and after the \n1993 changes that led to the current rule 11.\n  Where I come out on it is that this really is an attack on the \nFederal judiciary. Yes, they have discretion on whether to decide \nwhether there has been a rule 11 violation of in initio, but this is \nsomething that encourages rule 11 motion litigation.\n  It encourages rule 11 motion practice, and that is why the Federal \njudges oppose it. The Judicial Conference surveyed the Federal judges \nof this Nation, and fully 87 percent of United States district judges \nprefer the current version of rule 11. After all, it already allows \nmonetary sanctions for silly lawsuits.\n\n[[Page H6115]]\n\n  I think something of a false picture was presented a little bit \nearlier, the implication that Federal judges don't have the power to \nimpose monetary sanctions. Court costs and legal fees of the so-called \nvictims of frivolous lawsuits, that is in the current practice of rule \n11. They can do that now.\n  If a Federal judge decides that he or she thinks that a lawsuit has \nbeen frivolous and dismissed, on that basis, they can fully award all \ndefense costs and defense fees. As a result, this is completely \nunnecessary and superfluous legislation. It offends the Federal \njudiciary. After all, we are talking about limiting the discretion of \nFederal judges.\n  Federal judges are folks that are appointed. We work very, very hard \nhere on Capitol Hill in making sure that we appoint only the Federal \njudges who will exercise good discretion, Federal judges that are \ncompletely vetted, who are interviewed, who go through hearing after \nhearing and are very carefully selected here by the United States \nCongress.\n  To say that we cannot and we should not repose full discretion in our \nFederal judges is what is being said here, and I think it is a \nmisguided attempt to take away the discretion of our Federal judges.\n  Not only that, it leads to unnecessary litigation. Everybody in court \nwho ever won a motion or threw out a case thinks that the opposition's \nposition was frivolous.\n  When you say rule 11 sanctions are mandatory, it creates this \ncompulsion to follow up a motion victory with a rule 11 motion: Not \nonly did I win the case, but I want you to pay my attorney's fees and \ncosts.\n  When you make it a mandatory sanction like this, you create this \ncompulsion to file rule 11 motions, and I don't say that out of theory, \nMr. Speaker.\n\n  The truth is that we did have, in that 10-year period, 7,000 rule 11 \nmotions. This is the type of a rule that we lived under for 10 years \nthat this legislation would go back to that spawned all this extraneous \nlitigation. You say: Your position was frivolous, so I am filing a rule \n11 motion.\n  Guess what--rule 11 motions themselves are subject to rule 11 so that \nthey could be frivolous so that the receiving end says: Well, your rule \n11 motion was frivolous, so I am filing my own rule 11 motion against \nyou.\n  That is something that happened.\n  In fact, a United States district judge from the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania, Robert S. Gawthrop, in the suburban Philadelphia area, he \ntermed that ``zombie litigation.'' That is something that gets spawned \nby this type of litigation. We don't need zombie litigation in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I would just ask the gentleman this: What other sorts of legal claims \nshould a victim be able to prove in court--prove in court, but be \ndenied damages by the judge?\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. I am afraid I am not following the gentleman from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. It is a simple question. What other sorts of legal \nclaims should a victim be able to prove in court--because they are \nallowed to do this under rule 11--prove that they have suffered damages \nin court, but be denied those damages by the judge?\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. This is not something that is denied. Judges have \ndiscretion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. COHEN. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that this is \nmisguided legislation.\n  More ominously, it disproportionately hurts the people filing \nclaims--civil rights claims, consumer rights claims--and it has a \nchilling effect on legal innovation. It was legal innovation on the \npart of Thurgood Marshall to come up with Brown v. Board of Education. \nWho are we to chill that kind of legal innovation in this Chamber?\n  For those reasons, I oppose this legislation.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to respond to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania, who was not able to identify a single \nother sort of legal claim where the victim would be able to prove their \ndamages in court, but still be denied those damages by the judge.\n  What I am getting at is that in no other area of the law can a person \nprove to a judge that they are a victim under the standards that define \nthe wrong they have suffered, yet the judge retains the discretion to \nrefrain from compensating the victim of the legal wrong.\n  All this bill does is provide equal treatment by allowing victims of \nfrivolous lawsuits, who prove the lawsuit against them was frivolous, \nthe right to compensation for the harm done to them, just like every \nother victim of a legal wrong.\n  I would continue to ask: In what other area of the law can a person \nprove to the judge they were the victim of a legal wrong and still be \ndenied compensation by the judge?\n  This only occurs after the judge has already found that the lawsuit \nwas frivolous, which would not apply to some of the great cases through \nhistory where courts have found merit to the case. They are not going \nto find it frivolous.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I yield \nto the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  The answer is that, every time somebody with damages proves his or \nher case in front of a jury, the jury has the discretion to award \nwhatever they think is proper damages. For example, if they accept some \nof the damages and reject other parts of the damages, they don't award \nthe full amount, and that is the kind of discretion a Federal judge \nshould retain.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, the judge has that \ndiscretion under current law, has that discretion under this bill, but \nthey don't have the discretion to say they are not going to award any \ndamages where the case is found to be frivolous and, in fact, damages \nhave been incurred.\n  Obviously, the judge has a discretion to determine what those actual \ndamages are, but he doesn't have the discretion to simply say: I am not \ngoing to award damages, even though I found the case to be frivolous.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nFarenthold), a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 758, the \nLawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, commonly called LARA, sponsored by my good \nfriend and colleague from Texas, Mr. Lamar Smith. The legal system in \nthe United States needs to driven by justice, not by dollars.\n  Right now, there are too many lawyers out there throwing their money \nat frivolous lawsuits to manipulate and abuse the system. No one should \nbe able to abuse our system.\n  It is simple to file a lawsuit, and you can cost the defendant \nhundreds of thousands of dollars on a frivolous claim going through \ndiscovery and going through all of the legal processes. That simply \nisn't right.\n  LARA ensures that judges impose monetary sanctions against lawyers \nwho file these frivolous lawsuits, including the costs of attorneys' \nfees incurred by their victims. It prevents bad lawyers from using the \njudicial system as a weapon and provides justice for those who have \nbeen abused by these attorneys.\n  By passing LARA, these attorneys will no longer be able to exert \npower over their victims with these suits that are not based on facts \nor in law, but are merely intended to scare or extort money out of the \nvictims.\n  I remember when I was in law school in Congressman Smith's hometown \nof San Antonio, Texas, and one of the professors in one of my classes \nsaid something that has stuck with me for all these years about a \nlawsuit: You may be able to beat the wrap, but you can't beat the ride.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  LARA helps with that. You are not going to be able to stop the \nemotional\n\n[[Page H6116]]\n\nroller coaster ride the defendant and his family, his partners, his \nemployees, his friends all go through as a result of the lawsuit that \nis frivolous, but you will be able to beat some of the cost of that \nride by holding the attorneys who file frivolous lawsuits responsible \nfor that. That is what we need to do.\n  Frivolous lawsuits drain victims of their money and damage their \nreputations. Let's stop them before they start by putting the lawyers \nat risk for filing frivolous lawsuits.\n  In many countries, there is a loser pay system. We are not proposing \nwe go that far here in the United States, but we do want justice for \nthose who are victims of clearly frivolous lawsuits, and this \nlegislation will make sure that that happens. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), who was a distinguished barrister \nbefore becoming a Congressman.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the so-called \nLawsuit Abuse Reduction Act.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, is Constitution Day. How is the House GOP \ncelebrating Constitution Day? By trampling on our Framers' vision of an \nindependent judiciary as one of three separate but equal branches of \ngovernment.\n  The Framers of our Constitution established an independent judicial \nbranch because they believed the judges should be able to interpret the \nlaw without interference. They believed that only when judges were \nshielded from the influence of politicians and pundits and special \ninterests could they issue rulings fairly and impartially. In short, \nthey worked to create a system that shielded judges from efforts like \nthe one behind today's Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act.\n  This legislation, Mr. Speaker, is nothing more--I repeat, this \nlegislation is nothing more--than a giveaway to corporate special \ninterests that seek to price Americans out of their day in court. The \nbill restores a rule, reimposes a rule that our independent judiciary \nsystem abandoned over 20 years ago because it unfairly disadvantaged \nworkers and consumers and other Americans that dared to take on big \ncorporations in court.\n  Our judges put in place this rule--or kept this version that we use \ntoday of this rule--20 years ago, and they remain strongly in support \nof it today. That is because today's rule, Mr. Speaker, gives judges \nthe flexibility to determine when to apply sanctions against attorneys \nwho file frivolous lawsuits.\n  This legislation flies in the face of our Framers' vision of an \nindependent judiciary. It strips our judges of their discretion, \nimposing congressionally mandated rules that drove up costs and clogged \nour courts when these were the rules before.\n  We don't have to debate the harmful consequences of this legislation \nbecause history has already shown us how the 1983 version of rule 11 \ntipped the scales of justice in favor of those with the deepest \npockets.\n  Mr. Speaker, too often everyday Americans feel that they have got the \ncards stacked against them in our economy and in our elections. Let's \ngive them a fighting chance in the courtroom and reject this frivolous \nbill.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Rohrabacher).\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 758.\n  This is not an attack on the Federal judiciary. This is an attack on \nthose unscrupulous lawyers and con artists who are bilking the American \npeople out of hundreds of millions of dollars that they have had to \nearn and work hard in order to achieve. Our system is out of whack \ntoday, and today we find our honest citizens exposed to this type of \nthreat. This would take care of that somewhat.\n  First, I would like to thank my good friend from Texas, Lamar Smith, \nfor his bill, which I believe is so important, as many small- and \nmedium-sized businesses like we have in California are hit every year \nwith frivolous and abusive lawsuits.\n  I would also like to thank my friends Chairman Trent Franks from \nArizona and especially Chairman Bob Goodlatte from Virginia for their \nleadership on this much-needed legislation.\n  Frivolous lawsuits have cost honest Americans hundreds of millions of \ndollars by encouraging lawyers and scam artists to attack honest \ncitizens, expecting that these honest citizens will opt for a \nsettlement. This is what we call a legal shakedown, and it must be \nended, which is what H.R. 758 intends to do.\n  Let us note that giving in when someone reaches a settlement rather \nthan trying to fight people who have more resources than they do, even \nthough it is a frivolous lawsuit, encourages more people to have more \nlawsuits and encourages certain lawyers to go down a route where they \nare only aimed at trying to use their leverage against honest citizens \nto enrich themselves.\n  I would note that this legislation will go a long way in these \nspecific areas in terms that threaten all Americans, honest citizens, \nbut it especially will take care of another concern that I have had, of \ncourse, and Chairman Goodlatte and Chairman Smith have had, and that is \nit takes care of patent trolls, who are scam artists who use claims of \npatent infringement in their frivolous lawsuits.\n  Other proposed approaches to this problem deal with the problem in a \nway that would hurt legitimate inventors--this is where we have a \nlittle disagreement--but this solution will help these inventors and \nhelp all enterprisers and entrepreneurs. H.R. 758, combined with the \nactions of the FTC and other States on bad faith demand letters, gives \nsmall-business owners the tools they need to fight scam artists, \nincluding patent trolls who attempt to use our judicial process to \nextort America's job creators.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 758. Support those people \nwho are creating jobs throughout our society. Support those people who \ndeserve the protection and are not trying to scam our system.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello).\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, should those filing a \nfrivolous lawsuit be held accountable to the victims of that frivolous \nlawsuit? I think most people would say yes. There are hard-working \nAmericans and small businesses across this country spending tens of \nthousands of dollars, collectively millions of dollars every year \ndefending themselves from frivolous lawsuits.\n  A frivolous lawsuit, as it is defined, has no basis in fact or in \nlaw, no basis whatsoever. A judge can make a determination--must make a \ndetermination--whether a lawsuit is frivolous or not upon the question \nbeing presented and yet not award damages even upon a finding of a \nfrivolous lawsuit. That just doesn't make sense, and it is not fair to \nthe victims of frivolous lawsuits.\n  The bill that we are voting on here stands for something very basic. \nA judge shouldn't be allowed to deny damage awards to the victim of a \nfrivolous lawsuit. A vote for this bill is a vote to reduce the filing \nof frivolous lawsuits; a vote for this bill is a vote to protect the \nintegrity of the judicial system; and a vote for this bill is a warning \nshot to anyone who thinks that filing a frivolous lawsuit is a way to \nextort money.\n\n  It has been said--and I practiced law--what is the nuisance value of \nthis claim? In other words, what would you advise your client to just \npay the other side to make a frivolous lawsuit go away because of how \ncostly it is and how much time you spend worrying and preparing?\n  Lawsuits can be very intimidating to a defendant, and those who have \na good faith claim will litigate it out, and the judge won't find there \nto be anything frivolous about it; but when it is frivolous, those \nfiling it should have to pay. This is very, very common sense.\n  A vote for this bill is standing on the side of small business and \npreserving the integrity of our judicial system.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  First, I just want to go back to the Judicial Conference of the \nUnited States and their committee on rules of practice and procedure, \nwhich came out against this. They were just against it totally. In a \nletter signed by Judge Jeffrey Sutton and Judge David\n\n[[Page H6117]]\n\nCampbell, they said it is going to cost money, going to impede justice, \nand is not necessary.\n  Now, we have heard this is common sense and all these frivolous cases \nand how absurd it is and how wrong it is and how terrible it is. Well, \nthe two judges that wrote this letter to Mr. Goodlatte and said that \nthis was unnecessary, that we should just keep the rule we have got, \nthat the rule that we are adopting was an error in 1983 to 1993, it \ncost a lot of money in frivolous litigation, satellite lawsuits, \nexplosion of satellite litigation, and it just didn't work.\n  Judge Sutton was appointed to the bench by President Bush after \nclerking for Justices Scalia and Powell. I would assume that if you \nwere appointed by President Bush, approved by the United States Senate, \nand you clerked for Justices Scalia and Powell, you are not some kind \nof a big supporter of frivolous lawsuits in the plaintiffs' bar.\n  The other gentleman is Judge Campbell from Arizona, also appointed by \nPresident Bush. They were pretty adamant that this was a bad idea. They \ntook some surveys, and 80-some-odd percent of folks said it was a bad \nidea. The bar association said it was a bad idea. The bar association \nhad a group of 200 lawyers, litigants, judges, and academics who \nparticipated in the 2010 conference at Duke University Law School \nconvened by the advisory committee to search for ways to address the \nproblem. Not one of the 200 people proposed a return to the 1983 \nversion. So 200 lawyers, litigants, judges, and academics met, and none \nof them suggested this type of bill.\n  The Judicial Conference, headed up by two people appointed by \nPresident Bush, conservative judges, said this is a very bad idea. The \nbar association says it is a terrible idea. Yet we are to come here and \nthink that Congress has got the best idea, better than all these \nspecialists. That is one of the things that is wrong with this \nCongress. People realize that we are not respecting logic, expertise, \nand history.\n  In their letter, the judges said that this was a return to previous \nattempts to amend this rule, that it would eliminate this provision \nadopted in 1993, and their concerns that they expressed here mirrored \nthe views expressed by the Judicial Conference in 2004 when the \nRepublicans, I believe, had both Houses, the House and Senate, but they \ncertainly had the House.\n  In 2005, this bill came up, and they came out against it. The \nRepublicans had the House and maybe the Senate, I don't know. The bill \ncame up again in 2011 and 2013. So this bill has been here in 2004, \n2005, 2011, and 2013, and the Judicial Conference, the judges, the \nlawyers, and the experts almost two to one have said it is a bad idea. \nI know it is throwback Thursday, but that is no reason to bring this \nbill forward.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  I find it hard to be against my good friends, Mr. Smith and Mr. \nGoodlatte. They are fine gentlemen. Mr. Rohrabacher was here. He is my \nbuddy. But it is a bad bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Smith).\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. I thank Chairman Goodlatte for yielding.\n  A couple of things. First of all, we have found in the past that the \njudiciary, of course, always opposes anyone else changing these rules \nexcept for themselves. That is no surprise, that they object to this \nchange that we propose today.\n  That doesn't mean the change isn't a good one, but that is their \nhistory. If they didn't think of the change, they don't like it. \nClearly, this is good for the American people because it reduces the \nnumber of frivolous lawsuits.\n  The gentleman from Tennessee mentioned a poll a few minutes ago. I \nwould like, first of all, to mention a poll that was taken when this \nrule was in effect in 1990.\n  At that point, 751 Federal judges responded to that survey, and they \noverwhelmingly supported a rule 11 with mandatory sanctions.\n  The gentleman mentioned, I believe, a 2005 survey. In that survey, \nonly 278 judges responded. Over half of the judges who responded had no \nexperience under this stronger rule 11 because they were appointed to \nthe bench after 1992.\n  So the 2005 survey tells us very little about how judges actually \nview the stronger versus the weaker rule 11.\n  It is just amazing to me to hear individuals try to justify these \nfrivolous lawsuits. There is no effort in this bill to deny individuals \nthe right to file lawsuits if they have legitimate claims.\n  But to try to justify frivolous lawsuits and lawsuits that are found \nto be frivolous by judges, to me, is so contrary to the best interest \nof Americans who are innocent of these charges. I just don't understand \nthe opposition to this bill.\n  Innocent Americans sacrifice reputations. They sacrifice money. They \noftentimes lose their livelihoods to frivolous lawsuits. I think we \nought to do everything we possibly can to reduce the number of these \nfrivolous lawsuits.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I respect Mr. Smith and understand what he is saying about judges \nwanting to control their own courtrooms and control the system, but \nthey have the expertise.\n  The bar association is not the judges. The bar association is against \nthis, too. So you have got the bar association and the Judicial \nConference, both of which are conservative organizations, against it.\n  In the study, yes, some of those folks might not have been there in \n1983 to 1993, but they still knew what the rule was and they were able \nto study and they were able to understand things.\n  They weren't there when cases were filed. They didn't know the facts \nof the case. They learned. They have got minds that are capable of \nabsorbing information, analyzing it, synthesizing it, and coming to \ndecisions.\n  You didn't have to be alive when slavery was around to know slavery \nwas bad. You didn't have to be on the bench from 1983 to 1993 to know \nthat rule 11 was working and that this bill which brings back that old \nrule would be a failure.\n  So I think there is deference you should give to the bar association \nand to the Judicial Conference, both of which have come out against \nthis.\n  There are motions for summary judgment. They talk as if there is no \nway to get rid of a frivolous lawsuit. If you bring a frivolous \nlawsuit, you are going to get a motion for summary judgment. A court \ncan order that. It can find a motion to dismiss. You don't even have to \ngo into discovery.\n  The courts are the ones that suffer the most. You said that, sure, \nsometimes the defendants do from defending these cases, but the courts \nhave to put up with it.\n  The courts don't want frivolous litigation at all. They probably are \none of the first groups that don't want frivolous litigation.\n  I know some people that serve in this Congress who have been judges. \nThey are outstanding men. They understand how important judges are and \nthat their opinions should be revered and respected.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would just say that sometimes I see Mr. Rohrabacher and I think \nabout the fact that we have traveled some together. One of the things I \nhave learned on those travels is the thing people in foreign countries \nappreciate most about the United States of America is our justice \nsystem, the fact that you have got a system where you go in and get a \ncase heard. That is one of the things that is best about our country.\n  What this is about is taking power from judges and giving financial \nincentives. The defendants have got the heavy pockets, and it will end \nup squeezing plaintiffs from bringing actions. If they are so \nfrivolous, the judges will dismiss them on summary judgments or motions \nto dismiss.\n  The judges can still have sanctions and damages, but just not have \nall power taken from them. And there are other rules where they can \nhave sanctions if you are just messing with discovery and violating the \nrules.\n  I just think this is going to help close our courts, and that is not \nthe right way to go, particularly on Constitution Day.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  First, Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman from Tennessee, who \nis\n\n[[Page H6118]]\n\nmy friend, that I was pleased that he cited as one of the credentials \nfor the two judges that wrote to the committee on behalf of the \nConference that they had been schooled by Justice Scalia.\n  Here is what Justice Scalia himself had to say about this. He \nspecifically opposed the weakening of rule 11 when it occurred in 1993, \nwriting that it would ``render the Rule toothless, by allowing judges \nto dispense with sanction, by disfavoring compensation for litigation \nexpenses, and by providing a 21-day `safe harbor,' '' entitling the \nparty accused of a frivolous filing to escape with no sanction at all.\n  Justice Scalia further observed, ``In my view, those who file \nfrivolous suits and pleadings should have no `safe harbor.' The Rules \nshould be solicitous of the abused (the courts and the opposing party), \nand not of the abuser. Under the revised Rule, parties will be able to \nfile thoughtless, reckless, and harassing pleadings, secure in the \nknowledge that they have nothing to lose: If objection is raised, they \ncan retreat without penalty.''\n  So I also want to say, Mr. Speaker, that the gentleman from Tennessee \nand I agree on one of the great hallmarks of this country, and that is \nour judicial system. The hallmark of our judicial system is that, when \nyou are victimized in this country, you have a place where you can go \nand seek justice.\n\n  That is exactly what Mr. Smith's bill does. It allows people who are \nvictimized by aggressive plaintiffs--abusive, frivolous, and fraudulent \nlawsuits--to be able to get justice themselves.\n  Because when you are the victim of an expensive, costly lawsuit that \ncan damage your business, damage your reputation, cost you huge amounts \nof money, you are indeed a victim, if the court finds that that whole \nlawsuit was brought on a frivolous basis.\n  And, yet, I challenge again the other side of the aisle and those who \noppose this legislation to name one other sort of legal claim--just \none--where the victim is able to prove in court their damages and then \nbe denied those damages by the judge.\n  They have not done that. They have not made their case in this court, \nthe people's court. The elected representatives of the people today \nshould pass this legislation and give justice to victims of frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this great legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I oppose H.R. 758, the ``Lawsuit Abuse \nReduction Act of 2015.''\n  This bill is substantially identical to bills that we considered in \nthe 112th and 113th Congresses, and we have considered even earlier \nversions of this bill going back at least a decade.\n  H.R. 758, like its predecessors, is a solution in search of a problem \nthat would threaten to do more harm than good if enacted.\n  H.R. 758 would restore the 1983 version of Rule 11 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure by making sanctions for Rule 11 violations \nmandatory and by eliminating the current safe-harbor provision that \nallows a party to withdraw or correct any allegedly offending \nsubmission to the court within 21 days after service of such \nsubmission.\n  Moreover, the bill would go beyond the 1983 Rule by requiring a court \nto award reasonable attorneys' fees and costs related to Rule 11 \nlitigation. Current Rule 11 makes such awards entirely discretionary.\n  Yet no empirical evidence suggests any need for a change to the \ncurrent Rule 11.\n  In fact, there were good reasons why the Judicial Conference of the \nUnited States amended the 1983 version of Rule 11. For these same \nreasons, H.R. 758 is ill-advised.\n  The 1983 Rule caused excessive litigation. Many civil cases had a \nparallel track of litigation--referred to as ``satellite litigation''--\nover Rule 11 violations because having mandatory sanctions and no safe-\nharbor provision caused parties on both sides of a Rule 11 motion to \nlitigate the Rule 11 matter to the bitter end.\n  The dramatic increase in litigation spawned by the 1983 Rule not only \nresulted in delays in resolving the underlying case and increased costs \nfor the litigants, but also strained judicial resources.\n  In light of this history, it is clear that H.R. 758 will result in \nmore, not less, litigation and will impose a great burden on the \nfederal judiciary.\n  Ultimately, the type of Rule 11 sanctions regime that H.R. 758 \nenvisions will only favor those with the money and resources to fight \nexpensive and drawn out litigation battles.\n  H.R. 758 also threatens judicial independence by removing the \ndiscretion that Rule 11 currently gives judges in determining whether \nto impose sanctions and what type of sanctions would be most \nappropriate.\n  It also circumvents the painstakingly thorough Rules Enabling Act \nprocess, recklessly attempting to amend the rules directly, even over \nthe Judicial Conference's objections.\n  Finally, we know that the 1983 Rule had a disproportionately chilling \nimpact on civil rights cases, and there is no reason to think H.R. 758 \nwould not have a similar chilling effect if it is enacted.\n  Civil rights cases in particular depend on novel arguments for the \nextension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\n  Not surprisingly, a Federal Judicial Center study found that the \nincidence of Rule 11 motions was higher in civil rights cases than some \nother types of cases when the 1983 Rule was in place, notwithstanding \nthe fact that the 1983 Rule was neutral on its face.\n  Even the decision in Brown v. Board of Education arguably may have \nbeen delayed or stopped had H.R. 758's changes to Rule 11 been in \neffect at the time, given the novel nature of the plaintiffs' arguments \nin that case.\n  At a minimum, the defendants could have used Rule 11, as amended by \nH.R. 758, as a weapon to dissuade the plaintiffs or weaken their \nresolve.\n  H.R. 758 is a flawed bill for many reasons. I would urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary \nCommittee and a strong defender of the civil rights and liberties of \nall Americans, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 758, the ``Lawsuit \nAbuse Reduction Act of 2015,'' which can more accurately be described \nas the ``Denial of Access to Civil Justice Act.''\n  This ill-considered and misguided legislation would rescind the \ncurrent version of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nwhich has been in effect since 1993, and reinstate the disastrous 1983 \nversion of the rule.\n  I strongly oppose H.R. 758 because it hampers the ability of federal \ndistrict courts to deter frivolous litigation--while preserving access \nto the courts--by limiting the ability of judges to exercise discretion \nin imposing sanctions for Rule 11 violations.\n  Under H.R. 758, federal district judges would be required to impose \nsanctions for all violations of Rule 11, even in cases in which it \nwould be manifestly inappropriate to do so.\n  Mr. Speaker, the reason the version of Rule 11(c) in effect from \n1983-1993 was rescinded is because the results of its 10-year \nexperiment proved conclusively that it did not work.\n  Instead of reducing frivolous litigation, mandatory imposition of \nsanction actually had the opposite effect of increasing litigation.\n  Indeed, according to the American Bar Association, ``during the \ndecade of that the 1983 version of the Rule requiring mandatory \nsanctions was in effect, an entire industry of litigation revolving \naround Rule 11 claims inundated the legal system and wasted valuable \ncourt resources and time.''\n  Studies by the Judicial Conference of the United States, the \nadministrative arm of the federal judiciary, found that the 1983 \nversion of Rule ii(c) quickly became a tool of abuse.\n  Aggressive filings of Rule 11 sanctions motions required expenditure \nof tremendous resources on Rule 11 battles having nothing to do with \nthe merits of the case and everything to do with strategic \ngamesmanship.\n  Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 758 would undermine civil rights \ncases.\n  During the decade between 1983 and 1993, mandatory sanctions under \nRule 11 were disproportionately imposed in civil rights cases.\n  A leading study on this issue showed that although civil rights cases \nmade up 11.4% of federal cases filed during this period, 22.7% of the \ncases in which sanctions had been imposed were civil rights cases.\n  If this bill were to be enacted, once again, as happened between 1983 \nand 1993, defendants in civil rights cases could wield Rule 11 as a \nweapon against legitimate plaintiffs, tying up civil rights cases in \nlong and costly satellite litigation on Rule 11 and preventing \nlegitimate civil rights cases from moving forward.\n  For these reasons, I urge all Members to vote against H.R. 758.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Ms. DelBENE. I am opposed, in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n\n[[Page H6119]]\n\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. DelBene moves to recommit the bill H.R. 758 to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report the \n     same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendment:\n       Add, at the end of the bill, the following:\n\n     SEC. 3. PROTECTING EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN.\n\n       This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall not \n     apply in the case of any action brought under employment \n     discrimination laws, including laws that ensure that women \n     receive equal pay for equal work.\n\n  Ms. DelBENE (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous \nconsent to dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Washington?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nWashington is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthe bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.\n  The so-called Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act would turn back the clock \nto deter good-faith litigants seeking justice, like women who are \ndenied equal pay for equal work.\n  The harmful effects of this bill are not speculative. We know this \nbill will undercut important civil rights and equal pay litigation \nbecause it would restore a version of rule 11 that was in effect from \n1983 to 1993.\n  Under the version of rule 11 that this bill would resurrect, \nsanctions were disproportionately imposed against plaintiff's in civil \nrights and antidiscrimination cases. The old rule's onerous provisions \ncreated a chilling effect on civil rights litigation, created time-\nconsuming and costly satellite litigation, and gave rise to needless \ndelay and harassment in the courtroom.\n  This amendment would ensure the bill's harmful effects do not apply \nin cases brought under employment discrimination laws, including laws \nto ensure women earn equal pay for equal work.\n  When President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law 50 years \nago, women, on average, made 59 cents for every dollar earned by men.\n  While we have made some progress since then, with women appointed to \nthe Supreme Court and to executive leadership roles at Fortune 500 \ncompanies, we are still nowhere near the goal of equal pay for equal \nwork.\n  Just as recently as 2007, the Supreme Court ruled against Lilly \nLedbetter, making it nearly impossible for workers who suffered \ndiscrimination to seek justice.\n  Because she was prohibited from discussing her salary with coworkers, \nLilly didn't find out she was making significantly less than her male \ncounterparts until her retirement.\n  The court ruled that she waited too long to file her lawsuit. \nLuckily, in 2009, Congress intervened, passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair \nPay Act to reverse the Supreme Court's decision.\n  Unfortunately, stories like this are not unique. Women still make \nonly 79 cents on the dollar, about 20 percent less take-home pay than \ntheir male counterparts.\n  That is why it is critical that Congress vote for this amendment: to \nensure women can continue fighting for equal pay at work.\n  Because equal pay is not just good for women, it is good for \nfamilies, businesses, and our economy. When women aren't paid what they \ndeserve, middle class families and communities pay the price.\n  Families today rely on women's wages to put food on the table, save \nfor retirement, and pay for their children's education. It is estimated \nthat the pay gap costs a woman and her family more than $10,000 in lost \nearnings each year, a significant number by any standards.\n  I recently spoke with a mother of three named Adriana. She told me \nthat, while working her way through college as a waitress, she had to \napproach her manager after discovering her less-experienced male \ncolleague made more than $1 an hour than she did.\n  Adriana said she felt lucky that she worked for a small, family-run \nbusiness. Otherwise, she might have been too intimidated to ask for \nequal pay.\n  She said it seemed ``criminal and ridiculous'' to pay people unfairly \nand that lawmakers should think about their wife, sister, or daughter \nand the effect this financial barrier would have on them. I agree. I \nhope everyone in this Chamber does as well.\n  For women seeking justice under employment discrimination laws, the \nLawsuit Abuse Reduction Act would be a disaster.\n  Women taking on huge corporations with limitless funds and armies of \nattorneys will face an uphill battle in court, at best, or may be \ncompletely deterred from even pursuing their day in court.\n  We have come a long way in expanding opportunities for women, but \nthere is no question that we have a lot more to do. We cannot create \nmore barriers to success than women and families already face in \nAmerica today.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this motion to recommit and \nsupport the women and families in our communities who we were sent here \nto represent.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit must be strongly \nopposed by anyone who understands that the victims of frivolous \nlawsuits are indeed victims.\n  No one who supports civil rights laws or the Constitution should \nsupport the filing of frivolous claims without penalty, but that is \nexactly what this motion to recommit would allow.\n  The base bill makes sanctions for filing frivolous lawsuits in \nFederal court mandatory. Under rule 11, a lawsuit is frivolous if it is \npresented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause \nunnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation if it \nis not warranted by existing law or if the factual contentions have no \nevidentiary support.\n  In other words, a lawsuit will only be found frivolous if it has no \nbasis in law or fact.\n  Who here thinks that lawyers should be able to avoid any penalty when \nthe lawsuit they file is found by a Federal judge to have been filed \nsimply to harass or cause unnecessary delay or to needlessly increase \nthe cost of litigation or when the Federal judge finds that the lawsuit \nis not warranted by existing law or has no evidentiary support?\n  If you think lawyers should be able to get off scot-free when they \nfile those sorts of frivolous lawsuits, vote for this motion to \nrecommit; but if you agree with me that the victims of frivolous \nlawsuits are real victims and that they have to shell out thousands of \ndollars; endure sleepless nights; and spend time away from their \nfamily, work, and customers just to respond to frivolous pleadings with \nno basis in law or fact, then you should oppose this motion to recommit \nand support the base bill, and join me in taking a clear stance against \nfrivolous lawsuits.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this motion to recommit \nand to support the underlying bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by \n5-minute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered, ordering the \nprevious question on House Resolution 421, and adopting House \nResolution 421, if ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 179, \nnays 239, not voting 16, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 500]\n\n                               YEAS--179\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n\n[[Page H6120]]\n\n\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Castro (TX)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Costa\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeFazio\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Fattah\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Hinojosa\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jackson Lee\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

Mr. Speaker, September is Pulmonary Fibrosis Awareness \nMonth and a time to shine a light on a disease that is deadly. While \nsome may not be familiar with pulmonary fibrosis, approximately 200,000 \nAmericans suffer from the disease.\n  This serious illness takes the lives of 40,000 Americans every single \nyear, which equates to about one death every 13 minutes. That is the \nsame mortality rate as breast cancer.\n  There is no known cure for pulmonary fibrosis. There is no known \ntreatment to extend the life of a patient or improve the symptoms. As a \nresult, the median survival rate is just 2\\1/2\\ years, and as many as \n80 percent of patients die within 5 years of diagnosis.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity to bring attention to this \nserious illness that affects so many.

Mr. Speaker, the confectionary \nindustry directly employs 70,000 people in the United States and more \nthan 400,000 jobs in agriculture, retail, transportation, and other \nindustries that rely, in part, on the sale of confections for their \nlivelihood.\n  For every job that is created in confectionary, another six are \nsupported in related industries, which means that candy drives a \nmultiplier effect of 6 to 1.\n  Chicago was once known as the candy capital of the world. However, \ndue to an unfair sugar program, many decent and good-paying \nmanufacturing jobs are now located outside the United States.\n  The candy industry is comprised of hundreds of small- and medium-\nsized family-owned businesses, as well as the multinational companies \nwith global brands that operate more than 1,000 manufacturing \nfacilities in all 50 States.\n  The confectionary industry is doing its part to help address the \nongoing conversation about food and nutrition, policy wellness, and \nfood safety. NCA member companies are providing consumers with the \ninformation options and support they need to make the choices that are \nright for them.\n  Candy helps to make America just a little sweeter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6122-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6122-H6123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WELCOMING POPE FRANCIS\n\n  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HILL.

Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, Secretary of \nDefense Ash Carter stunned Congress and the country when he admitted \nthat the administration's $500 million program to train and equip so-\ncalled moderate Syrian rebels had resulted in the training of 60 \nindividuals. The original goal was to have 5,000 within the first year, \nbut they only had 60.\n  The information gets worse. Today, most of those 60 mercenaries have \nbeen killed, captured, or just gone missing.\n  Mr. Speaker, where, oh, where have the fighters gone? Where, oh, \nwhere could they be? Have they gone to fight with the enemy--which just \nleaves us how many? It is four or five, according to General Austin. \nFour or five fighters for a cost of $500 million, is that the plan for \nthe war in Syria to defeat ISIS?\n  The lack of a plan in Syria has created chaos. Thousands of people \nhave panicked and are running from the Syrian turmoil. The U.S. needs \nto lead.\n  Expecting five mercenaries to defeat ISIS is disgraceful.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a father of four, \na regular dad who loves my children more than I love my own life. I \nknow I speak for millions when I say that my wife, Jenny, and I fell in \nlove with our children before they were even born.\n  It is this love for my children that led me to the pro-life movement, \nto serve on the board of directors of a crisis pregnancy center, to \noffer free legal services for those who want to adopt.\n  It is in this spirit of love, informed by powerful life experiences, \nthat I rise today in strong support of legislation to defund Planned \nParenthood.\n  Now, Hoosiers have made it clear. They should not be forced to \nviolate their own conscience so that Planned Parenthood can continue to \noperate.\n  Given the light that has recently been shed on Planned Parenthood's \ngruesome practices and procedures, can we not agree that taxpayers \nshouldn't have to foot the bill for these atrocities?\n  Now, if the best argument on the other side is that eliminating \ntaxpayer subsidies for Planned Parenthood would create access problems, \nthat is just not the case.

Earlier this year, my staff and I \nspent a morning cleaning up the beaches on Stock Island in the Florida \nKeys and saw just how much trash washes ashore.\n  Unfortunately, this amount is just a snapshot of an even larger \nproblem.

Mr. Speaker, in America, the practice of abortion is now \nreferred to as women's health care. Yes, in the 21st century, even with \nall the science, we refuse to ask the question: What about the baby?\n  The cavalier spirit and the coldhearted callousness in taking a live \nbaby and then cutting into her face to retrieve fresh body parts--can \nyou imagine the national outrage if we were carving up puppies in the \nsame manner?\n  We don't condemn these young mothers who have been convinced that no \nother options exist; yet we will be negligent if we stand silent over \nthe atrocities of an abortion mill that goes by the name Planned \nParenthood. Whether you are pro-life or not, surely, most Americans are \nappalled by the idea that our tax dollars are funneled to this \norganization.\n  I cannot look the other way. It is my belief, and I am thoroughly \nconvinced that this is no longer a political issue. This is about a \nhuman rights violation that parallels other barbaric times throughout \nhistory.

Mr. Speaker, graphic videos, personal testimony, and \nverbal assent reveal the true colors of Planned Parenthood.\n  There is probable cause to believe that America's largest abortion \nprovider is altering abortion procedures to obtain uncrushed baby body \nparts; is performing partial-birth abortions; and is selling baby \nhearts, brains, and other fetal specimens for monetary value. This is \natrocious.\n  Planned Parenthood staff doesn't want to lowball fees for baby body \nparts, and third parties are drooling over intact unborn children. It \nis unimaginable how one can camouflage the humanity of a clinician's \nannouncement of ``another boy'' and watch a baby's beating heart just \nbefore harvesting the baby's brain to sell; yet Federal funding \ncontinues to pour unabashed, unabated into the coffers of Planned \nParenthood, America's number one killer of unborn babies.

When we see the atrocities in the videos, the \ncallousness of the organization that is trafficking in body parts from \ndead babies, we should react in horror and remove the funding for that.\n  The greatest argument the other side puts up is that they provide \nwomen other services. This chart shows the Planned Parenthood locations \nin New Mexico versus those providing other services.

Mr. Speaker, the question we must ask ourselves today \nin light of recent revelations: Why does Congress insist on giving half \na billion dollars of the taxpayer money to an organization that has \nsuch disregard for human life?\n  Considering the budget constraints currently imposed on our military, \nwhy are the American people's hard-earned money being diverted to \nPlanned Parenthood, which reports more than $127 million in excess \nrevenue and more than $1 billion in net assets?\n  When I was back home in Texas during the August recess, I had the \npleasure of visiting the Austin Pregnancy Resource Center, a model \nwomen's health organization that can and should lead by example.\n  The APRC does a lot to support women's health and provide guidance on \naccessing women's health services. The APRC's slogan of building the \nculture of life is one that we should all be able to get behind, but \nthere are many pro-life women's health organizations like APRC that \ntake no Federal dollars.\n  Even so, some of my colleagues prefer to continue to send taxpayer \ndollars to Planned Parenthood, an organization that takes in money from \naborted fetal parts, an organization that alters abortion procedures so \nthey can harvest organs, an organization that, frankly, rips off the \nFederal Government.\n  Not only are the alleged actions of Planned Parenthood illegal under \nFederal law, they are morally reprehensible.\n  I am disgusted that an organization that is involved in such \nrepulsive activity would promote itself as a protector of women's \nhealth. It is beyond hypocritical. It is deceitful and I believe \nfraudulent.\n  When I first ran for Congress, I promised that I would vote with my \nconscience and use God's word as my guide.

That is the history of \nPlanned Parenthood. That is the history that is being funded.\n  That is the current day practice of Planned Parenthood, to target \nminority communities with abortion, with destruction, with elimination.\n  Without a doubt, in my mind, I think in the mind of the American \npeople, it is time to stop funding racism with our tax dollars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6125-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6125-H6126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRESS SHOULD NOT BE AN ACCESSORY TO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY\n\n  (Mr. GOHMERT asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. GOHMERT.

Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from West Virginia \n(Mr. Mooney) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my \ndeepest concerns for the health and safety of the women, children, all \nbabies, and families in our great country.\n  Recent undercover videos by The Center for Medical Progress unearthed \nsome of the most alarming information that has been hidden from the \nAmerican people for years. These videos deeply disturb me, and I know I \nam not alone.\n  The practices uncovered in the Planned Parenthood videos are \nrepulsive. I never dreamed I would be standing before this body \nquestioning if our own government is a willing enabler in the \nprofiteering from the buying and selling of aborted baby parts.\n  It is wrong that Planned Parenthood continues to do as it pleases and \nthat the American taxpayers are bankrolling that organization. We are \nspending $450 million a year funding Planned Parenthood.\n  That is why I sent a letter along with 134 of my colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives on July 27 that calls for a full investigation \ninto Planned Parenthood by the Justice Department.\n  Mr. Speaker, I speak for the people that I am blessed to represent \nfrom the Second Congressional District in West Virginia. I am here to \nsay that taxpayers should not fund abortions. Supporters of Planned \nParenthood continually point to other services that they provide.\n  There is precisely one Planned Parenthood provider in all of West \nVirginia, located in Vienna, less than an hour outside of my district, \nright here. One. Does it even provide mammograms? No, it does not.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  However, we have more than 300 federally certified women's care \nfacilities in West Virginia that do provide these essential services. \nTaxpayers should not be forced to fund abortions through Planned \nParenthood. We should defund that organization from taxpayer funding \ndollars right now.\n  Senior officials--on camera--were caught admitting to unethical, \nillegal activities in the selling of body parts.\n  Let's define what we are talking about here. This is a baby \napproximately 16 weeks after the moment of conception. Human life \nbegins at conception. This is a baby.\n  Some would like to define it as something else--call it anything but \na baby. They will call it a fetus, a blob of tissue, cells; but they do \nnot want to call this little boy or girl a baby. However, you couldn't \nsell baby body parts, such as lungs, hearts, livers, as Planned \nParenthood was caught doing, unless it was a baby.\n  This is a baby. This is what he or she looks like. This is what \ntaxpayers in this country--you, the taxpayers--are being forced to pay \nfor, the killing of this baby and the buying or selling of her body \nparts. That is wrong. That is what we are standing against here in the \nU.S. House of Representatives, and we need your support in this.\n  The Federal Government needs to stop enabling this black market \nbusiness immediately. That is why I have cosponsored several pieces of \nlegislation to make sure that the taxpayers and thousands of unborn \nchildren are protected from the activities and horrendous actions of \nPlanned Parenthood and other abortion providers.\n  H.R. 3134, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015, simply \nprohibits funding of Planned Parenthood for a year to allow for a full \ncongressional investigation to take place.\n  H.R. 3197, the Protecting Life and Taxpayers Act of 2015--this bill \nwill prohibit Federal funding of an entity that performs abortions, \nincluding Planned Parenthood.\n  H.R. 3215, the End Trafficking of the Terminated Unborn Act of 2015--\nthis bill will prohibit any transfer of fetal tissue from aborted \nbabies for a purpose other than disposal. This will prevent both \npublicly and privately funded research involving the remains of unborn \nchildren who were aborted.\n  Finally, my bill, H.R. 816, the Life At Conception Act, would define \nlife at the moment of conception, which is a biological fact.\n  The abortion issue, actually, in this bill defunding Planned \nParenthood--which our goal is to defund Planned Parenthood--does not \nactually stop abortion. I wish we could. Abortion is the taking of a \nhuman life.\n  Defund Planned Parenthood is simply saying that taxpayers should not \nbe forced to pay for those abortions. That is a widely accepted view of \nthe majority of Americans, even those who may disagree with us pro-life \nadvocates on the abortion issue. Many people think that abortion \nshouldn't be funded with taxpayer dollars.\n  All of these bills are crucial to making sure that the American \ntaxpayer is no longer footing the bill or condoning the barbaric \npractices of Planned Parenthood or any other organization like them \nthat traffics in aborted baby body parts.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for these four vital \npieces of legislation and remove taxpayer funding of abortion in the \nspending bills before us in Congress. That is our duty in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives.\n  We control spending in this Chamber. No one can tell us what to do. \nWe represent the people in the districts that voted us into office. I \nam calling on the folks in this Chamber and in America to support the \ndefunding of Planned Parenthood now.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6126-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6126-H6130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WILDFIRES AND FOREST MANAGEMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) is \nrecognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the \nmajority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Mooney of West Virginia). Is there \nobjection to the request of the gentleman from Arkansas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to \nwildfires and forest management.\n  Recent headlines show that our forests are in terrible shape: 8.8 \nmillion acres have burned this year; $250 million was recently \ntransferred from forest management accounts to fight fires, announced \nlast week.\n  Emergency fire spending has already topped $700 million this year and \nis still growing. We have a problem that is greatly decreasing and \nimpairing the value of our forest for the next generation.\n  I worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass H.R. \n2647, the Resilient Federal Forests Act, back in July. This bill was \nsupported from Maine to Alaska by Democrats and Republicans. The bill \nends the destructive practice of fire borrowing in a fiscally \nresponsible manner. It creates a subaccount under the Stafford Act for \nwildfire. This ensures that resources to put out major fires are \navailable when necessary.\n  This week, the Obama administration publicly called on the Congress \nto fix fire borrowing. While I appreciate the President's interest, I \nagree with him that we need to fix fire borrowing. I applaud the 19 \nDemocrats who voted for H.R. 2647 that fixes fire borrowing.\n  Fixing fire borrowing alone won't solve the problem. Fixing fire \nborrowing alone simply is treating a symptom instead of a disease. It \nis like putting on a bandaid without cleaning out the wound.\n  Again, the House passed this bipartisan legislation back in July. We \ncould be fixing these problems now, but\n\n[[Page H6127]]\n\nthe Senate hasn't acted. It is time for the Senate to act. It is time \nto stop playing politics with our Nation's forests, one of our most \ntreasured resources. The House offered a solution. Let's embrace \nconstructive governance and make H.R. 2647 the law of the land.\n  I want to take a moment and look at what the Resilient Federal \nForests Act does. We already talked about fire borrowing, but it also \nprevents future fires.\n  H.R. 2647 gives the Forest Service the tools it needs to better \nmanage our national forests immediately after its passage. Our forests \nare overgrown, and therefore, they are fire prone. Fighting fires \ndoesn't prevent future fires. That is why we need better management. \nScientific thinning helps prevents future fires.\n  I would like to show some photographs from a forest in my home State \nof Arkansas. To some, this may look like a healthy, thriving forest \nbecause you see trees and you see a lot of greenery, but I am a \nforester, and when I look at that, I see an overstock stand of trees. I \nsee too much undergrowth. I see too much dead and dying material on the \nforest floor. This is not a healthy forest, but this happens to be a \ncontrol site in the middle of a healthy forest.\n  Next, I want to show how we get to a healthy forest on this \nparticular side.\n  This area has been thinned, and there is controlled burns taking \nplace. These burns take place on intervals of 3 to 5 years. They not \nonly make the forest better to withstand potential forest fires; they \nalso create better wildlife habitat. The biodiversity in this forest \ngoes through the roof when these kind of management practices are put \nin place. We get healthy trees. We get an early successional habitat \nthat is good for wildlife. It also is good for the soil; it is good for \nwater quality, and it is good for air quality.\n  This last picture shows what a healthy forest in my district looks \nlike. These trees are thriving. This is an early growth not too long \nafter a fire. This is a great wildlife habitat. The biodiversity of \nwildlife and plant life is much higher in this photograph than what we \nsaw in the previous photograph. This creates a win-win situation.\n  Now, this isn't the solution for everywhere across the country; this \nis what works in the forests in my district, but there are forest \nmanagers across this country that know how to manage their forests in \ntheir particular climate and in their particular setting to create \nhealthy forests and forests that can withstand a fire. It would be \nalmost impossible for a forest fire to destroy these trees.\n  The next thing that the Resilient Federal Forests Act does is it \nstops frivolous lawsuits. You may ask: Why do we need to stop frivolous \nlawsuits?\n  Well, frivolous lawsuits hinder forest plans that are developed \nlocally, using science, best management practices, and collaborative \nefforts that represent stakeholder values. The end result is a forest \nthat is decreased and impaired in value for our next generation.\n  This bill discourages frivolous lawsuits by requiring those suing to \nstop collaborative projects to post a bond. If the plaintiff loses, \nthey pay the taxpayer's legal bills. If they win, they get their money \nback.\n  This bill also aids in better land management planning. In the words \nof former U.S. Forest Service chief Dale Bosworth: ``We do not have a \nfire problem on our Nation's forests; we have a land management \nproblem. And it needs to be addressed quickly.''\n  Delayed decisionmaking or, even worse, no decisionmaking at all, is \nhurting our forests. Forests are dynamic. They are a living, growing \norganism. When we say no action, we are actually taking action. Since \nforests are not static, scientific analysis should not be static.\n  This bill requires the Forest Service to critically analyze the \nimpacts of no action, which often are overgrowth, increased wildfire, \nand diseases. Increases in future wildfire problems are often caused \nbecause of poor land management. It makes it difficult for \nreforestation, ultimately decreasing and impairing the value of \nforests.\n  This bill sets up requirements for salvage plans in response to \ncatastrophic events. It requires environmental assessments for salvage \nprojects to be completed within 90 days so that timber can be removed \nwhile it is still commercially valuable.\n  The USDA completed post-Hurricane Katrina NEPA on the De Soto \nNational Forest within 90 days. They expedited it. They were successful \nat that. As a result, 80 percent of the timber was salvaged that was in \nmoderate to heavily damaged areas.\n  The management actions laid out in this bill must comply with forest \nplans. It is not taking a shortcut. Despite what some folks say, this \ndoesn't mean thousands of acres clearcut. It doesn't mean destruction \nof snag habitats that often become available after a large fire.\n  In my home State, clearcuts are restricted to 180 acres, at most. We \nare talking about thousands of acres of land that still have to follow \nforest management practices.\n  This bill rewards collaboration. It incentivizes collaboration and \nspeeds up the implementation of collaborative projects. It safeguards a \nstrong, timely environmental review process through categorical \nexclusions for forest management projects.\n  You may ask: What are collaborative projects? This is simply where \nlocal land managers, environmentalists, citizens, and industry \nrepresentatives come up with a plan. These groups spend hundreds if not \nthousands of hours working on a plan that is best for their local area. \nWhy wouldn't we encourage this sort of compromise?\n  This bill encourages more collaborative projects. Passing this bill \nshows that we endorse commonsense plans that tend to local and \necological needs.\n  This bill creates greater reforestation after natural disasters. As a \nforester, this statistic is really disturbing to me. On average, less \nthan 3 percent of an area is reforested after a catastrophic event on \nour national forests. This bill requires that 75 percent reforestation \ntakes place within 5 years. This will revitalize our forests that are \ndestroyed by fire or other natural events.\n  When we reforest an area, we have young trees that grow fast and \nsequester carbon faster than older, fully grown trees. If we want to \nsequester more carbon, then we should be planting more trees. We should \ndemand that we reforest our land after the timber is destroyed in one \nof these catastrophic events.\n  We have to stop playing politics, and we need to pass this bill.\n  This bill creates greater roles for the tribes. Oftentimes, the \nFederal Government does not collaborate and work together with those \nwho have expertise in forest health. This bill brings in State and \ntribal governments as strong partners in forest management.\n  It gives the Forest Service the authority to accept assistance from \nStates willing to put money toward forest management.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  It also reinforces existing tribal authority to assist in the \nmanagement of national forest land adjacent to reservations.\n  The Resilient Federal Forests Act modernizes secure rural schools. \nThis is an issue that is very important in my district. We have many \nrural areas near our national forests, and the schools are hurting \nbecause of the decreased funding because we are not keeping our forests \nhealthy.\n  Rural communities not only depend on our forests for their \nsustenance, but they also provide emergency services, education, and \nsupport for the forests and residents who live near the forests. As \nforests lose value, communities suffer, and they will only suffer more \nin the future.\n  This bill gives counties flexibility to spend secure rural schools \nfunding. It allows them to spend money on emergency services on Federal \nlands, and it puts 25 percent of stewardship contracts into the county \ntreasury where the projects occurred.\n  This bill means more money for our schools and other public services, \nalong with the benefits of a healthy and resilient forest.\n  One more time, I want to look at the fire borrowing issue. This is \none of the worst fire seasons we have seen. We know what good \nmanagement practices are. We know how to implement those practices on \nthe land.\n  The House has acted by passing H.R. 2647, the Resilient Federal \nForests Act. It solves fire borrowing. It completely reforms current \nbad management practices. And this is isn't just me saying\n\n[[Page H6128]]\n\nthis. We have letters from hundreds of groups that have endorsed this \nbill. Here is a list of just a few of them: the Forest Products \nIndustry National Labor Management Committee, the Congressional \nSportsmen's Foundation, the National Association of Counties, the \nNational Association of Forest Service Retirees, the National Water \nResources Association, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, \nthe United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. There are \nhundreds more that have supported this legislation because it is good, \ncommonsense legislation that is good for our country; it is good for \nour forests.\n  The House has acted. It is time for the Senate to act. It is time for \nthe administration to stop playing politics with wildfire. It is time \nto make H.R. 2647 the law of the land.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce).\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for \nbringing this subject up. It is a subject that all of us in the West \ndeal with every year.\n  A couple of years ago, we had Tom Tidwell in New Mexico. He was there \nat a time when the Forest Service was in the process of burning down \n255 homes in Ruidoso. The fire almost burned completely out of control \nand burned the entire town down. That is what the agency was surprised \nand frightened by.\n  These fires are caused by a lack of management. And instead of \naddressing the problem by reducing the number of trees in the forests, \nthe Forest Service is saying, and Tom Tidwell himself said, that our \npolicy is going to be to reintroduce fire into its natural habitat.\n  Introducing fire into the forest at this stage, with the years of no \nattention, with the years of fuel buildup, with the decades of drought \nthat have put them in an explosive position in much of the West, is \nabsolute lunacy. And yet this was the highest ranking Forest Service \nemployee saying that we need to reintroduce fire into the wild.\n  I am sorry, but we need to clean up the forest first, then the fire \ncan keep the forest healthy--but not until then. These raging wildfires \nare a natural conclusion to the management policies for the past \ndecades, and so we can't start and act like that policy has not been in \nplace.\n  Another policy that the Forest Service is engaged in is letting fire \nachieve management objectives. If I were to take a look at, say, one of \nthe large fires out in Grant County, in the Gila Wilderness area of New \nMexico, you can see the daily reports where they are talking about, \nwell, the fire is 300 acres, it is 600 acres, and it is achieving its \nmanagement objective.\n  Well, there is one truth about New Mexico: If the wind is not blowing \ntoday, it is going to blow tomorrow. Letting those fires go, while they \nare supposedly monitoring them, and the fire then gets the push from \nthe wind and grows from 300 or 800 acres to 10,000 to 30,000 acres is, \nagain, a natural conclusion to the management policies of this Forest \nService.\n  It is time for us to revise the way our forests are managed. Mr. \nWesterman has a bill that is exactly right, H.R. 2647, and we should \npass that bill, and that process should go forward.\n  Let's start cleaning the excess timber out of our forests. It is much \nsimpler than what everybody wants to make it. It is much simpler than \nthe Forest Service would allow.\n  So again, I appreciate the fact that you are bringing this issue up. \nI appreciate the fact that you have yielded time.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. I thank the gentleman from New Mexico.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I wish to express thanks to the gentleman \nfrom Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) for leading this discussion tonight. It \nis very important to many of us in rural America.\n  Of course, my district, which includes seven national forests, has \nexperienced increasingly devastating forest fires caused by overgrown, \nmismanaged, or even nonmanaged forests, and has been economically \nstrangled by restrictions on forest management.\n  Our Nation has already lost over 8\\1/2\\ million acres to wildfire, \nand the year isn't yet over. We are on pace to exceed the record of 10 \nmillion acres burned back in 2006, and that is not a record we want to \nbreak.\n  Our rural communities, public lands, and the environment are being \ndestroyed through neglect. The habitat is gone, erosion into our lakes \nand waterways goes unchecked, and the people's asset, the value of the \ntrees, is wasted.\n  In light of Forest Service surveys finding that over 12 million \nSierra Nevada trees have died in the last year, we cannot afford to \nwait another year.\n  That is why we need Mr. Westerman's bill, H.R. 2647, which will \nreturn active management to our forests by increasing flexibility, \ncutting red tape, and, most importantly, acting to manage forests \nbefore fires occur, not afterwards.\n  Streamlining review process means that forest management can occur \nwhen it is actually needed to address dangerous conditions, not after \nyears of legal roadblocks.\n  Allowing categorical exclusions for post-fire salvage and \nrehabilitation hastens forest recovery and prevents fuel buildup that \ncan contribute to future fires.\n  Expanding local involvement in forest management will improve the \ndata and know-how available for planning and also respect local \npriorities.\n  Finally, the budget impact of forest neglect can no longer be \nignored. Just this week, the Forest Service diverted yet another $250 \nmillion from forest management to fighting fire. That brings the \nFederal spending total so far this year on firefighting to $700 \nmillion, money that, though we agree, needs to fight fire this year, \ncould surely be used better if we properly managed forests in the \nfuture.\n  This bill will end the borrowing by funding fires, as we do \nhurricanes, earthquakes, and other disasters, making them eligible for \nFEMA disaster funds.\n  In California, over 1,000 homes have burned. Tens of thousands have \nbeen evacuated from their homes or communities. Firefighters have lost \ntheir lives, as well as some residents now. This is a needless loss of \nlife, needless suffering in rural America.\n  Let's start by keeping H.R. 2647 moving in the process through the \nSenate and on to the President's desk.\n  I again thank Mr. Westerman for his leadership and allowing me to \nspeak on this important topic here tonight.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. I thank the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Zinke).\n\n  Mr. ZINKE. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support to remind my colleagues in the Senate \nthat the Western United States is on fire. We don't have time for \ninaction and more political pandering.\n  The House has passed the Resilient Federal Forests Act, which \nincludes vital reforms that can be implemented tomorrow if our \ncolleagues in the Senate take the bill up.\n  So why don't we do what is right for America? Why don't we come \ntogether and move the bill?\n  This wildfire season has been one of the worst in the last 10 years, \nand it has had enormous cost. Despite the cooler conditions in Montana, \nwe have 35 fires that are continuing to burn, a total of 334,000 acres \ngone. That is equivalent to 522 miles, square miles. Two-thirds of this \nacreage belongs to the public, our national forests.\n  And it is not just the physical damage. We lost four firefighters in \nWashington, four that paid the sacrifice fighting forest fires, and we \nhave to remember that.\n  I was at a fire in Glacier National Park. It was a reburn from a fire \nthat occurred in 2003. The reburn happened to occur because of a threat \nof a lawsuit which prevented the Forest Service from doing the right \nthing. What they wanted to do was salvage timber. But because there was \nstanding timber, ground crews couldn't get at it. And when ground crews \ncouldn't get it, that means they had to fly aircraft at $3,000 an hour \nto put out the fire. That is wrong. It is wrong for Montana, and it is \nwrong for America.\n  I know the firsthand value of our natural resources. I am a \nconservationist. But I also know the value of tourism in Montana. I \nalso know the value of clean air. And when the smoke in Montana--which \npeople travel all the way from across this country and\n\n[[Page H6129]]\n\nthe world to go to--is worse than Beijing, it has an impact.\n  It also has an impact on the elderly, the asthmatic. It is unhealthy. \nWorst of all, it is preventable.\n  The problem is real. Not only does the Forest Service lack the \nresources to adequately fight fires, it has a land management problem \nat the source.\n  Former Chief of the Forest Service, Dale Bosworth, his quote before \nthe hearing was: ``We do not have a fire problem . . . we have a land \nmanagement problem.''\n  This isn't from a political member. This is from a scientist. And \nyes, we need more scientists in the woods and less lawyers.\n  That is why I am proud of what we did in the House on H.R. 2647. We \npassed it back in July because we saw this problem coming, and so we \ncrafted a solution. That is what we are all sent here to do. We were \nsent here for solutions, to look at the challenges ahead and make a \ndifference.\n  So this bill addresses both the fire borrowing problem and the \npractices that have created the crisis that we now, unfortunately, have \nto bear. It does address lawsuits that are frivolous. The number one \nexpense in the Forest Service is fighting forest fires, Number two is \nlitigation, and if they have any money left, then that is what they use \nfor management.\n  Why are we spending, this fire season, over $600 million in August \nalone? Don't we all agree that $600 million can be better utilized by \npreventing forest fires, by restoring habitat, by providing better \npublic access, better recreational activities and opportunities on our \npublic lands?\n  Unfortunately, we have lost this fire season, and still it burns.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate won't take up the bill. My fellow Montanan \nSenator Steve Daines has been a loud and vocal advocate of this bill. \nHe understands, and I am asking his colleagues to stand and do the \nright thing: Take the bill up. If you don't like a provision in the \nbill, then show leadership and put an amendment on it and we will work \ntogether to fix it. That is what leadership does. But to sit there and \nnot take up the bill and have no action is unacceptable.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. I thank the gentleman from Montana.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to add that when we passed this bill in the \nHouse, we put amendments on it that were offered by Democrats. We were \nopen. We listened. We wanted to do what is best for the forest.\n  I encourage the Senate to take up this bill. If there is something \nyou don't like, let's talk about it. But let's do what is best for the \nforest. Let's make this bill the law of the land.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis).\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. I join in thanking Representative Westerman for this \nlegislation and this Special Order tonight, explaining the extent to \nwhich these catastrophic wildfires are destroying the West and other \nareas of our country.\n  This year, over 9 million acres have burned in the West. It is a new \nrecord for catastrophic wildfires. This year, most of the damage has \nbeen in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and northern California.\n  You heard the gentleman from northern California earlier talk about \nthe number of houses that have been destroyed; the lives that have been \ndisrupted; the wildlife that has been destroyed; the habitat that has \nbeen destroyed; the carbon that has gone up in the air and the illness \nthat that has caused; the watersheds that are destroyed; the oxygen \nthat is destroyed when you have ash running down hillsides into \nstreams, choking the oxygen out of the water, killing the fish.\n  The habitat destruction, the effects on people and ungulates and fish \nand resources, it is irresponsible. We have a stewardship obligation \nfor these lands. We know how to manage these lands. This doesn't need \nto be happening.\n  Representative Westerman is a professional forester and an engineer. \nHe has spent his career studying the science of doing this right.\n  I have a photograph here of an example of how to do this right. He \nshowed us some earlier from his State of Arkansas. I want to show you \nhow his methodology works in the Black Hills that straddle the border \nbetween South Dakota and Wyoming.\n  You can't see this terribly clearly, but if you look at this vibrant \ngreen in the middle and compare it to the browns and yellows that you \nsee down here--Black Hills National Forest--that has been thinned, that \nhas been forested, that has been conservation logged.\n  It has created sunlight in places that were clogged and choked from \nsunlight. It has created healthy underbrush, as opposed to a clogged \nunderbrush that burns. It has allowed wildlife to graze. It allows snow \nto be stored and held longer in the forest into the spring and very \nearly summer before it melts and goes downstream, thereby preventing \nflooding downstream. It is a natural hedge against flooding.\n  We know all of this. All we have to do is pass and implement \nRepresentative Westerman's bill, and we can start preventing this.\n  The day to save a tree is yesterday, but this summer, because we have \nignored this problem for so long, we let 9 million more acres go up in \nsmoke in the West.\n  I spent the entire August work period in my State of Wyoming. \nAlthough Wyoming, thank God, wasn't on fire this summer--it has been in \nthe past--but I can tell you, every day, when I woke up on the western \nside of the State of Wyoming, my eyes were burning from fires that were \nburning hundreds of miles west of me in Idaho, in Oregon, in \nWashington, and in northern California.\n  To ignore science, to ignore management practices, and to allow this \nto continue is abominable.\n  The gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) has the answer. The House \npassed it. I urge the Senate to take it up.\n  I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for his thoughtful contribution \nto the Congress of the United States by serving here.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming for her comments, \nand I also thank her for pointing out that forest management is \ndifferent in different parts of the country.\n  We have trained forestry professionals all over this country. We have \ngood people working for the Forest Service that know how to do the \nright job, but their hands are tied. They can't use the things that \nthey have learned in forestry school. They can't use the things that \nthey have learned through practice. They can't practice the art of \nforestry and the science of forestry because of policy here in \nWashington, D.C.\n  We need to untie their hands so that they can implement these \nmanagement procedures on the land to make it healthier.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcClintock).\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking Congressman \nWesterman for organizing this Special Order tonight and for his \nindispensable work on the Natural Resources Committee and its \nSubcommittee on Federal Lands.\n  Mr. Westerman is a professional forester, schooled at Yale \nUniversity, which the founder of the U.S. Forest Service, Gifford \nPinchot, did so much to shape.\n  Mr. Westerman's H.R. 2647 represents the first step toward restoring \nthe sound, well-established, scientifically validated, and time-tested \nmethods that, for generations, produced healthy, thriving, and vibrant \nforests.\n  These forest management practices prevented vegetation and wildlife \nfrom overgrowing the ability of the land to support them. Not only did \nthis assure robust and healthy forests capable of resisting fire, \ndisease, and pestilence, but it also supported the prosperous economy.\n  Revenues from the sale of excess timber provided a steady stream of \nrevenues to the Treasury which could, in turn, be used to further \nimprove the public lands.\n  About 45 years ago, we replaced these sound management practices with \nwhat can only be described as a policy of benign neglect. In 1970, \nCongress adopted the National Environmental Policy Act that opened a \nfloodgate of ponderous and Byzantine laws, regulations, and lawsuits, \nwith the explicit promise that they would ``save the environment.''\n  Well, after 45 years of these policies, I think we are entitled to \nask: How is the environment doing?\n\n[[Page H6130]]\n\n  Well, according to every scrap of evidence submitted to our \nsubcommittee by a broad cross-section of experts, the answer is that \nthese laws have not only failed to improve the forest environment; they \nhave catastrophically harmed that environment.\n  Surplus timber harvested from our national forests as a result of \nthese laws has dropped dramatically since the 1980s, while acreage \ndestroyed by forest fire has increased concurrently and concomitantly. \nWildlife habitats that were supposed to be preserved are now being \nincinerated.\n  Precipitation that once flowed to riparian habitats now evaporates in \novergrown canopies or is quickly claimed in the fierce competition of \ndensely packed vegetation. We have lost vast tracts of our national \nforests to beetle infestations, as weakened trees can no longer resist \ntheir attacks.\n  The U.S. Forest Service reports that in the Tahoe Basin in my \ndistrict, there is now four times the vegetation density as normal, and \ntrees that once had room to grow and thrive now fight for their lives \nagainst other trees trying to occupy the same ground.\n  Revenues that our forest management agencies once produced and that \nfacilitated our forest stewardship have all but dried up. This has \ndevastated mountain communities that once thrived from the forest \neconomy, while precious resources are diverted for lifeline programs \nlike secure rural schools and PILT.\n  Despite a growing population, visitation to our national forests has \ndeclined significantly. We can no longer manage lands to prevent fire \nor even salvage dead timber once fire has destroyed it.\n\n  Appeals, lawsuits, and especially the threat of lawsuits have \nparalyzed and demoralized the Forest Service and created perverse \nincentives to do nothing to manage our lands.\n  The steadily deteriorating situation is forcing managers to raid \nforest treatment and fire prevention funds to pay for the growing costs \nof wildfire suppression, creating a fiscal death spiral--the more we \nraid prevention funds, the more wildfires we have; the more wildfires \nwe have, the more we have to raid our prevention funds.\n  Ironically, our private forest lands are today conspicuously \nhealthier than the public lands, precisely because the private lands \nare free from so many of the laws that are tying the hands of our \npublic foresters. These laws may be making environmental law firms \nrich, but they are killing our national forests.\n  H.R. 2647 is the first step toward restoring sound, rational, and \nscientific management of our national forests. It streamlines fire and \ndisease prevention programs and assures that fire-killed timber can be \nquickly removed to create both the revenues and the room to restore \nfire-damaged lands. It protects forest managers from frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  In my district, comprising the Sierra Nevada mountains in California, \ntwo major forest fires are now raging. The Butte fire in Amador County \nhas already killed two people, left hundreds homeless, and destroyed \n72,000 acres of forest land. The Rough fire in Fresno County has \ndestroyed 141,000 acres, and they are still burning tonight.\n  We have exhausted our firefighting budget, and, without relief, we \nwill have to begin stripping funds intended for fire prevention.\n  Mr. Westerman's bill would allow these catastrophic wildfires to be \nfunded like every other natural disaster.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have a very simple choice. We can continue the \nmisguided environmental laws that, for 45 years, have become \nresponsible for the destruction of hundreds of square miles of our \nnational forests every year, or we can restore the sound forest \nmanagement practices that will guarantee healthy and resilient forests \nfor the next generation.\n  This bill has already passed the House. It is now sitting in the \nSenate, and it is essential that the Senate act soon to put it on the \nPresident's desk.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. I thank the gentleman from California and would also \nlike to thank the gentleman for his tireless efforts on the Natural \nResources Committee, the chairman of the Federal Lands Subcommittee.\n  This is something that--I am a freshman, and I have been working on \nfor a small amount of time--but he has spent years working on this \nissue. I thank him for his tireless efforts and his desire to see \nhealthy forests not only in his home State but across the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer).\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, sometimes overlooked in the debate \nsurrounding wildfires is the importance of forestry practices intended \nto prevent the wildfires before they start.\n  The Resilient Federal Forests Act, authored by my friend from \nArkansas (Mr. Westerman), passed the House in July with bipartisan \nsupport. Since then, there have been multiple fires, major fires that \nare raging across the country.\n  This bill would simplify and streamline environmental process \nrequirements and reduce the cost of forest management projects intended \nto prevent catastrophic wildfires. The bill would also allow for quick \nremoval of dead trees to pay for reforestation after large fires and \nprevent the incidence of reburn.\n  As wildfires continue to burn in the Western United States, with \ntremendous costs to people and property, it is important to note that \nthese fires are literally sending billions of dollars of Federal assets \nup in smoke, depriving State government, local government, and the \nFederal Government of billions in revenues not just in wood products, \nbut in recreation revenues.\n  I am a small forest owner myself. I understand the value of a healthy \nwell-managed forest.\n  Mr. Speaker, America has already lost 9 million acres in valuable \nforests this year. Our forests continue to burn and more will be burned \nunless we act on this legislation. I encourage my colleagues in the \nSenate to quickly pass this much-needed legislation and send it to the \nPresident's desk.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. I thank the gentleman from Alabama. We are from \nSouthern States, but good forestry management is very important to us \nas well. I have about 2.5 million acres of Federal forest in my \ndistrict in Arkansas, and we want to see that land managed properly. We \ndon't want to see it go up in smoke.\n  Mr. Speaker, we face a lot of contentious issues in this body and in \nCongress, but this shouldn't be one of them.\n  President Roosevelt, who was the father of our national forests, \nalong with Gifford Pinchot, said that this is one of our most treasured \nnatural resources. We need to leave it in better shape for the next \ngeneration than what we received it in.\n  Right now, we are not doing that. This is not a partisan issue. This \nis something that we need to look at the science, we need to work \ntogether, and we need to do what is right for America. We need to do \nwhat is right for forests because healthy forests create a winning \nsituation on many levels.\n  We get better air quality. We get better water quality. We get a \nbetter economy. We get better wildlife habitat. We sequester more \ncarbon.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  There is not a downside to a healthy forest, but we have to get our \nact right here in Washington, D.C.\n  It is with that that I, again, plead with and encourage the Senate to \ntake up this issue. Let's have a debate on it. Let's fix this and get \nourselves back on the right path to healthy forests. We didn't get here \novernight, and we are not going to fix everything overnight, but we \nhave to start sometime. The sooner we start, the sooner we can have our \nforests back in a healthy condition and the sooner we can enjoy this \nnational treasure that belongs to all of us in America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6130-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6130-H6133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              VOTE ``NO'' TO DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts?\n\n[[Page H6131]]\n\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of talk \nabout defunding Planned Parenthood. Some Republicans have made this \nsuch a priority that they are vowing to shut down our government, shut \ndown our programs for veterans and hinder their ability to access \nservices, WIC programs serving moms and babies, curtail services for \ndomestic violence, and close our national parks and landmarks.\n  The last Republican shutdown cost our economy $24 billion, but many \nof the GOP's Presidential candidates said in their debate just last \nnight that defunding Planned Parenthood is a priority.\n  We are not talking about abortion here. We are talking about access \nto health care. Under current law, Federal money cannot be used for the \ncoverage for abortion except in the most extreme circumstances of rape, \nincest, or the possibility of the death of the mother. Even though most \nAmericans disagree with that restriction and believe firmly that \ndecisions surrounding pregnancy should be between a woman, her doctor, \nand her faith, that is not the law of the land currently.\n  So if we are not talking about abortion, what are we talking about? \nWhat is this threat that will be stopped by cutting off all Federal \nfunding for Planned Parenthood? What we are talking about is denying \nhealth care to the 2.7 million patients who received care just last \nyear at Planned Parenthood.\n  More than 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does is preventative \ncare. This includes wellness exams, cancer screenings, contraception, \nprenatal care, and testing and treatment for STIs. Just last year, \nPlanned Parenthood had over 2 million contraception patients, performed \napproximately 3.7 million STI tests, 370,000 Pap tests, and 450,000 \nbreast exams. These are the types of services patients receive at \nPlanned Parenthood, and this preventive health care is what the \nmajority would like to get rid of by defunding it.\n  That is what is most important about this debate: the care that \npatients receive, the care that one in five American women will receive \nfrom Planned Parenthood at some point in their life.\n  I would like to welcome my colleague, at this point, from New \nJersey's 12th District, Congresswoman Watson Coleman. She is a strong \nvoice for women and families. I am proud to call her a friend and a \ncolleague, and I yield to the gentlewoman.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, for the umpteenth time, men in Congress are leading the \ncharge to limit women's access to health care, but now, instead of just \nwasting taxpayer dollars and time, they plan to take their outrageous \ntactics to a whole new level, perhaps shutting down the entire Federal \nGovernment if they don't get their way. As the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts has already explained, that is absolutely ridiculous.\n  Rather than consider legislation that would fund repairs to our \nNation's infrastructure or invest in our schools or create jobs for \nmillions of Americans still out of work, we are considering legislation \nthat would cut off support to an organization that provides vital \nhealth services to women and men who might not otherwise have access.\n  Mr. Speaker, Planned Parenthood is, first and foremost, an \norganization dedicated to women's health. What is more, despite the \nendless conservative rhetoric to the contrary, Planned Parenthood does \nnot use a single dollar of Federal funds to provide abortions. This is \nreally just a thinly veiled attempt to allow Congress to regulate a \nwoman's uterus, and the end result won't be the end of very legal \nabortions. It will be the erosion of care, family planning, and medical \ntreatment for thousands of women.\n  Wednesday's Washington Post offered a perfect example. It profiled a \nsingle Planned Parenthood clinic in Ohio, a clinic that does not offer \nabortion services. According to The Post, that clinic sees 7,100 \npatients each year, most of them young and poor. They administer 3,400 \npregnancy tests, they write 2,900 birth control prescriptions, and they \nprovide 13,200 screenings for sexually transmitted infections.\n  Facilities like this make up nearly half of the Planned Parenthood \ncenters nationwide. Cutting their funding will only result in more \nillness, more unplanned pregnancies, and more babies born to mothers \nunprepared to care for them.\n  In 2013, Planned Parenthood provided more than 71,000 patients with \ncare in my State, the State of New Jersey. They provided almost 16,000 \nPap tests to New Jersey women, and they conducted more than 33,000 \nbreast exams.\n  In a shortsighted response to a series of questionably edited videos \nand false claims, we are going to take health care away from Americans \nwith few, if any, alternatives. That is not what my constituents \nelected me for. That is not what they expected me to be doing in \nCongress. I am here to create jobs, to better educate our young people, \nand to reform our broken criminal justice system. By no means am I here \nto relitigate a woman's right to choose.\n  Quite frankly, I am not sure which I am more disgusted by: the fact \nthat we are doing this again, or the fact that I have come to the floor \nof this House so many times before to express that disgust.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider taking up the work that really \nmatters to the American people. I thank the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey.\n  I want to reiterate something that the Congresswoman said, that this \nis really a thinly veiled extremist position. What we are talking about \nis exactly as the gentlewoman from New Jersey put it. We are talking \nabout relitigating rights that are established under the law and that \nhave really nothing to do with abortion. They are having everything to \ndo with the way that one in five American women receives her health \ncare. And Planned Parenthood not only has a huge reach in the patients \nthat they serve, but they historically serve low-income and underserved \npopulations.\n  For example, in 2013, 78 percent of Planned Parenthood patients had \nincomes of 150 percent of poverty or less. To put that in real terms, \nthat is an income of a little over $36,000 dollars a year for a family \nof four. So not only does Planned Parenthood provide critical services \nto low-income families, but they also have a geographic reach to help \nensure all patients have a healthcare access point.\n  Nationwide, they represent 54 percent of all health centers in rural \nareas, medically underserved areas, and health provider shortage areas. \nAnd in some areas, they are even a larger part of the healthcare \nsystem. In Alabama, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Louisiana, Mississippi, \nMontana, Rhode Island, and Wyoming, they are 100 percent of the health \ncenters in rural areas, medically underserved areas, and health \nprovider shortage areas. That is why Planned Parenthood is so critical.\n  I am delighted to yield to my colleague from California's 33rd \nDistrict. Congressman Lieu represents communities in Los Angeles. He is \nan Air Force veteran and Reservist, president of the freshman class of \nDemocrats, and, as a California State senator, and now as a \nCongressman, he has had an unparalleled record on women's issues.\n  I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Thank you, Representative Clark, for your \ngreat work on this issue.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  September 17, 2015, on page H6131, the following appeared: Mr. \nLIEU. Thank you, Representative\n  \n  The online version should be corrected to read: Mr. TED LIEU of \nCalifornia. Thank you, Representative\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Madam Speaker, I rise to stand with Planned Parenthood.\n  Last month, as it became more and more clear that Republicans were \nwilling to shut down the Federal Government to defund Planned \nParenthood, I received a letter from a constituent of mine in Los \nAngeles. She gave me permission to read her letter. It says:\n\n       Dear Congressman Lieu,\n       I grew up in a small desert town that had a very high teen \n     pregnancy and high school dropout rate. I made very poor \n     choices as a young teenager, and I was drinking, partying, \n     and ditching school at 15. During this time, I met a boy I \n     cared for and started having sex. I knew that I didn't want \n     to end up pregnant like a lot of young girls in my town, so I \n     went to the one place I knew would help: Planned Parenthood. \n     They made me feel comfortable there. They performed a \n     thorough exam and gave me birth control pills. They also \n     contacted me confidentially to tell me I had an STD and would \n     need to take antibiotics. Without treatment, this STD could \n     have made me permanently infertile.\n       I thank God that I straightened my act out and, by the end \n     of high school, I was getting\n\n[[Page H6132]]\n\n     straight A's. I went to a good college, graduated from \n     medical school, and began my residency. I met a great guy, \n     who is now my husband, and again went to Planned Parenthood \n     for birth control bills, STD screening, and Pap smears. \n     Several years later, I finally went off the birth control \n     pills, and my husband and I got pregnant with our first of \n     two healthy children.\n       I feel compelled to share my story because of everything \n     that Planned Parenthood has done for me in my lifetime. \n     Planned Parenthood allowed me to make good, healthy \n     reproductive decisions and avoid ever having to make a \n     decision as to whether or not to abort an unwanted pregnancy.\n\n  That letter is from one of many constituents and from millions of \nwomen across America that have benefited from Planned Parenthood.\n  The two bills on the floor today that are attacking Planned \nParenthood are a direct attack on American women. In reality, a vote to \ndefund Planned Parenthood is a vote to deny health care, education, and \nopportunity to millions of Americans like my constituent.\n  I stand with American women and with Planned Parenthood in opposition \nto these two bills, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Thank you, Congressman Lieu. We \nappreciate your coming. The story that you shared is repeated over and \nover with the millions of women that count on Planned Parenthood for \ntheir healthcare services.\n  I would now like to yield to my colleague from Tennessee's Ninth \nDistrict. Congressman Cohen is a champion on women's issues and a \nlifelong supporter of Planned Parenthood.\n  Mr. COHEN. Thank you very much for the time, and thank you for \nscheduling this important hour, Special Order.\n  Madam Speaker, this issue is extremely important to women, to men, to \nthe Constitution, and to progress, and this week has been, \nunfortunately, very much an example of what the House has been doing \nthroughout this session--messaging.\n  We are about to have a shutdown of government because of Planned \nParenthood, and the cost to our economy and to people for a shutdown of \nthe Federal Government is astronomical. The last shutdown, which I \nthink was in 2013--it might have been 2011--cost hundreds of billions \nof dollars to the economy. The stock market fell, people lost jobs, \nlost income, and lost services all because of Planned Parenthood.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  The bottom line is that Planned Parenthood is an outstanding \norganization that serves women in this Nation, in my State, and in my \ncity--mostly low-income women and a lot of women of color.\n  There, they get their basic female healthcare services whether it is \ncervical cancer exams, breast cancer exams, sexually transmitted \ndisease tests, family planning programs.\n  It is not about abortion. A very small part of it is abortion. It is \nnot called ``Planned Abortion.'' It is called ``Planned Parenthood.''\n  Madam Speaker, most people are in need of those services. To cut them \nout, as they talked about, and to give them to community health centers \nis not the answer. That doesn't work as it is going to disadvantage a \nlot of women.\n  What we have had this week is a bill--the most recent bill--did \nanybody discuss the fact that this second bill didn't go to committee? \nI guess it is called the ``unborn baby bill,'' whatever it is. Has that \nbeen discussed?\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. No.\n  Mr. COHEN. That is the amazing thing. This bill that has come up--\nthat will come up tomorrow, I guess--never went to committee. In fact, \nit was kind of just sprung on us on Monday, and they didn't even get \nthe language straight until maybe Tuesday.\n  Madam Speaker, in the Congress, we generally have committee meetings. \nYou have a hearing on a bill almost always--that is what committees are \nfor, is to have hearings--sometimes by a subcommittee and then, later, \nby a full committee--and a markup, sometimes by the subcommittee, \nalways at least by the full committee. Then it goes to the Rules \nCommittee, and then it comes to the floor.\n  When this Congress came about, the majority party made a big deal \nabout how they were going to come in and change the way things were \ndone and how there was going to be regular order.\n  Bills weren't going to be brought to the floor without any notice; \ncommittees would do their work; amendments would be offered; and people \nwould get an opportunity to testify from the public.\n  This bill was given no markup in committee, no hearing in committee, \nno opportunity for the public to voice any concerns as to whether they \nwere for it or against it, and no Congresspeople on the committee had a \nchance to voice their concerns.\n  In essence, it was sprung on the public. The bill will have a new \ndefinition of ``abortion''--unknown before in Federal law. That is a \npretty major thing--with no hearing, no notice, no opportunity to \naddress the issue, no opportunity to maybe bring in somebody who is an \nexpert to say: You might have missed this. You might have missed that. \nThis is the way it ought to be. No.\n  Madam Speaker, this week in Congress, the Republican side has \nbasically said: We don't want to hear from the public. We don't want to \nhear from doctors. We don't want to hear from women. We don't want to \nhear from them on another bill we had up today. We don't want to hear \nfrom judges on something that affects the Federal courts, where the \njudges, in reviewing it, voted by 85 percent ``bad idea''--no judges, \nno lawyers, no doctors, no women, no public--because that side of the \nHouse knows how to do everything.\n  They know how to define ``abortion.'' They know how to run the \ncourts. They know how to run women's lives. Choice and reproduction \nshould be a decision between a woman, her family, her conscience, and \nher doctor, not what this side wants.\n  What this side wants is to repeal Roe v. Wade. They want to do away \nwith a woman's right to abortion. That is what this is about. They pick \nthese other issues to talk about, but that is what they really want. If \nthat happens, it is going to be no different than alcohol prohibition \nin the twenties and marijuana today.\n  Alcohol was illegal. So what happened? People got alcohol and they \ndrank, but they drank because organized crime supplied it for them--no \ntaxes, lots of organized crime, lots of killings between organized \ncrime.\n  Marijuana. Do people have problems getting marijuana? People don't \nhave problems getting marijuana. It is everywhere. It was at George \nBush's school. It is everywhere. It is not hard to get, but it gives \nthe cartels a way to sell it. It happens.\n  Madam Speaker, when abortion was illegal in this country, wealthy \nwomen could afford to go to Mexico or wherever it was legal and get \nabortions. Poor people went to get abortions, but they had to go to \nsomebody who maybe didn't have a clean area in which to do the \nprocedure or the experience or the ability. Poor women went to back \nalleys and oftentimes had health detriments because of it and sometimes \nlost their lives.\n  So abortion is not going to be outlawed in this Congress, I don't \nthink, but that is what they would like to do. Even if it is outlawed, \nit is still going to happen. If it happens, it is going to happen for \nthe rich, and the poor are going to get the worst services.\n  You can't take your morality and tell the American public, when they \nwant some service, some opportunity, some freedom, that they can't have \nit, because they will find it. It will just be through a roundabout \nway.\n  Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. Clark for having this Special Order. I am \ngoing to always support Roe v. Wade and support Planned Parenthood. It \ndoes a lot for the women in my district. As I said, it is one of the \nbest organizations in our country, and I believe that.\n  They help women with services they otherwise couldn't get. In a lot \nof States like mine, where the Affordable Care Act has not been \nextended through the expansion of Medicaid, it is even more difficult \nfor poor women to get medical services and even life-saving services.\n  So thank you. We will continue to message and continue to fight and \nhope the American public realizes that what is going on here is \nshutting them out--no voice, no message--simply activity.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for \nhis words and for his commitment\n\n[[Page H6133]]\n\nto women and their access to health care and for pointing out the \nconfounding thing about defunding Planned Parenthood, which is that we \nare not even talking about abortion, as we have already restricted that \nFederal funding.\n  Madam Speaker, we are talking about access to health care to \nunderserved women, to low-income women, who are trying to get general \nwellness checkups, who are trying to have cancer screenings, who are \ntrying to access health care.\n  It is Planned Parenthood that fills that void in our underserved \npopulations, in our rural areas. That is where they make a critical \ndifference.\n  You are absolutely right in that the messaging that this is somehow \nabout something else is completely hiding the fact that we are bringing \nbills to the floor without committee hearings, that we are not being \ntransparent, and that we are misleading the American public about what \nthis debate is about.\n  I am delighted that we also have another champion for working \nfamilies and a great voice for the communities he serves.\n  I yield to my colleague from California's 36th District, Congressman \nRuiz.\n  Mr. RUIZ. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of a woman's right to choose, \nwomen's health, and Planned Parenthood.\n  You see, before I ran for Congress, I spent 9 years as an emergency \nmedicine physician. A few years ago, a 55-year-old woman came into my \nemergency room with a gynecological hemorrhage.\n  After we stopped the bleeding in the ER, we admitted her for \ndiagnosis and treatment. Sadly, as I suspected, she had advanced \ncervical cancer, and 5 months later, she died, leaving her family \nbehind.\n  Until recently, cervical cancer was the leading cause of cancer \ndeaths for women in the United States. However, over the past 40 years, \nwe have dramatically reduced the number of deaths from cervical cancer.\n  According to the CDC, ``This decline largely is the result of many \nwomen getting regular Pap tests, which can find cervical pre-cancer \nbefore it turns into cancer.''\n  Madam Speaker, that is what is at stake in this debate.\n  In fact, 97 percent of Planned Parenthood's services are not abortion \nrelated. Planned Parenthood provides many health and wellness services, \nincluding STI testing, contraceptives, and cancer screenings to over 2 \nmillion women and men each year.\n  Opponents of Planned Parenthood's want to turn this into a debate \nabout abortion, but it is not. Let's be clear. Defunding Planned \nParenthood won't reduce the number of abortions at all.\n  This is a debate about cervical cancer. This is a debate about breast \ncancer. This is a debate about how many women we are going to allow to \ngo undiagnosed and untreated. This is a debate about how many women we \nare going to allow to show up in emergency rooms like mine, with \nterminal cancer, too late to be saved.\n  In California alone, Planned Parenthood health centers have provided \nover 93,000 Pap tests for cervical cancer and 97,000 breast exams to \nhelp prevent death from breast cancer.\n  Madam Speaker, Planned Parenthood saves lives.\n  Here is who actually loses if Planned Parenthood loses its funding: \nWomen in geographically underserved areas lose; uninsured and \nunderinsured women lose; women on Medicaid lose; and low-income women \nlose.\n  Planned Parenthood fills that access gap and provides essential \nhealth services to those who need it the most. Cutting their funding \nwill have a long-term, devastating effect on the overall health of \nwomen in our communities, worsening health outcomes and health \ndisparities for women across our Nation.\n  To me, this isn't a political debate, because I have seen firsthand \nwhat happens when women don't have access to preventative care. Women \ndie; children are left without their mothers; and families are torn \napart.\n  It is for these reasons that I oppose this misguided, mean-spirited, \npolitically driven measure, and it is for these reasons that I stand \nwith Planned Parenthood.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman from California for \nsharing his experience as a medical doctor and as someone who stands \nwith Planned Parenthood.\n  Thank you for joining us.\n  Congressman Ruiz raises an interesting point about looking at our \nsystem of health care.\n  Part of the proposal from the Republicans is that this is easy, that \nwe can simply take the money from Planned Parenthood and give it to \ncommunity health centers, but there is simply not the capacity in the \nsystem to handle these extra patients.\n  Currently, more than half of Medicaid providers are not offering \nappointments to new Medicaid patients, but two-thirds of the States \nreport difficulty in ensuring enough providers, including OB/GYN care.\n  Madam Speaker, this hurts low-income women especially hard because 60 \npercent of Planned Parenthood patients access care through Medicaid \nand/or Title X, and 35 percent of women view their OB/GYN as their main \nsource of care.\n  So what we are talking about here is not abortion, but women's health \ncare, preventative measures that save lives.\n  We know that over 90 percent of the services Planned Parenthood \nprovides are preventative. We know that they serve underserved areas.\n  We know that there isn't enough capacity to see these patients in \nother settings and that eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood \nwould mean over 390,000 patients would no longer receive health care.\n  If all of this sounds crazy to you, you are not alone. It is why I \ncame down here tonight, and I thank my colleagues who joined me.\n  It is time that we reveal the falsehoods of this argument and defeat \nthese efforts--these radical efforts--that are threatening to shut down \nour government in order to defund Planned Parenthood, which carries so \nmuch of our healthcare system for women in this country and especially \nfor low-income women.\n  It is time we stand up, debunk the lies and the mysteries that we are \nbeing told, and let women have the healthcare access that they need and \ndeserve.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/house-section/article/H6133-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate has passed with an amendment in which the concurrence \nof the House is requested, a bill of the House of the following title:\n\n       H.R. 719.
