And it is not just patients who suffer. Family \nmembers and caregivers, too, often bear the brunt of this tragic and \nemotionally draining disease. I know this personally, having lost my \nmother to complications from Alzheimer's on January 28, 2011.\n  Please consider taking a few hours out of your weekend to benefit \nAlzheimer's awareness and research for south Florida's elderly and the \nfamilies who support and love them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/02/house-section/article/H7350-5", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING AMERICA'S VETERANS AND MILITARY FAMILIES\n\n  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. FOXX.

Liberty is bought and paid for by the incomprehensible \ngenerosity of these patriots.\n  We also honor the commitment and sacrifices of our military families \nby celebrating Military Family Month in November. Through deployments, \nseparations, and moves across the country and overseas, these families \ninspire us as they endure the extended absence of their loved ones with \ngrace, strength, and devotion.\n  America is the land of the free because we are the home of the brave. \nI thank our veterans for seeing the value of freedom and rising to \nAmerica's defense with unfailing strength. I thank our military \nfamilies for standing with our servicemembers, supporting that great \nbravery, and sharing in the sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/02/house-section/article/H7350-6", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATIONS TO PAUL DAVIS RYAN\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, congratulations to \nAmerica's new Speaker of the House, Paul Davis Ryan.\n  I have been grateful to serve with the Speaker for a number of years, \nand I know he is a proven conservative. I know his positive commitment \nto the people of the First District of Wisconsin and every corner of \nour Nation, which he visited while campaigning in 2012.\n  I look forward to Speaker Ryan's conservative leadership, cited in \nthe National Journal Daily as ``chief Democratic villain in \nWashington.'' He was also condemned as a ``budget-slashing fiend.'' \nDespite these attacks, his service will advance meaningful, \nconservative change for the American people, limiting government, and \nexpanding freedom. Congress has a positive leader, as we work to \npromote a strong national defense of peace through strength.\n  The Economist identified the Speaker as a dogmatic conservative with \nfaith in supply-side reform for growth-boosting.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and the President, by his \nactions, must never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n  Our sympathy and prayers to the people of Russia upon the deaths of \n224 persons onboard the Metrojet charter flight in Egypt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/02/house-section/article/H7350-7", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING LINDA CHMIELEWSKI\n\n  (Mr. EMMER of Minnesota asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota.

She has effectively overseen the hospital's nursing \ndepartment and ensures that her patients receive quality care, making \nher fully deserving of this award.\n  This is not the first time that Linda has been recognized for \nexemplary work. In 2014, she was honored by the Women's Health \nLeadership Trust, again, for her leadership in the healthcare field.\n  Nursing is a noble profession. We have all been cared for by a nurse, \nso we all know they go to great lengths for their patients. Without \ncaring individuals like Linda, our healthcare system would suffer.

In particular, the continuing crackdown \non opposition members, which has included assassinations, extra-\njudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, and torture, have worsened \nsignificantly during the election campaign that returned President \nNkurunziza to power earlier this year. In addition, the Government of \nBurundi has blocked opposing parties from holding organizational \nmeetings and campaigning throughout the electoral process. Police and \narmed youth militias with links to the ruling party have intimidated \nthe opposition, contributing to nearly 200,000 refugees fleeing the \ncountry since April 2015. Accordingly, I intend to terminate the \ndesignation of Burundi as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country \nunder AGOA as of January 1, 2016.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, October 30, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/02/house-section/article/H7351-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Insider Threat Program.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. King) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. The bill under \nconsideration ensures that the Department of Homeland Security has the \nauthority and congressional mandate to create a robust Insider Threat \nProgram.\n  In the Manning and Snowden espionage scandals, two trusted insiders \nabused their access to classified information. When Aaron Alexis \nattacked the Washington Navy Yard, 12 Americans lost their lives. In \nthe face of these insider threat scenarios, it is vital that government \nagencies have the tools to detect and disrupt future insider threat \nsituations before damage is done. Unfortunately, all three were able to \nconduct their traitorous work undetected because the government had at \none time vetted and granted them access to secure facilities and \ninformation systems.\n  H.R. 3361 reinforces the message that a security clearance is a \nprivilege granted to individuals who have pledged to protect the \nAmerican people from threats domestically and abroad. Had investigators \nmore thoroughly scrutinized Edward Snowden's background, they might \nhave identified disturbing trends that made him unfit to hold a \nclearance of any kind and a potential insider threat to U.S. national \nsecurity. Had Federal adjudicators had access to criminal history \nrecords from the Seattle Police Department, they would have been aware \nof Aaron Alexis' arrest in 2004 on firearms charges and potentially \nconducted a more rigorous screening of his background prior to \nauthorizing him access to the Washington Navy Yard.\n  Trusted insiders, going back to Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen, not \nonly severely damaged national security, their traitorous actions led \nto the loss of life. In each case, the post-breach review highlighted \nthat the previously trusted individual exhibited suspicious behavior, \nbut it was not reported due to a lack of understanding by colleagues or \nfailures in the reinvestigation process.\n  In describing the new type of insider threat represented by Snowden \nand WikiLeaks, Michael Hayden correctly concluded that, ``in this new, \nmodern, connected era, the trusted insider who betrays us is far more \nempowered to do damage far greater than these kinds of people were able \nto do in the past. And therefore we have to be even more vigilant.''\n  The Department of Homeland Security has over 280,000 employees, \nincluding tens of thousands with access to classified or sensitive \ninformation. The Department has an existing Insider Threat Program and \nis moving forward to increase security controls on internal systems, \nbut much more remains to be done.\n  The bill directs DHS to develop a strategy for the Department to \nidentify, prevent, mitigate, and respond to insider threats, and \nrequires DHS to ensure that personnel understand what workplace \nbehavior may be indicative of a potential insider threat and how their \nactivity on DHS networks will be monitored.\n  The bill codifies a comprehensive Insider Threat Program at DHS that \ncan be implemented throughout the Department and its component agencies \nand, most importantly, reinforces the importance of preventing future \ninsider attacks.\n  I want to thank Homeland Security Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member \nThompson, Ranking Member Higgins, and Congressmen Katko, Donovan, and \nBarletta for working with me to bring this bill to the floor. The bill \nwent through regular order and received bipartisan support during \nsubcommittee and full committee consideration.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can establish a \ncomprehensive, transparent DHS-wide Insider Threat Program that is a \nmodel for the public and private sectors.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3361, the Department of Homeland Security \nInsider Threat and Mitigation Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3361, the Department of Homeland Security Insider \nThreat and Mitigation Act of 2015, authorizes the Department of \nHomeland Security to address the homeland and national security risk \nposed by trusted insiders.\n  Typically, trusted insiders are given unrestricted access to mission-\ncritical assets such as personnel, facilities, and computer networks. \nWhile DHS, like other Federal agencies, conducts extensive vetting of \nprospective employees, there remains a risk that someone who gains \n``insider status'' exploits their position to damage the United States \nthrough espionage, terrorism, or even the unauthorized disclosure of \nsensitive national security information.\n  As the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, I am \nsupportive of the Department of Homeland Security's current Insider \nThreat Program. It is targeted at preventing and detecting when a \nvetted DHS employee or contractor with authorized access to U.S. \nGovernment resources, including personnel, facilities, information, \nequipment, networks, and systems, exploits such access for nefarious, \nterroristic, or criminal purposes.\n  While I support the DHS program, I could not support this legislation \nwhen it was considered by the full committee because it did not include \nlanguage to prevent the somewhat broad authority granted under this \nbill for being used by DHS to deploy ``continuous evaluation.'' \nContinuous evaluation is an automated system that constantly monitors \npublic and private databases for information regarding the credit, \ncriminal, and social media activities of certain individuals. The \nDefense Department has an extensive pilot underway, and I am concerned \nthat Federal agencies, with the understandable urge to protect their IT \nsystems and facilities, are racing to acquire this capability before \nknowing whether such costly systems are even effective.\n  At this time, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. King) about some concerns I have with the prospect \nthat the Department will use the authority under this act to establish \na continuous evaluation program.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Would the gentleman agree that it is important that, prior to \nestablishing any such program under which certain DHS employees would \nbe subjected to ongoing automated credit, criminal, or social media \nmonitoring, the Department engages Congress about not only the \npotential costs and benefits of such a program but what protections \nwould be in place for workers subject to such program?\n  I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. King).\n  Mr. KING of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Yes, I agree with the gentleman from Mississippi. The implementation \nof the Insider Threat Program, including a possible continuous \nevaluation component, needs congressional oversight and must be \ntransparent.\n\n[[Page H7353]]\n\n  I look forward to working with the gentleman from Mississippi on this \nissue as we go forward.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, we live at a time when the threats to our Nation are \ncomplex. None of us want to see someone exploit their access to DHS \nnetworks to carry out cybercrimes or other criminal activity.\n  Even as DHS works to detect and prevent such threats, it is important \nthat such activities be carried out in a transparent way so as not to \ncompound the chronic morale challenges that exist within the workforce.\n  Each time DHS considers making an adjustment to its Insider Threat \nProgram, thoughtful consideration must be paid to whether the \noperational drawbacks and costs of such an adjustment outweigh the \nbenefit of such change.\n  That said, I commend General Taylor, the Under Secretary for \nIntelligence and Analysis at DHS, for the attention he has given to the \ninsider threat challenge and look forward to continuing to work with \nhim to bolster security within the Department.\n  I appreciate the gentleman from New York's cooperation and colloquy. \nI look forward to the successful passage and approval of this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me also at the outset thank the distinguished \nranking member for his support and his cooperation as this bill has \ngone forward. I am sure the two of us will be able to continue to work \nand cooperate as, again, this will be monitored in the future.\n  The Department of Homeland Security and all Federal agencies are \ntargeted by adversaries on a daily basis. Some of the most damaging \nattacks to the U.S. Government have been committed by U.S. citizens who \nhave been granted access to government facilities and electronic \nnetworks.\n  This bill provides the framework for DHS to implement an Insider \nThreat Program that identifies and disrupts malicious insiders who seek \nto do the Department and its employees harm. It also seeks to protect \nthe Department's workforce by conducting a transparent process to \nreinforce cyber hygiene, data security, and awareness of malicious \nactivity through a robust training program.\n  I want to thank the committee staff, especially John Neal and Tyler \nLowe.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3361.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 3361, the ``Department of \nHomeland Security Insider Threat and Mitigation Act.''\n  I am in support of this bill because it amends the Homeland Security \nAct of 2002 to direct the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to \nestablish an Insider Threat Program, which shall: provide training and \neducation for DHS personnel to identify, prevent, mitigate, and respond \nto insider threat risks to DHS's critical assets; provide investigative \nsupport regarding such threats; and conduct risk mitigation activities \nfor such threats.\n  The Department of Homeland Security will establish a Steering \nCommittee headed by the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis \nwho will serve as the Chair; and the Chief Security Officer of the \noffice as the Vice Chair of the Committee.\n  The Under Secretary and the Chief Security Officer, in coordination \nwith the Steering Committee, shall: develop a holistic strategy for \nDHS-wide efforts to identify, prevent, mitigate, and respond to insider \nthreats to DHS's critical assets; develop a plan to implement the \nstrategy across DHS components and offices; document insider threat \npolicies and controls; conduct a baseline risk assessment of such \nthreats; examine existing programmatic and technology best practices \nadopted by the federal government, industry, and research institutions; \ndevelop a timeline for deploying workplace monitoring technologies, \nemployee awareness campaigns, and education and training programs \nrelated to potential insider threats; consult with the Under Secretary \nfor Science and Technology and other stakeholders to ensure that the \nInsider Threat Program is informed by current information regarding \nthreats, best practices, and available technology; and develop, \ncollect, and report metrics on the effectiveness of DHS's insider \nthreat mitigation efforts.\n  Threat mitigation is focused on blunting the effectiveness of threats \nposed by terrorists seeking to carry out attacks in the United States.\n  This is a core mission of the Department of Homeland Security and \nthis bill will support that mission.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. King) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 3361, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/02/house-section/article/H7353-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7353-H7355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY CLEARANCE MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION \n                                  ACT\n\n  Mr. KING of New York.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation.\n  In 2013, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper called the \nnumber of individuals with clearances ``too high.'' In a memo to \ngovernment agencies, Director Clapper expressed his concern with the \ngrowing number of individuals with access to classified information, \nparticularly TS/SCI clearances.\n  H.R. 3505 complements the bill the House just passed, H.R. 3361. One \nimportant element of any Insider Threat Program is knowing who has \naccess to classified information and who has a need to know specific \ninformation.\n  This bill requires the DHS Secretary to conduct a review of all \npositions within the Department designated as positions of national \nsecurity to confirm whether or not those positions continue to require \nsecurity clearances.\n  This is an example of good government. The bill directs the \nDepartment to conduct an inventory of its positions that require \nsecurity clearances and assess what positions may be duplicative or are \nno longer necessary.\n  As we know, security clearances are costly to investigate, \nadjudicate, and maintain. This bill will ensure that DHS conducts a \nthorough screening of its workforce needs and reduces the number of \npositions, if determined appropriate.\n  The bill introduced by Ranking Member Thompson is an example of the \naccounting that each Federal department should be conducting today and \nwill lead to a more lean and effective Department of Homeland Security \nin the future.\n  I urge support for the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3505, the Department of \nHomeland Security Clearance Management and Administration Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to start off by thanking the chairman of the \nCounterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee, Mr. King, as well as \nChairman McCaul, for their support of my bill.\n  I introduced H.R. 3505, the Department of Homeland Security Clearance \nManagement and Administration Act, to make specific reforms in how the \nDepartment manages its security clearance process. Specifically, H.R. \n3505 addresses how DHS carries out the complex and extensive tasks of \nidentifying positions that warrant security clearances, investigating \ncandidates for clearances, and administering its clearance \nadjudications, denials, suspensions, revocations, and appeals process.\n  Since September 11, there has been a massive proliferation of \noriginal and derivative classified materials across the Federal \nGovernment. Along with the enormous growth of classified material \nholdings has come a sizeable growth in the number of Federal positions \nrequiring security clearances.\n  H.R. 3505 reflects recent regulations issued by the Office of \nPersonnel Management and the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence to help ensure that Federal agencies make correct \ndesignations for national security positions and, in turn, avoid the \ncostly exercise of recruiting, investigating, and hiring an individual \nat a clearance level and salary well above what is necessary.\n  H.R. 3505 seeks to put DHS on a path of right-sizing the position \ndesignations for its workforce. Specifically, my bill directs the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that the \nsensitivity levels of national security positions are designated \nappropriately across the Department and its components.\n  It also requires the Department's Chief Security Officer to audit \nnational security positions periodically to ensure that such security \ndesignations are still appropriate.\n  Additionally, the bill requires the Department to develop a plan to \nensure that adjudications of eligibility for a security clearance are \ndone accurately across the Department.\n  Lastly, in response to the growing security threat from data \nbreaches, this act also provides safeguards for the protection of the \napplicant's personal information.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, my bill seeks to take targeted steps at \nimproving critical aspects of how the Department of Homeland Security \nadministers its security clearance program.\n  If enacted, H.R. 3505 would make DHS a leader among Federal agencies\n\n[[Page H7355]]\n\nwith respect to security clearance and position designation practices. \nI ask for my colleagues' support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 3505.\n  I commend the ranking member, the gentleman from Mississippi, for \nauthoring this legislation. I am proud to support it. It is a \ncommonsense, good-government bill that will reduce waste and improve \nsecurity.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border \nand Maritime Security, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3505 the \n``Fusion Center Enhancement Act,'' which would guarantee improvement of \nsecurity for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  This bill requires the Homeland Security Department to provide \ntraining to appropriate staff of the Department to determine \neligibility for access to classified information.\n  At least 88 DHS workers have been on administrative leave pending \nresolution of claims against them, according to the office of Senator \nCharles Grassley (R-Iowa).\n  Four workers had been on leave for three years or more with another \n17 on leave for two years or more. The 88 were placed on leave for a \nvariety of reasons.\n  Amongst those reasons it was noted that 13 were placed on leave due \nto security clearance issues.\n  Earlier this year officials said that a database holding sensitive \nsecurity clearance information on millions of prior, current, as well \nas potential federal employees and contractors was compromised, via a \nChinese Breach.\n  That database was also breached last year by the Chinese in a \nseparate incident.\n  The bill will ensure that:\n  1. The Secretary will review all sensitivity level designations of \nnational security positions;\n  2. Access shall be administratively adjusted and an appropriate level \nperiodic reinvestigation completed, as necessary; and\n  3. The Inspector General of the Department shall conduct regular \naudits.\n  With cyber security threats on the rise across the world, and our \ncontinued dependence on technology we must be ever vigilant of the \nthreats that we face.\n  It is for these reasons, as well as the previously mentioned cases of \nthreats to DHS security clearance, that I seek the support of my \ncolleagues today to support H.R. 3505.\n  I am confident that my colleagues will heed my advice and realize the \nneed for the enactment of H.R. 3505.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. King) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 3505.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/02/house-section/article/H7355-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7355-H7357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FUSION CENTER ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. BARLETTA.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3598, the Fusion Center \nEnhancement Act of 2015. The purpose of this legislation is to clarify \nand enhance the partnership between the Department of Homeland Security \nand the National Network of Fusion Centers.\n  The bill amends the existing statute to update the Department's \nresponsibilities for sharing information with State and local law \nenforcement and other emergency personnel within the National Network \nof Fusion Centers.\n  After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, State and local governments created \nfusion centers as a way to communicate Federal homeland security \ninformation to State and local law enforcement officials as well as to \nfuse State and locally collected information with Federal intelligence.\n  Congress supported this partnership by mandating that the Office of \nIntelligence and Analysis within the Department of Homeland Security \ncoordinate and share information with fusion centers. There are now 78 \nState and locally owned fusion centers across the country.\n  H.R. 3598 amends existing law to improve the relationship and flow of \ninformation between the Federal Government and fusion centers.\n  The bill includes language updating the responsibilities of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security related to support and coordination \nwithin the National Network. This includes improving coordination with \nother Federal departments to provide better operational intelligence, \nreducing inefficiencies, and coordinating nationwide suspicious \nactivity reporting.\n  As a member of the Homeland Security Committee and a former mayor, a \nconcern I have heard from law enforcement in my district is a lack of \ninformation and coordination from ICE, CBP, and other DHS component \nagencies.\n  I have seen this problem firsthand and know that more can be done to \nhelp our local law enforcement get the support that they need from the \nFederal Government.\n  This bill is one small step to make that fusion center a better \nresource for the people who know our communities the best: our local \nlaw enforcement officers.\n  The bill includes language to direct DHS to ensure that each \ncomponent is providing information and personnel to work with the \nfusion centers.\n  To address the need for better accountability, language is included \nthroughout the bill requiring DHS to coordinate with fusion centers and \nState Homeland Security advisers in carrying out the assigned \nresponsibilities.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Additionally, I added a requirement for the Department to submit a \nreport to Congress on their efforts, including the components, to \nsupport fusion centers and specifically report on how they are meeting \nthe requirements set forth in this bill.\n  I want to thank House Intelligence Committee Chairman Nunes, \nCommittee on Homeland Security Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member \nThompson, and Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence \nChairman King and Ranking Member Higgins for working with me to bring \nthis bill to the floor. The bill went through regular order and \nreceived bipartisan support during subcommittee and full committee \nconsideration.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can add \nimportant requirements and accountability\n\n[[Page H7357]]\n\nin how the Department of Homeland Security interacts and shares \ninformation with key State and local stakeholders.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n         House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on \n           Intelligence,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 28, 2015.\n     Hon.

I \n     thank you for your cooperation in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Michael T.

I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3598, the Fusion Center \nEnhancement Act of 2015. First of all, let me compliment Mr. Barletta \nfor his bill. Those of us who have been around kind of know the \nconfusion that exists among fusion centers throughout the country, and \nany effort to streamline that confusion is much appreciated.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill seeks to update the law to reflect \nthe evolution of the Department of Homeland Security's National Network \nof Fusion Centers as well as the relationship of the Department's \nOffice of Intelligence and Analysis with the fusion centers in the \nnetwork.\n  H.R. 3598, as introduced by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nBarletta), clarifies that fusion centers are State- and locally owned \nand operated and requires the Department's Office of Intelligence and \nAnalysis to provide support to centers in its network through the \ndeployment of appropriate personnel and providing access to \ninformation.\n  Importantly, H.R. 3598 also adds several new responsibilities to the \nUnder Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis related to grant guidance, \ncoordinating nationwide suspicious activity reports, and ensuring that \nfusion centers are the focal points for sharing information.\n  This bill makes several technical changes to existing statutory \nlanguage to help ensure increased information-sharing resources are \nmade available to Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials \nat our National Network of Fusion Centers.\n  If enacted, H.R. 3598 will go a long way to providing States and \nlocalities that have invested significant resources in standing up \nfusion centers to participate in DHS' National Network with the support \nthey need to keep their communities and, ultimately, the Nation secure.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to express my support again for this \nbill and commend the leaders of the committee's Counterterrorism and \nIntelligence Subcommittee, Mr. King and Mr. Higgins, for working \ntogether to advance this timely and important piece of legislation.\n  Again, let me thank Mr. Barletta and talk about the longstanding \nconfusion that has existed with fusion centers around the country. When \ncreated, it was Congress' hope that everybody would be singing from the \nsame sheet of music. Hopefully this gets us real close to that \nperformance. I urge the passage of H.R. 3598 and look forward to its \npassage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the most critical responsibilities of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is to share threat information with \nState and local first responders. Fusion centers are a key mechanism \nfor that process. The original requirements directing DHS' \nresponsibilities towards fusion centers were enacted in 2007. In the \npast 8 years, there have been significant changes to the information-\nsharing environment and the fusion centers across the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3598 in order to \nbolster the information-sharing environment within the Department and \nbetween the Department and State and local stakeholders.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 3598, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/02/house-section/article/H7357-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7357-H7360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SUPPORT TO FUSION CENTERS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Ms. McSALLY.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Arizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3503, the Department of \nHomeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2015.\n  We have made improvements since the 9/11 attacks, the Boston Marathon \nbombings, and Fort Hood to increase and enhance the Nation's ability to \ndetect and prevent terrorist attacks. However, the elevated potential \nfor attacks carried out by individuals either directed or inspired by \nradical violent extremism reinforces that there is more work to be \ndone, especially breaking down information-sharing stovepipes. Ensuring \nthat the Federal Government is sharing intelligence and homeland \nsecurity information with State and local officials is a vital \ncomponent to that effort.\n  In June, I visited the Arizona Counter-Terrorism Intelligence Center, \nor the ACTIC, my State's fusion center. I saw firsthand how fusion \ncenters are disseminating Federal threat and intelligence information \nout to emergency responder providers, as well as collecting State and \nlocal information, and fusing it with Federal intelligence to enhance \nterrorist investigations and create a more complete picture.\n  While fusion centers are continuing to mature, I am concerned about \nthe lack of small cities' and rural areas' representation in fusion \ncenters. As we continue to enhance the Nation's ability to share \nintelligence information, we need to ensure that all emergency service \nproviders have access to this vital information.\n  To help break down the information-sharing stovepipes, the ACTIC and \n77 other fusion centers across the country need greater access to \nintelligence and information from the Department of Homeland Security \nand its components.\n  Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 3503 along with Chairman McCaul, \nChairman King, and Representatives Barletta and Loudermilk to ensure \nthat the Department is providing fusion centers with the resources \nneeded to protect our Nation from terrorist attacks and other \nemergencies. This bill passed the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and \nIntelligence and the full Committee on Homeland Security by voice vote \nwith bipartisan support.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) for \nadding two important provisions to this bill during the full committee \nmarkup. These provisions ensure that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's information technology systems are user-friendly for State \nand local analysts, and require the Under Secretary of the Office of \nIntelligence and Analysis to sign a memorandum of understanding with \neach fusion center to ensure that each center is aware of what \ninformation can be publicly disclosed.\n  Also, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Nunes of the House \nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence and his staff for working \nwith me and the Committee on Homeland Security to get this bill to the \nfloor today.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3503, as amended, requires the Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, to conduct an assessment of the Department \nof Homeland Security personnel detailed to fusion centers and whether \ndeploying additional personnel from several of the departmental \ncomponents will enhance threat and homeland security information \nsharing. Having an unbiased assessment of staffing levels and \nresponsibilities for Department of Homeland Security personnel deployed \nto fusion centers will be valuable in making decisions moving forward \non the appropriate staffing levels.\n  Additionally, this bill applauds the effort of the Office of \nIntelligence and Analysis in establishing a program to provide top \nsecret clearances to appropriate State and local analysts in fusion \ncenters. To ensure that this initiative is carried out efficiently and \nin a manner that ensures operational security, the bill requires DHS to \nsubmit a onetime report to Congress.\n  The committee has received testimony from State and local law \nenforcement about the value additional clearances will provide. The \nneed for top secret clearances was also a key finding\n\n[[Page H7359]]\n\nof the committee's Foreign Fighter Task Force, of which I was proud to \nbe a member.\n  It is especially timely that we are considering this bill today. This \nweek is the annual conference held by the National Fusion Center \nAssociation. This bill will help ensure that our State and local law \nenforcement officers, as well as fire and EMS personnel, are getting \naccess to the information they need to protect our communities.\n  Since the summer, our country has been at its highest threat posture \nsince 9/11, given the large number of foreign fighters and ISIS-\ninspired plots. It is essential that Congress ensure that all of the \ndots are being connected.\n  I urge all Members to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n\n         House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on \n           Intelligence,\n                                                 October 28, 2015.\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, this \nbill was passed unanimously by the committee last month, and I am \npleased that it is being considered on the House floor today.\n  After the terrorist attacks of 9/11, there was broad recognition that \nthe traditional stovepipes to the sharing of homeland security \ninformation needed to be cleared and that the Federal Government needed \nto do more to share timely information with State and local partners.\n  A key mechanism to fostering such information sharing has been the \ndevelopment of a network of fusion centers across the Nation. These \ncenters allow Federal intelligence and homeland security information to \nbe shared with State and local law enforcement and other key \nstakeholders. As of today, 77 fusion centers have been stood up by \nState and local governments and participate in the Department of \nHomeland Security's National Network of Fusion Centers.\n  For fusion centers to realize their full promise, it is critical that \npersonnel assigned to fusion centers be able to access Department of \nHomeland Security information, data, and personnel. In the course of \nconducting oversight of fusion centers, the committee has learned that \nnot enough State and local analysts and officials assigned to these \ncenters have the TS/SCI clearances necessary to foster the timely \nsharing of homeland security information and intelligence. H.R. 3503, \nfor the first time, authorizes DHS to sponsor State and local analysts \nfor security clearances.\n  All of us, as the chairwoman has said, have heard from our State and \nlocals that this is, indeed, a problem. The approach taken is \nconsistent with ongoing DHS efforts to sponsor TS and SCI clearances on \nappropriate State, local, tribal, as well as territorial partners' \nlevels.\n  In the 14 years since 9/11, there has been progress across the \nFederal Government at breaking down institutional stovepipes and moving \naway from a ``need to know'' to a ``need to share'' culture. Certainly \nwith the right support and buy-in at the Federal level, the \nDepartment's National Network of Fusion Centers holds great promise for \nfostering more opportunities to interdict would-be terrorists before \nthey attack and contributing to better awareness, preparedness, and \nresponses at all levels.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona for this \nlegislation. Again, this is getting us all on the same sheet of music. \nWe absolutely have to have fusion centers operating in uniformity, and \nwe should not have fusion centers doing their own thing. We are \nfighting this together. The stovepiping of information is not good, and \nit is not healthy. We have problems identifying bad actors, terrorists, \nand what have you. So I urge passage of H.R. 3503, the Department of \nHomeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  One of the core missions of the Department of Homeland Security is to \nshare threat information with State and local first responders. Fusion \ncenters are a key mechanism for that process.\n  As fusion centers continue to mature into national assets, Congress \nmust ensure the Department of Homeland Security is supporting fusion \ncenters with the resources needed to keep our communities safe.\n  Once again, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3503.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 3503, the ``Homeland \nSecurity Support Fusion Centers Act of 2015.''\n  State and major urban area fusion centers serve as central points \nwithin the state and local environment for the receipt, analysis, \ngathering, and sharing of threat-related information between the \nfederal government and state, local, tribal, territorial, and private \nsector partners.\n  H.R. 3503 will require the Under Secretary of Intelligence and \nAnalysis of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in coordination \nwith the homeland security advisors of the states to provide an \nassessment of fusion center personnel needs, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security.\n  H.R. 3503 will amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to improve the \nmanagement and administration of the security clearance processes \nthroughout the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Homeland Security advisors must conduct a needs assessment of \nDepartment personnel assigned to fusion centers pursuant to subsection \n(c) of section 210A of the Homeland Security Act of 2002.\n  The assessment must include information on: the current deployment of \nDHS personnel to each fusion center; the roles and responsibilities of \nOffice of Intelligence and Analysis intelligence officers, intelligence \nanalysts, senior reports officers, reports officers, and regional \ndirectors deployed to fusion centers; federal resources, in addition to \npersonnel,\n\n[[Page H7360]]\n\nprovided to each fusion center; whether deploying additional personnel \nwould enhance intelligence and information sharing between DHS and \nfederal, state, local, tribal, and territorial partners; fusion centers \nlocated in jurisdictions along land and maritime borders of the United \nStates and the degree to which deploying personnel from the U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, and the Coast Guard to such centers would enhance the \nintegrity and security at such borders; and fusion centers located in \njurisdictions with large and medium hub airports and the degree to \nwhich deploying personnel from the Transportation Security \nAdministration to such centers would enhance aviation security.\n  The Under Secretary must submit such assessment to specified \ncongressional committees, together with a report on: the number of \npersonnel assigned to fusion centers from the Office of Intelligence \nand Analysis; the number of personnel assigned to the National Network \nof Fusion Centers from components and offices of DHS and the \nmethodology for determining the fusion centers to which such personnel \nare assigned; and an implementation plan for determining how DHS's \npersonnel resources will be allocated to fusion centers in the future.\n  H.R. 3503 will help to ensure the safety of our fusion centers and \nthe personnel that work within these centers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 3503.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 3503, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/02/house-section/article/H7360-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7360-H7363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXPRESSING CONCERN OVER ANTI-ISRAEL AND ANTI-SEMITIC INCITEMENT WITHIN \n                       THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree \nto the resolution (H. Res. 293) expressing concern over anti-Israel and \nanti-Semitic incitement within the Palestinian Authority, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.\n  The text of the resolution is as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 293\n\n       Whereas the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the \n     Gaza Strip, commonly referred to as Oslo II, specifically \n     details that Israel and the Palestinian Authority shall \n     ``abstain from incitement, including hostile propaganda, \n     against each other and, without derogating from the principle \n     of freedom of expression, shall take legal measures to \n     prevent such incitement by any organizations, groups or \n     individuals within their jurisdiction'';\n       Whereas the Oslo II agreement further states that Israel \n     and the Palestinian Authority ``will ensure that their \n     respective educational systems contribute to the peace \n     between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and to peace in \n     the entire region'';\n       Whereas Palestinian Authority incitement against Israelis \n     has continued unabated for many years despite periods of \n     negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority;\n       Whereas this incitement takes on many forms, and has \n     included the glorification of terrorists who have murdered \n     Israeli civilians; advocating struggle against Israel despite \n     entering into negotiations with Israel; the demonization of \n     Jews and Israelis, including by the use of anti-Semitic \n     motifs; the denial of Israel's existence and its \n     delegitimization as evidenced by the absence of Israel on \n     official maps used in Palestinian Authority institutions; and \n     false claims that Israel or the Jews are endangering Muslim \n     holy sites, such as the Al-Aqsa mosque/Temple Mount in \n     Jerusalem;\n       Whereas in June 2013, Abbas referenced Israeli acts which \n     ``indicate an evil and dangerous plot to destroy Al-Aqsa and \n     build the alleged temple'';\n       Whereas on September 16, 2015, Abbas stated on Palestinian \n     television that ``we welcome every drop of blood spilled in \n     Jerusalem. This is pure blood, clean blood, blood on its way \n     to Allah. With the help of Allah, every martyr will be in \n     heaven, and every wounded will get his reward'';\n       Whereas since mid-September 2015 there has been a wave of \n     Palestinian violence in Israel and the West Bank, including \n     stabbings, shootings, and other terrorist acts;\n       Whereas this situation has been inflamed by statements made \n     by Palestinian President Abbas, other Palestinian officials, \n     clerics, and official Palestinian Authority media, and \n     frequently amplified on social media platforms;\n       Whereas these statements have included repeated false \n     claims that Israel seeks to change the ``status quo'' on the \n     Temple Mount/al-Aqsa Mosque compound;\n       Whereas despite the incitement-induced wave of terrorism, \n     the Palestinian Authority security forces and the Israel \n     Defense Forces have continued security cooperation;\n       Whereas section 7038 of the Consolidated and Further \n     Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 states that ``none of the \n     funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act \n     may be used to provide equipment, technical support, \n     consulting services, or any other form of assistance to the \n     Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation'';\n       Whereas section 7040(e) of the Consolidated and Further \n     Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 requires the Secretary of \n     State, if the President waives section 7040(a) of that Act, \n     to ``certify and report to the Committees on Appropriations \n     prior to the obligation of funds that . . . the Palestinian \n     Authority is acting to counter incitement of violence against \n     Israelis and is supporting activities aimed at promoting \n     peace, coexistence, and security cooperation with Israel''; \n     and\n       Whereas the Palestinian Authority has not fully lived up to \n     its prior agreements with Israel to end incitement and should \n     do more to prepare the Palestinian people for peace with \n     Israel: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n       (1) expresses support and admiration for individuals and \n     organizations working to encourage cooperation between \n     Israelis and Palestinians;\n       (2) strongly condemns the wave of violent attacks in Israel \n     and the West Bank;\n       (3) reiterates the strong condemnation of anti-Israel and \n     anti-Semitic incitement to violence in the Palestinian \n     Authority as antithetical to the cause of peace;\n       (4) calls on the Palestinian Authority to--\n       (A) immediately discontinue incitement to violence in all \n     Palestinian Authority-controlled media outlets, and \n     officially and publicly repudiate attacks against Israelis \n     and engage in a sustained effort to publicly and officially \n     rebuke anti-Israel incitement to violence;\n       (B) continue important security cooperation with Israel; \n     and\n       (C) agree to unconditionally renew direct talks with the \n     Israelis, including the reconstitution of the Trilateral \n     Commission on Incitement;\n       (5) encourages responsible nations to condemn in the \n     strongest possible terms incitement to violence by the \n     Palestinian Authority;\n       (6) expresses support for the Government of Israel in its \n     fight against terror;\n       (7) directs the Department of State to regularly monitor \n     and publish information on all official incitement by the \n     Palestinian Authority against Jews and the State of Israel; \n     and\n       (8) calls on the Administration to continue publicly \n     repudiating and raising the issue of Palestinian anti-Israel \n     incitement to violence in all appropriate bilateral and \n     international forums.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the esteemed chairman of our full \ncommittee, Chairman Royce, and Ranking Member Engel, who is before us \ntoday, for their leadership and for helping us to mark up and vote on \nthis resolution at the subcommittee and at the full committee, thereby \nlanding us right here on the floor this afternoon.\n  I would also like to thank my friend and dear south Florida \ncolleague, ranking member of the Middle East and North Africa \nSubcommittee, Mr. Deutch, for joining me in introducing this important \nresolution condemning the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement from \nwithin the Palestinian Authority.\n  Sadly, Mr. Speaker, as we have seen over the past 2 months in Israel, \nviolence and terror are on the rise, and hardly a day goes by when we \ndon't hear about yet another attack against innocent Israelis.\n  Since the most recent round of attacks began on the Jewish New Year \nin mid-September, there have been nearly 60 stabbing attacks, 5 \nshootings, and 6 car-ramming attacks, resulting in 10 deaths and scores \nmore injured.\n  Let me repeat that again, Mr. Speaker: 60 stabbing attacks, 5 \nshootings,\n\n[[Page H7361]]\n\nand 6 car-ramming attacks, resulting in 10 deaths and many people \ninjured, not to mention the psychological toll that these acts of \nterror have taken on Israelis.\n  Today--today--Mr. Speaker, there were two separate stabbing attacks \nin two different cities. An 80-year-old woman was among the victims, \nshowing that these random attacks can happen anywhere, at any time, to \nanyone.\n  When Israeli citizens cannot walk out of their homes to go to work or \nthey cannot walk out of their homes to go to the grocery store for fear \nof yet another terrorist attack, we must hold the Palestinian \nleadership accountable for its incitement and its unwillingness to ease \ntensions in the region.\n  The resolution before us, Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 293, \nunfortunately is the consequence of the continued failure of the \nPalestinian leadership. Instead of working toward achieving lasting \npeace with Israel, what is Abu Mazen, the leader of the Palestinian \nAuthority, doing? He is undermining the peace process.\n  Instead of encouraging the Palestinian people and leading them toward \na better future, Abu Mazen's divisive actions are tearing the \nPalestinians apart, leading them into despair, into hatred, into \nviolence.\n  Instead of calling for an emergency meeting with Palestinian leaders \nto discuss a way to walk back the rhetoric, a way to calm the tensions, \nno, Abu Mazen called for an emergency meeting at the United Nations \nHuman Rights Council, the preferred platform to spew anti-Israel \nhatred.\n  Why? In an effort to delegitimize the Jewish state where he further \nfanned the flames of violence once again, as he has been doing, Mr. \nSpeaker, since he assumed leadership.\n  Already the perpetrators of these acts of terror are being \nglorified--yes, glorified--hailed as heroes, hailed as martyrs.\n  Last week, in fact, the Palestinian Authority named a street after a \nPalestinian terrorist. What did that person do? He fatally stabbed two \ninnocent Israelis in Jerusalem.\n  But where is the world's condemnation of this? What is the response \nfrom the international community? Silence. Too often we see attempts to \nplace this false moral equivalence between the Israelis' actions and \nthe Palestinians' because too many are unwilling to accept the truth, \nand that is that the Palestinian leadership is the problem, not the \nsolution, to the peace process.\n  We cannot allow Abu Mazen's words and Abu Mazen's actions to continue \nto go unpunished because, as we have seen over the past month and a \nhalf, they have consequences and innocent people have died.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity to send a clear message to \nAbu Mazen, that his words and actions are unacceptable, that we condemn \nthese actions, and that we hold the Palestinian Authority responsible \nfor inciting these recent acts of terror against Israeli citizens.\n  Palestinian leaders have been indoctrinating the Palestinian people \nwith incitement against Israel for generations, and that is not \nsomething that is easily reversed.\n  But by passing this resolution tonight, Mr. Speaker, we are sending a \nmessage to the Palestinian leader that this behavior will not be \ntolerated and it will not be unaddressed. This is an opportunity to \nstart to hold Abu Mazen and the PA accountable for their words, \naccountable for their deadly actions.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in condemning anti-Israel and anti-\nSemitic incitement in all of its forms.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of this measure.\n  Let me start by thanking our former chair of the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for sponsoring this resolution. I agree \nwith every word she just said.\n  She has been a good friend to the state and people of Israel, and \nthis measure, which I am happy to cosponsor, shows once again that \nsupport for Israel in Congress is not a partisan issue. Israel has much \nbipartisan support in this Congress, and we intend to keep it this way.\n\n  As the Congresswoman has mentioned, the violence in Israel has gone \nfrom bad to worse in recent days. Day after day, we hear new reports of \ninnocent Israeli victims of stabbings or shootings at the hands of \nPalestinian terrorists.\n  I use the word ``terrorist,'' Mr. Speaker, because what they are \ndoing are acts of terrorism. If random people, average citizens, have \nnothing to do with policy, have nothing to do with politics--they are \njust civilians that are walking in the street--if they are attacked by \na knife or something else that harms them, that is a terrorist attack.\n  Imagine if we had such things going on in the United States. It would \nhave a chilling effect on what people can do, and whether they can move \naround or can't move around as a result of it.\n  So this is not something that is random. It is not something that is \nconfined. It can strike anybody at any time, any place, and it is \nterrorism.\n  I have often said that while I support a two-state solution, if the \nPalestinians continue to use terrorism because they think it will get \nthem closer to their state, they are wrong. It will prevent them from \never having a state if they don't renounce terrorism.\n  That is what this is all about. It is the incitement. It is the \nencouraging of hatred for Israelis and the Jews and for the United \nStates as well.\n  This goes on time and time and time again, and then we wonder why we \nhave these acts of violence, because you cannot fan the fires and be a \nleader in it and then suddenly look the other way and say, ``Well, you \nknow, we are not encouraging it.''\n  The Palestinian Authority has been irresponsible, and they have been \nirresponsible for many, many years. So, as it has every right to do, \nIsrael has defended itself against these attacks, these stabbings and \nshootings. But this bloodshed must be brought to an end.\n  I have no doubt, Mr. Speaker, that it could be in a hurry if \nPalestinian leaders would do the right thing: repudiate the violence \nand, most importantly, the ceaseless campaign of incitement that \ndemonizes Jews and Israelis and glorifies terrorists.\n  Chairman Royce and I will soon send a bipartisan letter signed by \nmore than 350 of our colleagues in both parties. I am very, very happy \nwith the overwhelming support we have gotten from our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle for this letter.\n  That is why Chairman Royce and I try to do things in a bipartisan \nmanner: because something like this is bipartisan; support for Israel \nis bipartisan; support against terror is bipartisan.\n  We have to stand together as Americans, regardless of party \naffiliation, and say: we will not countenance terror. And we are going \nto point fingers at the Palestinian Authority, who has been utterly \nirresponsible in this whole thing.\n  So if Palestinian leaders would do the right thing and repudiate the \nviolence and, most importantly, end the ceaseless campaign of \nincitement that demonizes Jews and Israelis and glorifies terrorists, \nthis could stop.\n  This letter that Chairman Royce and I have done, signed by more than \n350 of our colleagues, to Palestinian President Abbas urges him to take \nthat course, but I cannot say that I have high hopes. After all, this \ntype of rhetoric by Palestinians against Jews and Israelis and even \njust Americans, in general, is nothing new.\n  In Palestinian books and newspapers, on the television and radio, we \nsee and hear a constant message of hatred and incitement.\n  From a young age, Palestinians are taught that the people of Israel \nare their enemies and those who use violence are heroes, and this is \nvery, very infuriating.\n  It is the fuel that fires the violence we are seeing today, and it is \na roadblock, as I said before, on the path towards a two-state \nsolution.\n  Palestinians will never build their own state on the backs of \nterrorists. It is a dead end for them, and it is counterproductive. \nThey ought to know it. They are doing their people a tremendous \ndisservice.\n  This resolution calls on Palestinian leaders to show real \nresponsibility to reject the violence and end incitement and to return \nto the negotiating table with no preconditions, sit down and negotiate.\n  It reaffirms our commitment to our Israeli allies and our desire to \nsee\n\n[[Page H7362]]\n\npeace for both Israelis and Palestinians.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Poe), who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs \nSubcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida \nfor yielding on this important resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians \nhas reached new levels of terror. Over the past month, Palestinians \nhave stabbed, shot, or run over innocent Israelis almost every day. The \ncause of these tragedies is simple: the incitement by Palestinian \nleaders.\n  Of course, our government is on the wrong side of this issue. Our \ngovernment stands by while Palestinian Authority President Abbas \npraises violent riots on the Temple Mount.\n  But the problem is bigger than speeches. Palestinian leaders have \nturned their schools into terrorist breeding grounds that teach hate.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Israel reacted to this violence how any other country should react; \nbut the United States State Department callously calls Israel's self-\ndefense executive force. Like I said, the State Department has got it \nwrong.\n  The Palestinians should be called out for what they are doing: \ninciting violence and committing violence. They are responsible for \ntheir criminal acts, not the Israelis. We can stand side by side with \nIsrael by condemning these terrorist acts, and the Palestinian leaders \nshould be held personally accountable for inciting violence in the \nPalestinian community. The State Department and the world need to quit \nmaking excuses for Palestinian terrorists and hold them accountable for \nthe crimes that they commit.\n  I am glad to be an original cosponsor of House Resolution 293. I urge \nits passage so that America and the rest of the world understand that \nwe stand by Israel and not by the terrorists.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Deutch), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs \nSubcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. I thank my friend, Mr. Engel.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel \nand their staffs for working to bring this bipartisan resolution to the \nfloor. I want to thank my friend and colleague and neighbor, \nCongresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for partnering with me on this \neffort.\n  In the month of October, there have been more than 50 stabbings in \nIsrael, there have been attempted stabbings, there have been shootings, \nthere have been cars rammed into civilians. Terrorists have killed 11 \nand have wounded more than 10 times that number. In a span of just 12 \nhours today, there were 4 separate terror attacks.\n  This resolution is important because these attacks aren't a protest \nor a political statement about holy sites or politics. It is terrorism, \nand it flows from incitement at the highest levels of the Palestinian \nGovernment.\n  Now, I have said many times that all attacks on innocent civilians \nshould be condemned and that they should be condemned regardless of who \ncommits them. Yet I have to point out that, when a revenge attack \noccurs, committed by Israelis, the Prime Minister of Israel himself \ncondemns that action on national television; but when there are \nattempted stabbings every single day for nearly 8 weeks, Palestinian \nleadership does not condemn even one single attack. Instead, we \ncontinue to see officials trying to justify acts of terror as an \nexpected part of a religious conflict.\n  False accusations about changes at the Temple Mount, when they have \nbeen repeatedly denied by Israeli leadership, send a very dangerous \nmessage that violence is necessary to preserve Muslim holy sites when, \nin fact, those holy sites are not threatened at all.\n  Unfortunately, incitement from officials within the Palestinian \nAuthority is not new. Despite statements from President Abbas that he \nis committed and has been committed for years to nonviolence, there are \nstill countless examples in official textbooks, on social media pages, \nand in television speeches that call for an armed conflict and that \ndepict Jews as dirty pigs.\n  Mr. Speaker, Secretary Kerry was right when he recently said, \n``President Abbas has been committed to nonviolence. He needs to be \ncondemning this loudly and clearly, and he needs to not engage in the \nincitement that his voice has sometimes been heard to encourage; so \nthat has to stop.''\n  If President Abbas remains committed to his stated vision of a \npeaceful, stable Palestinian state, living side by side with a safe and \nsecure Israel, then now is the time for real leadership. Now is the \ntime to go on national television and condemn these attacks. Now is the \ntime to accept the Jordanian plan for surveillance at the Temple Mount \nto ensure that religious freedom is, in fact, being protected.\n  Now is the time to stop dangerous rhetoric, like when he said that he \nwould ``welcome every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem'' or when he \naccused Israel of the ``summary execution of children'' when, in fact, \nthe 13-year-old whom he referenced was receiving medical care in an \nIsraeli hospital after he stabbed two Israeli teenagers.\n  Even before these recent terror attacks, incitement within the \nPalestinian Authority has been well documented. If these are the \nmessages that are sent to Palestinian youth, if they never see the \nState of Israel on a map in their textbooks or if they watch television \nprograms that glorify attacks on Israelis and Jews, how can we ever \nexpect him to be committed to peace?\n  By passing today's resolution, the United States House of \nRepresentatives is sending a message. It is a very simple message to \nthe world, that we stand with the people of Israel as they face this \nonslaught of terror and that incitement spurred by inflammatory, \nviolent rhetoric will not be tolerated.\n  We won't tolerate officials using religion as a means to spur \nviolence, and we won't tolerate actions like the recent Palestinian-\nbacked resolution at UNESCO that attempted to rewrite history and \ninflame tension on the ground.\n  Our resolution also expresses support for individuals and \norganizations that are working to encourage cooperation between \nIsraelis and Palestinians. Unfortunately, President Abbas and his \ngovernment are doing just the opposite.\n  Mr. Speaker, there must be an end to this wave of terrorism. It is \ntime to stop the spread of incitement. This resolution puts the House \non record that incitement leads to violence, and it must end if there \nis to be a chance for peace.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin), who is a member of our \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. I thank Ms. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for her inspiring \nleadership in bringing forth this bipartisan resolution.\n  I am inspired as I listen to the words of Mr. Deutch and Mr. Engel as \nthis is something that allows Americans to unite for a cause of \nstrengthening our relationships with our friends, like Israel, ensuring \nthat we treat our enemies as our enemies.\n  Mr. Speaker, according to the Maariv daily, Palestinian Authority \nPresident Abbas said in a Ramallah address:\n\n       We will not forsake our country, and we will keep every \n     inch of our land. Every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem is \n     pure. Every Shahid will reach paradise, and every injured \n     person will be rewarded by God.\n\n  The Palestinian Authority President said he would insist that a \nfuture Palestinian state include East Jerusalem as its capital. He \nsaid:\n\n       The Al-Aqsa Mosque is ours. The church is ours as well. \n     They have no right to desecrate the mosque with their dirty \n     feet. We won't allow them to do that.\n\n  A top Hamas official in the Gaza Strip called on all of the \nPalestinians to turn their weapons against the Israelis, saying that \nAllah created man only to wage jihad and to plunge knives into the \nchests of the enemies.\n  We hear a lot of talk about the pursuit of a viable two-state \nsolution. It is not just about Israel and its recognizing the \nPalestinians' right to exist.\n\n[[Page H7363]]\n\nIt is also about the Palestinians and its recognizing Israel's right to \nexist. Yet the Palestinian Authority, by the day, is under more and \nmore influence of an element that will not rest until the other side is \nwiped off the map.\n  I was disturbed when the Secretary of State's spokesperson, John \nKirby, said:\n\n       Individuals on both sides of this divide are, have been \n     proven capable of, and, in our view, are guilty of acts of \n     terrorism.\n\n  Last month the State Department claimed that the Temple Mount status \nquo was violated. I was just there a couple of months back. I was at a \nplace called Decks Restaurant in Tiberias. It is right on the Sea of \nGalilee.\n  The owner of the restaurant got on the microphone--the place was \ncrowded with locals--and she started preaching about her love of \nAmerica, about her appreciation of the strength of that bond between \nthe U.S. and Israel.\n  As she is saying this, a boat pulls in off the Sea of Galilee and \nstarts setting off fireworks. As the fireworks start blowing off, they \nstart playing ``God Bless America'' over the loud speaker. All the \nlocals stood up and were singing along, and if they didn't know the \nwords, they were lip-syncing it.\n  It was such a proud moment. Where else in the world can you go where \nyou will find a restaurant at which the owner will get on the \nmicrophone and start talking about her love of America?\n  I value the relationship that we have with our friends, such as \nIsrael. We didn't see the Israeli Prime Minister going on international \nTV trying to embarrass the President of the United States after there \nwas a hospital strike, which the President took responsibility for.\n  It is important that we don't embarrass our allies and that we stand \nwith them in tough times. Right now we stand with innocent victims in \nIsrael, who are being targeted by terrorist attacks through the \nincitement of violence by the leadership of the Palestinian Authority.\n  That is why I am so proud to stand here today with Ms. Ileana Ros-\nLehtinen for, again, her consistent and strong dedication and \nleadership and for her determination in ensuring that this body stands \nunited with Israel every single day.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In closing, as you have heard from everyone who has spoken, the \nrecent surge of Palestinian violence against Israel must stop. It must \nstop to save innocent lives. It must stop so that negotiations can go \nforward. It must stop because acts of terrorism are not to be \ntolerated.\n  Any way you look at it, these are terrorist acts, and the only way we \ncan have peace and the only way we can have a two-state solution is if \nboth parties sit opposite each other, with no preconditions, and start \nnegotiating.\n  I do support a two-state solution--a Palestinian Arab state and an \nIsraeli Jewish state--living together in peace and harmony; but it is \nnot going to happen if the Palestinian leadership, which is bankrupt in \nmore ways than one, refuses to teach its people the right thing, if it \nrefuses to repudiate acts of terror.\n  Mahmoud Abbas, or Abu Mazen--the leader of the Palestinians--is, I \nthink, on the eighth year of his 4-year term. He is not really \nlegitimate anymore. The more he talks with rhetoric and incitement, the \nless relevant he becomes.\n  It is really a shame because I do think that the Palestinians deserve \nbetter and I do think that, ultimately, they deserve their own state; \nbut they will not have their own state if they resort to terror. It is \nbankrupt, and it is a dead end for them.\n  Instead of encouraging these kinds of acts of terror against innocent \ncivilians, the leadership of the Palestinians ought to be dismissing \nit, ought to be condemning it, ought to be taking strong stands against \nit. We have yet to hear, and that is why this resolution is so \nimportant.\n  This resolution sends the signal that Palestinian leaders have a \nresponsibility to repudiate this violence and put an end to the \nhorrific campaign of incitement against Jews and Israelis.\n  Everyone who spoke today is saying the same thing. We are saying the \nsame thing because it is clear as night and day what is going on over \nthere. So I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure.\n\n  The United States will always stand with the people of Israel, and \nthe United States will always stand against violence and terrorism \nwherever it rears its head around the world.\n  I again thank my good friend, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her leadership \nand Mr. Deutch for his leadership as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I want to thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Royce, for his \nhelp in bringing this resolution to the floor after the markup in the \nsubcommittee and the full committee.\n  I want to thank Mr. Engel for his steadfast support of doing \neverything that is humanly possible to support efforts in getting peace \nin the Middle East and his support for the democratic Jewish state of \nIsrael.\n  I want to thank Mr. Deutch, who is my partner on the Middle East and \nNorth Africa Subcommittee. He has been a person who understands the \nmany obstacles to peace that the Palestinians encounter because of \ntheir failed leadership, and the responsibility lies in that \nleadership. I have had the opportunity to travel to Israel with Mr. \nDeutch, and I am very thankful for his friendship and for his guidance.\n  I also want to thank Mr. Poe and Mr. Zeldin--valued members of our \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs--for their perspectives on how to reach \npeace, because, when all is said and done, this is what this resolution \nis all about.\n  We are condemning the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement to \nviolence by the Palestinian Authority, but we do so because this is \nantithetical to the cause of peace, which is what this body is all \nabout and what the United States' foreign policy is based on in the \nMiddle East.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, securing a lasting peace between Israel and \nPalestine requires a commitment to humanizing the experiences of both \npeoples. Divisive rhetoric dehumanizes people and undermines the \nprospect of long-term peace. This resolution is divisive.\n  Incitement by either party, including Palestinian Authority leaders, \nis a serious issue and deserves to be condemned. But when we denounce \nthe Palestinians and leave no mention of divisive rhetoric by the \nIsraeli government, we do a disservice to Palestinians and Israelis. \nJust two weeks ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said \n``Hitler didn't want to exterminate the Jews at the time, he wanted to \nexpel the Jews.'' He laid the blame for the Shoa at the feet of a \nPalestinian Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini. Al-Husseini \nwas a virulent anti-Semite. But Prime Minister Netanyahu's blaming the \nidea of the Holocaust on a Palestinian, and by implication \nPalestinians, deserves to be condemned by this body just as Palestinian \nincitement does.\n  I oppose this resolution, not because the Palestinians are not \ninciting, and not because I believe this incitement should not be \ncondemned. I oppose this resolution because any resolution that attacks \none side while ignoring the other can only further tension and \nviolence.\n  If Congress wants to be considered a legitimate arbiter of peace \nbetween Israel and Palestine we must pursue a balanced approach that \ncalls for an end to incitement on both sides and both leaders to live \nup to their obligations under the Oslo Accords.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Harris). The question is on the motion \noffered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) that the \nHouse suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 293, as \namended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/02/house-section/article/H7363-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7363-H7367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1715\n     PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL POLICE \n                              ORGANIZATION\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass \nthe bill (H.R. 1853) to direct the President to develop a strategy to \nobtain observer status for Taiwan in the International Criminal Police \nOrganization, and for other purposes.\n\n[[Page H7364]]\n\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1853\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE INTERNATIONAL \n                   CRIMINAL POLICE ORGANIZATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Safety, security and peace is important to every \n     citizen of the world, and shared information ensuring wide \n     assistance among police authorities of nations for \n     expeditious dissemination of information regarding criminal \n     activities greatly assists in these efforts.\n       (2) Direct and unobstructed participation in the \n     International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) is \n     beneficial for all nations and their police authorities. \n     Internationally shared information with authorized police \n     authorities is vital to peacekeeping efforts.\n       (3) With a history dating back to 1914, the role of \n     INTERPOL is defined in its constitution: ``To ensure and \n     promote the widest possible mutual assistance between all \n     criminal police authorities within the limits of the laws \n     existing in the different countries and in the spirit of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights.''.\n       (4) Ongoing international threats, including international \n     networks of terrorism, show the ongoing necessity to be ever \n     inclusive of nations willing to work together to combat \n     criminal activity. The ability of police authorities to \n     coordinate, preempt, and act swiftly and in unison is an \n     essential element of crisis prevention and response.\n       (5) Taiwan maintained full membership in INTERPOL starting \n     in 1964 through its National Police Administration but was \n     ejected in 1984 when the People's Republic of China (PRC) \n     applied for membership.\n       (6) Nonmembership prevents Taiwan from gaining access to \n     INTERPOL's I-24/7 global police communications system, which \n     provides real-time information on criminals and global \n     criminal activities. Taiwan is relegated to second-hand \n     information from friendly nations, including the United \n     States.\n       (7) Taiwan is unable to swiftly share information on \n     criminals and suspicious activity with the international \n     community, leaving a huge void in the global crime-fighting \n     efforts and leaving the entire world at risk.\n       (8) The United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, \n     declared its intention to support Taiwan's participation in \n     appropriate international organizations and has consistently \n     reiterated that support.\n       (9) Following the enactment of Public Law 108-235, a law \n     authorizing the Secretary of State to initiate and implement \n     a plan to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan at \n     the annual summit of the World Health Assembly and subsequent \n     advocacy by the United States, Taiwan was granted observer \n     status to the World Health Assembly for six consecutive years \n     since 2009. Both prior to and in its capacity as an observer, \n     Taiwan has contributed significantly to the international \n     community's collective efforts in pandemic control, \n     monitoring, early warning, and other related matters.\n       (10) INTERPOL's constitution allows for observers at its \n     meetings by ``police bodies which are not members of the \n     Organization''.\n       (b) Taiwan's Participation in INTERPOL.--The President \n     shall--\n       (1) develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan \n     in INTERPOL and at other related meetings, activities, and \n     mechanisms thereafter; and\n       (2) instruct INTERPOL Washington to officially request \n     observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and to actively urge \n     INTERPOL member states to support such observer status and \n     participation for Taiwan.\n       (c) Report Concerning Observer Status for Taiwan in \n     INTERPOL.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall transmit to \n     Congress a report, in unclassified form, describing the \n     United States strategy to endorse and obtain observer status \n     for Taiwan in INTERPOL and at other related meetings, \n     activities, and mechanisms thereafter. The report shall \n     include the following:\n       (1) A description of the efforts the President has made to \n     encourage INTERPOL member states to promote Taiwan's bid to \n     obtain observer status in INTERPOL.\n       (2) A description of the actions the President will take to \n     endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and \n     at other related meetings, activities, and mechanisms \n     thereafter.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank the chairman of the Asia and the \nPacific Subcommittee, Congressman Matt Salmon, for introducing this \nimportant resolution.\n  Taiwan is indeed a strong ally of the United States, one which shares \nour interests and values, including an enduring commitment to democracy \nand the freedom of expression.\n  Taiwan is a beacon of freedom in the Pacific, serving as an \ninspiration for the world's oppressed, and it serves as a model for \nfuture democratic transitions. Unfortunately, however, Taiwan is under \nincreasing pressure from an aggressive China that is attempting to \nassert its dominance in the Pacific and to isolate Taiwan on the \ninternational stage. One organization that China has prevented Taiwan \nfrom joining is INTERPOL, the International Criminal Police \nOrganization.\n  INTERPOL was created, Mr. Speaker, to promote international \ncooperation between criminal police authorities; but because of undue \nChinese pressure, Taiwan is no longer a member of INTERPOL. Taiwan is \nforced to receive less effective, secondhand information about \ninternational criminals and their illicit activities. Likewise, Taiwan \ncannot share the law enforcement information that it gathers in order \nto benefit INTERPOL.\n  In China's efforts to exclude Taiwan and in the efforts of some \nnations to accommodate China, they have ended up hurting Taiwan and the \nentire international community in the process.\n  So we have this bill before us, Mr. Speaker. This bill by Congressman \nSalmon directs the President to request observer status for Taiwan at \nINTERPOL, to urge other INTERPOL members to support it, and for the \nPresident to develop a strategy to ensure the participation of Taiwan.\n  I am pleased to support this legislation. I believe that the United \nStates should be helping Taiwan's meaningful participation in all \ninternational organizations and entities in which it has expressed an \ninterest in participating.\n  Taiwan's exclusion from organizations like INTERPOL is dangerous. It \nis a dangerous practice. It hurts the international community just as \nmuch as it hurts the people of Taiwan.\n  We must not allow U.N. politics or China's efforts to isolate Taiwan \nto exclude it from international organizations. It is, therefore, \ncrucial that the United States provide the kind of military assistance, \neconomic assistance, and political assistance that will allow Taiwan to \nresist any type of Chinese coercion.\n  The Taiwan Relations Act, together with the Six Assurances are the \ncornerstone of U.S.-Taiwan relations, and we must always keep it as our \nguiding beacon. I know that this is a sentiment that is greatly shared \nby the members of our Foreign Affairs Committee and by the chairman of \nour committee, Mr. Royce of California, because the friendship between \nthe people of the United States and Taiwan has cemented into one of the \nmost cherished partnerships. I look forward to the United States \nGovernment demonstrating its continued commitment to the people of \nTaiwan with the passage of Mr. Salmon's bill.\n  I want to thank, again, Chairman Salmon for introducing this \nimportant resolution. I am pleased to offer my support, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I rise in support of this measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to also thank Mr. Salmon from Arizona, who chairs \nour Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, for authoring \nthis bill. I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  The International Criminal Police Organization, what we call \nINTERPOL, helps law enforcement agencies around the world collaborate \nwith one another. Thanks to INTERPOL, a task force in New York can \nshare information with a police agency in Hamburg or flag a terrorist \nsuspect for authorities in Tokyo.\n  Sensitive information about criminals or missing persons is available \nat the push of a button for INTERPOL's\n\n[[Page H7365]]\n\nmembers. For decades, it has been a vital tool for global security.\n  Until 1984, Taiwan was a member of INTERPOL; but since the People's \nRepublic of China applied for membership, Taiwan has been left out. \nThis is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous.\n  Taiwan has the 16th or 17th largest economy in the world. And anyone \nwho has ever been to Taiwan, as I have and as my colleague has, will \njust be amazed at the democracy they have built themselves on that tiny \nisland. The fact is that they look to the United States for protecting \nthem and helping them. Because just like we share the same values with \nIsrael, we share the same values with Taiwan, and that is why we work \nwith them.\n  Taiwan has been left out, and this gap in INTERPOL's membership \ncreates a public safety risk for the people of Taiwan and also for the \nrest of the world. So nobody is saying that China should not be a \nmember, but China should not have the right to exclude Taiwan.\n  This legislation would close that gap. It would instruct the \nadministration to push for Taiwan to be granted observer status in \nINTERPOL. Observer status, that is what we are asking for.\n  There are countries around the world that function as countries, that \nhave everything that all other countries have, and yet, because of \npolitics, they are excluded from these international organizations. \nTaiwan is one such country. Kosovo is another type of country.\n\n  We have to stop this. People that live in these countries need to not \nbear the brunt of politics, but really need the protections that \ncitizens of other countries have. By our not giving them the \nprotections, we leave ourselves a bit unprotected as well.\n  So this legislation would instruct the administration to push for \nTaiwan to be granted observer status in INTERPOL. As an observer, \nTaiwan would have access to the information that law enforcement \nagencies already have. It would also allow Taiwan to contribute \ninformation to INTERPOL, information that could be used to stop crime \nor thwart terrorist activity, arrest human traffickers, or sideline \nother bad actors.\n  Good precedent exists for giving Taiwan this status. Taiwan is an \nobserver in the World Health Assembly, where it has played a vital role \nin contributing to public health and fighting pandemic disease.\n  In fact, Taiwan has repeatedly shown itself to be a constructive, \npositive force in the global community. Countries around the world \nstand to benefit from Taiwan's inclusion in international organizations \nlike INTERPOL. So not only does Taiwan benefit, but the rest of the \nworld benefits. It is a no-brainer. It is a win-win situation for \neverybody.\n  I support this legislation wholeheartedly. I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  I thank my colleague from Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and the \nchairman from California, Ed Royce. Again, we are all in this together.\n  This is great bipartisan legislation of the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee. It is important for Taiwan and important for the United \nStates.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to Mr. Salmon, I ask \nunanimous consent that the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), the \nesteemed chairman of our committee, who is here with us now, manage the \nrest of the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Salmon). He is the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Asia and the Pacific and the author of this important \nmeasure.\n  Mr. SALMON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Ed Royce for bringing this \nimportant measure to the floor today and for being a constant champion \nof the people of Taiwan.\n  I was able to go on a trip with the chairman to Taiwan, and I think \nthat he is as close to royalty in Taiwan as anybody that I have ever \nmet. They love Ed Royce. In fact, the guy that used to be called ``Mr. \nTaiwan'' was the former Senator from Arizona, Barry Goldwater, but I \nthink Ed Royce has maybe taken that title away.\n  I am just honored to be able to be here supporting this bill that he \nhas allowed to come to the floor. I have been a long-time supporter of \nTaiwan, as have Members throughout this body on both sides of the \naisle.\n  Let me just segue for a minute.\n  A lot of people out there get really, really frustrated by the \npartisan nature of what they see happening here in the Nation's \nCapital. A lot of people are frustrated: Why can't both sides just \nagree? I mean, after all, aren't we all Americans?\n  The interesting thing is I wish more Americans could come and see our \ncommittee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, in action because it is the \nepitome of bipartisanship. Besides the fact that Chairman Ed Royce \nleads the committee and demands that we exhibit bipartisanship, Ranking \nMember Eliot Engel is one of the best men I have ever met in my life. \nAnd I mean that from the bottom of my heart.\n  Whether it is dealing with terrorism in the Middle East or fairness \nacross the globe like this issue with Taiwan and common sense, he is \nalways on the right side. He leads his delegation, his folks on that \nside of the aisle in something that we have long believed, but \nsometimes it kind of gets lost in the cacophony of arguments here on \nCapitol Hill on other things, but that is that partisanship ends at the \nwater's edge.\n  My hat is off to you, Mr. Engel, because you have always exhibited \nthat, and I appreciate the way that you have led this body in that way.\n  Taiwan is a wonderful, thriving democracy. In fact, I had an \nopportunity as a young man to live there for 2 years, from 1977 to \n1979, while serving a mission for my church. While I was there in 1978, \nthe Nixon administration normalized relations with China, recognizing \nthe Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole, legal \ngovernment of China and declaring it would withdraw diplomatic \nrecognition from Taiwan. The U.S. Government has since articulated a \none-China policy, which was a dark turn for U.S.-Taiwan relations. \nSince then, we have seen a Taiwan that is marginalized in the \ninternational community.\n  Taiwan's ambiguous sovereignty status has contributed to its \nexclusion from many, many international organizations, despite Taiwan's \nobvious willingness to play a larger role in international affairs and \ninternational security, as it should. From humanitarian assistance and \ndisaster relief to law enforcement and global health, so often it has \nbeen denied the right to share its knowledge and its expertise in the \ninternational fora.\n  This bill, H.R. 1853, would improve Taiwan's capability to contribute \nand benefit from the international community in the interest of \ninternational security. H.R. 1853 would direct the President to develop \na strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan in the International \nCriminal Police Organization, or INTERPOL. It would also require the \nPresident to report to Congress on efforts to encourage Taiwan's \ninclusion in INTERPOL.\n  Since the early 20th century, INTERPOL has facilitated mutual \nassistance between criminal police authorities worldwide through the \nsharing of information, such as access to comprehensive lists of \nsuspicious persons and criminals.\n  As we all know and, I think, as every American knows, terrorism and \nother nontraditional security challenges no longer end at our borders \nor anybody's borders. These threats are global by nature.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  In order to secure domestic and international security, the sharing \nof information across borders is vital. Taiwan's exclusion from \nINTERPOL hampers efforts to prevent and respond to threats.\n  To ensure that potential terrorists are barred from entering Taiwan, \nit is essential that Taiwan have direct access to INTERPOL and its I-\n24/7 system, which provides real-time information on criminals and \nglobal criminal activities.\n  Without this access, Taiwan is forced to cobble together its own list \nbased on incomplete and untimely information obtained from a small \nnumber of friendly countries to Taiwan and Taiwan's own domestic \nintelligence.\n\n[[Page H7366]]\n\n  Equally important, Taiwan is unable to share the information that it \ngathers on criminals and suspicious persons with INTERPOL directly. Mr. \nEngel called this policy silly. I think that that is very, very \nappropriate and accurate. This puts everybody at risk, when we have a \npolicy that plays politics instead of common sense.\n  Cooperation between Taiwan and INTERPOL could be markedly enhanced if \nTaiwan is able to become an observer. H.R. 1853, with 114 bipartisan \ncosponsors, continues to carry the torch of congressional support for \nTaiwan's membership and inclusion in the international community.\n  Taiwan is a vibrant, democratic society, with much to contribute to \nthe international community. The United States must do more to fulfill \nour obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act, which provides that the \nU.S. treat Taiwan the same as foreign countries, nations, states, \ngovernment, or similar entities.\n  This is a vote for U.S. support of Taiwan's inclusion in \ninternational affairs. This is a vote for international security. I \nurge my colleagues to vote to support Taiwan's participation in \ninternational policing efforts by supporting this legislation, H.R. \n1853.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We are all saying the same thing, and I think it really shows how \nimportant this legislation is. I want to mention the gentleman from \nArizona, as I mentioned before. He was very kind about some of the \nthings he said about me.\n  You need to go on a trip to China or Taiwan with the gentleman from \nArizona because he is very modest, but he speaks fluent Mandarin. He \nhas great diplomatic skills, and the people there really appreciate \nwhat he has done. I appreciate him being the author of this important \npiece of legislation.\n  It is true, when we talk about bipartisanship in foreign affairs, it \nis probably more important than in any other place. I have gone on a \nnumber of trips and we have had delegations of Republicans and \nDemocrats together, and always, as Americans, the differences that we \nmight have are very, very tiny.\n  When you travel together and you go to another country, we realize \nhow important it is that, as Americans, we stand united and that other \ncountries respect our country for what our country has done and is \ndoing. That is really important.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona, my friend. He has been a \nvital force for this legislation, H.R. 1853, but he has also been a \nvital force on so many other issues on the Committee on Foreign Affairs \nand global issues that are really just so important.\n  When we talk about global issues and talk about policy that we need \nto do, there really are no Democrats and no Republicans. We are all \nAmericans. We want to make sure that other countries respect what we \ntry to do.\n  We believe in what this country stands for, and we want to have good \nrelations with countries around the world. I think it is so important \nwhen Members travel there and meet with dignitaries and meet with \nleaders of the country and meet with other parliamentarians that people \nunderstand what the United States of America is all about.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona for his leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, as a strong original \ncosponsor. I want to thank Mr. Engel, and I want to thank Mr. Salmon \nand Mr. Brad Sherman for this legislation.\n  Taiwan is a nation of 23 million people. It is a booming democracy, \nwith a free and open media. It is a loyal friend. It is a loyal partner \nto the United States.\n  Taiwan is engaged in important missions worldwide. We see the results \nof a lot of that engagement. Ebola is one most recently on our mind. \nWhen Ebola hit West Africa, it was Taiwan that donated 100,000 sets of \nprotective equipment that were used to stop the spread of Ebola. It was \nTaiwan that gave so much in financial resources to help the sickest in \nLiberia.\n  Taiwan today is assisting those who have been forced out of their \nhomes by terrorists, whether it is in Syria or Iraq; yet, despite its \nactive and constructive role internationally, Taiwan is excluded from \nmany international organizations because of its political status.\n  While Taiwan voluntarily adheres to the rules and the regulations of \ninternational organizations like the U.N., it is barred from \nparticipating. It is barred from being included in U.N. treaties \nagainst transnational organized crime and nuclear proliferation. This \nis not good for Taiwan, and it is not good for us.\n  To better protect its citizens and all the people around the world \nwho travel there, Taiwan is seeking observer status in the \nInternational Criminal Police Organization, which many know as \nINTERPOL.\n  This organization enables police from 190 member countries to work \ntogether to make the world a safer place through information sharing, \ncapacity building, and response coordination between police \ndepartments. That is 190 countries, but Taiwan is not included.\n  The legislation before us today will help to secure observer status \nfor Taiwan at INTERPOL. The measure requires the President of the \nUnited States to develop and execute a strategy to ensure that Taiwan \nparticipates in INTERPOL's next General Assembly meeting, which is \ncoming up in Indonesia. This will bring better international law \nenforcement cooperation with one of our most important partners: \nTaiwan.\n  Mr. Speaker, by way of history, Taiwan had full membership in \nINTERPOL starting back in 1964, but Taiwan was ejected from the law \nenforcement group in 1984, when the People's Republic of China applied \nfor membership.\n  Since then, Taiwan has relied on delayed secondhand information that \nthey get from the United States about international criminals and \nglobal criminal activities, and that, frankly, makes Taiwan more \nvulnerable to security threats.\n  Likewise, Taiwan cannot share the law enforcement information it \ngathers to the benefit, frankly, of INTERPOL and the rest of the \ncommunity and all of the members of INTERPOL, all the police \norganizations that try to rely on that. And, of course, we are part of \nthat. We could utilize that benefit.\n  Mr. Speaker, the fact that Taiwan must rely on a convoluted process, \nwith an added layer of bureaucracy, to access this critical information \nmakes no sense. Taiwan regularly hosts the type of megaevents which \noften, unfortunately, attract terrorist activity, or they could.\n  For example, in 2009 Taiwan hosted the World Games and had to rely \nsolely on the United States to vet athletes and media lists, and with \nthe U.S.' help, several suspicious persons were, in fact, identified. \nThey were denied entry into Taiwan.\n  In 2017 Taiwan will host the Summer Universiade, a student sporting \nevent in which 900 athletes from 170 countries are expected to attend. \nThis event is second only to the Olympics in the number of participants \nand countries that are represented.\n  There must be a more streamlined way for Taiwan to access information \nfrom INTERPOL. As the number of visitors from Taiwan to the United \nStates has grown exponentially, there is an urgent need to ensure that \nTaiwan's police forces have real-time access to information on criminal \nactivities and on threats.\n  Taiwan entered into the U.S. Visa Waiver Program in 2012. Since then, \nthe number of Taiwanese visitors to the United States has increased by \nnearly 42 percent. From my home State of California, the increase in \nvisitors from Taiwan has been a boon to the economy.\n  I am proud to have worked on Taiwan's entry into the Visa Waiver \nProgram because I know that, as a result of this agreement, Taiwanese \nAmericans in southern California have a much easier time staying \nconnected to their families, and business travelers are having an \neasier time, too.\n  That is why I am also supporting Taiwan's participation in Customs \nand Border Protection's Global Entry program, which will make two-way \ntravel even easier.\n  Mr. Speaker, strengthening Taiwan's law enforcement capabilities \nbenefits American citizens as much as it does the Taiwanese. Every year \ntens of thousands of Americans travel to Taiwan, and this bill will \ncertainly help\n\n[[Page H7367]]\n\nTaiwan's police forces protect American citizens traveling in Taiwan.\n  INTERPOL's constitution allows for observers at its meetings by \npolice bodies which are not members of the organization. And so I am \nconfident Taiwan will be able to be an observer.\n  H.R. 1853 will support Taiwan's efforts to gain observer status with \nINTERPOL. It is going to improve everybody's security. Mr. Speaker, we \nmust constantly be pressing to ensure that security across the globe is \nprotected.\n  Taiwan's unique political status has thus far hindered its inclusion \nin INTERPOL and is a vulnerable loophole for criminals and, frankly, \nfor terrorists to target. With this piece of legislation, we are \nsending a clear message that safety is a priority.\n  I want to again commend Representative Matt Salmon of Arizona, \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, and, of course, \nMr. Engel and Mr. Sherman for authoring and introducing this important \nmeasure. I appreciated working with them on it.\n  I will just say this of Mr. Salmon as well. He has a longstanding \ninterest in Taiwan. His leadership on this measure is very much \nappreciated by all of us.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close on my side. I yield \nmyself such time as I may consume.\n  As I have said, we need to use every tool available to combat \nterrorism and disrupt criminal networks around the world. It only makes \nsense to have more partners at the table in that effort.\n  So bringing Taiwan back into INTERPOL as an observer just makes \ncommon sense. The more participants in INTERPOL, the more good the \norganization can do. We should do all we can to bring willing \ncontributors off the sidelines.\n  Again, Taiwan was a member and was thrown out when everyone \nrecognized People's Republic of China. There is room for both. There \nshould be both.\n  I again want to commend my friend, Mr. Salmon, who is largely \nresponsible for this, and our chairman, Mr. Royce, who I think has more \npeople from Taiwan in his district than virtually any other district in \nthe country. So he knows quite a bit about Taiwan and quite a bit about \nwhat should be done.\n  It is something that we are all saying the same thing. It makes sense \nfor Taiwan. It makes sense for the United States. It makes sense for \nINTERPOL. I encourage my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 1853.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill \n(H.R. 2494) to support global anti-poaching efforts, strengthen the \ncapacity of partner countries to counter wildlife trafficking, \ndesignate major wildlife trafficking countries, and for other purposes, \nas amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2494\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Anti-Poaching Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Poaching and the illicit trade in endangered and \n     threatened wildlife are among the most lucrative criminal \n     activities worldwide, worth an estimated $7 to $10 billion \n     annually.\n       (2) Poaching and wildlife trafficking have escalated in \n     scale, sophistication and violence, risking the potential \n     extinction of some of the world's most iconic species.\n       (3) Wildlife poaching and trafficking threaten elephants, \n     rhinoceros, and tigers greatly, but also have devastating \n     impact on a number of other species, including sharks, great \n     apes, and turtles.\n       (4) The high demand for rare wildlife products has driven \n     prices to historically high levels.\n       (5) Much of the demand for wildlife products comes from \n     Asia and is fueled by the perceived medicinal value and \n     social status associated with these products.\n       (6) Reporting indicates that a number of rebel groups and \n     terrorist organizations, including Sudan's Janjaweed militia, \n     the Lord's Resistance Army, the Seleka rebel movement in the \n     Central African Republic, and Somalia's al-Shabaab, either \n     participate in or draw funding from illicit wildlife \n     trafficking networks.\n       (7) Analyses suggest the high demand for illegal wildlife \n     products, combined with weak law enforcement and security \n     measures and corruption and governance failures, has led to \n     the increased involvement of transnational organized crime in \n     wildlife trafficking.\n       (8) The United Nations Security Council has authorized \n     multilateral sanctions against individuals and entities \n     supporting armed groups through the illicit trade in \n     wildlife, in addition to other natural resources, in the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African \n     Republic.\n       (9) A National Intelligence Council analysis of wildlife \n     poaching threats found that certain African government \n     officials facilitated the movement of wildlife products, and \n     that these governments' ability to reduce poaching and \n     trafficking was hindered by corruption and weak rule of law.\n       (10) On November 13, 2013, the Secretary of State announced \n     the first reward under the Transnational Organized Crime \n     Rewards Program for information leading to the dismantling of \n     the Xaysavang Network, a large wildlife trafficking syndicate \n     that is based in Laos and spans Africa and Asia.\n\n     SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF WILDLIFE ENFORCEMENT NETWORKS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Wildlife enforcement networks are government-led, \n     regionally-focused mechanisms that increase capacity and \n     coordination efforts between law enforcement, environmental \n     agencies, and other entities focused on countering wildlife \n     trafficking of member countries.\n       (2) Currently there are active wildlife enforcement \n     networks in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Central America. \n     The more mature wildlife enforcement networks, such as the \n     Southeast Asia wildlife enforcement network, have proven \n     effective in dismantling transnational wildlife trafficking \n     networks and bringing to justice those individuals involved \n     in the illegal trade of endangered and threatened species.\n       (3) Efforts are underway to establish additional wildlife \n     enforcement networks in Central Africa, the Horn of Africa, \n     South America, and Central and West Asia, among other \n     regions.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--The Secretary of State, the \n     Administrator of the United States Agency for International \n     Development, the Director of the United States Fish and \n     Wildlife Service, and heads of other appropriate agencies \n     should, in an effort to address regional threats to \n     biodiversity and conservation, support strengthening existing \n     wildlife enforcement networks and the establishment of new \n     networks in other appropriate regions.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that in \n     the process of strengthening and expanding wildlife \n     enforcement networks, the appropriate agencies should--\n       (1) assess the existing capacity of wildlife enforcement \n     network member countries to gather baseline data that may be \n     used for developing program activities for the wildlife \n     enforcement network;\n       (2) establish a central secretariat within each wildlife \n     enforcement network that will coordinate the operational \n     mechanisms of each such network;\n       (3) establish a focal mechanism in each member country of a \n     wildlife enforcement network, that includes representatives \n     from environmental and wildlife protection agencies, law \n     enforcement agencies, financial intelligence units, customs \n     and border protection agencies, and the judiciary system, \n     that will serve as a conduit to the larger wildlife \n     enforcement network and the central secretariat;\n       (4) strengthen cooperation and the capacity of law \n     enforcement agencies of the wildlife enforcement network;\n       (5) facilitate the sharing of intelligence and relevant \n     case information within the agencies of a wildlife \n     enforcement network;\n       (6) support the cooperation and coordination between \n     different regional wildlife enforcement networks;\n       (7) incorporate and utilize expertise from international \n     bodies and civil society organizations that have appropriate \n     subject matter expertise;\n       (8) eventually create an institutionalized, sustainable, \n     and self-sufficient platform; and\n       (9) recognize that lawful, well regulated hunting can \n     contribute to sustainability and economic development, and \n     that enforcement policies should not discourage or impede \n     this activity.\n\n     SEC. 4. SUPPORTING THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE WILDLIFE \n                   LAW ENFORCEMENT SECTOR.\n\n       The Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United \n     States Agency for International Development, the Director of \n     the\n\n[[Page H7368]]\n\n     United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and heads of other \n     appropriate agencies, including the National Park Service and \n     the United States Forest Service, should, in an effort to \n     address local and regional threats to biodiversity and \n     conservation and support the rule of law and good governance, \n     promote the professionalization of the wildlife law \n     enforcement sector and professional ranger training in \n     partner countries through support and technical assistance \n     for the following:\n       (1) The creation and adoption of standards for professional \n     ranger training and qualifications, including in relevant \n     international fora and multilateral agreements.\n       (2) Training and accreditation systems based on the \n     standards described in paragraph (1) that produce \n     professionally trained and qualified rangers and promote the \n     overall professionalization of ranger forces, whether through \n     existing United States institutions, such as International \n     Law Enforcement Academies, or through partnerships with \n     national or regional training institutions.\n       (3) Legal reforms, where necessary, to provide rangers with \n     authority to detain and arrest suspects, process crime \n     scenes, present evidence in court, and defend themselves in \n     life threatening situations.\n       (4) The development and institutionalization of reward and \n     promotion systems for rangers based on performance and set \n     competencies.\n       (5) The development and institutionalization of national \n     systems to provide insurance to rangers and their families \n     and compensation for those rangers killed in the line of \n     duty.\n       (6) Cooperation and coordination between local law \n     enforcement tasked with wildlife or park protection and local \n     defense forces, where appropriate, including training \n     opportunities, logistical support, or provision of equipment.\n\n     SEC. 5.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO \n                   COUNTER WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING AND POACHING IN \n                   AFRICA.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should \n     continue to provide defense articles (not including \n     significant military equipment), defense services, and \n     related training to appropriate security forces of countries \n     of Africa for the purposes of countering wildlife trafficking \n     and poaching.\n\n     SEC. 7.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative to revise and extend their remarks and to include \nextraneous material.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an exchange of letters between \nmyself and the chairmen of the Natural Resources and Judiciary \nCommittees.\n  Mr. Speaker, the very disturbing reality is that some of the world's \nmost majestic animals have become ``blood currency'' for terrorist \norganizations and rebel groups. Some of the same radical organizations \nthat carry out terror for political purposes get their resources by the \nsale of rhino horns and ivory through the slaughter of these animals in \norder to fund their terrorist operations. Poachers are taking advantage \nof under-equipped and undermanned park rangers. As we watch this play \nout across the sub-Saharan continent, they are decimating elephant and \nrhino populations and trading their tusks.\n  In the 1980s, over 1 million African elephants roamed the continent's \nforests and savannahs. That is not that long ago. Today, there are less \nthan 500,000 left. With this explosion in poaching, at these current \nrates, in about two decades, they will vanish. The rhino would vanish.\n  In South Africa, home of the one of the largest rhino populations, \npoachers killed an average of 14 rhinos per year in the 1990s and \n2000s. Last year, they killed 1,200--the top year on record.\n  This is bigger than security. This, frankly, is a security issue for \nthe entire planet. As we watch what is developing with these \norganizations, wildlife trafficking is now the most lucrative criminal \nactivity--certainly, one of the most lucrative--around the world. I saw \nan estimate that poaching in Africa is worth $10 billion in annual \nincome for these radical organizations.\n  The Foreign Affairs Committee has held several hearings and briefings \nin which we learned how nefarious groups like al Shabaab, the \nJanjaweed, and Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army benefit from \ntrafficking in wildlife and trading the ivory for guns. An average-size \ntusk is worth 25 cases of fresh ammunition in central Africa. Twenty-\nfive cases will enable rebel groups to continue to rampage and \nterrorize civilian populations.\n  The U.S. has invested a great deal of resources in trying to bring \nstability to the countries where these armed groups operate: Somalia, \nSudan, and the Congo. All of that effort and investment are undermined \nwhen these terrorist organizations and rebel groups find these new \nfinancial lifelines. We remember the situation with blood diamonds. \nWell, for the last decade and a half, it has been ivory and rhino \nhorns.\n  Mr. Speaker, to address this crisis, the Global Anti-Poaching Act \ntackles wildlife trafficking in several ways. This legislation \ndesignates those countries that are ignoring wildlife trafficking and \nallows the Secretary of State to withhold security assistance from the \nworst offenders.\n  In some wildlife trafficking cases, foreign governments have been \nfound complicit. A ``naming and shaming'' of these countries is the \nminimum we can do if we are to contend with the poaching explosion. We \nknow from some of our antitrafficking legislation how much pressure \nthis does, in fact, put on foreign governments. Countries in Asia that \nare driving the demand for wildlife products also come under the \nspotlight in this bill.\n  In the same tactic of naming and shaming that this legislation \nestablishes, it has been used, as I mentioned, not just with \ntraffickers, but also in drug trafficking cases. It is a way to force \nother countries to become part of the solution, rather than part of the \nproblem.\n  To make this big business riskier for those who are involved in it, \nthe legislation makes wildlife trafficking an offense under \nracketeering and money laundering statutes, going after the \ninternational networks that are taking profits out of this. It is the \nterrorist organizations on the ground doing the work, but it is the \ninternational criminal syndicates that then move the ivory around the \nworld. We also have to stop that demand for the ivory.\n  The legislation directs that any seized assets from these new \npenalties go toward the conservation of the very species that were \ntrafficked. So when moneys are obtained from those involved in the \npipeline, it can be employed for that purpose.\n  Mr. Speaker, tackling poaching can protect exotic wildlife, increase \nsecurity, and help Africa's development. One of the fastest growing \nsectors in Africa is ecotourism. In 2014, the industry contributed $70 \nbillion to the African economy and directly employed 8 million people.\n  These majestic animals drive tourism in Africa. They drive \nsustainable development there. But if we don't bring the slaughter to \nan end, there might not be any of these animals to see in a few years.\n  The park rangers on the front lines trying to stop the slaughter at \nthe hands of poachers are outmaneuvered and outgunned. This bipartisan \nlegislation will help even out the fight by pressuring the \nadministration to provide vital security assistance, including vehicles \nas well as intelligence and surveillance tools, to these park rangers.\n  We know the security and economic consequences if today's poaching \nrates go on unchecked: terrorist and rebels fund their dangerous \nactivities, and the African economy takes a major hit. The legislation \nbefore us today is a chance to change this course and to reverse this \ncourse back toward one of sustainable development; back toward one \nwhere, in the future, people from around the globe can go to Africa and \nsee these magnificent animals and participate in building the economy \nthrough ecotourism in Africa.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 15, 2015.\n     Hon.

Edward R. Royce,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding H.R. 2494, the Global \n     Anti-Poaching Act.

Royce,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure.\n  I want to, first of all, thank my friend, the chairman of the Foreign \nAffairs Committee, Ed Royce, for authoring the Global Anti-Poaching \nAct. I am very proud to be an original cosponsor. This bill, again, is \na good example of our committee working across the aisle to get real \nresults.\n  On average, one elephant is killed every 20 minutes. That is just a \nshocking statistic. So in the 40 minutes we have to debate this bill, \ntwo elephants will be killed. Last year, the toll was 20,000. It is \njust disgusting.\n  And make no mistake, these animals aren't being killed for sport. No \nmatter how you feel about big game hunting, the real reason elephants \nand other iconic animals are being wiped out is far more sinister, and \nit is why this issue deserves the attention of Congress and the \nadministration. Those responsible for poaching are profiting from their \ncrimes by selling ivory or rhinoceros horns or cheetah pelts.\n  Where do these profits go? These profits go to buy weapons for \nviolent, armed militias, to bribe government officials and law \nenforcement, and to fuel criminal networks. In short, poaching pumps \nresources into groups that threaten security and stability, groups that \nwant to do harm to innocent people and want to do harm to the United \nStates of America. That is why Chairman Royce and I view wildlife \ntrafficking as a security issue, and that is why we introduced the \nGlobal Anti-Poaching Act.\n  Our bill would bring wildlife trafficking under money laundering and \nracketeering statutes that are already part of our law. It would \nsupport the professionalization of wildlife law enforcement units on \nthe ground and allow us to provide them nonlethal assistance. It would \nstrengthen regional Wildlife Enforcement Networks designed to combat \npoaching, and it would name and shame governments that aren't taking \nthis problem seriously.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to highlight the excellent work of the \nWildlife Conservation Society from my hometown, Bronx, New York. The \nWildlife Conservation Society runs the Bronx Zoo and many other \ncultural institutions in New York City. They have been actively \nfighting poaching and trafficking for many years. They have been on the \nforefront of the American fight against poaching and trafficking. It is \na pleasure to work with them on this and so many other issues.\n  I, of course, have longstanding ties with one of their leaders, John \nCalvelli, who used to be my chief of staff in Washington--he ran my \nWashington office--so I know how dedicated this group is.\n  We need to crack down on wildlife trafficking, both to deny resources \nto dangerous organizations and to protect some of the world's most \niconic creatures.\n  People may feel: Well, if I just buy a little ivory doll or I buy \nsomething made out of ivory, how can that hurt? After all, it is there.\n  It may be cute. It may be trendy. What is wrong with it? I will tell \nyou what is wrong with it. It funnels and aids and abets terrorism, \nbecause these groups that sell the tusks and sell the ivory are, by and \nlarge, groups that get the money back and use it to force terror.\n  People who are buying these things are not buying some innocent \nthings; they are buying things that help terrorist organizations. Just \nlike we have the fight with the artifacts that are coming in from Syria \nthat ISIS takes and loots and then sells abroad to help finance their \nterrorist activities, the same thing is true for ivory and the same \nreasons are being used: It is being done to funnel this money towards \nhelping sinister groups, many of whom are terrorist organizations.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this bill. This is a very \nimportant bill. I thank my friend and partner, Chairman Royce.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I just want to recognize Mr. Engel's \ncommitment to conservation on this planet and to his work on this \nlegislation as well.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of \nthe Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and \nTrade. He is an original cosponsor of this bill.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman for yielding. I also thank the \nchairman and ranking member for their work on this very important piece \nof legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, around the world, big game like elephant and rhinos are \ngetting slaughtered. Ivory-seeking poachers have killed 100,000 \nelephants in 3 years. The black rhino population has dropped 95 percent \nsince the early 20th century. In 2007, there were 12 rhinos killed in \nSouth Africa; but in 2013 and 2014, over 1,000 were killed each year.\n  Regarding elephants, this is a photograph of one of the oldest \nelephants in existence. Satao was his name. He was in his forties. He \nwas killed for his tusks. They were so long, they drug on the ground.\n  That is what is happening to the elephant population in Africa. They \nare killed not for their meat; they are killed for their tusks.\n  Most of the people doing the poaching are really not the locals who \npoach for an animal to eat. That is not most of the poaching, although \nthat does occur.\n  Most of those doing the poaching are transnational criminal \norganizations.\n\n[[Page H7371]]\n\nThe criminal groups come from places like China and Vietnam. China is \nthe number one destination for elephant tusks. Vietnam is the number \none world destination for rhino horns.\n  Criminal cartels that are involved in this trafficking don't just \ntraffic wildlife. They traffic drugs, weapons, and people. It is all \nthe same group of criminals that are trafficking. They traffic anything \nfor money.\n  The wildlife trafficking trade has exploded in recent years because \nthe criminals understand that profits they get from trafficking \nwildlife are bigger than what they get for trafficking drugs.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Also, the chances of getting caught are less and, if caught, the \npunishment is less. So that is why wildlife trafficking is on the \nincrease.\n  A rhino horn is now worth about $27,000 per pound. That is twice the \nvalue of gold and platinum and more than cocaine and diamonds.\n  It should come as no surprise that terrorist groups are involved in \nthis as well. I held a hearing in my subcommittee in February on the \nconnection between wildlife trafficking and terrorist groups. The \nwitnesses testified that terrorists are one of several groups involved \nin wildlife trafficking. And, of course, they do it all for the money. \nThey use the money, as Mr. Engel said, to buy bullets and guns to cause \nterror in Africa and other places in the world.\n  Just over the weekend, al Qaeda's Somali affiliate, Al-Shabaab, \nreleased photographs of its fighters hunting and killing a giraffe. \nHere is a photograph of that giraffe that was killed in Africa. It is a \nrecruiting poster for jihad.\n  Al-Shabaab put this on its recruiting poster. This recent video says: \nTerrorism is in my nation, and we do it for tourism. Therefore, come \nand help us in jihad. That is a recruiting poster, the killing of \nwildlife in Africa.\n  Killing of elephants is a main revenue source for the Lord's \nResistance Army, led by the infamous Joseph Kony.\n  By going after wildlife traffickers, we are going after transnational \ncriminal organizations and terrorists.\n  But we also must call out, as this legislation does, corrupt \ngovernment officials that give a wink and a nod for allowing the \npoaching, in their countries, of rhinos, elephants, and others.\n  This isn't just a wildlife problem. It is a national security \nproblem. This bill will give our law enforcement the authority it needs \nto be able to go after criminals and terrorists and help foreign \ngovernments save rhinos and elephants from extinction.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, if we don't stop wildlife trafficking \nof rhinos, elephants, and other animals by terrorist groups, for \norganized criminal activities, the only places our kids and grandkids \nare going to see rhinos and elephants are at the zoo or in a Disney \ncartoon.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Again, let me thank Chairman Royce for his leadership on this issue, \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), and all of the people that have \nworked so hard on this.\n  We need to be creative in the way we go after financing for violent \ngroups. If nothing is done, I believe the statistic is that, in 11 \nyears, elephants will be extinct in the wild. Isn't that a tragedy? Who \nwould have thought? So we need to be creative in the way we go after \nthe financing for violent groups.\n  Mr. Poe pointed out some very, very important things about terrorism \nand criminal activities. So, again, I want to say that, when people buy \nthese things, it is not innocent. They are aiding terrorism, and they \nare aiding criminality.\n  We need to use every tool at our disposal, so this legislation does \nthat by going after a critical source of funding for criminals and \nterrorists. At the same time, it will help to preserve some of the \nworld's most imperiled animals.\n  Again, I urge all my colleagues to support this measure. I thank \nChairman Royce for his hard work on this and so many other things. This \nis something that everyone needs to support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, part of the tragedy of this can be seen in \nwhat happened in Garissa National Park in Africa. The jihadists hit \nthat park in order to take those tusks, in order to get that hard \ncurrency and trade those tusks for weapons and for bullets, and then \nused that weaponry to turn on Garissa University.\n  Now, remember, these are jihadists. The one thing that Al-Shabaab has \nin common with the Janjaweed and with these other jihadi organizations \nis a hatred--just as Boko Haram has this hatred--a hatred of those who \nstudy.\n  So what did they do? What did they do when they had their hands on \nthose weapons? They then went to Garissa University and slaughtered 145 \nstudents after slaughtering the elephants in the parks.\n  There is a direct link when jihadi organizations, as Judge Ted Poe \nshared with you, carried out these attacks to recruit, to show that \nthey have got the power to kill, that they have got the power to \nexterminate, to annihilate not just these animal species but human \nbeings as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, time is not on our side. Each day of inaction means more \nanimals poached, and the coffers of terrorist organizations and rebels \ngrow full because the criminal syndicates that buy the ivory give them \nthe weapons and give them the money. That has to come to an end.\n  Since the time we started this debate, as Mr. Engel pointed out, two \nelephants have already been poached, have been slaughtered, because one \nis killed every 15 minutes in Africa.\n  It is quite possible, as Mr. Engel said and as Mr. Poe alluded, that \nour children could grow up in a world without rhinoceros, without \nelephants, and it is no exaggeration. Certainly the forest elephant is \ngoing to be wiped out; the black rhino is going to be wiped out.\n  Do we want to live in that kind of a world? Do we want to allow that \nto happen on our watch?\n  The Global Anti-Poaching Act combats today's unprecedented levels of \npoaching and wildlife trafficking by holding foreign governments \naccountable, by adding greater consequences for traffickers in this \nillicit trade, while also assisting those park rangers on the ground \nwho, frankly, need our help, need the help of our intelligence \nservices, need our satellites and other capabilities, and need a better \nway in which to defend themselves and those parklands across Africa.\n  Some years ago, myself and another Member of this body authored \nlegislation to help set up these national parks across Africa, the \nCongo Basin Forest Partnership Act, which Clay Shaw and I authored.\n  But today these terrorist organizations are in the parklands \nthemselves, slaughtering these species.\n  I would like to thank the Members that have been involved in putting \nthis together and, also, some from the other committees that assisted \nus, like Chairman Goodlatte of the Judiciary Committee and Chairman \nBishop of the Natural Resources Committee, for their constructive input \nand assistance in getting this legislation to the floor.\n  And, of course, I would like, in closing, to recognize, again, \nRanking Member Engel and Representatives Poe, Smith, and Bass for their \nvaluable contributions.\n  I urge all my colleagues to seize this opportunity and vote for H.R. \n2494 and then help us bring a little pressure to bear to get this bill \nout of the Senate.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reiterate a point I made \nduring the Foreign Affairs Committee markup of the Global Anti-Poaching \nAct, H.R. 2494, which is being considered on the House floor today.\n  At the markup in June, I offered a very specific amendment to this \nbill that would simply ensure that nothing in Section 6 of this Act \nshall be construed to authorize the use of the United States Armed \nForces in combat activities. Since that time, I am happy to see that \nthe Chairman has amended the text of this legislation to reflect my \nconcerns.\n  I think it is important to state, once again, that this bill does not \nauthorize the use of U.S. forces in combat activities as a result of \nfighting poaching. At markup the Chairman assured me that nothing in \nthis bill could be construed to authorize such a combat activity, and \nthe amended text of this bill does more to ensure that is the case.\n  We all know that poaching is a very serious problem and I believe \nthis bill is a constructive\n\n[[Page H7372]]\n\nstep toward combating that evil.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the \nresolution (H. Res. 354) expressing the sense of the House of \nRepresentatives regarding the safety and security of Jewish communities \nin Europe.\n  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.\n  The text of the resolution is as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 354\n\n       Whereas anti-Semitic rhetoric and acts, including violent \n     attacks on people and places of faith, have increased in \n     frequency, variety, and severity in many countries in Europe;\n       Whereas the French Service de Protection de la Communaute \n     Juive (Jewish Community Security Service) reported an \n     increase in anti-Semitic acts in France between 2013 to 2014 \n     (from 423 acts to 851), including an increase in violent ones \n     (from 105 acts to 241);\n       Whereas the Community Security Trust reported an increase \n     in anti-Semitic acts in\n\n[[Page H7373]]\n\n     the United Kingdom between 2013 to 2014 (from 535 acts to \n     1,168), including an increase in violent ones (from 69 to \n     81); and the Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary \n     European Jewry reported an increase in anti-Semitic acts \n     between 2013 and 2014 in Germany (from 788 acts to 1076, \n     including 36 violent acts to 76), Belgium (from 64 acts to \n     109, including 11 violent acts to 30), Austria (from 137 acts \n     to 255, including 4 violent acts to 9), and Italy (from 45 to \n     90, including 12 violent acts to 23);\n       Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported, in \n     its latest available statistics, 870 incidents in 2012 with \n     anti-Jewish bias motivation, including 13 violent incidents, \n     and 625 incidents in 2013 with anti-Jewish bias motivation, \n     including four violent incidents;\n       Whereas anti-Semitic attacks have been increasingly \n     directed at places of ordinary daily life and places of \n     worship, including--\n       (1) the violent extremist who pledged his loyalty to the \n     Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and attacked a \n     kosher supermarket in Paris, France, January 9, 2015, \n     murdering four Jewish patrons; and\n       (2) the violent extremist who pledged his loyalty to ISIS \n     and attacked the Great Synagogue in Copenhagen, Denmark, \n     during a bat mitzvah celebration, February 15, 2015, \n     murdering a member of the Jewish community on security duty, \n     and wounding two members of the Danish Police Service;\n       Whereas anti-Semitic attacks are threats to the fundamental \n     freedoms, rights, security, and diversity of all citizens, \n     societies, and countries in which they occur;\n       Whereas governments have primary responsibility for the \n     security and safety of all of their citizens and therefore \n     primary responsibility for monitoring, preventing, and \n     responding to anti-Semitic violence;\n       Whereas Jewish community groups that focus on strengthening \n     safety awareness, crisis management, and preparedness are \n     essential to keeping members of the Jewish community safe, \n     and complement efforts of government and inter-governmental \n     entities;\n       Whereas keeping members of Jewish communities safe requires \n     government agencies, intergovernmental institutions and \n     agencies, and law enforcement associations, formally \n     recognizing and partnering with Jewish community groups that \n     focus on safety awareness and crisis management and \n     preparedness;\n       Whereas in the United States, United Kingdom, and France, \n     there are examples of formal recognition, partnership, \n     training, and information-sharing between government entities \n     and Jewish community security groups that have strengthened \n     these countries and contributed to the safety and security of \n     Jewish communities;\n       Whereas Jewish community groups, consortia, and \n     initiatives, have formed and are forming to focus on safety \n     awareness, crisis management, and preparedness, and partner \n     with law enforcement entities and thought leaders;\n       Whereas information-sharing and action-focused campaigns, \n     including the national ``If You See Something, Say \n     Something'' campaign of the Department of Homeland Security, \n     which rely on members of the public reporting suspicious \n     activity to law enforcement personnel, are critical to \n     preventing violent attacks on individuals and communities;\n       Whereas relevant information, research, and analysis is \n     vital to strengthening the preparedness, prevention, \n     mitigation, and response of Jewish communities and law \n     enforcement agencies;\n       Whereas broader efforts to counter violent extremism, and \n     efforts to counter anti-Semitism, should be integrated with \n     each other as appropriate and share best practices;\n       Whereas in the Berlin Declaration of April 29, 2004, \n     participating States of the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) condemned anti-Semitism and \n     committed themselves to specific actions to combat it, and to \n     collect and maintain reliable information and statistics \n     about anti-Semitic crimes;\n       Whereas, on December 6, 2013, the Ministerial Council of \n     the OSCE, which is composed of the Foreign Ministers of \n     participating States, adopted Decision number 3/13 entitled \n     ``Freedom of Thought, Conscience, Religion, or Belief'', \n     emphasizing ``the link between security and full respect for \n     the freedom of thought'', and committing member governments \n     to adopt ``policies to promote respect and protection for \n     places of worship and religious sites, religious monuments, \n     cemeteries and shrines against vandalism and destruction'', \n     among other specific actions;\n       Whereas, on December 5, 2014, the Ministerial Council of \n     the OSCE adopted Declaration number 8, the Basel Declaration, \n     on ``Enhancing Efforts to Combat Anti-Semitism'', in which \n     members of the Council stated, ``We express our concern at \n     the disconcerting number of anti-Semitic incidents that \n     continue to take place in the OSCE area and remain a \n     challenge to stability and security'' and ``We stress the \n     importance of States collaborating with civil society through \n     effective partnerships and strengthened dialogue and co-\n     operation on combating anti-Semitism''; and\n       Whereas in 2004, Congress passed the Global Anti-Semitism \n     Review Act, which established an Office to Monitor and Combat \n     Anti-Semitism, headed by a Special Envoy to Monitor and \n     Combat Anti-Semitism: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n       (1) urges the United States Government to work closely with \n     European governments and their law enforcement agencies, the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), \n     the European Union, Europol, and Interpol, encouraging them \n     to--\n       (A) formally recognize, partner, train, and share \n     information with Jewish community security groups to \n     strengthen preparedness, prevention, mitigation, and response \n     related to anti-Semitic attacks and to support related \n     research initiatives;\n       (B) consider the formal partnerships in the United States, \n     the United Kingdom, and France, between government entities \n     and Jewish community security groups, as examples of \n     partnership, training, and information-sharing;\n       (C) support assessments of the--\n       (i) general environment in which anti-Semitic attacks \n     occur;\n       (ii) data on types of crimes committed and the response \n     from law enforcement;\n       (iii) relationships of Jewish community groups with local \n     law enforcement agencies, including joint training \n     opportunities and information sharing;\n       (iv) preparedness, including emergency response plans, of \n     Jewish community groups; and\n       (v) response of local law enforcement systems to anti-\n     Semitic attacks, including incident reporting, initial \n     response, and the prioritization and prosecution of those \n     crimes;\n       (D) utilize these assessments to help make adjustments to \n     their strategies and efforts to combat anti-Semitism as \n     needed;\n       (E) help Jewish communities develop common, baseline safety \n     standards;\n       (F) consider developing a standardized pan-European \n     information-sharing and alerting system that can include \n     governmental and non-governmental agencies, as well as Jewish \n     communities;\n       (G) develop safety-awareness and suspicious activity \n     reporting campaigns;\n       (H) integrate, as appropriate, efforts to combat violent \n     extremism and efforts to combat anti-Semitism;\n       (I) ensure law enforcement personnel are effectively \n     trained to monitor, prevent, and respond to anti-Semitic \n     violence, and to partner with Jewish communities;\n       (J) reaffirm and work for the implementation of the OSCE \n     declarations, decisions, and other commitments focusing on \n     anti-Semitism; and\n       (K) ensure senior officials, with commensurate authority \n     and resources, have been appointed or designated to combat \n     anti-Semitism and collaborate with governmental and inter-\n     governmental agencies, law enforcement agencies, Jewish \n     community groups, and other civil society groups;\n       (2) reaffirms its support for the mandate of the United \n     States Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism as \n     part of the broader policy priority of fostering \n     international religious freedom; and\n       (3) urges the Secretary of State to continue robust United \n     States reporting on anti-Semitism by the Department of State \n     and the Special Envoy to Combat and Monitor Anti-Semitism.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude any extraneous materials in the Record.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism in Europe is on the rise. Jewish \ncommunities there are on the edge. Fearing this rise in hatred toward \nthem may signal a return to Europe's darkest days. This sad reality is \nwell documented by authoritative reports from the Pew Foundation, the \nAnti-Defamation League, and others.\n  In 2015, a survey by the Anti-Defamation League showed that over 25 \npercent of European respondents said that they harbored anti-Semitic \nfeelings; and that number had significantly increased from the year \nbefore in a few countries, such as in the Netherlands and in the United \nKingdom.\n  It is a phenomenon clearly felt on the streets, seen scrawled across \nsynagogues and in desecrated burial sites, and even demonstrated in \ndeadly acts of terror. We all recall the horrific attacks on the \nCharlie Hebdo offices and\n\n[[Page H7374]]\n\nthe grocery in Paris and the later attacks at a synagogue and a cafe in \nCopenhagen. Just last month in Manchester, four Jewish youths were \nattacked by thugs who shouted their hatred of Jews. One of the victims, \na 17-year-old boy, had to be hospitalized.\n  The rise of such attacks and hate-filled rhetoric is causing Europe's \nJews to look over their shoulders and even consider fleeing communities \nthat they have been a part of for over 20 generations, to seek safety \nelsewhere.\n  Targeted violence against the Jewish people or any other religious or \nminority group is repugnant. Sadly, the Jewish people have been among \nthe most persecuted in the world.\n  When you think of the consequences of the Holocaust, when you think \nof the consequences of the Inquisition, the magnitude of it comes home \nwhen you realize that there are as many Jews left alive on this planet \ntoday as there were during the early days of the Roman Empire. The \nslaughter of these people, their persecution, leaves for humanity the \nthought: Have we learned nothing from the Holocaust?\n  European leaders must unequivocally send this message to their people \nand act to provide greater protection for their Jewish citizens.\n  This important resolution proposes several commonsense steps for our \nEuropean allies to consider to improve the safety of their Jewish \ncommunities:\n  It calls for establishing partnerships between law enforcement and \nJewish community groups in order to improve the security plans, \ntraining, and enhanced law enforcement response to these anti-Semitic \nattacks.\n  Improved sharing of information between government agencies, law \nenforcement, and Jewish community groups is another key recommendation.\n  Finally, this measure encourages European nations to improve \ncommunication between themselves and with the United States to analyze \ntrends in anti-Semitic crimes and to share best practices in combating \nextremism.\n  As we learned from the Holocaust, anti-Semitic sentiment can lay the \nfoundation for persecution of Jewish communities under the guise of \npolitical protest or under the guise of nationalistic pride. That is \nwhy leaders of free societies everywhere must expose these prejudices \nfor the dangers they pose to their communities.\n  I want to recognize Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey for \nauthoring this important measure. And, as always, I thank Ranking \nMember Engel for his help on this measure and in getting this bill to \nthe floor.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this timely resolution.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I rise in support of this measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce, again, for being on top \nof all these very important issues. Under his leadership, the Foreign \nAffairs Committee has really taken the lead on important issues such as \nthis.\n  I want to also thank Mr. Smith from New Jersey for sponsoring this \nresolution. As the chair of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, \nGlobal Human Rights, and International Organizations, Chris Smith has \nbeen focused on the disturbing surge of anti-Semitism in Europe. He is \nalways there. He always speaks out forcefully about anti-Semitism and \nother things that are important to him. I am grateful for his \nleadership.\n  It is disappointing that we still need to take up this sort of \nmeasure. As we all know, anti-Semitism, that ancient hatred, has \ncontinued smoldering through the centuries. Week after week, we hear \nreports of new anti-Semitic attacks: the vandalism of the Babi Yar \nHolocaust site in Kiev--I have been there a number of times. It is very \ndisheartening that that would be desecrated--the targeting of the Great \nSynagogue in Copenhagen; and, of course, the unfathomable attack, as \nChairman Royce mentioned, in Paris last January.\n  We would be foolish to dismiss this surge in anti-Semitism as the \nwork of violent, fringe individuals. In countries like Hungary and \nGreece, shamefully, we see explicitly anti-Semitic political parties \nwinning seats and elections. It is deeply troubling, very disturbing.\n  It wasn't even a century ago that we heard this canary in the coal \nmine. You can draw a straight line from early indifference and inaction \nto the darkest chapter in human history. The lessons of the Holocaust \nare seared in our collective consciousness. Those lessons are telling \nus to throw water on this fire before it burns out of control.\n  I was born after World War II in New York, and I remember hearing \nfamily members talking about anti-Semitism. The general prevailing \nthought was, well, this is something that will never happen again, that \nthe Holocaust was so horrific that world humanity would understand that \nsomething like this could never happen again. When I say ``never happen \nagain,'' I mean to any group--not just to Jewish groups, to any group.\n\n  This cannot be tolerated, and one has to just look around the world \nto see all the hatred and all the people who are being slaughtered \nbecause of who they are or what tribe they are from or what people they \nare from.\n  It is particularly galling in Europe, where so many people--6 million \nJewish people--perished during the Holocaust, that anti-Semitism would \nrear its ugly head again. One would think that people would be ashamed \nand would not want to go down the anti-Semitic path again.\n  Here it is, barely 70 years after the end of World War II, and we see \nan alarming rise. And it is an alarming rise from a lot of different \ncommunities. There are skinheads and people who have always uttered \nanti-Semitic remarks.\n  We also, unfortunately, have a number of people living in Europe of \nMiddle Eastern descent who also are using the conflict between Israel \nand the Palestinians to, again, fan the fires of anti-Semitic hatred. \nAs the numbers of people from Arab lands go to Europe, some, \nunfortunately, are fanning the fires of anti-Semitism. That has to be \ncondemned and stopped as well.\n  Anti-Semitism needs to be condemned no matter who is espousing it, no \nmatter where it is coming from, and no matter what they are saying. It \nis really time to call it the way it is.\n  So we need greater vigilance by law enforcement when Jewish \ncommunities in Europe are under threat. But it is not that simple. We \nalso need greater leadership from officials by speaking out against \nanti-Semitism. We had a bill just a couple of hours ago--maybe not even \na couple of hours ago--which talked about the Palestinian leadership \nnot condemning anti-Semitism and having incitement of things that \nresult in anti-Semitic attacks.\n  So this is the same thing. It is the same thing, whether it is in \nEurope or the Middle East. It is rearing its ugly head, and it is time \nfor us to continue to speak out against it.\n  The United States of America has always been the bastion of society, \nand the world looks to us for leadership. I think it is very important \nthat the United States Congress is doing this now.\n  So we need greater vigilance by law enforcement when Jewish \ncommunities in Europe are under threat, but it is not that simple. We \nalso need greater leadership from officials by speaking out against \nanti-Semitism. We need stronger partnerships with Jewish communities to \nhelp them develop their own safety responses, community policing \ntechniques, and information sharing with government agencies.\n  We need to foster cultures that respect diversity and don't ostracize \nminority groups. I condemn any kind of ostracizing of any minority \ngroup in this country or around the world. We need to step in and say \nthat we will not tolerate it.\n  So this resolution encourages these efforts, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to support it. Anti-Semitism is rearing its ugly head, but \nit can be defeated. I think what the Congress is doing today is a very \ngood step in that direction.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the remainder of my time to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the author of this measure, and \nI ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control the time. Mr. \nSmith, as U.S. chairman of the Helsinki Commission, works with our \nEuropean allies to improve the security and improve the safety of these \nJewish communities in Europe. We appreciate his authorship of this \nresolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n\n[[Page H7375]]\n\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for his \nleadership on this very important human rights issue, as he has done so \nably and effectively on all of these issues, particularly his \nleadership on Iran; and that, of course, would be echoed with Eliot \nEngel's excellent work there as well. This is a group of leaders that \nhave made a huge difference. So thank you, Chairman Royce, for that.\n  H. Res. 354, Mr. Speaker, prescribes specific, effective actions that \ngovernment should take in response to the deadly threats to the Jewish \ncommunities in Europe. As we all know, the number of violent anti-\nSemitic attacks have increased from 100 to 400 percent in some European \ncountries since 2013 alone. Murders in Paris and Copenhagen and \nelsewhere remind us that there are those who are motivated by anti-\nSemitic hate and have the will and the means to kill.\n  I would just note parenthetically that my work in combating anti-\nSemitism began back in 1981, in my first term, from this very podium, \nspeaking out in favor of Jewish refuseniks. I joined Mark Levin and the \nNCSJ 1 year later in 1982 on a trip to the Soviet Union where we met \nwith men and women who were targeted by the KGB and the Soviet evil \nempire simply because they were Jewish. Sadly, anti-Semitism has not \nabated, and in recent years, it has actually worsened.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  This resolution calls for the United States Government to work with \nour European allies on specific actions that are essential to keep \nEuropean Jewish communities safe and secure. It is based on \nconsultations with the leading experts who are working directly with \nthese communities. The resolution focuses on the formal partnerships \nbetween European law enforcement agencies and Jewish community security \ngroups.\n  Here in the United States, Mr. Speaker, the collaboration between the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and Security Community Network--an \ninitiative of the Jewish Federation of North America and the Conference \nof Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations--has been \nessential to protecting Jewish communities here.\n  The formal partnerships between the Community Security Trust in the \nUnited Kingdom and the Jewish Community Security Service in France and \ntheir respective governments are also excellent models that need to be \nemulated.\n  The resolution emphasizes the importance of consistent, two-way \ncommunication and information sharing between law enforcement agencies \nand Jewish community groups. It encourages the development of a pan-\nEuropean information sharing, communication, and alerting system, and \nenvisions governments, intergovernmental agencies, and Jewish \ncommunities working together on it. Such a system should function day-\nround and year-round and include training for personnel who are \nimplementing it.\n  The resolution also calls for European governments to support \nassessments in several key areas and accordingly adjust their actions \nand strategies. Details matter. The assessments should gather and \nanalyze data on crimes committed, response from law enforcement, types \nof attacks or incidents that are most prevalent, and the types of \ntargets that are most at risk.\n  It is essential to understand how law enforcement agencies usually \nreceive reports of anti-Semitic crimes and what initial actions they \ntake when a report is filed.\n  I remember years ago, when I offered a resolution at the OSCE \nParliamentary Assembly, we heard that it was just hooliganism and other \nkinds of acts done by young people when you spray-paint a swastika on a \ntombstone in a Jewish cemetery, when you deface a synagogue, and you \nattack a man simply because he is wearing a yarmulke. Clearly, these \nare acts of anti-Semitic hate; yet, they were being dismissed as \nsomething that was other.\n  Assessments are also needed on Jewish community security groups, \nparticularly of their capabilities, resources, relationships with local \nlaw enforcement agencies, preparedness, including emergency response \nplans, and the extent to which their decisionmaking is based on the \nbest available information, analysis, and practices.\n  The resolution calls for governments to use these assessments to help \nthese community groups develop common baseline safety standards. These \nstandards should include, as I said before, training, controlling \naccess to physical facilities, physical security measures, including \ncameras, and crisis communications. Emergency exercises and \nsimulations, mapping access to facilities, and sharing information with \nlaw enforcement agencies should also be part of the standards.\n  These assessments, Mr. Speaker, will help achieve the resolution's \ncall for law enforcement personnel to be well trained to monitor, \nprevent, and respond to anti-Semitic violence and to partner with \nJewish communities. For all of these assessments, governments should \ndraw information from sources that include Jewish groups, law \nenforcement agencies, independent human rights NGOs, research \ninitiatives, and other civil society groups and leaders.\n  H. Res. 354 calls for safety awareness and suspicious activity \nreporting campaigns, like ``If you see something, say something'' here \nin the United States. Other aspects of the resolution include \nappropriately integrating initiatives to counter violent extremism and \nthose to combat anti-Semitism and the urgency of implementing the \ndeclarations, decisions, and other commitments of the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe that focus on anti-Semitism.\n  To accomplish these goals, the resolution calls for European \ngovernments to ensure that they appoint or designate senior officials \nwith the necessary authority and resources to combat anti-Semitism and \ncollaborate with governmental and intergovernmental agencies, law \nenforcement, and Jewish community groups.\n  Finally, the resolution reaffirms support for the mandate of the \nUnited States Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism as part \nof the broader policy of fostering international religious freedom and \nurges the Secretary of State to continue robust U.S. reporting on anti-\nSemitism by the Department of State and the Special Envoy to Combat and \nMonitor Anti-Semitism.\n  I would note parenthetically that I authored the amendment to the \nGlobal Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004, introduced and sponsored by \nSenator Voinovich. My amendment created the Office to Monitor and \nCombat Anti-Semitism within the State Department. That has proven to be \na key tool in this fight.\n  Mr. Speaker, the resolution has the support of leading organizations, \nand it has 89 cosponsors, including all eight of the co-chairs of the \nBipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism.\n  I would like to acknowledge, Mr. Speaker, John Farmer, Jr., and Paul \nGoldenberg for their tireless efforts and dedication and leadership in \nfighting anti-Semitism and terrorism over the years.\n  John is a former attorney general of New Jersey and is now on the \nsteering committee of the Institute for Emergency Preparedness and \nHomeland Security and is the codirector of the Faith-Based Communities \nSecurity Program at Rutgers University.\n  Paul is the executive director of the Secure Community Network and a \nsenior adviser to the Institute and the program. Several major Jewish \ncommunities in Europe have relied on their counsel, and both have spent \ntime on the ground within these communities.\n  Finally, I would like to acknowledge and single out for very, very \nspecial thanks and recognition Rabbi Andy Baker, personal \nrepresentative of the OSCE chair in the Office on Combating Anti-\nSemitism and director of the International Jewish Affairs for the \nAmerican Jewish Committee. He has been critical--critical--to American \nleadership in Europe and in the United States in the fight against \nanti-Semitism.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New \nYork (Mrs. Lowey), my good friend and the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Appropriations.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to particularly thank Chairman Ed \nRoyce\n\n[[Page H7376]]\n\nand my good friend, our ranking member of the committee, Eliot Engel, \nand all those who were so involved in putting this important resolution \ntogether.\n  I rise in support of House Resolution 354. It was introduced by the \nco-chairs of the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism. In \nthe aftermath of appalling anti-Semitic incidents throughout Europe, \nincluding the devastating terrorist attacks at the Paris kosher \nsupermarket and the Great Synagogue of Copenhagen, this important \nresolution urges the United States Government to help improve the \nsafety and security of Jewish communities in Europe.\n  From Austria to Belgium, Germany to the United Kingdom, Ukraine to \nFrance, there has been a sharp rise in assaults on Jewish individuals \nand acts of vandalism on Jewish places of worship, cemeteries, and \nmemorials. Such destruction and desecration is unacceptable and must be \nstopped. That is why this resolution is so critical.\n  It highlights specific ways the administration can work with European \ngovernments, especially law enforcement agencies, to formally recognize \nand partner with Jewish organizations to develop common safety \nstandards, alert systems, information-sharing mechanisms, and ensure \nthat local law enforcement personnel are effectively trained to \nmonitor, prevent, and respond to anti-Semitic violence.\n  I want to express my appreciation to my fellow co-chairs of the Anti-\nSemitism Taskforce, Representatives Smith, Engel, Granger, Israel, Ros-\nLehtinen, Deutch, and Roskam. The task force remains committed to \nworking across regions, religions, and party lines to condemn all anti-\nSemitism and fight for the right of Jews to live freely as Jews without \nfear.\n  Before closing, I also want to express my strong support for H. Res. \n293, which condemns anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement within the \nPalestinian Authority and calls on President Abbas to discourage such \ndespicable behavior.\n  The latest cycle of terrorism against Israel must end. The only way \nit will end is if Palestinian leaders take genuine and immediate steps \nto denounce all violence and promote security cooperation, coexistence, \nand peace with Israel.\n  As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on State, Foreign \nOperations, and Related Programs of the Committee on Appropriations, I \nwill continue to do everything in my power to bolster Israel's security \nto combat incitement and to promote stability and peaceful coexistence \nthroughout the world.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chair of the \nSubcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa of the Committee on \nForeign Affairs, and the former chair of the full committee.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Mr. \nSmith's bill, House Resolution 354, expressing the sense of the House \nof Representatives regarding the safety and security of Jewish \ncommunities in Europe. I was an original cosponsor of this resolution.\n  I want to highlight the work of my good friend and colleague, Chris \nSmith, for his leadership on this issue and, indeed, for his tireless \nefforts to fight anti-Semitism and support international religious \nfreedom.\n  I would also like to thank our fellow co-chairs of the congressional \nBipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism for demonstrating \ntheir leadership on this issue in Congress and for raising the level of \nawareness and dialogue within our body related to global anti-Semitism.\n  In recent years, Mr. Speaker, the protection and the promotion of \nthese values have moved from being part and parcel of our foreign \npolicy objective to not even ranking as one of our top priorities. It \nis time.\n  It is way past time that we make respect for human rights and the \nprotection of religious and ethnic minorities a top priority for our \nforeign policy objectives and show real leadership and show that we \nhave the will and the moral imperative to promote our values across the \nworld.\n  The terror group ISIL is rising in the Middle East. It is seeking to \nestablish an Islamic caliphate. It wants to wipe out the region's \nreligious minorities of all kinds and anyone who does not adhere to its \nradical brand of Islam.\n  This, along with an alarming rise in anti-Semitism in Europe and \nother attacks on religious freedom across the globe, underscores why \nMr. Smith's measure before us today is so timely, is so important.\n  It urges our government to work with European governments and law \nenforcement agencies in order to help them fight the rise of anti-\nSemitism across the continent and to make combating anti-Semitism part \nof our government's broader policy of promoting international religious \nfreedom.\n  Europe is at the dawn of a lamentably repeated and dangerous era, one \nof anti-Semitism, often masked through a political anti-Israel stance. \nIf we don't move to act now, Mr. Speaker, we may see more deadly \nattacks, like the murder of four Jews in a kosher supermarket in Paris \nearlier this year.\n  We in the United States must be at the forefront, leading the effort, \nhelping other nations develop a more comprehensive approach to \nconfronting the rising anti-Semitism problem. This measure before us \ntoday establishes a good framework in moving forward.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 \nseconds to the gentlewoman.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the task force \nmembers, of which I am humbled to be just a small part, Congresspersons \nChris Smith, Kay Granger, Peter Roskam, Eliot Engel, Nita Lowey, Ted \nDeutch, and Steve Israel, all of us working together to highlight the \nspread of anti-Semitism and steps we must take to stem this tide.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution brought \nforth by the gentleman from New Jersey. I thank all of the Members who \nhave worked on the task force to bring this forward.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on both \nsides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 11 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), who is the ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa of the Committee on \nForeign Affairs and a good friend.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the ranking member of \nthe Foreign Affairs Committee, for yielding and for his tireless work \nto address the threat of anti-Semitism around the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, this resolution was a collaborative effort among my \nfellow co-chairs of the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-\nSemitism, and I thank each of them for their commitment to bringing \nattention and responding to the proliferation of anti-Semitism \nglobally. I especially want to thank and acknowledge Congressman Smith \nof New Jersey for his commitment to human rights and his ongoing fight \nagainst anti-Semitism.\n  This resolution is a strong statement by Congress that, in the face \nof rising global anti-Semitism, countries, including ours, must \nprioritize the security and the protection of their Jewish communities.\n  The anti-Semitism we are witnessing around the world today is both \nunique and longstanding. It is amorphous and it is very direct. It is \ncomplex. But in many ways, it is straightforward hatred.\n  Not every case of anti-Semitism will garner international attention \nlike the attack on the Paris supermarket earlier this year. However, \nJewish communities around the world experience attacks and intimidation \non a regular basis.\n  Just weeks ago, in Marseille, France, an armed man attacked three \nJews near a synagogue, including a rabbi and his 19-year-old son. A \nthird man suffered serious injuries from the stabbing. Earlier this \nyear, in Argentina, the phrase ``death to the Jews'' and a swastika \nwere spray painted. In Ukraine, there have been at least three \nincidents of Holocaust memorials desecrated with swastikas. And in many\n\n[[Page H7377]]\n\ncities, Jews are simply afraid to walk the streets as Jews.\n  Tragically, these cases are far too commonplace for Jewish \ncommunities. No one, Jewish or otherwise, should ever have to accept \nthey will feel targeted, that they will not feel safe, and that their \nlives are always somewhat at risk.\n  Governments must take a hard look at the trends of bigotry developing \nin their countries. They must be sufficiently prepared to react \npreemptively and respond swiftly to cases of violence and intimidation \nagainst Jewish communities.\n  This resolution, among other things, calls on countries to build \npartnerships between communities and law enforcement agencies and to \nestablish standard procedures for responding to threats and attacks by \noutlining steps to take and the responsibilities for each party.\n  I welcome the historic and continued bipartisan and overwhelming \nsupport in Congress for combating anti-Semitism. Tonight, we stand \nagainst anti-Semitism, it is true; but where anti-Semitism grows, it is \na symptom of the growth of hatred, of bigotry, and of the violation of \nhuman rights.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution and, in turn, to \nsupport a world where hatred of any type, anti-Semitism and all hatred, \nwill not be tolerated. That is the world that we envision on the floor \nof the United States House of Representatives this evening.\n  Again, I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Connolly), a very valued member of the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. I thank my friend from New York for his leadership. I \nalso thank Mr. Chris Smith of New Jersey, of course, for his \nleadership, and that of the taskforce.\n  Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism and the safety of Jewish communities in \nEurope are issues with overwhelmingly powerful historical context. The \nContinent has more than intimate knowledge of the devastation wrought \nby the purveyors of anti-Semitism.\n  When we say ``never again,'' our threshold for action shouldn't be \nthe impending threat of violence, let alone genocide. Instead, we must \nmarshal the will and resources to stamp out even the conditions or \nprecursors to an environment that allows for such anti-Semitism to \nflourish. In fact, when we face anti-Semitism today, whether it be \nhere, in Europe, or in any part of the world, we ought to say to those \npurveyors, ``We are all Jews.'' That is the protection we ought to \nseek.\n  The proactive measures and collaboration encouraged by this \nresolution are in keeping with what should be our highest standard for \nvigilance with respect to anti-Semitism. ``Never again'' isn't about \nwords. It is a pledge that is sacred and must be kept.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Cohen).\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to \nthank everybody who has put effort into bringing this resolution to the \nfloor.\n  It is not difficult to stand up--or it shouldn't be difficult, and I \ndon't think it is--to speak against anti-Semitism, but it is a little \nmore difficult to have carved a niche in the United States Government \nand governments around the world as being a leader in fighting for \nhuman rights and against anti-Semitism; and that is what I have seen \nCongressman Chris Smith do.\n  Congressman Smith is the chair of the Helsinki Commission, of which I \nam a proud member. I got to know Mr. Smith during the hearings we have \nhad and the travels on the Helsinki Commission. Chris Smith is a super \nleader in looking out for people and minorities all over the world. So \nI thank him particularly for his efforts at spearheading this and being \nvigilant. It is so important.\n  It is hard to fathom that we still have anti-Semitism in this world. \nIt wasn't that long ago that the Holocaust occurred. We have got \nHolocaust museums and programs throughout different countries. We have \nhad a lot of Holocaust museums and an understanding in Germany as well, \nbut you have got skinheads and disciples of ISIL who continue to spread \nhate and venom.\n\n  I know Elie Wiesel, a survivor of the Holocaust, said that people who \nhate, hate everyone; and I know Elie Wiesel, who was a genius and a \nprophet, was right. So it is important that we stand up and that we \nshare resources with our European allies to fight anti-Semitism and \nthat this country remains a bulwark in fighting against anti-Semitism. \nWe haven't always been that. We are today, and we will continue to be.\n  I am proud to support this resolution. I thank the Members for \nbringing it, and I urge all Members to vote for it and pass it.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  I just want to thank my dear colleague, Mr. Cohen, and the other \nmembers of the taskforce.\n  This is truly a bipartisan resolution. We all contributed to it. We \nall care deeply about it. I want him and my other colleagues to know \nhow deeply I respect their efforts, which have been Herculean, to try \nto end this cruelty that is on the rise in Europe, in the United \nStates, and in other parts. We know in the Middle East it is perhaps as \nbad as it has ever been; and the diaspora that makes its way into \nEurope is carrying that hatred with them--not all of them, of course, \nbut a sizable number--presenting more and more challenges.\n  This is truly a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank Mr. Cohen for \nhis comments.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), who is a newer \nMember, but she has certainly made her mark.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I want to thank Mr. Engel for giving me this \nopportunity to speak, and I want to thank my colleague and neighbor, \nCongressman Chris Smith, for introducing this resolution. I stand in \nproud support of the resolution, and I urge its passage.\n  Mr. Speaker, more than 70 years removed from the Holocaust, Jewish \nresidents in Europe face renewed waves of anti-Semitic violence. The \nPew Research Center reported that global harassment of Jews has reached \na 7-year high. This violence is pronounced in Europe, where the \ndesecration of synagogues, cemeteries, schools, and other violent \nincidents have spiked over the past few years.\n  The Jewish Community Security Trust reported more than 1,100 anti-\nJewish incidents in the United Kingdom in 2014, including 81 violent \nassaults. That same year, according to the French Jewish advocacy group \nCRIF, anti-Semitic incidents doubled in that nation. Troubling, \nviolent, and even deadly anti-Semitic attacks have also occurred in \ncountries such as Denmark, Belgium, and Germany.\n  As the leader in the international community, the United States plays \na very vital role in denouncing anti-Semitism and hate. The national \ndirector of the Anti-Defamation League has attributed U.S. public \nfigures speaking out against hate as contributing to steady decreases \nin anti-Semitic attitudes domestically.\n  As a nation founded on equality and religious freedom, we share a \nresponsibility to stand against anti-Semitism and against hate in all \nits manifestations, whether it is the hate that manifested as four \npeople were killed at the HyperCacher Jewish supermarket outside of \nParis this past January, or the hate that manifested as the nine \nAmericans killed in the massacre at Mother Emmanuel AME in Charleston, \nor the hate manifested as six killed at the Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, \nor the hate that manifested in the flames that have recently burned \ncountless Black churches to the ground. We must join together as a \nnation and a global community to denounce hate wherever it may appear \nand uproot weeds of hate wherever they may sprout.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to support this.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Frankel), a very valued member of the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee.\n\n[[Page H7378]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. I thank Mr. Engel, Mr. Smith, and my \ncolleagues on the anti-Semitism Taskforce.\n  Mr. Speaker, Susanne Winter, a member of the Austrian Parliament from \nthe extreme rightwing Freedom Party of Austria, received the following \npost on her Facebook: ``The Zionist money Jews are the global problem. \nEurope, and in particular Germany, are now getting what they deserve \nfrom Zionist Jews, particularly rich Zionist Jews in the USA.'' Winter \nresponded to the post on Saturday. She said: ``It is great. You took \nthe words right out of my mouth.''\n  Mr. Speaker, this resolution condemning anti-Semitism in Europe takes \nthe words right out of my mouth, and I support it emphatically.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  History has shown us the tragedy of what can happen when this sort of \nhatred goes on unchecked. It is past time for governments and \ncommunities to focus on the rising tide of anti-Semitism in Europe and \ndo whatever it takes to turn it back.\n  This resolution sends a message that we are keeping a close eye on \nthe problem and that action is needed now to meet this challenge. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this measure.\n  I want to also compliment my good friend Chris Smith. We all worked \nhard on this, but no one works harder than he in combating anti-\nSemitism. If you know Chris Smith, you know that, when he gets obsessed \nwith something, he follows it to the end; and it, as always, has a \ngreat conclusion. He is obsessed against hatred. He is obsessed against \nbad things happening to any group of people. I am very proud of the \nwork that he has done through the years, and I want to thank him for \nhis leadership in combating anti-Semitism.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n  Again, I want to thank Mr. Engel for his leadership and his kind \nwords. Again, this is truly a collaborative effort, and I want to thank \nhim for it.\n  Mr. Speaker, at a congressional hearing I chaired in 2002--and I \nchaired about 18 such hearings on combating anti-Semitism--Dr. Shimon \nSamuels of the Wiesenthal Center said: ``The Holocaust for 30 years \nafter the war acted as a protective Teflon against blatant anti-Semitic \nexpression, especially in Europe. That Teflon has eroded, and what was \nconsidered distasteful and politically incorrect is becoming simply an \nopinion.'' He warned ominously, saying, ``cocktail chatter at fine \nEnglish dinners can end as Molotov cocktails against synagogues.''\n  Mr. Speaker, Abraham Lincoln once said that ``to sin by silence when \nthey should protest makes cowards of men.'' Silence is not an option. \nAnd, I would equally say, nor is inaction.\n  If our fight is to succeed, we need government officials at all \nlevels to not just denounce but to act without hesitation or delay \nwhenever and wherever anti-Semitic acts occur. There are no exceptions. \nThe purveyors of hate never take a holiday or grow weary, nor should \nwe.\n  H. Res. 354 is a best practices resolution designed to seriously \ninspire and challenge the governments of Europe, especially law \nenforcement and their homeland security agencies, to partner with their \nrespective Jewish communities to mitigate and hopefully end and \neradicate anti-Semitism in all of its ugly manifestations.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  United States law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security, the \nJustice Department, the FBI, as well as State Homeland Security \nagencies, including in my own State of New Jersey, have been robust and \naggressive in combating anti-Semitism here. We need to replicate this \nand encourage others to follow our lead and that of the UK, and I do \nhope we will do that.\n  This resolution is broadly bipartisan. I want to thank Nathaniel \nHurd, on our staff, for his tremendous work on this resolution, working \nwith all of his respective staffers and Members, of course, to bring \nthis about. And I want to thank the leadership for bringing it to the \nfloor this evening.\n  I urge a ``yea'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules \nand agree to the resolution, H. Res. 354, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and \nnays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/02/house-section/article/H7378-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE E-FREE ACT\n\n  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, can you imagine such debilitating pain, \nfatigue, and depression that you feel as if your children have lost you \nas a parent?\n  For women impacted by the medical device Essure and its documented \ndamaging side effects, this unimaginable situation is a stark reality.\n  Since it appeared on the market in 2002, Essure, a permanent \nsterilization device for women, has triggered over 5,000 formal \ncomplaints to the FDA, including reported symptoms of pelvic and \nabdominal pain, internal bleeding, autoimmune reactions, loss of teeth \nand hair, and even metal breaking and migrating throughout the body.\n  On top of that, Essure has been proven responsible for the deaths of \nfour women and five unborn children.\n  Yet, in the face of all these facts, today Essure remains on the \nmarket, certified with FDA's stamp of approval. That is unacceptable to \nme and the tens of thousands of women who are living with this device's \neffects.\n  That is why this week I will introduce the E-Free Act, legislation to \nremove this device from the market before it can hurt any other women. \nThis is a women's issue, a safety issue, a regulatory issue, an issue \nwith faces and names.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and join me and the \nthousands of women across the Nation in this fight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/02/house-section/article/H7378-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF THE LATE SENATOR FRED THOMPSON\n\n  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. COHEN.

He had been a staffer on the Watergate \nCommittee and kind of made a name for himself there when he asked such \ngood, probing questions and did such a marvelous job.\n  He later went on to be an outstanding attorney before he became a \nUnited States Senator and an actor and a leader in our country who \ncrossed party aisles and was known to sometimes deviate from everybody \nto do what he thought was right.\n  I was a State senator and a Democrat. Fred Thompson, a Republican, \nencouraged me to get involved, stay involved, and shoot for the top in \npolitics.\n  He worked with Democrats in the Senate, and he was awarded the \nNational Conference of State Legislators Keeping Federalism Alive Award \nbecause of his lone vote, a single bill that has kept the policy of \nfederalism. It wasn't politics for Fred Thompson. It was philosophy.\n  He was a great leader. He will be missed. I send my condolences to \nhis family.

Mr. Speaker, thanks to the American taxpayers, what \nmight be the world's most expensive gas station was built in \nAfghanistan. A mysterious Department of Defense special task force \nspent $43 million on a gas station in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. Speaker, that must be a humdinger of a truck stop. What should \nhave only cost $500,000 cost 140 times that amount, charged to the \ntaxpayers' credit card. Yet, there are no answers or explanations.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has now since been reported that Afghans don't even \nuse the gas station because of the cost of the gas.\n  No one has been held accountable for such wasteful government \nspending, not surprisingly. This is getting to be normal for government \n``spendocrats.''\n  Time for no more Washington spending-sprees on the taxpayers' dime. \nPeople need to be held personally responsible for such wasteful \nspending.\n  The American people deserve an explanation. After all, it is their \nmoney that is funding $43 million gas stations in other countries.\n  Mr. Speaker, why are we building a five-star gas station in \nAfghanistan anyway?\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/02/house-section/article/H7379-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS \n  TO H.R. 22, HIRE MORE HEROES ACT OF 2015; PROVIDING FOR PROCEEDINGS \nDURING THE PERIOD FROM NOVEMBER 6, 2015, THROUGH NOVEMBER 13, 2015; AND \n      PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES\n\n  Mr. WOODALL from the Committee on Rules submitted a privileged report \n(Rept.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to lead tonight's \nCongressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, where we will have the \nopportunity to speak directly to the American people.\n  But before we get to business, I do want to take a second, even \nthough it feels like an eternity, to congratulate my dear friend and \ncolleague, our CBC chairman for the 112th Congress, the Honorable \nEmanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, for his hometown Kansas City Royals \nvictory in last night's World Series game.\n  I am an Illinoisan by way of New York. So I had a little stake in \nthis one. But, again, my congratulations to the city of Kansas City and \nto Congressman Cleaver.\n  Mr. Speaker, I truly do believe that it is an honor and a privilege \nto host the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. So I speak \nto you this evening very much concerned and severely disappointed that \nwe are even having tonight's topic under such circumstances.\n  Tonight we are here to address saving our communities, where our \nfocus for this hour will be on key legislative priorities that this \nCongress, this year's Congressional Black Caucus, and our Nation must \nconfront in order to help make this union more perfect for our next \ngeneration.\n  Mr. Speaker, this year there have been a lot of tragic episodes that \nmay make one shake their head and ask what is going on.\n  We have covered a number of these topics in the course of this year, \nwhether it be the issue of criminal justice reform, gun violence, \neconomic investment as a antidote to violence, community policing, or \nthe value of Black lives in America.\n  Mr. Speaker, the issues that I will cover this evening aren't Black \nCaucus issues. I know that most in this Congress and most across this \ngreat country would acknowledge that they are American issues.\n  Falling short as a Nation on these fronts only divides us and only \nserves as a barrier to our boundless possibilities as an American \npeople.\n\n  Over the past few weeks, we heard a lot about the need to clean out \nthe barn before the baton was passed from Speaker to Speaker. I think \nwe made some progress in clearing out the barn last week as we passed a \nbipartisan budget agreement, which President Obama signed into law \nearlier today.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, as the baton has been passed from Speaker Boehner \nto Speaker Ryan, we must keep in mind that there is still much that \nneeds to be cleaned out of the barn when it comes to criminal justice \nreform, creating opportunity in vulnerable communities, addressing \ninequities in the justice system, valuing all lives, regardless of \nrace, religion or sexual orientation, making sure that good cops can do \ntheir job in keeping communities safe, and making sure that bad cops \ndon't get to be the Nation's norm.\n  We must have a culture where bad cops don't have a safe haven, where \nthey can't get away with violations of the public trust in communities \nthey were sworn to protect, and where they aren't in a position to \nspoil the whole bunch of good cops we have protecting American \ncommunities.\n  Mr. Speaker, tonight we will have a long and overdue conversation \nabout saving our communities.\n  At this time, I yield to the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, \nmy colleague from North Carolina, Representative G.K. Butterfield.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Let me first thank you, Congresswoman Robin Kelly, \nfor yielding time to me tonight. Thank you for your willingness to stay \non the floor tonight, even though this suspension bill was placed in \nfront of us tonight. We certainly understand that has that happen from \ntime to time. But thank you so very much for staying on the floor to \nmanage the time this evening.\n  I also want to thank you, Ms. Kelly, for your extraordinary \nleadership. Thank you for what you do for the Congressional Black \nCaucus. Thank you for what you do for your constituents in Illinois. \nMost importantly, thank you for what you do for our country. It is \ncertainly appreciated.\n  I will certainly join you, Ms. Kelly, in congratulating the Kansas \nCity Royals on their well-deserved victory. I did not watch the entire \nWorld Series, but I watched enough of it to know that this team was \nmuch deserving of this victory. And so congratulations not only to Mr. \nCleaver, who is so proud of Kansas City and talks about his hometown \nall of the time, but congratulations to all of those fans of that great \nteam.\n  Tonight we are talking about the urgent need to save our communities. \nWhat an appropriate topic, Ms. Kelly, because communities all across \nthe country are in crisis.\n  I travel quite a bit across the country and visit many different \ncommunities not only in my State, but in many other States. I can tell \nyou firsthand that communities all across our country are facing \ncrises. They are facing crises in so many different respects.\n  They are facing the whole issue of pervasive poverty. Poverty in \nAmerica is real. We have more than 400 counties in the United States of \nAmerica that have poverty rates that exceed 20 percent, and all of \nthese have had poverty rates for more than 30 years greater than 20 \npercent. So poverty is a critical issue in our country, and communities \nare feeling the effect of it in a significant way.\n  Joblessness. Joblessness. I continue to say that the unemployment \nrate is\n\n[[Page H7380]]\n\nunacceptably high. Even though we have made a great improvement in the \nunemployment rate since the recession, it is still too high. For \nAfrican American workers, it is hovering somewhere around 10 percent. \nThat is unacceptable.\n  We all talk from time to time and we see it all over the news today \nabout police misconduct. Police misconduct is continuing to be a \npervasive problem in so many communities.\n  I'm sure tonight Mr. Bobby Scott from Virginia, who is very \npassionate about the whole issue of criminal justice reform, is going \nto talk about mass incarceration in the United States of America.\n  Certainly that is a real problem, and there are many Members in this \nbody who are working every day to try to craft together legislation to \ntry to address the whole question of mass incarceration.\n  Also, we have crumbling schools and infrastructure and highways and \ntunnels and ports. Our whole infrastructure in this country needs to be \naddressed. Hopefully, we will be able to pass a transportation bill \nbefore the end of the year.\n  Hopefully, my friends on the other side of the aisle will not try to \nload up the transportation bill with any Ex-Im Bank riders that will be \na poison pill that would slow down or even defeat the transportation \nbill.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  So the point is, Ms. Kelly, that we do have an urgent need to save \nour communities. We need all hands on deck as we take on this \nchallenge.\n  We consistently see, Ms. Kelly, an over-criminalization of African \nAmericans, specifically our youth. We see, for example, minor \ninfractions that occur in the context of a classroom--yes, we have seen \nthat on television over the last few days--a minor infraction in a \nclassroom that escalates into an arrestable offense.\n  Students, particularly those who are African American and Hispanic, \nare too frequently funneled into the justice system as a result of \noverly punitive school discipline policies and poorly defined roles for \nlaw enforcement in educational settings.\n  Unfortunately, the school-to-prison pipeline is still a reality. When \nI first came to Congress 11 years ago, we were talking about the \nschool-to-prison pipeline, and we continue to talk about it today. It \nis a reality. So we must work together to remedy this problem.\n  We, as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, do not at all \nendorse what some people over the last few days have started to call \nthe ``Ferguson Effect.'' Let me just elaborate on that for a moment.\n  We have heard some high-ranking officials in our country refer to the \n``Ferguson Effect.'' They are suggesting in some way that an uptick in \ncrime can be attributable to police inaction because of their fears of \nthe ``Ferguson Effect.''\n  That is so erroneous. That is so disingenuous. I wish we would \nconcentrate on the problem and not try to get sidetracked on the so-\ncalled ``Ferguson Effect.''\n  The deaths of so many unarmed Black men like Michael Brown, Eric \nGarner, and Freddie Gray are all a result of a number of issues, \nincluding the overcriminalization of minorities and a lack of effective \ncommunity policing practices.\n  Let us seize this opportunity that we have before us to gain \nsignificant ground on several legislative areas which are not only CBC \npriorities, but are also in the strategic interests of our Nation. \nCriminal justice reform is one such area.\n  Mr. Speaker and Ms. Kelly, any criminal justice reform, any \nlegislation that we consider, must guarantee a substantial reduction in \nthe prison population for Federal prisoners. We are, as a country, 5 \npercent of the world's population; yet, we incarcerate 25 percent of \nthose who are incarcerated in the world. There is something is wrong \nwith that, Mr. Speaker.\n  We must make sure that our laws and our criminal laws in this country \nare fair and that they are not disproportionate and overburdensome in \nsome areas.\n  We have Members of this body on both sides of the aisle who \nacknowledge the inadequacies in our criminal justice system and see \nreform as a key priority. The political will--the political will--for \ncriminal justice reform is here today.\n  The President was in Newark, New Jersey, today talking about criminal \njustice reform. Some of my Republican colleagues are talking about it, \nand my Democratic colleagues are talking about it.\n  The leadership on both sides of the aisle have had meaningful \nconversations on this issue. We believe that a bipartisan legislative \naccomplishment can be achieved in this session.\n  I know that there are several bills that are pending, and I hope Mr. \nScott will talk extensively about it when he makes his remarks in just \na moment.\n  But criminal justice reform can take place in the 114th Congress, and \nI believe we can reach a bipartisan compromise that can get this bill \nto the President's desk by the end of this term.\n  Thank you, Ms. Kelly, for yielding time.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, my colleague from North Carolina, \nfor your outstanding remarks on this topic of saving our community. I \nreally, really appreciate it, and so do the American people.\n  At this time, I would like to introduce my other colleague, \nRepresentative Bobby Scott from the great State of Virginia.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentlewoman for organizing this \nSpecial Order so that we can talk about many aspects of the criminal \njustice system.\n  You have asked us to talk about the militarization of communities, \nalso what we can do to improve policing and the problem of mass \nincarceration. On the term of militarizing the communities, there was \nan amendment offered a few months ago that would have prevented the \nDepartment of Defense from giving local police departments certain \nmilitary equipment.\n  I think it is important to read what was actually in the legislation \nbecause some thought that handguns and ammunition was what we were \ntalking about. Actually, the amendment goes into great length \nspecifically about what would be prohibited if that amendment passed to \nhelp reduce the militarization of our communities.\n  The Department of Defense has a program where they will give surplus \nequipment to local communities, and the limitation was that none of \nthese transfers could include aircraft, including drones; armored \nvehicles; grenade launchers; silencers; toxicological agents, including \nchemical agents and biological agents; launch vehicles; guided \nmissiles; ballistic missiles; rockets; torpedoes; bombs; mines; or \nnuclear weapons.\n  Those are the only things that would be barred if this amendment had \npassed, not handguns and ammunition or other things that local police \ndepartments could actually use. But what local police department needs \nnuclear weapons or torpedoes?\n  We are not talking about the large, sophisticated police forces. This \nis the kind of stuff that was being given to police departments that \nyou might think of when you think of Andy Griffith and Barney Fife. \nWhat do they need with a tank?\n  In one of the local incidents when they had a tank come out, it was \npointed out that the people trying to drive the tank hadn't been \ntrained on the tank. Can you just imagine hearing from inside, ``Where \nare the brakes? Where are the brakes?''\n  If you need a military response, the appropriate thing to do would be \nto call in the National Guard. Then you have the military performing \nthe military functions. I think there is a lot that we can do to \nrestrict this kind of equipment going to our local police departments.\n  A lot has been said about policing. We can discuss the problem of \npolicing. We all know that the vast, overwhelming majority of police \nofficers risk their lives on our behalf and do an excellent job.\n  But whenever you get to describe what the problem is, we know what \nthe solution is going to be, and that is to make sure that there is a \nconsensus growing that we need body cameras so we can know exactly what \nhappened and police training so that police can be properly trained on \nthings like how to avoid profiling, how to avoid discrimination, and \ntreating one group different from the other. Implicit bias is what it \nis called. There is a lot you\n\n[[Page H7381]]\n\ncan do in training, and we need to make sure we have funding for that \ntraining.\n  But in terms of mass incarceration, that is where we really need a \nlot of work. As the chairman mentioned, we have 5 percent of the \nworld's population and 25 percent of the world's prisoners. In most \ncountries, for every 100,000 population, they lock up 50 to 200 people \nper 100,000. The United States locks up over 700 per 100,000. We are \nwell into the first place. There is nobody close.\n  That number is particularly egregious because there have been recent \nstudies that have suggested that anything over 500 per 100,000 is \nactually counterproductive.\n  You have got so many people in jail. You have so many families being \nraised with their parents in prison. Young people are being raised \nwithout their parents. You have so many people with felony records \nhaving trouble finding jobs.\n  You are wasting so much money that anything over about 500 per \n100,000 is counterproductive. We are at 700 and some per 100,000. The \nAfrican American incarceration rate is in the thousands. That is just \nwasted money.\n  That is what Texas found when they were looking a few years ago at an \nappropriations request of $2 billion needed to keep up with all the \nslogans and sound bites that they had codified in terms of keeping up \nwith the mass incarceration in Texas, $2 billion in construction.\n  And somebody said, ``Well, if you actually make a better choice, if \nyou invested some of that money in prevention, early intervention, and \nrehabilitation, you might not have to spend all $2 billion.''\n  That is what they did. They intelligently invested in evidence-based \nprograms, programs studied and known to reduce crime, not just sound \nlike they reduce crime, but actually known to reduce crime, evidence-\nbased policies of prevention, early intervention, and rehabilitation, \nand they found that they didn't need to build any new prisons.\n  In fact, they were able to close some of the prisons that they had. \nOver 30 States have figured out that they can reduce crime and save \nmoney by reducing mass incarceration. On the other hand, Mr. Speaker, \nthere are people that think slogans and sound bites are good, and that \nis how we got in the mess we are in now.\n  The chairman mentioned the school-to-prison pipeline. I like to refer \nto it as the Children's Defense Fund does, as the cradle-to-prison \npipeline, because that suggests that there are things all the way along \nthe line that we are not doing that help construct this pipeline that \nends up with--at present estimates, one out of three African American \nboys born today will end up in prison.\n  We can do better than that if we make the appropriate investments all \nthe way through from early childhood education to after-school \nprograms, a continuum of services, to make sure that they create the \ncradle-to-college-and-career pipeline and not the cradle-to-prison \npipeline. That includes investments that have been studied, evidence \nbased, and we know they work.\n  There is a lot you can do in terms of criminal justice reform, but if \nyou do it right, it has to be comprehensive. That means you start with \nprevention and early intervention, make sure you are making those \ninvestments so fewer young people are getting in trouble. Then you have \nto do police training. We know that good police training can improve \npolicing and, also, reduce crime. Body cameras can eliminate a lot of \nproblems.\n  Last year we passed the Death in Custody Reporting Act, which \nrequires reporting from local police of anybody that dies in their \ncustody in prison, in jail, or in the process of arrest, so we know \nwhat is going on around the country. As you have the debate, you can \ndebate from a point of view of facts, not just in allegations when \npeople don't know exactly what the facts are.\n  We can make sure that the police training is there. You can have \ndiversion to make sure that people who are arrested might not have to \nspend--the only people you need pretrial in jail are those that need to \nbe in jail. You don't want to have unnecessary people serving time and \nlosing their jobs in the process.\n  You need a continuum of services, drug courts which can address the \nunderlying problem rather than just convict them, lock them up, they \ncome back, same thing, come back, back and forth.\n  If you deal with the underlying problem in a drug court, you can have \na situation where they are diverted from prison and, also, much less \nlikely to commit a crime in the future.\n  One of the major factors in over-incarceration are the mandatory \nminimums. We need to have significant reductions in mandatory minimum \nsentencing to make sure they only apply to a small portion of real, \nlegitimate kingpins, not to girlfriends and people on the periphery \nthat may have gotten caught up in a conspiracy.\n  Once you get into prison, make sure that it is for rehabilitation, \nnot for just warehousing, so you are much less likely to commit a crime \nwhen you come out. You have to fund the second chance programs.\n  All of this is part of the SAFE Justice Act, which has the added \nbenefit that, because of the significant reductions in mandatory \nminimums, there will be savings. The Department of Justice is able to \nredirect the savings into the prevention, early intervention programs, \nthe drug courts, the body cameras and everything else. So everything in \nthe program is paid for by reducing incarceration.\n\n  This legislation has the support of a lot of different organizations, \nliberal and conservative, because everybody knows that, if it is \nenacted, we will reduce crime and save money.\n  So we know what to do. It is just a matter of making sure we have the \npolitical will to do the right thing, to deal with mass incarceration \nby making the right choice, not the slogans and sound bites, but the \nevidence-based approach that will actually reduce crime and save money.\n  We can do it. There is legislation pending. There are a lot of \ndifferent bills, but we need to make sure that the comprehensive \napproach is reflected in whatever comes to the floor.\n  So I want to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for bringing us \ntogether so we can discuss the militarization of our communities, the \nsolutions for policing, which would include training and body cameras \nand how we can effectively reduce mass incarceration. We know what to \ndo, and the solutions save more money than they cost.\n  So thank you very much for the opportunity to present that.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you so much for your important remarks. \nI know this topic is one that you have been researching and studying, \ntrying to come up with solutions for a long time.\n  One thing that is a little disconcerting is you say that the SAFE \nJustice Act is widely supported, but it still doesn't move.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Well, it doesn't matter which bill moves. The \nquestion is whatever moves ought to have the elements of prevention and \nearly intervention, ought to have diversion, and if you only deal with \nsentencing in the Federal system, you are not dealing with mass \nincarceration in the United States.\n  The Federal system only has 10 percent of the prisoners. So if you \njust eliminated the Federal system, you are only talking about 10 \npercent reduction in incarceration. You have to do something about mass \nincarceration at the State level.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  So when you just talk about sentencing reform, if you reduce a \nmandatory minimum for 25 to 15 years, the first 15 years, that has no \neffect, because they will serve the first 15 years, then gradually you \nwill have an effect. If you want an effect, you need to have prevention \nprograms so fewer people are coming into prison, diversion programs so \nthose who are arrested can be diverted from prison, dealt with \neffectively in drug court so they are much less likely to commit a \ncrime again so that you can reduce crime and save money.\n  You have to make sure you have meaningful mandatory minimum reforms \nbecause that is one of the major drivers of the overincarceration. When \npeople are in prison, you have to make sure you have the funding for \nthe programs to make sure they don't come back. And once in the \ncommunity, the\n\n[[Page H7382]]\n\nsecond chance programs that have been very effective need to be funded.\n  We know what to do; it is just a matter of getting it done. It \ndoesn't matter whose bill passes; it is just whatever passes ought to \nhave those elements.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Is there any particular State that you think \ndoes a better job that we can hold up as a role model?\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. There are 30 States that have reduced crime \nand saved money. Texas was one of the first because they were looking \nat a $2 billion appropriation request to keep up with the slogans and \nsound bites that they had enacted in mass incarceration. At the rate \nthey were going, they needed $2 billion in prison construction.\n  They decided instead to invest it in prevention programs so fewer \nkids were getting in trouble; early intervention programs so that once \npeople got in a little trouble, they wouldn't get in worse trouble; and \nrehabilitation in prisons so that as people got out, they were less \nlikely to come back. They found that they not only didn't have to spend \nany of the $2 billion building prisons, they were able to close some of \nthe prisons they had.\n  Texas is a red State, and they called their initiative ``Right on \nCrime.'' Using the word ``right'' in both words is correct, and from \nthe political right. So you had conservatives investing their money \nappropriately, reducing crime, and saving money.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. That is fantastic.\n  I know in my district, we have held some roundtables, and some of my \nemployers, manufacturers, they shared that they did hire people who \nwere in prison and were some of their best employees because they are \nso grateful that someone gave them a chance. We really need to promote \nthat and highlight those things.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. The second chance idea is that people who get \nout of prison ought to be supported. The little money you spend on \nsupport pales in consideration to what usually happens. They get out, \nthey can't find a job, they can't do anything, and they are right back \ninto prison at $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year. If you spend a little \nbit of money supporting them, they might not come back.\n  One of the elements the President talked about today is the ``ban the \nbox.'' When you fill out an application, there is a little box, ``Have \nyou ever been convicted of a felony?'' If you check the box, that is \nthe end of the interview.\n  What the ban the box is suggesting is don't talk about the criminal \nrecord at first. Go through the process so you can present your \ncredentials. Then, at the end of the process, they can discuss criminal \nrecord, but not at the beginning.\n  You will find that many people, the conviction is so far past. \nStudies have shown that after a few years, if you have got a clean \nrecord, the chance of you committing a crime isn't any higher than the \ngeneral population. So if it is a 15-year-old nonviolent offense, well, \nmaybe it is not relevant; and maybe your credentials are so much better \nthan everybody else's that you are the right person for the job, but \nyou never would have had the opportunity to present your credentials if \nyou had to check the box.\n  So all around the country, cities, States, and businesses are \neliminating that box to check, talking to people and seeing if they are \nactually qualified for the job, and those that are qualified can get \nthe job. Obviously, some violations, if you have got an embezzlement \ncharge and you are trying to get a job in a bank, or child molestation \nat a daycare center, you know, but a lot of them, if it is a 20-year-\nold marijuana possession charge or something like that, compared to \nyour credentials, compared to everybody else head and shoulders, well, \npeople can overlook a 20-year-old conviction. You never would have \ngotten to that point if you had to check the box. That is why the ban \nthe box campaign is so important.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. That is a good idea we have now in Illinois.\n  Thank you, Representative. I really appreciate you taking the time \nand sharing your vast knowledge about this topic.\n  Mr. Speaker, many of the families that we represent believe that the \nonly and right way to save our communities and secure our better future \nis to enact laws that actually understand the needs of American \nfamilies, regardless of circumstance, and invest in their future.\n  This Congress must have a frank conversation about what those \ninvestments are and vote for policies that will truly save our \ncommunities. And this conversation has to be a bipartisan conversation, \nnot just a Congressional Black Caucus or Democratic conversation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am reminded that today our colleague, the Honorable \nDonald Payne, Jr., of New Jersey could not be here because he was asked \nto be with the President. President Obama visited Congressman Payne's \ndistrict to discuss criminal justice reform, as you heard a little bit \nabout already.\n  As many of you know, earlier today, President Obama spoke of his \nintent to make significant reforms in the criminal justice space; and \nin keeping with the message of ``saving our communities,'' the reforms \nthe President is championing are necessary. I thank the President for \nhis efforts.\n\n  I want to take just a moment to say that I appreciate the fact that \nover on the other side of the Hill, a bipartisan coalition of Senators, \nled by my Congressional Black Caucus colleague, Senator Cory Booker, as \nwell as my home State Senator, the Honorable Dick Durbin, and men \nwilling to cross the aisle, like Senator Mike Lee of Utah, were able to \ncome together to introduce comprehensive legislation aimed at \nrecalibrating prison sentences for certain drug offenders, targeting \nviolent criminals, and granting judges greater discretion at sentencing \nfor low-level drug crimes. Their sentencing reform legislation helps to \ncurve recidivism by helping prisoners successfully reenter society.\n  These are just small components of an overall strategy to help save \ncommunities, but they are critical ones nonetheless.\n  Here are the facts. More than half a million people leave U.S. \nprisons each year with jobs, housing, and mental health services \nscarce. Many are soon to be back behind bars.\n  Like the President said, many of us in the Congressional Black Caucus \nare calling on community stakeholders to break the cycle of \nincarceration by helping former inmates successfully reenter society.\n  So tonight's Special Order hour is an opportunity that comes on the \nheels of the President's New Jersey visit, a visit where he toured a \ndrug treatment center called the Integrity House, and recognized its \nwork in helping former inmates secure housing, jobs, and skills needed \nto transition to life outside of prison. I have a place like that in \nIllinois called the Safer Foundation that does much of the same work.\n  As the President noted, everyone has a role to play in criminal \njustice reform and reintegrating those who have served time in prison \nback into society. From businesses that are hiring ex-offenders to \nphilanthropies that are supporting education and training programs, we \nhave to get to work getting ex-offenders back on their feet so they can \nhelp build up their communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, this Congress has to have the astuteness and manpower in \nits ranks to recognize that we must do more, that it will take a \nvillage, and it takes real leadership to improve the plight of \nAmerica's communities. This means we need jobs legislation that offers \nopportunity. This means we need safe streets free of violence. This \nmeans we need community policing that brings us peace of mind and \ncomfort.\n  I feel compelled in this conversation about communities to say that, \nas a representative of the Chicagoland area and as a co-chair of the \nHouse Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, Congress must get over its \nfear of talking about violence in America. We have to do more than hold \nmoments of silence when tragedies occur. We have to stop being silent \nand start acting. We don't have to be enemies on this subject.\n  The issues of gun violence and police violence in our communities are \nreal. It is how we respond to the problems that exist in these areas \nthat will show our strength as a country. Right now, the tragic \noccurrences that exist with respect to these issues only serve as \nbarriers to our growth as a nation.\n\n[[Page H7383]]\n\n  When I talk about gun violence, I always start out by reminding folks \nof a few things.\n  First, it is important to realize that gun violence isn't just an \nurban problem; it is an American problem. In the last 50 years, more \nthan 1 million people have been killed by guns in America.\n  Since 1968, more Americans have died from gunfire than died in all \nthe wars of this country's history.\n  A young Black man is nearly 5 times more likely to be killed by a gun \nthan a young White man, and 13 times more than an Asian American man.\n  If a Black person is killed by a gun, it is judged a homicide 82 \npercent of the time.\n  And keep in mind, from metal detectors in buildings to shooting \nsafety drills at schools and movie theaters, gun violence has affected \nall of our communities, not only in terms of how we live, but whether \nwe live at all.\n  And the irony is that, even with all this death and tragedy, this \nCongress can't even put a background check bill on the House floor, \neven with an NRA membership that is in 80 percent agreement that we \nneed expanded background checks. Last Congress, even with about 190 \ncosponsors, the bill never came to the floor.\n  When I talk about saving our communities and discussing the actions \nof the police, I often remind people of this: the police are not our \nenemy. I won't ever say that because that simply is not the case.\n  To make our communities safer, we need the support of families, \nleaders, and our local law enforcement. I come from a family of law \nenforcement officers and know that our police ranks are filled with \nbrave, well-intentioned, civic-minded heroes. Sadly, too many in the \nBlack community don't have the same family experience that I have had \nwith law enforcement and fear the police. I have a 31-year-old son, and \neven though the same police are in his family, he hasn't had the same \nexperiences.\n  And, unfortunately, there are still too many police officers who \nharbor a level of fear when it comes to dealing with the Black \ncommunity.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have discussed the aftermath of a few high-profile \npolice events. I will repeat what I often say: we must hold our law \nenforcement officials to the highest professional standards and provide \nthem with the training they need to effectively police diverse \ncommunities. This training must address the biases and stereotypes that \ninfluence decisions in the field and that create obstacles to mutual \nunderstanding. In working to achieve that understanding, we can strive \ntoward a justice system that treats all Americans fairly and values all \nAmerican lives equally.\n  Before I end, I just want to give my colleague the opportunity to \nshare a few more words.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the \ngentlewoman from Illinois for all of her strong work in criminal \njustice. She has been fighting since she first got here. That is \ncertainly appreciated and has made quite a difference.\n\n  As you have indicated, this is a moment when adversarial groups and \nMembers of Congress, liberal and conservative, have come to a consensus \nthat we need to reform the criminal justice system. The Safe Justice \nAct that I mentioned is led by Jim Sensenbrenner from Wisconsin, a \nRepublican, and has Republican and Democratic support. There are bills \nin the House and the Senate with bipartisan support. If we are going to \nhave this moment where everyone is in agreement, we need to make sure \nthat we do everything we possibly can.\n  I thank you for organizing this Special Order so that we can make \ncriminal justice reform a reality.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you.\n  I thank my colleagues for lending their voices for this important \nconversation about saving our communities, and I will be submitting \nsome other work from other colleagues not here tonight.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues from the \nCongressional Black Caucus because last week our nation was reminded, \nyet again, Black lives have no value. But this time, the reminder was \ndifferent.\n  It did not come from law enforcement in response to a shooting, \ntraffic stop, or 911 call. Nor did it come from inside a jail cell or a \ncourt room. This time, the reminder came from the use of excessive \nforce in a place where most of us would expect it never to happen: our \nschools.\n  Schools should be safe havens for our nation's children. \nUnfortunately, actions of Spring Valley school resource officer, Ben \nFields, caught on video have proven that they are not. Instead of \npreparing young minds across the country to tackle our nation's most \ncomplex issues, some of our schools are fostering fear and mistrust.\n  And, this is what my young constituents have told me. On October 16, \nI held a listening session with more than 400 high school students from \nNortheast Ohio.\n  I was surprised to hear that nearly all of them felt there was no one \nthey could talk to--in their schools or communities--if they felt \nunsafe. Today, I am not so shocked. With incidents like the one \ncaptured in the Spring Valley video, who could blame them?\n  What messages are acts like these sending our youth? Are they to \nthink this behavior is acceptable and that they matter less, if at all?\n  The over criminalization of African-American youth and young adults \nis already a growing issue in our communities. The number of African-\nAmerican men in jail continues to rise. African-American and Latino \nboys and men tend to receive harsher sentences than their peers of \nother races.\n  Further, the school-to-prison pipeline is as strong as ever, with our \nAfrican-American students suspended at three times the rate of their \nWhite peers. In this case, criminal charges were even filed against the \nyoung Spring Valley female student after she was subjected to egregious \nforce by a ``resource officer.''\n  As a nation, we must stop this vicious cycle. It is time to change \nthe narrative and save our communities for generations to come.\n  I call on my colleagues in Congress to work together to pass policies \nthat tell our children their lives have value. We must pass criminal \njustice reform and support policies that create a safe, nurturing \nenvironment in our schools. The future of our communities depends on \nit.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, as many of you know, the promotion of best \npractices and oversight of state and local law enforcement have been \nlegislative priorities during my tenure as a Judiciary Committee \nmember. My Pattern And Practice statute, passed as part of the 1994 \ncrime bill, has served at the dominant tool used by the Department of \nJustice to address the myriad of policing controversies dating back the \nLAPD, New Orleans and most recently Seattle, Cleveland and Ferguson, \nMissouri police departments.\n  Over the past two decades, tensions between police and communities of \ncolor have grown as allegations of bias-based policing by law \nenforcement agents, sometimes supported by data collection efforts and \nvideo evidence, have increased in number and frequency.\n  Recent events in the wake of Ferguson, Missouri demonstrate that \nracial profiling and bias-based policing remain divisive issues in \ncommunities across the nation that strikes at the very foundation of \nour democracy.\n  The deaths of Walter L. Scott--arising from a traffic stop--Michael \nBrown, Eric Garner, and Antonio Zambrano-Montes--all at the hands of \npolice officers--highlight the links between the issues of race and \nreasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. Ultimately, these men are \ntragic examples of the risk of being victimized by a perception of \ncriminality simply because of their race, ethnicity, religion or \nnational origin.\n  Despite the fact that the majority of law enforcement officers \nperform their duties professionally and without bias, the relationship \nbetween the police and some of minority communities has deteriorated to \nsuch a degree that federal action is required to begin addressing the \nissue. With recent Washington Post reports of almost 400 police-\ninvolved shooting fatalities in the first five months of 2015, all \nshould agree that the time for bipartisan action is long overdue.\n  In 2001, I welcomed President Bush's invitation to draft legislation \nthat would end the practice of unlawful police profiling, with \nbipartisan Congressional support. In April, I reintroduced the End \nRacial Profiling Act in the hope that Congress and the Obama \nAdministration can come together to pass legislation that sends the \nsignal that the Federal government is committed to ensuring that its \nlaw enforcement agencies conduct their activities free from bias.\n  In May, the Judiciary Committee, where I am former Chairman and \ncurrent Ranking Member, held a hearing on Police accountability, where \nwe heard from expert witnesses on police practices and discussed policy \noptions to restoring the relationship between the police and \ncommunities of color.\n  In June, I followed up on this effort to address fair policing \npractices by reintroducing the Law enforcement Trust and Integrity Act. \nThat bill is designed to provide incentives for local police \norganizations to voluntarily adopt performance-based standards to \nensure that incidents of deadly force or misconduct will be\n\n[[Page H7384]]\n\nminimized through appropriate management and training protocols and \nproperly investigated, should they occur.\n  The bill authorizes the Department of Justice to work cooperatively \nwith independent accreditation, law enforcement and community-based \norganizations to further develop and refine accreditation standards, \nand further authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to law \nenforcement agencies for the purpose of obtaining accreditation from \ncertified law enforcement accreditation organizations.\n  Currently, there are no federally recognized minimum standards for \noperating a law enforcement agency. The ad hoc nature of police \nmanagement has accordingly left many officers and agencies in the dark \nabout how to cope with changes in their communities. That is the real \nreason police officers and department feel so adrift in the current \npost-Ferguson environment--not the Black Lives Matter Movement. There \nis a vacuum of leadership in policing that can only be filled by \nleadership at the federal level.\n  Beyond the human toll created by law enforcement accountability \nissues, there remains the fiscal impact created by the high cost of \nlitigation settlements for police abuse claims. While most cities fail \nto systematically track the cost of litigation, the cost reports for \nmajor cities have proven staggering. In New York City alone, during \nMayor Michael Bloomberg's three term tenure, NYPD payouts were in \nexcess of $1 billion dollars for policing claims. For small \ndepartments, the cost of a single high profile incident could prove \ncrippling in its impact on public safety.\n  While the Department of Justice has a range of criminal and civil \nauthority to address policing issues, the Civil Rights Division will \nnever have the resources necessary to investigate more than a small \nfraction of those departments engaged in unconstitutional conduct, even \nwith the enhanced funding and task force authority granted by this \nlegislation.\n  Through the support of a robust accreditation regime, like that \nexisting in healthcare, Congress can ensure that all communities have \nthe best trained and managed police departments. Only by establishing \nacceptable police operations standards can we begin to preemptively \naddress issues like use of force and heal the rifts within our \ncommunities.\n  Media reports from Baltimore and other cities depicting \nconfrontations between protestors and their police departments \nillustrate the current divide between law enforcement and the \ncommunities they police. In the past years, cities from New York to \nCincinnati and Miami to Los Angeles have experienced unrest following \ncontroversial use of force incidents by their police. Absent a climate \nof trust and accountability, community needs are not served and the \njobs of the police officers become more difficult and dangerous.\n  The energies of Congress should be focused on the adoption of \nlegislative priorities that address the substance of law enforcement \nmanagement and strengthen the current battery of tools available to \nsanction misconduct. As a Congress we have been enthusiastic about \nsupporting programs designed to get officers on the street.\n  We must be just as willing to support programs designed to train and \nmanage them after they get there. The current national climate requires \ndecisive action to implement solutions. Out of respect for all who have \nlost their lives over the last nine months--both law enforcement and \ncivilian--I hope you will join me in supporting legislation that \ninitiates the reforms necessary to restore public trust and \naccountability to law enforcement.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my \ncolleagues in speaking on the critically important issue of criminal-\njustice reform.\n  Just last week, an African-American girl at Spring Valley High School \nin Columbia, South Carolina was violently arrested by the school's \nresource officer. This is a disturbing example of a law enforcement \nofficer using excessive force when interacting with a person of color \nand a perfect illustration of an alarming trend in our schools. We need \nto have a substantive dialogue around how to empower administrators, \nteachers, and staff to deal with school disciplinary issues so that \nstudents aren't being criminalized for behavioral issues.\n  According to the Department of Education, black females enrolled in \nNew York City and Boston schools are disciplined 10.5 times more on \naverage than their white counterparts.\n  African Americans seem to face undue scrutiny by police officers \nthroughout our communities. Black Americans are more than twice as \nlikely to be unarmed when killed during encounters with police when \ncompared to Caucasians. States and Congress must set higher standards \nfor the use of deadly force and must hold police officers accountable \nif they violate these standards. This is the first of many steps to \nbegin the process of mending the delicate relationship between law \nenforcement and people of color.\n  This disparity is increasingly evident when looking at the \ncomposition of the U.S. prison population. The Coalition for Public \nSafety argues that more than 60 percent of our prison population is \ncomposed of racial and ethnic minorities. That is why I have supported \nH.R. 3713, a comprehensive sentencing reform effort with bipartisan \nsupport that aims to overhaul the current system which \ndisproportionately affects minorities.\n  I strongly believe that addressing the disparate treatment of people \nof color at the hands of police is a fundamental step toward creating \nan equitable society. As one of the first black women to be publically \nelected from Dallas, I spent my entire career championing equity for \ncommunities of color and fighting on behalf of African Americans for \nsocial justice. It is clear that there are fundamental problems in \npolice and justice systems across the nation that needs to be \naddressed. As a former Chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, \nthese issues are of the utmost importance to me and I am personally \ncommitted to finding long term solutions.\n  We must act now to remedy the culture and system of violence against \npeople of color. Our nation has endured this disparity for far too long \nand I encourage my colleagues to not only speak out on this issue, but \nalso take swift and immediate action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/02/house-section/article/H7384-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Payne (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \nofficial business.\n  Ms. Jackson Lee (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today and November \n3 on account of official business in district.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/02/house-section/article/H7384-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATE BILL REFERRED\n\n  A bill of the Senate of the following title was taken from the \nSpeaker's table and, under the rule, referred as follows:\n\n       S. 1731.
