It will create a means through which to finance more \nterrorism. It will create more tension because we only have ``managed \naccess inspections.''\n  What this deal will not change is Iran's behavior. They will continue \nto hate us. They will continue to call for ``death to America.''\n  This deal is a big gamble, a gamble the United Nations is apparently \nwilling to take, but one that we in Congress must reject.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this deal.

We could not be more proud that they call Connecticut home.\n  Congratulations, Pratt & Whitney.

Mr. Speaker, the House will soon consider legislation to \naddress sanctuary cities, local policies that skirt Federal policies \nregarding the detention of undocumented individuals who have broken the \nlaw, a policy that led recently to a terrible tragedy. We should \naddress this. It is right we do so.\n  But I rise out of concern for the enforcement mechanism in the \ncurrent draft of the legislation. The current draft would penalize \nsanctuary cities by reducing assistance to law enforcement, the very \nmen and women we rely on each day to keep us safe.\n  Consider the irony. To promote greater public safety in law \nenforcement, we are threatening to reduce assistance to law \nenforcement, when it is commissions and councils that actually adopt \npolicies regarding sanctuary cities. This is simply wrong.\n  We can do better. I anticipate voting for passage because we need to \naddress this issue nationally, but I ask my colleagues today to work \ntogether. Let's replace this shortsighted provision that wrongfully \npunishes those who serve us each day on the front lines of law \nenforcement, men and women that, months ago, we lauded on this House \nfloor during Police Week for the fine work they do.\n  Let's not reduce resources for law enforcement. Let's ensure that we \nare able to increase and continue to invest in local law enforcement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/house-section/article/H5408-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SAFE AND ACCURATE FOOD LABELING ACT OF 2015\n\n  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1599, which \nwould nullify states' rights to label genetically modified organisms, \ncommonly known as GMOs. The House will vote on this bill today.\n  I share the concerns of many of my constituents in California's 13th \nCongressional District about the proliferation of untested, genetically \nmodified foods entering our food supply.\n  I also share the concerns about the risks to farmers, the \nenvironment, and public health created by the rushed commercialization \nof genetically engineered crops and genetically modified food products.\n  American consumers deserve the best information available when it \ncomes to food choices that they make for themselves and their families. \nAlready, some 64 nations around the world require GMO labeling.\n  We need to be on the side of transparency and the safety of the \npeople we represent. That is why I support legislation like \nRepresentative Peter DeFazio's Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-\nKnow Act, H.R. 913, which would require the labeling of genetically \nengineered foods at the Federal level.\n  So I hope my colleagues will defeat H.R. 1599 and move forward with \nFederal efforts requiring adequate and clear labeling for the foods \nAmerican families are eating.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/house-section/article/H5408-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FINDING A CURE FOR DIABETES\n\n  (Mr. GUINTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the 1.25 million \nAmerican children and adults with type 1 diabetes.\n  As Members of Congress, we have the privilege of meeting with \nindividuals from our home States advocating on various issues. All come \nfrom different backgrounds and different experiences; however, they all \nhave one thing in common: they come to Washington looking to change our \nNation.\n  Last week, I had the honor of meeting with 11-year-old Skye Archibald \nfrom Exeter, New Hampshire, who was in Washington as part of the \nJuvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Children's Congress. Skye was \ndiagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the young age of 9 and, since then, \nhas been vital in changing the stigma attached with diabetes, raising \nmoney to help find a cure, and advocating at both the Federal and State \nlevel. In fact, her hard work and dedication has resulted in the \nsigning of a bill by New Hampshire's own Governor.\n  It is because of bright and determined advocates like Skye that \nWashington can begin working better for New Hampshire. And it is \nbecause of Skye that I recently signed on to H.R. 1427, a bipartisan \nbill to help provide increased coverage of a vital tool that monitors \nsugar levels to help save the lives of those with diabetes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/house-section/article/H5408-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5408-H5409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COMMEMORATING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MS.

Why do we keep doing this?\n  Indeed, sanctuary cities not only don't enforce the law, they \nintentionally cause people to be in harm's way because they are not \nenforcing the law. Denying funding to them is one strong message to \nsanctuary cities, over 300 of them now in the United States, that they \nare doing the wrong thing and needlessly endangering or losing the \nlives of Kate Steinle to illegal immigrants that are here causing this \ncrime.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3009, and for the Senate to \ntimely take it up and pass it as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/house-section/article/H5409-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1015\n                            SANCTUARY CITIES\n\n  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. CARDENAS.

Donald Trump is trying \nto get into the White House, but it looks like he has already \ninfiltrated Congress.\n  This bill on the floor of this House today has Donald Trump written \nall over it. This Donald Trump bill treats people like criminals who \nhaven't even been arrested yet.\n  Congress doesn't need to tell our local police and sheriffs how to \nkeep us safe.

Frankly, \nwe are doing a great disservice.\n  When there are rebel flags being flown to show racial divide or \nmonuments that represent very dire comments about those who are slaves, \nit looks as if this Congress could bring a voting rights legislation to \nbe voted on for all Americans to be able to vote.\n  What a sad state of affairs when we cannot have a real vote on the \nfloor of the House to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, which many of \nus have worked on even from the last Congress.\n  I finally conclude by saying on this floor will be a bill dealing \nwith what we call sanctuary cities, taking advantage of an enormous \ntragedy of which I offer my deepest sympathy.\n  The National League of Cities, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the \nnational Major County Sheriffs' Association are saying that the bill \ndealing with sanctuary cities is misguided.\n  It penalizes law enforcement, and it doesn't allow the common sense \nthat should have been issued in San Francisco, pick up the phone and \ncommunicate.\n  I think we should do the right kind of law in this body, not laws \nthat will undermine the very principles of democracy, equality, and \njustice.\n  Pass a Voting Rights Act now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/house-section/article/H5409-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2015.\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on \nRules, I call up House Resolution 370 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 370\n\n       Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be \n     in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3009) to \n     amend section 241(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     to deny assistance under such section to a State or political \n     subdivision of a State that prohibits its officials from \n     taking certain actions with respect to immigration.

The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for \n1 hour.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, \nI yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. \nPolis), pending which I yield myself such time\n\n[[Page H5410]]\n\nas I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time \nyielded is for the purpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on House Resolution 370, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring this rule \nforward on behalf of the Rules Committee.\n  The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3009, the Enforce the Law \nfor Sanctuary Cities Act. The Rules Committee met yesterday evening and \nheard testimony from both the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the \nranking member of the Subcommittee on Immigration, in addition to \nseveral Members interested in this important issue.\n  This rule brought forward by the committee is a closed rule and \nprovides for 1 hour of general debate, equally divided and controlled \nby the chair and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  We are bringing this rule forward today because both the safety of \nAmerican people and the integrity of our system of laws depends on its \npassage. No institution, body, or agency has the right to selectively \napply the law or selectively enforce the law.\n  The same individuals who claim exemption from our immigration laws \ndemand equality under our criminal laws. Do we really want to live in a \ncountry where an agency claims the authority to pass political judgment \non you and your circumstance to determine if the law applies to you?\n  This is precisely what the administration is proposing. Not only are \ntheir actions contrary to public safety, they fundamentally undermine \nthe most basic concept of law.\n  I believe that sanctuary cities are unacceptable. That is why I was a \npart of the effort to prohibit them in Georgia and why I am so \ncommitted to continuing this fight here in Congress.\n  The tragic and preventible death of Kate Steinle in San Francisco at \nthe hands of an illegal immigrant is the latest example of why we have \nto address sanctuary cities and enforce the law. Hear me, Mr. Speaker. \nKate is not the only victim.\n  According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, of 74,911 Federal crimes \nin fiscal year 2014, 27,505, or 36 percent, were committed by those \nhere illegally.\n  During an 8-month period in 2014, sanctuary cities released more than \n8,000 criminal illegal immigrant offenders the U.S. Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement was seeking to deport.\n  According to a new report released by the Center for Immigration \nStudies, of these 8,000 released, approximately 1,900 were arrested for \nsuccessive crimes during the 8-month timeframe.\n  I believe San Francisco's hands are soaked in blood now. They choose \nto protect criminal illegal aliens over an innocent American woman.\n  Beyond the public safety threat posed by sanctuary cities, the \nFederal Government has the responsibility to be good stewards of tax \ndollars entrusted to them by hard-working Americans.\n  There is no reasonable explanation, in law or policy, as to why the \nFederal Government should send money to cities in the form of grants or \nreimbursements to help them enforce the law when they are blatantly \nignoring the law.\n  It is a waste of taxpayer money to send this money to States for \npurposes of law enforcement when they clearly aren't using it for that \npurpose.\n  The situation before us today is one dangerous political hypocrisy. \nThe administration has vocally stated immigration law lies with the \nFederal Government and the Federal Government alone.\n  In fact, their entire case against Arizona was premised on that \npoint. That was when States were trying to enforce the law.\n  When States don't enforce the law, essentially playing into the \nadministration's failure to enforce the administration's claims, there \nis nothing they can do. It is sort of an interesting proposition.\n  Last week I questioned the Secretary of Homeland Security about the \nissues of sanctuary cities. The Secretary stated there was nothing that \nDHS could do and that he didn't feel it was productive to try and force \nthe cities to cooperate.\n  The administration jumped all over States that help enforce \nimmigration laws, including suing Arizona for enacting laws to protect \nits borders and its citizens.\n  I ask: Where is the outrage by the administration over San \nFrancisco's failure to follow the law? Where is the lawsuit?\n  It is not surprising that the administration is only outraged when \nStates are acting in a manner that doesn't meet their political goals.\n  DHS refuses to make sanctuary cities comply with the law while, at \nthe same time, DOJ is now requiring law enforcement in Maricopa County, \nArizona, to provide services in Spanish to jail inmates and to have \nFederal oversight for all workforce enforcement raids. This kind of \npolitical hypocrisy is the kind that has already cost the life of Kate \nSteinle.\n  The administration wants a nonenforcement policy, but it is up to \nCongress to make the administration follow the law. That is exactly why \nthe Rules Committee is bringing forward this rule and H.R. 3009.\n  Sanctuary cities ignore and shield illegal immigrants at the expense \nof law-abiding Americans, and the administration, through its failure \nto defend and enforce this law, is complicit.\n  Listen, Mr. Speaker, I believe that sanctuary cities should be \ndescriptions of cities that provide safe and secure places for law-\nabiding citizens, not the definition for cities choosing to provide \nsafety for those flaunting our immigration laws.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding me the 30 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying \nbill. The rule here today provides for consideration of H.R. 3009, a \nbill that I strongly oppose that wouldn't even solve the problem that \nit attempts to here today.\n  First, a little bit about the process. This is a closed process that \nreflects the practice of shutting down debate on the House floor.\n  We should be talking about how to protect Americans like Kathryn \nSteinle. Instead, we are limited to debating a bill that, even if it \nhad been the law, would not have affected this case or others like it \nor secured our borders. We are not even allowed to introduce amendments \nthat would secure our borders here before the House floor.\n  We have not had a single hearing on this bill, and it has not been \nmarked up in committee. It simply appeared before the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  It simply appeared before the Rules Committee yesterday fully formed. \nWe talked for several hours about many of its flaws there. But, \nunfortunately, nevertheless, it has been advanced under this rule to \nthe House floor.\n  This bill is not a fix. It is not a solution to anything. It is a \nheavy-handed way to attack communities that are simply trying to find \nsolutions to what is fundamentally a Federal problem.\n  Yes, Mr. Speaker, dress it up however you like. It is our fault, the \ninstitution of Congress' fault, the Federal Government's fault, that we \nhave failed to secure our borders.\n  It is the Federal Government's fault that there are 10-, 12-, 14 \nmillion people in our country illegally, some of them felon immigrants. \nThat is not the fault of any city or county or State.\n  Our law enforcement professionals--sheriffs, police chiefs--are doing \nthe best they can with the facts on the ground which work against them \nbecause of this body's failure to act.\n  This bill before us is simply an attempt to provide a false solution \nto a tragic incident, this in spite of the fact this body has refused \nto bring forward a single bill to fix our broken immigration system or \nsecure our border.\n  The murder of Kathryn Steinle was a terrible tragedy. It should not \nhave occurred. There were so many breakages along the way and things \nthat could have been done to prevent it. But this action is primarily a \nway to highlight our broken immigration system.\n\n[[Page H5411]]\n\n  It is a disgrace, for instance, that our immigration enforcement \nagencies dedicate significant resources to pursuing tens of thousands \nof individuals with no criminal history while the enforcement of our \nlaws against serious felons like Mr. Lopez-Sanchez, as a result, is \nlimited to something like a phone call or an email from the sheriff in \nSan Francisco.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  ICE, the agency with sole authority to pursue, detain, and deport \npeople within our borders--an agency with a budget of more than $5 \nbillion annually--is to blame here for its perverse allocation of \nresources.\n  Mr. Speaker, ICE should have pursued this individual vigorously, and \nICE is responsible for the fact that this man was walking the streets \nof San Francisco instead of in Mexico; but, rather than take \nresponsibility for this tragedy and commit to making the necessary \nchanges to prevent anything like this from happening in the future--\nlike, for instance, encapsulating the President's DACA and DAPA \nprograms in statute so that our limited enforcement resources can be \nfocused on criminal felons rather than tens of thousands of individuals \nwith no criminal history--instead of doing that, this body is \nthreatening local law enforcement with reducing their funds to keep \ncommunities safe.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill before us would do even less to address this \nissue in a meaningful way. This legislation undermines local law \nenforcement, tramples the 10th Amendment to our Constitution, and \ndirectly undermines the authority and judgment exercised by local law \nenforcement agencies that are simply trying to do their job as best \nthey can in light of a Federal failure--a Federal failure--to deport \nfelon immigrants, a Federal failure to secure our borders, and a \nFederal failure to establish enforcement priorities in statute.\n  These decisions behind policing communities and ensuring public \nsafety are made by those in those jurisdictions. We shouldn't have \nreactionary politicians in Washington threatening to cut off funding to \nsheriffs and police chiefs to make their communities less safe and lead \nto more victims of felons, both immigrant and American.\n  That is why this bill is opposed by the Conference of Mayors, Law \nEnforcement Immigration Task Force, the Fraternal Order of Police, and \nmany other law enforcement professionals.\n  The fact is, Mr. Speaker, that article I, section 8 of the \nConstitution, which we began the session of Congress by reading, makes \nit clear that it is the Federal Government's responsibility to create \nand enforce immigration policy.\n  No matter how much this body tries to pass its failure on to cities, \nStates, and counties, it will always come back here because only the \nFederal Government can secure our borders, only the Federal Government \ncan establish enforcement priorities in statute, only the Federal \nGovernment can provide a pathway to citizenship, and only the Federal \nGovernment deports felon immigrants.\n  Despite this, however, Congress has displayed a complete and total \nunwillingness to even begin the debate on fixing our broken immigration \nsystem, instead choosing to threaten local law enforcement for our own \nfailures in this town, Washington, D.C.\n  Mr. Speaker, I tried to reinitiate this debate just yesterday in the \nRules Committee by introducing an amendment to this bill that would \nhave allowed us to address the systemic problems by considering \ncomprehensive immigration reform, including border security. \nUnfortunately, on a party-line vote, my measure was voted down and, \ntherefore, in favor of maintaining this status quo.\n  Instead of having a meaningful debate on how to make our immigration \nsystem work in our favor and keep Americans safe by keeping immigrant \nfelons off the street and securing our border, the Republicans are \ninstead insisting to push this bill through the House, threatening \nlocal law enforcement without hearing, committee debate, or even the \nopportunity to amend it with good ideas from Democrats or Republicans.\n  Felons and egregious immigration violators like Mr. Lopez-Sanchez \nshould not be free to walk the streets of this country, but until this \nbody gets serious about securing our border and creating enforceable \nlaws with the resources to enforce them, people like Mr. Lopez-Sanchez \nwill walk free and will continue to harm Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation will effectively require local \nenforcement of immigration laws, effectively trying to foist off our \nresponsibilities on beleaguered local law enforcement agencies who, \nwith their limited resources, are making the best judgments they can to \nkeep their communities safe.\n  Federal courts have found that the DHS detainer policies violate the \nConstitution. Because ICE detainers request that a person be held in \nlocal custody for up to 2 days beyond the time they would otherwise be \nreleased, Federal courts have concluded that ICE detainers cause a new \nperiod of detention, and they are unconstitutional.\n  ICE has flouted this requirement for years, issuing detainers based \non investigative interests alone; and these dragnet detainer issuances \npractices have caused the detention of countless people who were not \ncriminal felons, felon aliens, who are not removable--even U.S. \ncitizens in some cases.\n  The Federal courts finally caught up with this practice and found \nthem to be unconstitutional and are holding local agencies under civil \nliability for honoring detainer requests from ICE.\n  In Colorado, for example, the Arapahoe County sheriff was forced to \npay $30,000 to a victim of domestic violence who was, herself, arrested \nwhen she called the police for help. She was then held in the Arapahoe \nCounty jail at the request of Federal immigration authorities for 3 \ndays after a judge had ordered her release. Another case in Jefferson \nCounty Sheriff's Office was forced to settle for $40,000.\n  Now, detainers are a form of communication and are therefore, in a \nreasonable reading of this proposed law, included. Effectively, you are \npresenting impossible choices to local law enforcement. You are telling \nthem, on the one hand, subject yourself to civil liability or subject \nyourself to the cutting off of Federal grants to support your efforts.\n  Either way, Mr. Speaker, it is a loss for the safety of American \ncitizens and a loss for law enforcement, all because this body fails to \nown up to the fact that only we can fix the problem; only we can secure \nthe border; only we can replace our immigration system with a \ncomprehensive approach that makes sense and has the resources to \nenforce it, the Federal resources to enforcement.\n  This isn't some theoretical matter that some intellectually curious \nlaw review cooked up. Jurisdictions in my district have been found \ncivilly liable for enforcing detainers and been forced to pay. Lawsuits \nare being filed, and local law enforcement agencies that serve as \nproxies for ICE are losing.\n  If you want to tell cities in my State to enforce unconstitutional \npolicies, why not take on the liability federally? Will this body pay \nthe settlement from the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office? Will this \nbody pay the settlement of $30,000 from the Arapahoe County sheriff?\n  The Republicans are making it clear that they don't have a plan to \nkeep people like Kathryn Steinle safe. They don't have a plan to secure \nour borders. They don't have a plan to address our broken immigration \nsystem. This bill today is just another piece of evidence of this \nbody's, this institution's failure to keep Americans safe.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to hit a couple of points here. It was \nstated by my friend from Colorado about the issue of San Francisco and \npursuing individuals, such as this one who committed murder; and the \nfact is ICE did ask for him to be held. San Francisco made the choice \nto let him go, which is leading us to the issue today before us, and we \nwant to continue.\n  Also, this one assertion that this is a false solution debate--when \nis it a false solution to actually have to be here and discuss actually \nenforcing the law? I think that is exactly what we are doing here. If \nyou choose to enforce the law, that is what your proper role should be, \nand if not, these are the penalties that will be put in place.\n\n[[Page H5412]]\n\n  I think we will continue this process, Mr. Speaker, and at this time, \nI reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern), my distinguished colleague on the Rules \nCommittee.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado for \nyielding me the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this closed rule. This process \nis an absolutely outrage. I also rise in strong opposition to H.R. \n3009.\n  Mr. Speaker, along with all of my colleagues and every American, my \nheart goes out to the family of Kathryn Steinle. The murder of any \ninnocent person is a tragedy, and after each such heinous crime, we \nalways ask ourselves: Could this have been avoided? Could we have done \nsomething differently?\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3009 paints itself as a remedy to Kathryn Steinle's \ndeath, but it does nothing--absolutely nothing--to address how to \nimprove communication between our law enforcement, immigration, \nprosecutors, and penal institutions, nor does it improve the protocols \nand practices of how decisions are made on the release or transfer of a \nprisoner against whom ICE has lodged a detainer request.\n  Instead, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3009 chose to penalize local law \nenforcement agencies and strip them of their Federal grants and funding \nwhen they prioritize working with immigrant communities in order to \nkeep neighborhoods, cities, and towns safe.\n  Republicans would rather demonize these cities and local law \nenforcement agencies and force them to squander scarce local resources \non immigration enforcement, instead of local policing. In effect, Mr. \nSpeaker, H.R. 3009 will make our cities and communities less safe, \nrather than more secure.\n  This is why law enforcement and city governments oppose this bill. It \ndeliberately and cynically undermines their ability to protect their \ncommunities, nurture public trust in the police and our legal system, \nand strengthen our public safety.\n  H.R. 3009 is opposed by the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the \nFraternal Order of Police, the National Criminal Justice Association, \nthe Major Cities Chiefs Association, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and \nthe National League of Cities; all of them strongly oppose this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill reeks of prejudice. It isn't meant to solve \nany problem. It is meant to punish cities that don't embrace the views \nof anti-immigrant extremists. It is meant to demonize all immigrants as \ncriminals.\n  It means to punish any city, any police officer, any sheriff, and any \ncop on the beat who challenges the Republican anti-immigrant orthodoxy \nof ``hate them all'' and ``deport them all.'' Deport the DREAMers; \ndeport the parents of U.S. citizens; deport children fleeing violence--\ndeport, deport, deport.\n  Mr. Speaker, this House continues to wait and wait for the Republican \nmajority to show some leadership and bring up a comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill. It has been more than 2 years since the Senate \npassed a strong, bipartisan immigration reform bill; and we are still \nwaiting for the House Republicans to act.\n  What we need is a way to bring 11 million of our neighbors, friends, \ncolleagues, small-business owners, and hard-working residents out of \nthe shadows. Let them register, be documented, and not fear talking \nwith the police. Let us recognize their achievements and contributions \nto the American way of life.\n  This bill had no hearings, no markup, and no input from local law \nenforcement--no regular order. In fact, in the topsy-turvy world of the \nRepublican House, the Judiciary Committee's Immigration and Border \nSecurity Subcommittee is holding its first hearing on this topic \ntoday--this morning--when this bill is already here on the House floor \nfor debate and voted today.\n  No, Mr. Speaker, this bill is just more of the same, old, divisive \nRepublican anti-immigrant formula. America is better than this, and I \nurge my colleagues to reject this closed rule and to oppose the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise and just, again, part of this is really--and even \nif you look at the Administration's view on this bill and others, it is \nalmost an Alice in Wonderland effect. What is up is down and down is \nup. We are looking at this, that enforcing the law hurts enforcement of \nthe law and that it is backwards.\n  Now, there are issues that need to be addressed. One of the issues is \nthat we have a communication problem. I agree. We have got a \ncommunication problem. When they say, ``Hold him; he is going to be \ndeported; he is deportable; he is not someone we want on our streets'' \nand San Francisco and other sanctuary cities choose to release him, \nthat is a communication problem. I will agree with my friends across \nthe aisle on that point.\n  To say that punishing views--how about enforcing the law? The last \ntime I sat in my law classes, we didn't enforce views; we enforced \nlaws. I think that is what we are bringing up here.\n  I can't let it pass. I talked about this before, and as a Member who \nbelieves that there are immigration issues that we need to address and \nas a member of the Judiciary Committee--which, by the way, has held \nhearings dealing with this subject--in fact, just last week, the \nSecretary of DHS was in. I questioned him directly about this, and it \nis amazing. He has no real opinion about sanctuary cities as he told me \nin his testimony.\n  I find that rather amazing in that he would say that there would be a \nproblem not enforcing these laws, and when I asked about other laws \nthat we want to enforce--is it okay for cities to turn their back on \nthose laws--there is not an opinion there.\n  We have talked about this. We have had immigration hearings. We have \nbegun the process of marking up legislation to secure our communities, \nto secure our borders, and to do those things; but before we start \nthrowing in the nature of saying there is all wrong with the Republican \nmajority on something that we have not done, I just want to go back and \nremind--I am still one who at the time was out there watching the \nproceedings from my home in the State of Georgia, where we were doing \neverything we could to balance the needs of our State and our economy \nduring shutdown and during a depression, recession--whatever you want \nto call it--and we were trying to balance budgets, and we were watching \nthis issue up here, but what I saw was that we are told today we are \nwaiting for Republicans and the Republicans have all this bad agenda.\n  At the same point, when this body was controlled by my friends across \nthe aisle, when the other body across the way--the Senate--was \ncontrolled by my friends across the aisle, and when the administration \nwas new and in their early stages of developing their strategy for \nsolving all the world's problems, what they chose to do was wreck \nhealth care and to work against community bankers. They chose that.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  They chose not to do comprehensive immigration reform. They chose to \nuse it as a political issue and a political pawn. They chose not to \nbring this up.\n  When you want to bring it up, let's shine the light brightly. Let's \nbring it up and shine the light brightly on both sides. The world was \nwaiting. You managed to get a lot of other things through. You managed \nto do other things that you wanted to do, but you chose not to do this. \nYou chose not to make this.\n  My question here is simply: the bill that is being brought forward, \nit says enforce the law.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As the gentleman from Georgia might recall, when the Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate last session, they did pass comprehensive \nimmigration reform with strong Republican and Democratic support. More \nthan two-thirds of the body supported securing our borders, expelling \nfelon immigrants, and keeping Americans safe. Had this body simply \nacted on that bill, as we repeatedly tried to get them to do, we quite \nlikely would not be facing this tragedy that we face here today. Until \nthis body acts, there are likely to be more victims, more American \nvictims, of criminal immigrants.\n  It is not the fault of the Democrats. We, with the Republicans in the \nSenate, put together a bill that would have\n\n[[Page H5413]]\n\naddressed it. It is the fault of this body, the House of \nRepresentatives, that failed to act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record a Statement of Administration \nPolicy with regard to this bill, which includes that the President's \nsenior advisers would recommend that he veto this bill. He then goes \ninto some of the same arguments we have been talking about with regard \nto why we need to secure our border and grow our economy and make sure \nthat we can fix our broken immigration system.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n          H.R. 3009--Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act\n\n                 (Rep. Hunter, R-CA, and 44 cosponsors)\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3009. This bill \n     fails to offer comprehensive reforms needed to fix the \n     Nation's broken immigration laws, undermines current \n     Administration efforts to remove the most dangerous convicted \n     criminals and to work collaboratively with State and local \n     law enforcement agencies, and threatens the civil rights of \n     all Americans by authorizing State and local officials to \n     collect information regarding any private citizen's \n     immigration status, at any time, for any reason, and without \n     justification.\n       The Administration continues to believe that it is critical \n     to fix the Nation's broken immigration system through \n     comprehensive commonsense legislation that builds on existing \n     efforts to strengthen border security, cracks down on \n     employers hiring undocumented workers, streamlines legal \n     immigration, and offers an earned path to citizenship for \n     undocumented immigrants to get right with the law if they \n     pass background checks, contribute to the Nation's economy by \n     paying taxes, and go to the back of the line. While the \n     Senate passed comprehensive legislation with strong \n     bipartisan support over two years ago that would do just \n     that, the House of Representatives failed to take any action. \n     According to the Congressional Budget Office, that \n     legislation would also grow the Nation's economy by 5.4 \n     percent and reduce Federal deficits by nearly $850 billion \n     over 20 years. The Administration continues to urge the \n     Congress to address all of the problems with the Nation's \n     broken immigration system and take up commonsense legislation \n     that will offer meaningful solutions to those problems.\n       The Administration also believes the most effective way to \n     enhance public safety is through sensible and effective \n     policies that focus enforcement resources on the most \n     significant public safety threats. The Administration has put \n     in place new enforcement priorities that do just that, \n     focusing limited resources on the worst offenders--national \n     security threats, convicted criminals, gang members, and \n     recent border crossers. The effectiveness of these new \n     priorities depends on collaboration between Federal, State, \n     and local law enforcement. Every day, the Federal government \n     fosters State and local collaboration through a variety of \n     mechanisms, including policies, programs, and joint task \n     forces. The Department of Homeland Security's Priority \n     Enforcement Program (PEP) enables Federal immigration \n     enforcement to work with State and local law enforcement to \n     take custody of individuals who are enforcement priorities, \n     including public safety and national security threats, before \n     those individuals are released into communities. PEP is a \n     balanced, commonsense approach to enforcing the Nation's \n     immigration laws. It replaced the Secure Communities program, \n     which, by establishing a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach to \n     State and local cooperation with Federal immigration \n     enforcement officials, discouraged some localities from \n     turning over dangerous individuals to DHS custody. Secure \n     Communities was embroiled in litigation and widely criticized \n     for undermining State and local community policing efforts. \n     PEP builds collaboration between Federal, State, and local \n     law enforcement that allows for the most effective \n     enforcement while enhancing community policing and trust. The \n     Congress should give PEP a chance to work, instead of \n     displacing that collaborative approach--which prioritizes the \n     worst offenders--with the coercive approach of this bill, \n     which makes no such differentiation.\n       Finally, the bill would condition Federal money on State \n     and local governments allowing their law enforcement \n     officials to gather citizenship and immigration status \n     information from any person at any time for any reason. The \n     Administration believes that such blanket authority would \n     threaten the civil rights of all Americans, lead to mistrust \n     between communities and State and local law enforcement \n     agencies, and impede efforts to safely, fairly, and \n     effectively enforce the Nation's immigration laws.\n       If the President were presented with H.R. 3009, his senior \n     advisors would recommend that he veto this bill.\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Doggett).\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, the Donald Trump wing of the Republican \nParty is clearly ascendant here today. It is the dominant thinking \namong House Republicans.\n  This is the same crowd that, just back in February, threatened the \nfunding for Homeland Security because they were so eager to deport our \nDREAMers--young people who came here as children, who have cleared a \ncriminal background check, who paid a fee and are already contributing \nto America--because whenever they are in doubt on immigration, they \nfade to the extreme right. These are the same Members of Congress who \nhave even gone to court to sue the President of the United States when \nhe prioritized the deportation of criminals over immigrant families; \nand these are the same Republicans who were so fearful of a sane \ndiscussion here, and this Congress, this House, is never a sanctuary of \nsanity when it comes to immigration.\n  But they refuse to bring to the House floor a bipartisan bill \nunanimously approved in the Homeland Security Committee to deal with \nborder security. If that weren't bad enough, they came back this year \nwith a totally partisan border security bill, and they have been afraid \nto bring it to the floor because they do not want a reasoned discussion \nof immigration in this House of Representatives.\n  Unfortunately, this Congress is also never a sanctuary from partisan \npolitical stunts designed to capitalize on the latest tragedy, like the \ntragedy that occurred in San Francisco. This bill is not about grabbing \ncriminals; it is about grabbing headlines. It is not about a thoughtful \ndebate of the best immigration and law enforcement policies for our \ncountry; it is about scoring political points. It does so by rejecting \nthe expert opinion of sheriffs and police chiefs and law enforcement \nexperts and organizations and local mayors and leaders in the municipal \nlevel across America who say that, to fight crime effectively, they \nneed to win the trust of all of the communities that they serve.\n  This bill is opposed by major law enforcement organizations, by \nmunicipal government organizations. I saw at the top of the list of \nthose law enforcement organizations the police chief of my hometown, \nwho works with community policing to make our communities safe. Some \nlocalities believe that they can better enforce the law, better keep \nour communities safe, if an undocumented person who is a witness or a \nvictim of crime is involved with them and reporting those crimes and \nhelping enforce the law.\n  If I have to choose between Donald Trump and his extreme attitudes \nembodied by colleagues here in this House today and my local law \nenforcement about how to protect my family, all of our families, I \nchoose law enforcement. Let's reject this bad bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. If they are so committed to supporting local law \nenforcement, eliminating funding for the COPS program is hardly the way \nto do it. We ought to be putting our dollars and our support and our \nimmigration laws in conformity with the law enforcement experts across \nAmerica and protect our families.\n  Reject this bad bill, and then do something substantive to back our \nlaw enforcement officials.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I appreciate the argument, and this is why we have this time. But I \ndo want to just remind again, from my previous statement, bringing up a \nbill last Congress reminds me of back when I used to coach kids in \nfootball. There was always that struggle you wanted to put as many kids \nin, you wanted everybody to play, and you still wanted to win the game. \nThere was that balance that you always had.\n  It reminds me of one time it happened to be one of my own kids. Now, \nthat is pretty hard when you are coaching one of your own kids and you \nget to the end of the game and you didn't put him in like you thought \nyou were going to because the time had run out on the game. And you go \nto him--fortunately, he was my son. I was driving home, and I said, ``I \nam sorry.'' I called his name and I said, ``I am sorry I didn't get you \ninto the game. The time had run out, but I had every intention of \ngetting you into the game.'' That is about like saying last Congress \nwhen the Senate was Democrat but the House was Republican and we have \ndifferent ideas and different views that we\n\n[[Page H5414]]\n\nare bringing forward. I simply go back to the time when that did not \nexist, when time was still on the clock and they chose not to do \nanything.\n  Also, it is a good distracter from what we are talking about today: \ncities enforcing laws, finding solutions, and doing so. That is simply \nwhat this bill does, that is what this rule provides for, and those are \nthe things that need to be talked about. This is the discussion that \nneeds to be had, and this is the discussion the American people are \nhaving all over, including, by the way, San Francisco, who is \nreevaluating their policy even now.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMaryland (Ms. Edwards).\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my House colleagues to stop and \nthink for a moment and to oppose not only the rule, but the underlying \nbill. It is extreme, it is anti-immigrant, and it is really not about \nsanctuary cities.\n  In fact, this flawed legislation actually second-guesses the \ndecisions that are made by local police chiefs and sheriffs around the \ncountry on how best to police their communities and ensure public \nsafety and ensure the kind of cooperation that they need in order for \nlaw enforcement to work properly.\n  As the founder and former executive director of the National Network \nto End Domestic Violence, representing domestic violence organizations \nand coalitions around the country, I am deeply concerned that this \nlegislation will have a negative effect on the cooperation that is \nnecessary between law enforcement and isolated, very isolated victims \nof domestic and sexual violence. Furthermore, it would strip the \nbipartisan provisions that passed in the Violence Against Women Act \nwhen we just reauthorized it.\n  Specifically, H.R. 3009 negatively amends section 241(i) of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act by doing the following:\n  It undermines the spirit and protections of VAWA, effectively pushing \nimmigrant survivors and their children, many of whom are likely U.S. \ncitizens, deeper and deeper into the shadows of danger.\n  It undermines the policies that local communities have determined are \nappropriate for their localities to ensure that victims of crime come \nforward without fear of retribution.\n  It allows violent crimes to go uninvestigated, and it leaves victims \nwithout redress because of reductions in funding.\n  This bill would have damaging ramifications for families across the \nNation and in my home State of Maryland.\n  I enter into the Record a letter from the National Task Force to End \nSexual and Domestic Violence Against Women, representing coalitions, \norganizations, shelters, services, and programs in every single State \nin this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to just quote from this letter. It says: ``Fear \nof deportation also strengthens the ability of abusers and traffickers \nto silence and trap their victims. Not only are the individual victims \nharmed, but their fear of law enforcement leads many to abstain from \nreporting violent perpetrators or coming forward, and, as a result, \ndangerous criminals are not identified and go unpunished.''\n\n         National Task Force To End Sexual and Domestic Violence \n           Against Women,\n                                                    July 21, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: As the Steering Committee of the \n     National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence \n     (``NTF''), comprising national leadership organizations \n     advocating on behalf of sexual and domestic violence victims \n     and women's rights, we represent hundreds of organizations \n     across the country dedicated to ensuring all survivors of \n     violence receive the protections they deserve. For this \n     reason, we write to express our deep concerns about the \n     impact of the ``Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act'' \n     (H.R. 3009), which amends section 241(i) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act.\n       As government officials, we ask you to approach this issue \n     from the perspective of a leader and be sure of the \n     implications this bill can have on entire communities. All \n     parties have the common goal of making communities safer. \n     This bill will encourage law enforcement to enforce \n     immigration law, and will significantly hinder the ability of \n     certain communities to build trust and cooperation between \n     vulnerable and isolated victims of domestic and sexual \n     violence and law enforcement. Last year marked the twentieth \n     anniversary of the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act \n     (``VAWA''), which has, since it was first enacted, included \n     critical protections for immigrant victims of domestic and \n     sexual violence. This bill undermines the spirit and \n     protections of VAWA and will have the effect of pushing \n     immigrant survivors and their children (many of whom are \n     likely U.S. Citizens) deeper into the shadows and into \n     danger.\n       As recognized in VAWA, bipartisan legislation supporting \n     our nation's response to domestic and sexual violence and \n     stalking, immigrant victims of violent crimes are often \n     fearful of contacting law enforcement due to fear that they \n     will be deported. A recent and comprehensive survey shows \n     that 41 percent of Latinos believe that the primary reason \n     Latinos/as do not come forward is fear of deportation.\n       Policies that minimize the intertwining of local law \n     enforcement with ICE help bring the most vulnerable victims \n     out of the shadows by creating trust between law enforcement \n     and the immigrant community, which in turn helps protect our \n     entire communities. Fear of deportation also strengthens the \n     ability of abusers and traffickers to silence and trap their \n     victims. Not only are the individual victims harmed, but \n     their fear of law enforcement leads many to abstain from \n     reporting violent perpetrators or coming forward, and, as a \n     result, dangerous criminals are not identified and go \n     unpunished. These criminals remain on the streets and \n     continue to be a danger to their communities.\n       This bill undermines policies that local communities have \n     determined are appropriate for their localities, and decrease \n     the ability of law enforcement agencies to respond to violent \n     crimes and assist all (immigrant, citizens, etc.) victims of \n     crime. As recognized in VAWA, law enforcement plays a \n     critical role in our coordinated community response to \n     domestic and sexual violence. Federal law enforcement funding \n     supports critical training, equipment, and agency staffing \n     that assists domestic and sexual violence victims. H.R. 3009 \n     will allow violent crimes to go uninvestigated and leave \n     victims without redress due to reductions in funding.\n       For these reasons, we urge you to affirm the intent and \n     spirit of VAWA and oppose the provisions above. Thank you \n     very much for taking this important step to protect and \n     support immigrant survivors of domestic violence and sexual \n     assault.\n\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Surely, Mr. Speaker, this is not what we need to do. We \nneed to ensure the continued protections of domestic violence victims \nall across this country, no matter who they are and no matter where \nthey are, and to know that law enforcement will be there to protect \nthem and their children.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The best way to address the problems in our immigration system, the \nbest way to address the lack of security for American citizens, the \nbest way to ensure that there are not others like Kathryn Steinle and \nothers that have fallen victim to immigrant felons is to fix our broken \nimmigration system, secure our borders. Only Congress can do that.\n  Now, the President has taken the first steps to help keep Americans \nsafe by suggesting certain policies like DACA and DAPA programs. Now, \nDACA is being implemented; DAPA is, unfortunately, tied up in the \ncourts. What these efforts allow our law enforcement agencies to do is \nto focus their efforts on criminals like Mr. Lopez-Sanchez rather than \nviolators of our civil law. It would be better if this body could put \nthose concepts into statute or, better yet, make sure that we can \ndifferentiate between noncriminals and criminals within the law.\n  An immigration reform bill would reduce the risk of tragedies like \nthis and help keep Americans safe by helping law enforcement identify \npeople who are here illegally, and it would bring people out of the \nshadows. Identifying the portion of our people that are here illegally \nthat qualify for relief and for prosecutorial discretion would help our \nlaw enforcement agencies narrow their focus and targets to individuals \nlike Mr. Lopez-Sanchez.\n  Immigration reform efforts like H.R. 15, which was the comprehensive \nbill from last Congress, would modernize our immigration agencies, \nincrease enforcement and resources tools, technology, and border \nsecurity to prevent tragedies like this from occurring. Doing the \ndifficult work of having a meaningful debate around immigration reform \nis the only way we can ever be able to keep Americans safer and reduce \nthe likelihood of this kind of incident.\n\n[[Page H5415]]\n\n  A vote for this particular bill won't do anything to address these \nsystemic problems. Had this been the law, it would not have prevented \nthis tragedy, nor does it do anything to address the problems plaguing \nour immigration system. Instead, it threatens and bullies local law \nenforcement and says to them, either expose yourself to civil \nliability--which is very real. My agencies in Colorado have been forced \nto pay--they have been forced to pay--$30,000 or $40,000. So pay legal \nfines, or we are going to cut your grants.\n  Look, it is a natural tendency of people to pass the buck, and \nCongress is basically trying to pass the buck to local law enforcement \nfor our failures here in this body.\n  Mr. Lopez-Sanchez should not have been wandering the streets of San \nFrancisco or any other American city. He should not have been allowed \nto illegally enter. In fact, he had been caught at the border four or \nfive times, and he had snuck across other times.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  We need real border security, and we need to finally enforce our law \nand get serious about restoring the rule of law, which this bill would \nonly make an even bigger joke.\n  Rather than restoring the rule of law and encouraging cooperation \nbetween Federal, State, and local authorities in cases that involve \nimmigrant felons, this bill would punish local law enforcement for \nprioritizing public safety and community policing over trying to do the \njob that Congress and the Federal Government are supposed to do.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado has 3\\3/4\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  It is time for this body to fix our broken immigration system to keep \nAmericans safe. How many other victims like Kathryn Steinle need to \nmake the ultimate sacrifice--or the countless other Americans who are \nvictims of other kinds of crime--at the hands of immigrant felons? It \nwill be until this body chooses to fix our broken immigration system \nand restore the rule of law.\n  This particular bill would only further dissipate the rule of law. It \ntells local law enforcement you have to either pay fines that drain \nyour ability to enforce our laws or you lose grants that reduce your \nability to enforce our laws.\n  Either way, if this bill were somehow to become law--even though the \nPresident has indicated he would veto it--it would drain away the very \nlocal law enforcement resources, the purpose of which is to keep \nAmericans safe.\n  Let us move forward to replace our broken immigration system with one \nthat works, not try to pass the buck. Mr. Speaker, the buck can't be \npassed. It is the Federal Government's responsibility to secure our \nborder and to establish immigration laws. It is the Federal \nGovernment's responsibility to deport criminals.\n  No matter how this body may try to say that it should be cities and \ncounties and sheriffs and police chiefs--who are trying to do the dirty \nwork--who are the result of our failure to take action, they need to \nmake the decisions that are in the best interests of keeping their \ncommunities safe.\n  With 10 or 12 or 14 million people in our country illegally--some of \nthem immigrant felons--we are passing along the buck to local law \nenforcement with an impossible task.\n  Rather than make that task more impossible by forcing them to pay \ncivil fines or to lose important law enforcement resources, let's help \nthem have the resources and policies they need to deport felon \nimmigrants before they can commit crimes like the tragedy that occurred \nin San Francisco.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule, to oppose this bill, and to \nreject this bizarre approach that we are seeking here today, which \nwould have done nothing to have prevented this tragedy or any other \nlike it, and would lead to countless more tragedies by taking resources \nout of the hands of those who are on the front lines--on our streets, \nin our neighborhoods--keeping Americans safe.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  This is an interesting argument, as I stated before, because it \nreally defies, in many ways, logic.\n  The best way to help prevent what has just happened is to enforce the \nlaw. It is not to give a substantive, wishy-washy: Well, I won't \nenforce this. I don't want to enforce this. I am making a political \njudgment.\n  In fact, that is really what the law should be there for, is to say: \nThis is the law that has been passed through the political process, but \nthis is the law for everyone.\n  When you have the debates in Congress, that is what the political \nargument is for. I don't disagree with my friend from Colorado, as this \nis the part that we are supposed to debate; but once it leaves here and \nit is printed and it is law and it is signed, it is to be enforced.\n  To really argue that, on this side, we don't want to enforce, and, on \nthis side, we want to enforce, where does it end--when we don't want to \nenforce drug laws? trafficking laws? employment law? Where does it end?\n  I am sure there are political differences in many cities, possibly in \nmy own district of the Ninth District of Georgia, where cities say: I \nam not sure I like this employment law. I am not sure I like having to \ndeal with compliance, with Federal law. We will just ignore it. No. It \nis about enforcement.\n  Lopez-Sanchez was requested by ICE. Whether you are talking about \nlimited resources or whether you are talking about a lot of resources, \nit doesn't matter. They requested him to be held.\n  San Francisco said no. It is San Francisco's choice--their political \nchoice, their life choice. It was a life choice for this young lady. \nHer life is gone.\n  It is not an economic choice--it is a life choice--and their choice \nled to a life's being taken. It is not about whether you like the law \nor not, and it is not about whether you have a view on the law or not--\nit is about whether you will enforce the law or not.\n  I struggle with this as I understand about the interest of immigrant \ncommunities, and I understand about good policing. My father was a \nState trooper.\n  I understand the relationship between communities and of their all \nworking together to provide a safe community; but sanctuary cities are \nsanctuaries for those who abide by the law--those who are here legally, \nthose who want to live a prosperous life and just get up and go to work \nand not have to worry about being shot on the street by somebody who is \nbeing sanctuaried because he is here illegally--not once but multiple \ntimes over.\n  As has already been stated, this is not a judgment call. San \nFrancisco could see this. They could see his record. They could see he \nhad been detained for illegally entering. This is not something that \nwas, frankly, even close. They chose.\n  The question remains: Do we enforce or do we not? The question \nremains: Do we want to be under a rule of law or do we want to have \nsomething else?\n  It has been brought up many times today of a bill in the last \nCongress that was passed by the Senate that would be the panacea for \neverything and probably would help this. That was the implication \ngiven.\n  I have just one question to those who make that assertion: If San \nFrancisco and other sanctuary cities won't enforce the law now because \nof their political views, what gives them any idea they would for a new \nlaw?\n  We have got a fundamental problem here, Mr. Speaker. The fundamental \nproblem is: Is political rule of law going to happen or is the rule of \nlaw going to happen?\n  Pass any bill you want, but if we allow them to ignore it without \nconsequence, then you have no standard, you have no basis for debate, \nyou have no place to move forward.\n  You can pass everything you want to and have the President sign it in \nbeautiful ceremonies; but if we allow political subdivisions in this \ncountry to just continue to pick and choose, then we have got a \nproblem.\n  Now, if there are issues, let's solve them here. Let's have the \ndebates--I\n\n[[Page H5416]]\n\nagree--but this isn't up for debate when it leaves here.\n  So pass whatever you want to pass. Will San Francisco enforce it? I \ndon't know--maybe, maybe not--but when they released and when other \nsanctuary cities release them and say: We are not going to hold. We are \nnot going to do these things, then they have made a choice. \nUnfortunately, in this case, they made a life choice, and that \nbeautiful life is gone.\n  This rule simply says enforce the law. This rule--this bill--says we \nhave law. It is what we have got right now. It is not your aspirational \ngoal. It is the law. Simply enforce it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the resolution.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS.

Pursuant to House Resolution 369 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1599.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson) to preside \nover the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1111\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 1599) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with \nrespect to food produced from, containing, or consisting of a \nbioengineered organism, the labeling of natural foods, and for other \npurposes, with Mr. Simpson in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1599, the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, is \nthe product of diligent and bipartisan work by the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee and the Agriculture Committee.\n  Over the past year and a half that we have been working on this \nlegislation, we have solicited input from Members and from relevant \nagencies like the FDA and the USDA. We have also met with the organic \ncommunity, conventional farmers and ranchers, seed producers, \nscientists, and supply chain specialists.\n  Throughout this process, we have sought to address every legitimate \nconcern and provide whatever clarification might be necessary.\n  The fact is that the scientific consensus on the safety of \ngenetically engineered products is utterly overwhelming. Precisely zero \npieces of credible evidence have been presented that foods produced \nwith biotechnology pose any risk to our health and safety.\n  Given this fact, it is not the place of government--government at any \nlevel--to arbitrarily step in and mandate that one plant product should \nbe labeled based solely on how it was bred while another identical \nproduct is free of a government warning label because that producer \nchose a different breeding technology. That is unscientific, and that \nis bad public policy.\n  The mandatory labeling of genetically engineered products has no \nbasis in legitimate health or safety concerns, but is a naked attempt \nto impose the preferences of a small segment of the populace on the \nrest of us and make the constituents whom I serve in Kansas pay more \nfor their food.\n  A recent study shows that the proposed State GE labeling laws could \nraise the cost of the average family's food bill by, roughly, $500 per \nyear. Many, many families in Kansas simply cannot afford that.\n  Antibiotechnology interest groups are attempting to use State laws to \nforce mandatory GE labeling on safe products and interfere with \ninterstate commerce.\n  To ensure that families in Kansas and all across the country have \naccess to nutritious and affordable food, H.R. 1599 accomplishes three \nprimary objectives.\n  First, we ensure that every new GE plant destined to enter the food \nsupply goes in for an FDA safety review.\n  Second, we prevent the creation of what would be the unworkable \npatchwork of State-by-State--or even county-by-county or city-by-city--\nmandatory GE labeling laws.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  Finally, in order to provide clarity to those who prefer not to eat \nGE products, our bill authorizes a voluntary, user-fee-based non-GE \nlabeling program at the USDA to provide even greater transparency and \nmore options so that consumers, by ensuring a common definition for \nnon-GMO for all foods, whether they are sold at the retail level or \nserved in restaurants.\n  Members of Congress need to realize that allowing activists to create \na patchwork State-by-State set of rules will have a real effect on our \nfamilies and our districts. Those who support mandatory GE products \nmust admit they are willing to increase the cost of food for families \nin Wichita and Dallas and Grand Rapids and in Vermont and in Boston and \nall across our Nation based on unscientific demands of a handful of \nantibiotechnology activists.\n  Congress' goal must be to ensure that people in those places have \naccess to safe, nutritious, and affordable food to feed their families. \nA patchwork of laws will not accomplish that.\n  The reality is that biotechnologies, time and time again, have proven \nsafe. It is simply not debatable. U.S. policies should reflect that. We \nshould not raise prices on consumers based on the wishes of a handful \nof activists. I ask for everyone to support H.R. 1599.\n  Mr Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 2015.\n     Hon. Michael K. Conaway,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Conaway: I write in regard to H.R. 1599, Safe \n     and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015, which was ordered \n     reported by the Committee on Agriculture on July 14, 2015. As \n     you are aware, the bill also was referred to the Committee on \n     Energy and Commerce. I wanted to notify you that the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce will forgo action on H.R. \n     1599 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor \n     for consideration.\n       This is done with the understanding that the Committee on \n     Energy and Commerce's jurisdictional interests over this and \n     similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. In \n     addition, the Committee reserves the right to seek conferees \n     on H.R. 1599 and requests your support when such a request is \n     made.\n       I would appreciate your response confirming this \n     understanding with respect to H.R. 1599 and ask that a copy \n     of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the \n     Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the \n     House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fred Upton,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                     Committee on Agriculture,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2015.\n     Hon. Fred Upton,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Upton: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     H.R. 1599, ``Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015.'' I \n     appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before \n     the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand \n     that the Committee on Energy and Commerce will forego action \n     on the bill.\n       The Committee on Agriculture concurs in the mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing consideration of the bill at \n     this time, the Committee on Energy and Commerce does not \n     waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in \n     this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, \n     should a\n\n[[Page H5417]]\n\n     conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your \n     request to have the Committee on the Energy and Commerce \n     represented on the conference committee.\n       I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional \n     Record during Floor consideration. I appreciate your \n     cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to \n     continuing to work the Committee on Energy and Commerce as \n     this bill moves through the legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               K. Michael Conaway,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. WELCH. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to address this issue that Mr. Pompeo and this \nbill present to this House. This question of GMO labeling and \nbiotechnology is a good thing. Biotechnology has done a lot of good \nthings for this country and for consumers. This is not a question about \nwhether the science says that GMO foods cause medical issues. That is \nnot the issue.\n  The question is whether consumers, when they purchase food, have a \nright to know what is in it. What Mr. Pompeo and this legislation are \nsuggesting is that, regardless of what consumers want, they won't be \ntold.\n  This bill does two fundamental things. One, it says to those States \nthat this is not about a small group of activists. This is States like \nVermont, Maine, and Connecticut with massive bipartisan votes, \nRepublicans and Democrats saying that they wanted the right to have \nthese products labeled, and then the consumer can decide whether he or \nshe wants to purchase that product. It is the market that ultimately \ndecides.\n  This legislation would basically block all State laws that require \nmandatory GMO labeling; so if the State of Idaho, with its Republicans \nand Democrats in the legislature responding to the demands of its \nconstituents, wanted to label it, they wouldn't be able to do it. It \neffectively blocks the FDA from creating a national labeling standard. \nThat is the irony here.\n  If you are talking preemption, you at least have to talk about a \nnational standard that has credibility and provides information that \nconsumers want. In this case, we strip from the States the right to do \nwhat they believe is in the interest of their citizens and don't \nsubstitute any serious label that would apply across the board. This \nclaim that this would create a patchwork of different State laws is not \naddressed when you don't even offer a national standard.\n  Next, it would allow ``natural'' claims on GMO foods and block State \nlaws that prevent such claims. This legislation fundamentally takes \naway from your State and mine the ability to do what they believe is in \nthe interest of their consumers: let them know what they are buying.\n  By the way, what is the problem with letting consumers know what they \nare buying? They are the ones that decide what products they want to \nconsume. The issue here, again, to repeat, is not about the science of \nwhether GMOs cause health problems, but there is a significant issue \nabout GMO products requiring significantly more herbicides in order to \nproduce, and the use of herbicides--glyphosate has gone from 16 million \npounds to about 280 million pounds since the introduction. Those \nfarming practices do have an effect, and a lot of consumers are really \nconcerned about that.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nthe great State of Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, today, I rise to lend my support to H.R. \n1599, the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act. As a mother, farmer, and \nformer nutrition education teacher, I understand the importance of \nproviding valuable information to consumers about where their food \ncomes from and how it is grown.\n  If we are going to face the growing challenges of obesity in this \ncountry and increasing demand for food worldwide, each and every \nAmerican is going to have to engage in an honest dialogue about our \nfood production and distribution systems.\n  It is important that these systems are based on sound science, with a \nstrong set of food labeling guidelines that are consistent across State \nlines, affordable for all Americans, and provide accurate and easy to \nunderstand information on the package for those consumers wanting to \nknow more.\n  H.R. 1599 is a mirror image of the successful USDA organic program \nthat many of my constituents have come to appreciate and trust. This \nvoluntary, commonsense option program is a compromise that balances the \nneeds of both consumers and producers while providing a national path \nto getting consumers information that they may want.\n  I thank the chairman for bringing this timely bill to the floor. I \nask all my colleagues to support H.R. 1599.\n  Mr. WELCH. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nPallone).\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I have stated at our two Energy and \nCommerce Committee hearings on this issue that I am sympathetic to the \nneed for Federal legislation.\n  It does not make sense to have a patchwork of food labeling \nrequirements in different States. I also do not believe that \ngenetically engineered foods are unsafe. If they were unsafe, they \nwould not be allowed on the market.\n  However, I acknowledge that the majority of consumers want foods made \nwith genetically engineered ingredients to be labeled as such. They \nview this as a right-to-know issue. While I don't know of any \nscientific reason to require GE foods to be labeled differently than \nnon-GE foods, I do not believe we will be engendering confidence in \nthese foods if we pass H.R. 1599.\n  I feel that by preempting State right-to-know laws without creating \nany national labeling requirement, this legislation will be seen by \nmost consumers as an attempt by Congress and Washington to prevent them \nfrom knowing which foods have GE ingredients, and therefore, I intend \nto vote against the bill.\n  However, I also understand why others think this bill is important \nand will vote for it. Obviously, it is up to any Member to decide for \nhim or herself how this affects constituents in their own districts and \nvote accordingly.\n  Mr. POMPEO. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nCollins).\n  Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of \nH.R. 1599, the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act.\n  As today's global food chain expands, consumers deserve to know what \nis in their food. H.R. 1599 eliminates confusion and saves taxpayers \nfrom shouldering the costs associated with a patchwork of State \nlabeling laws.\n\n  Additionally, H.R. 1599 ensures that our food supply is safe by \nclearly establishing the FDA as the preeminent authority to make \nscience-based decisions concerning food safety. Currently, a patchwork \nof GMO labeling has emerged across our country, with some States having \ncompletely different food labeling requirements than others.\n  This hodgepodge of regulation increases the cost of food for families \nand negatively impacts food producers. By increasing transparency, \nreducing the cost of regulations, and improving food safety, H.R. 1599 \nwill bring our Nation's food labeling into the 21st century.\n  Mr. WELCH. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. \nPeterson).\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support H.R. 1599.\n  This bill establishes a voluntary nationwide USDA-administered \ncertification program for labeling genetically engineered food \nproducts, and we believe that this is a reasonable, workable solution \nthat balances consumer demand to know more about their food with what \nwe know about the safety of the foods that we produce.\n  I didn't sign on to this bill initially because I thought we needed \nto make some changes, which were eventually made and made the bill \nsupportable, from my perspective.\n  This is a very important point. The bill ensures that every new \ngenetically engineered plant destined to enter the market has to go \nthrough an FDA safety review. This change means that foods from \ngenetically engineered plants will only be able to enter the \nmarketplace after this happens, and that is a change from the current \nsituation.\n  H.R. 1599 prevents the unworkable scenario of a State-by-State, \ncounty-\n\n[[Page H5418]]\n\nby-county, or even city-by-city labeling law. This patchwork of laws \nwould only create confusion for consumers, farmers, and food companies \nand would also drive up consumer grocery bills.\n  I acknowledge that consumers want to know what they are eating, and \nin my opinion, H.R. 1599 provides them with that information. Before we \ncan do anything in this area, we have to define what this means, and if \nyou talk to five different people about what genetically engineered or \ngenetically modified means, you are going to get five different \nanswers.\n  One of the things that will happen with this bill if it becomes law \nis that the USDA will go through a process, talking to all the \nstakeholders, and come up with a definition of what this means, which I \nthink is one of the most important things because, right now, I think \nthere is a real disconnect between the science on this issue and the \nconsumers.\n  What this bill does is allows companies like companies in my district \nto go and work with the Secretary to create a non-GMO label, \nnongenetically engineered label.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. WELCH. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Then consumers can find out. If they want to purchase \nnongenetically engineered products, there are companies out there that \nare going to provide them.\n  I think this doesn't get to where a lot of people want to get, but it \ngets us a long ways down the road. It will be able to define what this \nmeans and put in place a workable solution that I think people should \nsupport.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1599.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nto engage in a colloquy with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway).\n  When considering the substitute reported by the Committee on \nAgriculture, I would like to confirm that the committee was aware that \nmany ingredients derived from genetically engineered crops have been so \nhighly refined that they contain no genetically engineered material and \nthat finished food products produced with such ingredients, likewise, \nwould contain no genetically engineered material.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. POMPEO. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. It certainly is our \nunderstanding that products--and sugar is a good example of those--may \ncome from a GE crop, but the finished product has no genetic material \nin it.\n  Mr. POMPEO. This fact exemplifies why labeling as to whether or not \nfood has been produced through genetic engineering is appropriately \nvoluntary, not mandatory, as it seems unnecessary to require labeling \nabout the use of genetic engineering if the labeled food contains no \ngenetically engineered material.\n  I would just add--and hope that the gentleman from Texas would \nconcur--that this approach is consistent with the exemption from the \nlabeling requirements for major food allergens that Congress has \nestablished for highly refined oils as part of the Food Allergen \nLabeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004.\n  While the eight major food allergens--milk, egg, fish, crustacean \nshellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans--must be listed on \nfood labels where they or ingredients containing protein derived from \nthese allergens are added to food, the definition of ``major food \nallergen'' excludes any highly refined oil derived from a major food \nallergen and ``any ingredient derived from such highly refined oil.''\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. POMPEO. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. The gentleman is \ncorrect. This is a perfect example of why passage of this legislation \nis so important.\n  Mr. POMPEO. I thank the gentleman.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway).\n  (Mr. CONAWAY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1599. Mankind \nhas used biological technologies for more than 10,000 years to improve \ncrops and livestock and to make useful food products, such as bread, \ncheese, and to preserve dairy products.\n  When applied to plant breeding, these technologies have led to \nevolution of nearly every food product we consume. These and other \nadvances have enabled us to proudly boast that we enjoy the safest, \nhighest quality, most abundant, diverse, and affordable food supply and \nfiber mankind has ever known.\n  As our knowledge has increased, so has the speed and precision in \nwhich we are able to harness natural capabilities to improve the plants \nthat we cultivate. These new applications of biotechnology have been \navailable to American and international consumers for some three \ndecades.\n  The safety of technology has been documented and confirmed by the \nworld's leading scientific and public health organizations, including \nthe World Health Organization, the National Academies of Science, the \nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciences, the American \nMedical Association, and the Royal Society of Great Britain.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  The House Agriculture Committee has frequently reviewed these \ntechnologies. We have reviewed the regulatory mechanism that has been \nin place since the Reagan administration and have been regularly \nassured by the absence of any valid concerns regarding the safety or \nquality of products derived from these production technologies.\n  Biotechnology is an essential tool for farmers and our food supply to \nhave in the toolbox. If we plan to feed the estimated 10 billion people \nin the year 2050 in an environmentally sound, sustainable, affordable \nway, they must be used.\n  Unfortunately, threats exist to our ability to fully utilize this \ntechnology in the form of proposed Federal and State laws as well as \nsome new State laws that will be implemented soon if we don't act. \nPassage of any new antibiotech laws and amendments or implementation of \nthose already passed will likely have far-reaching negative \nconsequences, which we will debate today.\n  The legislation before the House today addresses this threat in a \nmanner that pays tribute to the successful voluntary, market-driven \nprograms administered by the Department of Agriculture. These programs \nhave not only enabled farmers to receive premiums in the marketplace \nfor their efforts to distinguish their products, they have appealed to \nthe growing desire of many food-conscious consumers. One such example \nis the highly successful National Organic Program, many aspects of \nwhich we have replicated in this legislation.\n  The structure and coverage of this legislation, like that of the \nNational Organic Program, will assure consumers are given reliable, \naccurate, and consistent information related to the genetic \nengineering, whether it is at the retail level or at a restaurant.\n  In developing this legislation, we worked in a bipartisan fashion \nbetween the Agriculture and the Energy and Commerce Committees, \nreceiving and integrating the ideas and suggestions of Federal \nagencies, organic interests, conventional producers and handlers, and \nmore.\n  Mr. Chairman, mandatory labels are used as a warning or a caution. \nEven our opponents to this legislation have said there is no safety \nissue here that we are talking about to ``scare'' potential consumers. \nWe believe this voluntary program meets that need of letting consumers \nknow, and I urge support of the bill.\n  Mr. WELCH. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. \nGabbard).\n  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Chairman, I am rising today in strong opposition to \nH.R. 1599, which actually stands in direct contradiction to the wishes \nof almost 90 percent of Americans across the country. It is no wonder \nthat this legislation has more commonly become known to people who are \nvery concerned about this issue as the DARK Act, or the Deny Americans \nthe Right to Know Act. And that is really what is at issue here.\n\n[[Page H5419]]\n\n  This legislation makes a mockery of transparency and leaves U.S. \nconsumers in the dark. What are they so afraid of? Why deprive \nAmericans of the ability to make educated choices about whether they \nwant food with genetically modified ingredients? Why make the labeling \nof such food just voluntary? Why not require it as you require basic \nnutrition information on processed foods now? Why not join the 64 other \ncountries, including the EU, Japan, Australia, Brazil, and China, in \nempowering our constituents with information, making mandatory \nlabeling?\n  My State of Hawaii is the number one State for experimental \ngenetically engineered plant field trials, according to the USDA. Many \nof my constituents are very concerned about GE crop field testing \nbecause of the lack of information about these trials and the \npesticides that are being applied to the fields.\n  On the island of Kauai, in my district, residents organized and \npassed an ordinance requiring large agrochemical companies to disclose \nthe pesticides they are spraying and observe buffer zones around \nschools, homes, and hospitals to prevent chemical spray drifts.\n  The DARK Act could overrule the rights of these local communities to \nmake such decisions to protect their health and safety and guide the \ngrowth of their agricultural industries.\n  This legislation could overturn a ban on the cultivation of \ngenetically engineered coffee passed by Hawaii Island constituents, \npotentially damaging the global reputation of Hawaii's famous and \nunique Kona coffee, the only domestic coffee industry in our country. \nIt could negate a ban on the cultivation of genetically engineered \ntaro, endangering a main staple and culturally significant plant for \nindigenous Native Hawaiians.\n  This is why I am calling on my colleagues to adopt the Genetically \nEngineered Food Right-to-Know-Act. I urge my colleagues today to vote \nagainst the DARK Act and support commonsense labeling as we move \nforward.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, it is clear that there is some \nmisinformation here. This legislation has literally nothing to do with \nrules about cultivation. State laws will be able to continue to govern \nthat. That is simply about labeling. I think it is important every one \nknow that.\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs).\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1599, the \nSafe and Accurate Food Labeling Act.\n  When any Federal agency mandates what used to be a voluntary process, \nit can only add to a bureaucratic headache. A mandatory process for FDA \nfood labeling approvals would create increased costs for businesses and \nconsumers, invite potential litigation, and burden our Nation's farmers \nand small businesses.\n  I am pleased to see that this bill streamlines the voluntary FDA \nlabeling process, with the help of the USDA, to make a combined, joint \neffort to label food headed to the market. Having uniform rules for \nfoods with a GMO-free label will benefit consumers and alleviate \nstruggles with interstate commerce in response to a patchwork of State \nand local labeling standards. H.R. 1599 will help give consumers an \nopportunity to make an informed choice at the supermarket, while also \nadvancing food safety and consistency in our food labels.\n  I thank my colleagues in the Agriculture Committee as well as the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee for finding a way to make this change in \na simple and most effective way.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Polis).\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Vermont for \nyielding.\n  I rise in opposition to H.R. 1599. This legislation, which should be \ncalled the Deny Americans the Right to Know Act, or DARK Act, \nrepresents a major threat to consumer information. States have the \nright to determine their own local laws relating to GMO labeling, and \nthe Federal Government shouldn't interfere.\n  I frequently hear Republicans talk about states' rights and talk \nabout the big, bad Federal Government; but when it comes down to it, \nhere they want to take away the rights of States and counties and the \nvoice of people, instead to support huge corporations and companies.\n  Polls prove again and again Americans want to know what is in their \nfood. Nine out of ten Americans support genetically engineered \nlabeling, including majorities of Democrats, Republicans, Independents, \nWhites, Latinos, Blacks. What else can bring everybody together? This \nisn't a ``handful of activists'' we are talking about here. We are \ntalking about 90 percent of the American people.\n  It is the right of States to be able to determine how they label \ntheir food. States are doing it as we speak, just as they do with many \nother things: sell-by requirements; labels on bottled water around \ndeposit requirements; States requiring origin of seafood and catfish, \nwhether it is farm raised or wild caught.\n  It is a vibrant discussion across the States that we should not \npreempt here in Washington at the behest of a couple major world \ncorporations. We are talking about the rights of hundreds of counties \nand States and tribes to talk about how close to schools and hospitals \npesticides can be used that relate to genetically modified organisms. \nDo we really want pesticides used to kill superbugs sprayed across your \n5-year-old child's playground?\n  These are the States that we are talking about, not a handful of \nactivists. It includes States like Texas, where legislation has been \nintroduced.\n  This bill will remove everything that has the right to know for \npeople and for States. We need to stand up to fight for the right to \nallow States and consumers to make these kinds of choices for \nthemselves. That is why I cosponsored my colleague from Maine's \nsubstitute amendment, which will remove the preemption language from \nthe bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the DARK Act and to support consumer \ntransparency.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We have heard on multiple occasions about this 90 percent number in \nsome poll about folks who want to have this labeling. This doesn't even \npass the smell test.\n  When consumers were asked to list the items they would like to see \nlabeled, exactly 7 percent of respondents to a 2013 Rutgers University \nstudy volunteered GMOs. Frankly, the most reliable survey, the ballot \nbox, has been 100 percent consistent. Every time a GMO labeling bill \nhas been presented to voters in any State in the United States of \nAmerica, they have rejected it.\n  There is most certainly not 90 percent of the folks wanting to know \nthat. This bill will not deny those handful that do the right to do \nthat. It is disingenuous to offer up anything to the contrary.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts).\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1599.\n  There are real sensitivities around GMOs and all issues regarding the \nfood we eat and feed our children and grandchildren. It is our job as \npolicymakers, particularly as it relates to the public health, to \nestablish a factually and scientifically sound foundation prior to \ntaking any action that would impact consumers in our economy.\n  The bill before us today, H.R. 1599, does just that by ensuring \nnational uniformity regarding labeling of foods derived from \ngenetically engineered plants by preventing a patchwork of conflicting \nState or local labeling laws which inherently interfere with interstate \nand foreign commerce.\n  Genetic engineering in agriculture has occurred for centuries. \nIngredients from genetically engineered plants have been a part of the \nU.S. food supply for decades. In fact, as much as 90 percent of our \ncorn, sugar beet, and soybean crops are now genetically engineered, and \nmore than 70 percent of processed foods contain ingredients derived \nfrom such crops.\n  The FDA oversees the safety of all food products from plant sources, \nincluding those from genetically engineered crops. These products must \nmeet the same safety requirements as foods from traditionally bred \ncrops.\n  The FDA currently has a consultation process in place in which \ndevelopers of the underlying technologies address any outstanding \nsafety or other regulatory issues with the agency prior to marketing \ntheir products. The FDA has completed approximately\n\n[[Page H5420]]\n\n100 of such consultations. No products have gone to market until FDA \nsafety-related questions have been resolved.\n  FDA officials have repeatedly stated that the agency has no basis for \nconcluding that bioengineered foods are different from other foods in a \nmeaningful way, and the World Health Organization has confirmed that \n``no effects on human health have been shown as a result of consumption \nof such foods.'' In fact, they can grow faster, resist diseases and \ndrought, cost less, and prove more nutritious.\n  Nonetheless, there recently have been a number of State initiatives \ncalling for mandatory labeling of food products that contain GMOs. I am \nconcerned that a patchwork of State labeling schemes would be \nimpractical and unworkable. Such a system would create confusion among \nconsumers and result in higher prices and fewer options.\n  Mr. Chairman, I commend Representatives Pompeo and Butterfield for \ntheir leadership on this legislation. I thank my colleagues on the \nAgriculture Committee for working through any issues and reaching \nconsensus between the sponsors, committees of jurisdiction, \nimplementing agencies, and impacted stakeholders. I commend the \nlegislation to the House and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Conyers).\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Welch and Mr. McGovern for \ntheir work on this issue.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important lessons I have \nlearned in the years I have been in this great body is that we have got \nto be aware of unintended consequences.\n  While some claim genetically modified organisms are safe beyond a \nreasonable doubt, the simple fact is that there is a great deal that we \ndo not know about a technology that alters the basic building blocks of \nnature.\n  We have more to learn about how the widespread use of GMOs could hurt \nthe resilience of our food system by reducing the diversity of plant \nspecies, and there is much research to undertake on how the chemicals \nthat are used concurrently with GMOs threaten human health.\n  Just this year, the World Health Organization found the herbicide \nglyphosate to be a probable cause of cancer. GMOs are designed \nspecially to be used with great quantities of this chemical, and the \nherbicide is being used in increasing quantities around the world.\n  This is why Pope Francis, himself, recently spoke of the need to \nexercise greater caution with regard to genetical manipulation by \nbiotechnology. This is why more than 90 percent of Americans want GMO \nlabeling, according to recent polling.\n  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1599 would make it impossible for people to even \nbe mindful of unintended consequences. It makes it impossible for \npeople to know what they are purchasing and eating. It prevents States \nfrom taking prudent actions to protect consumers and farmworkers.\n  Our Nation's leading legal organizations, environmental groups, \nconsumer groups, and food safety groups all oppose H.R. 1599 because it \nis an attack on transparency and a dangerous attack on our great \ntradition of federalism.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield), an \noriginal cosponsor, who is responsible for getting this bill to the \nstate it is in today.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Pompeo for yielding time \nand thank him for his leadership on this issue. I thank Mr. Welch for \nhis very thoughtful debate.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1599 and urge my colleagues \nto vote ``yes'' on final passage. This bipartisan bill, cosponsored by \n106 of our colleagues, creates a science-based nationwide labeling \nstandard for plant-based foods.\n  It establishes a national GMO-free certification program administered \nby USDA that will provide a government-issued label to qualifying \nproducts which will provide a market advantage.\n  It requires the FDA to conduct premarket safety reviews of all new GM \nplant varieties before they can be used to produce food, and it \nrequires the FDA to define the term ``natural'' through a rulemaking \nprocess allowing for public input and discussion.\n  Despite the downright false claims made by the opponents of what it \nwill or won't do, H.R. 1599 is a measured approach. It gives consumers \ncertainty, while taking into account the delicate balance and sheer \nsize and complexity of the food supply chain that employs tens of \nmillions of Americans and is responsible for feeding the country.\n  My opinion is shared by the bill's 106 sponsors and by 475 \nagriculture, science, hunger, and nutrition organizations from all 50 \nStates.\n  The alternative to H.R. 1599, already beginning to play out in some \nStates across the country, is a complex and unworkable patchwork of \ndiffering State laws that create an uneven playing field that only can \ncause confusion among consumers and do little to provide transparency.\n  Depending on what State regulations require, farmers and \nmanufacturers would be forced to set up separate supply chains in order \nto comply with as many as 50 different State laws. Wholesale changes to \ngrowing, packaging, and shipping foods would have to be made, beginning \nat the farm and all the way to the supermarket shelf, in order to \ncomply.\n  The new infrastructure requirements are as daunting as they are \ncostly. You can bet that all of these costs will be passed on to our \nconstituents, with a recent study showing the average cost topping $500 \na year. For many of my constituents and others across the country, that \nwill not work.\n  Despite going in with knowledge of the consequences that would result \nfrom upending a highly integrated and interconnected system, several \nStates have already moved forward with proposals that would require \nfoods containing these ingredients to be labeled. This is in response \nto an unsubstantiated claim that foods containing GM ingredients are in \nsome way dangerous; they are not.\n  Foods containing GM ingredients are safe. Don't take my word for it. \nThe science regarding the safety of bioengineered foods is not murky--\nthe opposite, in fact. There have been over 2,000 studies worldwide \nthat shows foods grown from these plants are safe.\n  The FDA, USDA, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, the \nAmerican Medical Association, National Academy of Sciences, the \nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, the World Health \nOrganization, and nearly every major scientific organization agrees \nthat foods produced with bioengineered products are as safe as their \nnon-GMO counterparts.\n  Even opponents of GM foods admit they ``have failed to produce any \nuntoward health effects,'' but the demonization of GM foods continue, \ndespite objective science proving the contrary. Those opposed to these \nfoods simply reject science. That is tremendously disappointing. Along \nwith the bill's bipartisan cosponsors--again, 106--I stand with the \nscience.\n  That is why I have worked with my friend, Mr. Pompeo, and the bill's \ncosponsors, in advocating for a Federal framework, a Federal framework \nthat puts the FDA and USDA--our Nation's foremost food safety \nauthorities--in the driver's seat.\n  H.R. 1599 is a balanced approach that reduces confusion by providing \nconsumers with labeling uniformity across State lines. It also \naddresses the concerns of those opposed to GM foods by establishing a \nprogram at USDA that will provide a Federal certification for GMO-free \nfoods, while not neglecting the fact that our Nation's farmers and \nmanufacturers grow and produce foods that are sold far and wide.\n  Without a Federal standard, those farmers and manufacturers will be \nforced to comply with uneven, costly, potentially misleading, onerous \nState-by-State mandates.\n  Compliance will require a new, costly supply chain infrastructure \nthat will disrupt our food supply. It will cause confusion, Mr. \nChairman, and uncertainty among consumers and, ultimately, will result \nin the consumer shouldering the increased costs associated with \nproduction.\n  In that regard, I thank Chairman Conaway for his commitment to work \nwith livestock and meat producers, many of whom operate farms and \nprocessing facilities in North Carolina, to\n\n[[Page H5421]]\n\naddress concerns about the definition of those products in the bill.\n  I share Mr. Conaway's commitment to getting the language right on \nthose products and ensuring fair and accurate labeling, and I thank him \nfor working so diligently with Mr. Peterson on these amendments.\n  In conclusion, H.R. 1599 is reasonable and, Mr. Chairman, it is \nworkable.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern).\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I have an idea. It is a radical idea. It \nis something that is unprecedented for this Congress, something that \nwould genuinely surprise the American people. That idea is simple; \nlet's give the American people what they want.\n  Poll after poll shows that an overwhelming majority of the American \npeople favor mandatory GMO labeling. People want to know what is in \ntheir food that they eat, and they want to know how it is grown. We \nshould give them what they want; yet the bill before us goes in the \nopposite direction. It keeps the American people in the dark about \nwhether their food contains GMOs. It is no wonder why Congress is so \nunpopular.\n  To the supporters of this ``keep Americans in the dark'' bill, I \nwould ask one simple question: What are you afraid of?\n  This debate is not about whether GMOs are good or bad. I consume \nGMOs; my kids consume GMOs. This is about consumers' rights to know \nwhat is in the food that they eat, plain and simple.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I am passionate about ending hunger, \nboth here in this country and around the world. If I thought for one \nsecond that GMO labeling would cause food prices to rise, I wouldn't be \ncalling for GMO labeling.\n  This is a scare tactic being used by opponents of GMOs labeling. The \nfact is companies change their labels all the time, for all kinds of \nreasons. Transportation and commodity prices are drivers of food \nprices, not labeling.\n  If you are worried about 50 States requiring 50 different labels, \nthen support mandatory GMO labeling. Do not override States that have \nalready embraced GMO labeling or consumers who want them. Sixty-four \ncountries already have GMO labeling. Why can't we?\n\n  American food companies already have to label their foods as \ncontaining GMOs in those countries. Why can't American consumers have \naccess to the same information? Keeping consumers in the dark about \nwhat is in their food is the wrong approach.\n  It is a ``Washington knows best'' approach from politicians inside \nthe beltway who think they know better than the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1599.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the amount of time \nremaining on each side?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Kansas has 10 minutes remaining. The \ngentleman from Vermont has 15\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. LaMalfa).\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n1599, the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act.\n  I also have great appreciation for the effort by Mr. Pompeo for a \nthoughtful and bipartisan bill that will be successful.\n  Some of the opponents of this bill, based off clear speculation and \nfear-mongering, are again trying to deny America's first industry--\nfarming--the necessary technology it needs to grow more food to meet \nconsumer demand in this generation and the next.\n  In what other industry do we discourage innovation? Why is it that \nfarming technology meets such scorn perpetuated by activist groups that \nstand to gain financially by tearing down modern agricultural \npractices?\n  Across numerous States, including my home State of California, voters \nresoundingly rejected State-mandated GMO labeling. The facts are clear. \nBiotechs have facilitated the growth of more nutritious crops, all the \nwhile reducing pesticide spraying by an estimated 975 million pounds.\n  Biotech crops have also increased crops produced, saved over 300 \nmillion acres of land, and helped alleviate poverty for 16.5 million \nsmall farmers and farm families, while reducing agriculture's--wait for \nit--greenhouse gases.\n  While some of the colleagues across the aisle have advocated \nconsumers have a right to know--and I agree--but mandated labeling will \nonly cause more consumer confusion, while drastically increasing the \ncost of foods for families at the store shelf across the entire Nation. \nThis bill allows consumers to have a choice by establishing a voluntary \nnon-GMO labeling program, much like the successful national organic \nprogram.\n  It is about common sense and delivering consumers what they want, \nchoice and confidence while buying their foods without unnecessary \nconfusion and high costs. A uniform, 50-State standard helps achieve \nthat goal.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Capps).\n  Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1599. This \nmisguided legislation would limit consumers' access to information \nabout the food they eat by preempting State laws and codifying the \ncurrent failed system.\n  I want to be clear. This is not a debate about whether or not \ngenetically-engineered foods are safe. It is a debate about whether or \nnot consumers have a right to know what is in their food is the point I \nhope we can all agree upon.\n  Unfortunately, consumers currently do not have access to the \ninformation they are looking for when it comes to genetically \nengineered foods. Current labeling standards are so ineffective that \nconsumers are often confused by the information that they do find.\n  Consumers should be able to trust that the labeling on food is both \naccurate and truthful. Consumers should not be confused about something \nas basic and fundamental as the food they eat, but rather than fix this \nproblem, H.R. 1599 simply perpetuates the status quo of confusion.\n  The food industry claims the current voluntary system is adequate and \nconsumers do have information they need; yet despite the fact that \nthere are great numbers of genetically engineered foods on the market, \nvery few of them have been labeled as such.\n  Our constituents want to know how their food is made, and they are \ncalling on us to help make this information more accessible, but \ninstead of responding to this call, this flawed legislation ignores the \nproblem and makes it even harder to require labeling in the future. It \nremoves FDA's authority to craft a national labeling solution yet also \nprevents States from acting on their own.\n  Simply put, this bill prioritizes profits over consumer choice and \nkeeps consumers in the dark. That is why I strongly oppose this bill, \nand I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``no.''\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington State (Mr. Newhouse).\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Kansas.\n  As a third-generation farmer and a former director of my State's \nDepartment of Agriculture, I cannot stress enough the importance of \nthis legislation for our Nation and our world's food supply.\n  Yesterday, I spoke on the merits of preventing a patchwork of \nconflicting State and local GMO labeling laws which would require \nproducers to sell under potentially hundreds of different labels, and I \nstill believe that is a very important element to this debate.\n  However, there is another aspect I would like to address on why I \nbelieve this mandatory labeling law, which some of my colleagues have \ncalled for, is a very poor idea.\n  Mr. Chairman, I question the motives behind some of these arguments. \nThey say they ``want consumers to have information'' but that can't \nactually be their concern because this legislation gives consumers \ninformation. It is disingenuous to claim it doesn't.\n  If you want to go to a store and buy a ``non-GMO'' product, much like \n``organic'' or ``cage-free,'' you can do that under this legislation. \nIt will provide consumers all the information they need to purchase \nfood they think is right for their families.\n  So what is their motive?\n  Is it they want to try to scare consumers, to demonize this \ntechnology?\n\n[[Page H5422]]\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order.\n  Mr. WELCH. The point of order is the speaker is questioning motives \nof those on the other side of this argument.\n  The CHAIR. Is the gentleman asking that the gentleman's words be \ntaken down?\n  Mr. WELCH. No, but I would suggest that the----\n  The CHAIR. The Chair would generally advise Members to avoid engaging \nin personalities.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, antiscience, fear-mongering strategies \ncannot be left unanswered. I believe there are a few things people \nshould know about biotechnology.\n  First, I appreciate anyone's safety concerns. That is why it is \nimportant to note that the USDA and the FDA rigorously test every \nbiotech crop for human safety for years before anything can be brought \nto the market.\n  To be clear, no peer-reviewed study--and there have been hundreds--\nhas ever found GMO foods have caused health concerns, ever.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  Individuals have concerns about environmental impacts. I appreciate \nthat, too. But what many people don't know is that, by turning on just \none gene in corn, we now have a corn that is significantly more pest-\nresistant, which means huge reductions in the use of pesticides. We can \ndo this with other crops as well. To be probiotech is to be \nproenvironment.\n  There is a type of rice that is vitamin A-enriched and has the \nability to prevent hundreds of thousands of cases of blindness and \ndeath from vitamin A deficiency around the world.\n  There is a really nasty type of wheat rot called UG-99 spreading from \nAfrica and the Middle East that has the ability to kill 90 percent of \nthe world's wheat supply.\n  To be clear, this would cause a global famine. Scientists are looking \nat a way to create rot-resistant wheat through biotechnology and gene \nsequencing, which would save millions and millions of lives.\n  Mr. Chair, this technology is good proenvironment, lifesaving \ntechnology. And while I agree we need to have a system to give \nconsumers the freedom to use it or not, which this bill does, we cannot \nallow antiscience opponents of biotechnology to use scare tactics that \nwould cost millions of lives in the end.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon \n(Mr. Schrader).\n  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chair, as a veterinarian and an organic farmer, \nhaving spent 6 years in the House Ag Committee, including 2 as ranking \nmember of the Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research Subcommittee, I \nhave studied GMOs very closely, and it is something I take very \nseriously. In fact, back in the eighties, I helped write our State \norganic standards in Oregon.\n  For thousands of years, humans have grown or bred plants and animals \nto choose the most desirable traits for breeding the next generations \nin an effort to help them to be able to resist pests, disease, and \nincrease yields.\n  Through biotechnology, we have been able to increase productivity and \nefficiency while reducing the number of inputs, like water and \npesticides, resulting in higher crop yields. Higher crop yields per \nacre allow for better land management and the conservation of marginal \nlands.\n  GMOs, in combination with good agricultural practices, also improve \nsoil quality and reduce pollution by allowing farmers to till, work the \nground, less often or not at all, reducing soil erosion and reducing \nthe carbon footprint of agriculture.\n  If you are worried about climate change and want good science, you \nshould be for this bill. GM crops flourish in challenging environments \nwithout the aid of expensive pesticides or equipment that play an \nimportant role in alleviating hunger and food stress in the developing \nworld.\n  This is precisely why I am very concerned about the demonization of \nbiotechnology and the rejection by many of the supporting science \nbehind it.\n  Food labeling should be about health and safety. The reason we have \nUSDA and FDA is to provide uniform protection to consumers across this \ncountry, to avoid a patchwork of politically motivated, nonscientific, \nmythological regulations by activists, not scientists. And right to \nknow is protected in this bill.\n  We have heard from many on polls. I would like to cite one. The Pew \nResearch Center conducted a poll recently and found that nearly 90 \npercent--yes, 90 percent--of the scientific community found genetically \nengineered food is safe and poses no health threat to the environment \nor humans.\n  H.R. 1599 provides a uniform standard for non-GMO products through a \nUSDA-administered program and ensures national uniformity for non-GE \nclaims, providing consistency in the marketplace while ensuring \nconsumer confidence in the integrity of the label.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from \nKansas (Mr. Pompeo). I know this hasn't been an easy path to get to \nwhere we are today, to allow for consumers in all 50 States to be able \nto know what is in their food.\n  I congratulate my colleague from Kansas (Mr. Pompeo) on the hard work \nhe and his staff and those on the House Energy and Commerce Committee \nand House Ag Committee have put forth to make this bill a reality \ntoday.\n  I am proud, as a subcommittee chairman on the House Ag Committee for \nBiotechnology, Horticulture, and Research, to put my name on an \namendment to this bill.\n  I am proud to stand here today to support this bill as a member of \nthat committee and, also, as a dad who is responsible for shopping for \nmany of the products that we are going to see this label put on in the \ngrocery stores when I go home every weekend.\n  Biotechnology is crucial to our ability to feed the world. It is a \ncritical technology, so much so in my district in central Illinois that \nearlier this month I went on a biotech tour in my district.\n  I visited plants and research facilities from Litchfield, Illinois, \nto Clinton, Illinois. I met with workers and scientists who are \ncommitted to developing better seed products that will help us feed a \ngrowing world.\n  Mr. Chairman, it will help us feed a growing world. So many people \nthat don't live in this great country, where we take for granted our \nability to have access to the safest food supply on this globe, don't \nhave access to food.\n  Biotechnology allows us to grow that food in countries where people \nneed food. They need to eat. They don't know where their next meal is \ncoming from. Without biotechnology, we are not going to be able to feed \nthe billions that are going to be required in the coming years.\n  I want to tell you about Pioneer technology in Litchfield, Illinois, \nwho is developing a soybean seed that won't have transfats. I thought \nthat was good, Mr. Chairman. But this is the type of technology that we \nare talking about here.\n  Science is on our side. Science shows that GMOs and biotechnology are \nsafe. As a matter of fact, just earlier today I was at a panel \ndiscussion with Alexis Taylor, the Deputy Under Secretary for Farm and \nForeign Agricultural Services right here at our USDA.\n  She even made a comment that GMOs are good for climate change. That \nshould make many of my colleagues in this Chamber happy. But, \nunfortunately, I don't think that will get them to ``yes'' on this \nvote.\n  We are hearing a lot about motives, Mr. Chairman. Our motives are to \nmake sure that every single American in all 50 States has access, has \nthe transparency, knows what is in their food.\n  This is exactly what H.R. 1599 is going to do for every single one of \nthem. Every mom and dad in this country is going to know what is in \ntheir food.\n  That is exactly why we are doing this. That is exactly why I am here \nto support this bill. That is exactly why I am proud of my colleague \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Pompeo) for doing exactly what we are going to do \ntoday.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chair, I will now enter into the Record two articles, \n``Mandatory GMO Labeling'' and ``NFU Union Reiterates Support for \nMandatory GMO Labeling.''\n\n[[Page H5423]]\n\n               [From the Huffington Post, July 23, 2015]\n\n            Mandatory GMO Labeling--It's Your Right To Know\n\n                          (By Gary Hirshberg)\n\n       The crossfire on whether or not to require mandatory \n     labeling of GMOs has become so heated and partisan that it's \n     hard to discern the facts from rhetoric. The latest volley \n     was last week's Slate essay that challenged labeling \n     proponents' lack of substantive proof that GMOs are unsafe or \n     unhealthy. Author William Saletan raises many valid points, \n     but equally fails to address the hyperbole and enormous gaps \n     between the promise and actual performance of agricultural \n     biotechnology. But beyond this imbalance, he entirely misses \n     the fact that there is a long history of government-enacted \n     labeling disclosures that have nothing to do with safety \n     concerns. There are no unique risks associated with orange \n     juice ``from concentrate'' compared to fresh juice, or from \n     ``wild caught'' vs. farmed fish, but both require labeling so \n     that consumers can choose. Most content on food labels is \n     government mandated, marketing oriented, or intended to \n     inform consumers about information that people just want to \n     know.\n       And that is the fact that trumps all the others. Despite \n     years of heated and often exaggerated rhetoric on both sides \n     of the GMO labeling debate, poll after poll reveals that the \n     public's skepticism has remained unchanged and that people \n     just want to know. The latest Mellman polls show the same \n     results as polls taken three years ago--nine in every 10 of \n     Americans want labels on foods containing GMOs so they can \n     make up their own minds. Here are the three reasons why this \n     choice makes sense:\n\n\n                     Inadequate Scientific Research\n\n       There have been essentially no studies by the government or \n     independent researchers designed to assess the long-term \n     public health impacts of growing and consuming GMO crops. FDA \n     approvals are essentially based on studies conducted by \n     industry. GMO technology developers design and conduct all of \n     the studies carried out on their own inventions, interpret \n     the results (almost always finding ``no new or novel risk''), \n     and report their conclusion to the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) as part of a ``voluntary consultation.'' \n     The FDA then performs a cursory appraisal of the submitted \n     data, and rarely asks for additional information. It does not \n     verify the data's reliability, nor attempt to independently \n     confirm the conclusions drawn from it by the companies. This \n     is why the FDA is always careful to say, in closing out a \n     ``voluntary consultation'' that ``you [the company] have \n     concluded . . .''\n       The lack of credible, independent research on GMO safety, \n     performance, and economics is the root cause of lingering \n     controversies over GMO crops like papaya and golden rice, as \n     well as confusion over whether Integrated Pest Management, \n     organic systems, or GMOs are the best way to deal with pests.\n       In order for us to be able to trust the science, both the \n     public and private sectors need to invest more heavily in the \n     work and careers of independent scientists willing to develop \n     and apply improved tools to monitor the impacts of GMO \n     technology and alternatives. Until then, skepticism will not \n     diminish, in spite of the propaganda.\n\n\n   Drastically increased herbicide use despite claims to the contrary\n\n       While proponents promised that GMO crops would reduce \n     pesticide use, they have, in fact, locked farmers into \n     unilateral, chemical and toxin-based pest management systems \n     that are bad for farmers, the environment, and consumers. \n     However, the use of herbicides, a category of pesticides that \n     kill weeds, has explosively increased, according to USDA \n     survey data. Where GMO soybeans and cotton are grown in 2015, \n     overall per acre herbicide plus insecticide use will be close \n     to double the level in 1996 at the dawn of the GMO era.\n       Since the mid-1990s, when biotech companies introduced \n     genetically engineered crops that are not adversely impacted \n     by the herbicide glyphosate, its use has increased 16-fold to \n     the point where the USGS has found glyphosate in 60-100 \n     percent of Iowa rainwater. Over-use of this formerly \n     effective weed control has led to the rapid spread of over a \n     dozen serious glyphosate-resistant weeds, so now farmers must \n     now spray three, four, or five herbicides. This includes \n     older products with greater potential to cause damage. \n     Farmers also now apply herbicides throughout the growing \n     season instead of a single application at the beginning with \n     greater potential to damage the soil, harm wildlife, and \n     increase collateral damage, particularly among those living \n     in farming areas and drinking water with multiple herbicide \n     residues in it.\n       Thanks in large part to to GMO crop technology, glyphosate \n     is now by far the most heavily used pesticide in history, \n     both in the U.S. and worldwide. Glyphosate is now showing-up \n     in the drinking water, air and breast milk of mothers in \n     areas where these herbicides are in concentrated use. Most \n     people on the planet are exposed to glyphosate on a near-\n     daily basis. And this past spring, the world's most respected \n     cancer research group--the World Health Organization's \n     International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified \n     glyphosate as ``probably carcinogenic.''\n       So to summarize, regardless of whether GMOs are ultimately \n     found to be safe to eat, the WHO IARC findings raise serious \n     questions about whether they are safe to grow. As resistance \n     continues to escalate due to over-use, farmers will have no \n     choice but to continue increasing their use of these toxic \n     herbicides. This is surely material to us all.\n\n\n                     It's Simply Our Right to Know\n\n       Responsible advocates are not demanding mandatory GMO \n     labeling because they are unsafe; we are demanding labeling \n     because people want, and have a right to know how our foods \n     are grown. Just Label It and other responsible labeling \n     proponents have never argued that science has proven GMOs to \n     be unsafe, although we have and will continue to make the \n     case for more in-depth, independent science using state-of-\n     the-art methods to be as sure as possible that they are safe. \n     But while scientific questions persist over the safety of \n     today's GMO crops, the now sharply upward trajectory in the \n     amount of herbicide needed to bring most GMO crops to harvest \n     on every continent on which GMO, herbicide-tolerant crops \n     have been planted, is deeply worrisome.\n       People have dozens of valid reasons for wanting to know \n     whether their food is from genetically engineered crops. Some \n     are grounded in religious or ethical views. Others reflect \n     concern over the long-term consequences of corporate control \n     over both seeds and the food supply. Yet others legitimately \n     believe that there has been inadequate independent testing of \n     GMOs for health and safety.\n       Whatever the reason, it is clear that facts and rhetoric \n     will continue to be debated for years to come. In the \n     interim, mandatory labeling of GMO foods will give consumers \n     another option to steer clear of uncertainty and support \n     farming systems and technology more closely aligned with \n     personal values and concerns. This Thursday, Congress will \n     vote on H.R. 1599 the so-called Safe and Accurate Food \n     Labeling Act (colloquially called the ``DARK Act'' for \n     Denying Americans the Right to Know), which deceptively \n     purports to support federal labeling disclosures. But in \n     fact, this bill would effectively block any hopes of American \n     joining the other 64 nations around the world who have \n     instituted mandatory GMO labeling. This bill needs to be \n     stopped so that all interested parties--food companies, \n     farmers, regulators and consumers can sit down at a table and \n     forge a mutually acceptable and responsible mandatory \n     labeling protocol free of hyperbole and judgment that simply \n     allows consumers to vote in the marketplace for the kind of \n     food system we want.\n       Please contact your congressperson and tell them to stop \n     the DARK Act and vote against H.R. 1599.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the National Farmers Union, July 21, 2015]\n\nNFU Reiterates Support for Mandatory GMO Labeling, Opposes Pompeo Bill \n                           But Notes Progress\n\n       Washington.--In light of the U.S. House of Representatives' \n     consideration of the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act \n     (H.R. 1599), National Farmers Union (NFU) President Roger \n     Johnson again highlighted NFU policy on Genetically Modified \n     Organism (GMO) labeling. The policy supports conspicuous, \n     mandatory, uniform and federal labeling for food products \n     throughout the processing chain to include all ingredients, \n     additives and processes, including genetically altered or \n     engineered food products.\n       ``NFU appreciates efforts by Representatives Pompeo, R-\n     Kansas, and Davis, R-Illinois, to reduce consumer confusion \n     and standardize a GMO label,'' said Johnson. ``The bill \n     passed out of committee makes significant improvements over \n     previous versions of this bill. Absent a mandatory labeling \n     framework, however, NFU cannot support this bill.''\n       Johnson noted that the bill has changed several times from \n     the one introduced during the last Congress. Improvements \n     include additional authority for the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture (USDA), a labeling framework that if utilized \n     could reduce consumer confusion, greater emphasis on the Food \n     and Drug Administration's role in safety reviews, and a GMO \n     label that works in conjunction with USDA's organic seal \n     instead of counter to it.\n       ``Consumers increasingly want to know more information \n     about their food, and producers want to share that \n     information with them,'' said Johnson. ``It is time to find \n     common ground that includes some form of mandatory disclosure \n     for the benefit of all aspects of the value chain, but this \n     bill is not that common ground.''\n\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chair, at this time I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I was pleased to hear the gentleman who \npreceded me in the well acknowledge climate change and say that GMOs \nare the solution.\n  I do think climate change is a problem. I don't think GMOs are the \nsolution.\n  Let's go to some of the arguments we have just heard: This is what we \nhave been doing for millennia, hybridization, you know, where you graft \nthe plant onto another plant.\n  I am not quite sure when the last time was when a flounder mated with \na tomato plant, but we now have tomatoes that have injected into them\n\n[[Page H5424]]\n\nflounder genes in order to enhance production, or the last time an eel \nmated with a salmon. They are putting eel genes into genetically \nmodified salmon--Frankenfish--so they will grow twice as fast as other \nfish, twice as fast.\n  Now, they say: Don't worry. They won't get out. And, besides that, \nmost of them are sterile. Yes. Right. Okay. So what happens when they \ndo get out and they begin to cross-breed with real salmon as opposed to \neel salmon or whatever these things are?\n  This bill would prohibit any labeling. You catch a real salmon, it is \na salmon. You present someone with a GMO eel salmon, it is a salmon. \nYou can't distinguish. You don't have to disclose. So that is not \nexactly hybridization, folks.\n  You know this thing about being politically motivated, nonscientific, \nand scare tactics because we want to have it disclosed that GMOs are \ncontained in the product. Well, I didn't hear those arguments when they \nrequired red dye number two or cellulose or xanthan gum. Why not GMOs?\n  Sixty-four countries require the labeling of products that contain \nGMOs, not the United States of America. Bastions of democracy like \nChina, Russia, Saudi Arabia, require it for their consumers. But, no, \nwe are not going to allow that in the United States of America.\n  Proliferation of labels. Yes. That is happening at the State level. \nAnd that is states' rights, which Republicans normally are for, except \nwhen a State does something they don't like, and then they are against \nit.\n  But there is a solution to that, my bill, which would require a \nuniform national label which just simply discloses ``contains GMOs.'' \nIt won't cost any additional money, since they are having to change the \nnutritional labels anyway.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. WELCH. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Now, we heard a lot about pesticides. This is great. \nLet's talk about Monsanto and glyphosate-resistant corn.\n  They are using more pesticides today on cornfields than they did \nhistorically, more, and they had glyphosate-resistant corn.\n  They dumped the glyphosate on the corn: Don't worry. There will never \nbe a glyphosate-resistant weed. Oops. They were wrong. Weeds everywhere \nnow taking over the cornfield.\n  Let's change that up. We are now going to have 2,4-D--remember Agent \nOrange? Pretty darn close--resistant corn. They are going to dump \nthousands, millions, of tons of 2,4-D over this corn.\n  That is the net result of this sort of forward movement that they are \ntouting as helping us deal with pesticide and herbicide issues: Oh. \nDon't worry. There will never be a 2,4-D resistant weed. If there is, \ndon't worry. They will get an even more toxic chemical.\n  They are addicting farmers to their products and addicting farmers to \nbuying more and more of their pesticides.\n  We have now seen milkweed wiped out in the Midwest, causing a crisis \nwith monarch butterflies, who are actually a pretty critical \npollinator. Most people don't know that, apparently. And that is the \nresult of all this glyphosate and the coming of 2,4-D.\n  I thank the gentleman for the time.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chair, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Ms. Clarke).\n  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. \n1599, the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, also known as ``the DARK \nAct.'' One of my concerns is that this bill blocks the FDA from \ncreating a national mandatory GMO labeling system.\n  The current voluntary labeling system is not providing consumers with \nthe information they need because only 2 percent of the products on the \nshelves have voluntarily submitted to the non-GMO labeling process.\n  It is apparent that mandatory labeling is sorely needed, such as the \nkind required by Mr. DeFazio, the gentleman from Oregon's bill, the \nGenetically Engineered Food Right to Know Act.\n  In addition, what has happened to the outcry for states' rights from \nthe other side of the aisle? This bill preempts States from passing \ntheir own GMO labeling laws.\n  This would essentially invalidate the will of the people and, in so \ndoing, limit a State's ability to respond to the individual needs of \nits constituents.\n  There have been many discussions and conversations surrounding this \nbill. One such discussion has been extremely troubling, debasing, and \nscornful. Specifically, there are some who say that poor people don't \ncare what is in their food, nor do they care what they eat.\n  Let me be clear: I don't care whether you are wealthy or poor. All \nAmericans deserve to know what is in their food. Poor people are, first \nand foremost, human beings. They are not marginal subordinates in a \ndemocratic civil society.\n  Poor people deserve the same respect and consideration as the \nwealthy. Despite what some may think, poor people do care about what \nfood they eat, and they should be able to choose what they put in their \nbodies.\n  I will say it again. All Americans deserve to know what is in their \nfood. I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 1599, the DARK \nAct.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa).\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the \nSafe and Accurate Food Labeling measure before us.\n  This legislation, I understand, creates a great deal of angst among \nvarious supporters and opponents. We have heard that. But it also \ncreates a uniform, science-based labeling standard. I think that is a \nmove forward.\n  It also creates Federal regulations for the Food and Drug \nAdministration and the United States Department of Agriculture to \nremain preeminent authorities in food safety and labeling, just as it \nhas been for decades.\n  Additionally, it creates a national GMO-free certification program so \nconsumers who choose to buy non-GMO foods have the ability to do so \nwithout the higher prices or the misleading labeling.\n  This legislation does not reject consumers' rights to choose. While \nthe opponents of this measure wish it would do other things, it does \nnot. I think it is a balanced attempt.\n  Furthermore, the voters of California, as many of you may know, \nrecently, in proposition 37, had an opportunity to put in GMO labeling. \nMr. Chairman, 42 percent said ``yes,'' and 58 percent of the voters of \nCalifornia said ``no.''\n  I urge we support this legislation.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time to close.\n  I thank the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Pompeo), my colleague on the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee. He is a good man. Sometimes he is \nmisguided, but he likes Ben & Jerry's ice cream. I appreciate that. And \nit is GMO-free.\n  But I do want to address seriously the arguments the gentleman has \nmade because, number one, this is a serious issue. It is a serious \nissue, first of all, because this legislation puts handcuffs on all of \nour State legislatures from doing whatever it is they deem in the best \ninterest of their people.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  Secondly, it puts handcuffs on voters. Mr. Pompeo said that voters \nhave rejected this. In some ballot initiatives, that is the case. He is \nright. Why pass a law that takes that power from the voters and invest \nit here?\n  This is a very serious policy question where the United States House \nof Representatives is intruding into the efforts of States to represent \nthe people that they serve.\n  By the way, three States have passed laws by overwhelming margins. In \nVermont, the Vermont Senate bipartisan body, it was a 26-2 vote; the \nVermont House bipartisan body, it was 114-30 vote. In Connecticut, it \nwas 143-3 in the House and 35-1 in the Senate. In Maine, it was 114-4, \nand it was unanimously passed in the Senate 35-0.\n  What we are doing in the House of Representatives right now is saying \nto the Vermont legislature, saying to the Maine legislature, and saying \nto the Connecticut legislature: Drop dead. What you passed, we are \ntaking away.\n\n[[Page H5425]]\n\n  I don't think that is right.\n  I will make an acknowledgement. Sometimes, it is the right thing for \nthe Federal Government or the Congress to preempt State action so that \nit can have a uniform, across-the-board standard. That is what the \nDeFazio bill does. It acknowledges that so you don't have this \npatchwork.\n  This bill, with voluntary labeling, in effect, creates a patchwork. \nDoes it mean that company A decides they do want to label and they \nwrite the label they want and company B writes another label or \ndoesn't? What does that mean for consumers?\n  First of all, in all likelihood, there will be no labels. Secondly, \nthere will be the patchwork produced by this legislation that is what \nthe critics of the State-by-State approach say they want to avoid.\n  Next, there was an assertion by my friend from Texas, Mr. Conaway, \nthat a label is a warning. I think that really goes to the heart of \nwhat the dispute here is. Is a label a warning?\n  In fact, the proponents of the DeFazio bill and the opponents of this \nbill are not asserting that the purpose of the label is to suggest \nthere is scientific evidence indicating GMOs cause health problems. \nWhat a label is, is information; and the consumer then decides. Your \nconsumers and my consumers, they decide. Whatever their reason is, they \nhave a right to decide to buy product A or B, depending on what is in \nit or what is not in it.\n  What is the big fear about letting consumers know? A lot of the big \nadvocates that are pushing this are, in fact, some of these \nmanufacturers that create products that they sell to farmers, and Mr. \nDeFazio outlined that in his argument. They fear that the label will \nreduce the saleability of that product.\n  Here is the irony: If what they are producing and selling is so good \nand so nutritious and so tasty and so yummy, why not let the consumer \nknow what is in it? That would be something you would want to \nadvertise.\n  This really is a very profound decision by this Congress. Number one, \nit is telling States that have been taking initiative on the basis of \ntheir citizens' desires that they can't do it anymore. Number two, in \nthe name of avoiding a patchwork set of regulations, it is creating the \ninevitability of a patchwork. Then, three, in a very basic way, it is \ntelling American consumers that it is really none of their business \nwhat is in their product, no matter how much they really want to know \nwhat is in their product.\n  I urge that we vote ``no'' and defeat this measure and stand for \nState rights and consumer rights to know.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  As I close, I would like to offer my thanks first to Mr. Welch for \nthe respectful debate today and for the ice cream. I would like to \nthank my lead cosponsor, Mr. Butterfield, for his hard work all along \nthe way; as well as being the chairman of the Congressional Black \nCaucus, he has leaned into this and really made us able to get where we \nare today\n  I would like to thank Chairman Upton, Chairman Conaway, and Ranking \nMember Peterson for their support and effort in getting this \nlegislation to the floor as well. I would like to thank all the staff \non the Energy and Commerce and Agriculture Committees for their hard \nwork, too.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't thank Blake Hollander on my staff, who \nput in long hours making sure this commonsense bipartisan bill was \nready for the floor.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is really very simple. H.R. 1599 has two very simple \ngoals. First, it is to ensure families in Kansas and across the country \nhave access to nutritious and affordable food; and, second, it is to \nmake sure that those who wish to avoid food products that contain GMOs \nwill be able to do so, that they will not be denied the right to know.\n  In place of a convoluted patchwork of loophole-filled State or local \nlabeling laws, we will ensure that our food policy is science based and \ntransparent to consumers.\n  Let's be very clear. Consumers who wish to avoid foods containing \nGMOs are able to do so today, and they will be able to do so after this \nbill becomes law--except it is better now. There will now be a clear \nstandard about what that term really means.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense, proconsumer, profarmer bill that \nbrings clarity to food labeling and keeps affordable food for our \nconstituents.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to support H.R. 1599, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair, on June 23, 2015, the House \nconsidered H.R. 1599, the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act. It is my \nintention to vote against this legislation. For the past four decades I \nhave fought tirelessly for one of the finest products in the world, \nwild Alaskan salmon. The multi-billion dollar seafood industry in \nAlaska is the largest private sector employer in my state. Yet the \napproval of a genetically engineered (GE) salmon, or ``Frankenfish'' as \nI call it, could put our thriving and iconic fishing sector in \njeopardy.\n   Frankenfish could pose a grave threat to our wild salmon stocks in \nAlaska, and the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) support for \napproving GE salmon is disturbing. Equally disturbing is the fact that, \nif approved, the FDA has said that it would not require GE salmon to be \nlabeled.\n   In today's global marketplace, a consumer's access to accurate \ningredient information is paramount. Clear and accurate GE labeling \nrequirements attempt to mitigate the risk of market confusion or \nrejection by countries that have no interest in purchasing the hybrid \norganism. Consumer confusion about what types of salmon or seafood are \ngenetically engineered may deter shoppers from purchasing these \nproducts altogether. If GE salmon is approved despite opposition from \nCongress and nearly two million people who wrote in to the FDA, it \nshould be clearly labeled to avoid the potential market rejection of \nall salmon.\n   In an effort to ensure that Alaskan consumers have this essential \ninformation, Alaska enacted legislation in 2005 that requires the \nlabeling of all products containing GE fish and shellfish. However, the \nso-called Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act (H.R. 1599), recently \nreferred out of the House Agriculture Committee, would block states \nlike Alaska from requiring mandatory labeling of GE fish while also \ncurtailing FDA's ability to craft a true, national GE labeling system. \nRather, its proponents would suggest that Alaskan fishermen should go \nthrough a costly non-GMO certification if they want consumers to know \nthat their salmon is not genetically engineered. Why should all U.S. \nsalmon fishermen have to prove their salmon are non-GMO when farmed GE \nsalmon coming into the U.S. from other countries would not. It is \ninsufficient for consumers and it is insufficient for Alaska's thriving \nfishing industry.\n   For these reasons, I oppose H.R. 1599 in defense of states' rights \nto decide these important matters for themselves. All consumers should \nbe able to see whether their salmon is Frankenfish or not.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this legislation, \nwhich would preempt the ability of states to require GMO labeling laws.\n  Numerous studies have shown that Americans want to know what's in \ntheir food. As states respond to this trend, we should not restrict \ntheir ability to keep consumers informed about the food they eat. GMO \nlabeling laws are widely supported by consumers in over 60 countries \nincluding China, Russia and the European Union. We should not deny \nstates the ability to make this decision for their residents.\n  While I understand the concerns about the potential for a patchwork \nof state labeling laws, companies, can, of course, voluntarily choose \nto provide GMO information on their labeling. In fact, many of those \nopposing this legislation provide information on GMO products in Europe \nand other countries.\n  Mr. Chair, this bill was rushed through the Agriculture Committee and \ncame too quickly to the House floor before we could have a serious \ndiscussion about GMO labeling and consumer rights. We must closely \nstudy the merits of the bill and find common ground between labeling \nand a consumer's right to know before we vote on this far-reaching \nlegislation.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I rise today to highlight an editorial that \nmy good friend and colleague, Congresswoman Chellie Pingree of Maine \nand I recently wrote expressing our opposition to H.R. 1599, the Safe \nand Accurate Food Labeling Act. It appeared in the July 21, 2015 online \nedition of The Boston Globe.\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, July 21, 2015]\n\n              Let Americans Decide for Themselves on GMOs\n\n                 (By Jim McGovern and Chellie Pingree)\n\n       America has a proud tradition of empowering consumers. You \n     can walk into any grocery store in the country, pick up a \n     product from the shelf, and immediately learn the calorie \n     count, the amount of protein per serving, and the full list \n     of ingredients.\n       So it's alarming that Congress could soon pass a bill that \n     aims to keep consumers in the dark when it comes to foods \n     with genetically modified organisms, or GMOs.\n\n[[Page H5426]]\n\n       This week, the House of Representative will consider the \n     Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act. Unfortunately, the bill \n     does nothing to support safe and accurate food labeling. \n     Instead, it protects the status quo by preventing states from \n     requiring labels on foods containing GMO ingredients and \n     locks in the current and inadequate voluntary GMO labeling \n     system.\n       As more of the foods we eat contain GMOs, consumers \n     naturally want to know which foods contain them. All they are \n     asking for are the facts. This bill ignores that.\n       Congress needs to pass a law that puts consumers first by \n     requiring mandatory GMO labeling across the country, \n     eliminating confusion and establishing one national standard.\n       Polls consistently show that there is overwhelming support \n     for clearly labeling foods that have been genetically \n     modified or contain GMO ingredients. In a 2012 survey by the \n     Mellman Group, 89 percent were in favor of labeling with 77 \n     percent saying they ``strongly'' prefer GMO labeling. That \n     same survey also showed strong bipartisan support for GMO \n     labeling with huge majorities of Democrats (85 percent), \n     independents (93 percent), and Republicans (88 percent) all \n     in favor.\n       While Congress has been stuck in neutral, states have \n     stepped up and passed laws that give the power back to \n     consumers. In 2014, Vermont became the first state to require \n     mandatory GMO labeling. Connecticut and Maine have both \n     passed laws to require labeling and more than a dozen other \n     states are considering similar oversight, including \n     Massachusetts. What's more, 64 other countries have GMO \n     labeling, including Brazil whose consumption patterns are \n     similar to those in the United States.\n       Supporters of the bill claim that GMO labeling will \n     increase food prices. While plenty of things impact the \n     prices we pay at the grocery store--including transportation \n     costs and ingredient costs--GMO labeling is not one of them. \n     In study after study, we have seen that a simple GMO \n     disclaimer on food packaging will not increase prices.\n       Food companies change their labels all the time to make new \n     claims, and all food companies will soon have to change their \n     labels to make important changes to the Nutrition Fact Panel. \n     Adding a few words to the back of the food package about \n     genetic engineering will not have any impact of the cost of \n     making food.\n       Opponents of updating food labeling made the same bogus \n     arguments when they fought nutrition labeling in the 1980s. \n     Back then, they claimed that disclosing the presence of \n     calories, salt, fat, and sugar would require costly \n     reformulations. But those much more significant changes to \n     foods labels--adding the Nutrition Facts Panel and including \n     more information about ingredients--didn't change the price \n     of food at all.\n       Americans want more information, not less. What we need is \n     one law that makes GMO labeling mandatory across the country \n     and establishes a single national standard that eliminates \n     confusion and puts consumers in charge.\n       This debate isn't about the safety of GMOs. It's about \n     consumers' right to know what's in the food they put on their \n     tables. We ought to give them that right.\n\n  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my strong support of the \nbipartisan Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015. I want to \nrecognize the hard work my colleague of Mr. Pompeo, as well as the \nefforts of both the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee \non Agriculture into this legislation.\n  As a representative from the great State of Iowa, I am extremely \nsensitive and aware of the issues facing agriculture--from farm to \nfork--and I am aware of the challenges my constituents face while \nproducing the delicious and nutritious food the rest of us consume. On \nan annual basis, Iowa grows $12B worth of corn and $5.7B worth of \nsoybeans, of which 95% and 97%, respectively, are Genetically Modified \nOrganisms--or GMOs. Recently, states began to enact laws that required \nlabeling of these GMO products, often with exemptions for local \nproducts, would increase compliance costs for producers and create \nconfusion for consumers.\n  This bill addresses the current patchwork of state biotechnology \nlabeling requirements--compliance with which would be a daunting task \nfor the producers in my district that distribute food throughout the \nUnited States--by providing a mechanism for uniform labeling \nrequirements. No one benefits--not farmers, nor food manufacturers and \nprocessors, nor retailers, and most of all, not consumers--from a \nconfusing collection of state laws--each different, with different \nrequirements--creating great confusion among consumers in the \nmarketplace.\n  It does so by establishing a voluntary non-GMO labeling program at \nUSDA modeled after the highly successful National Organic Program. \nToday, when consumers go into a grocery store, they may see a wide \nvariety of products that may have a non-GMO label on it. However, there \nisn't a standard that defines what a non-GMO product is or is not. The \nlanguage of the bill directs the USDA to establish standards and \ncertification process for producers in order to put a non-GMO label on \ntheir products.\n  Mr. Chair, a number of constituents along with some of my colleagues, \nare advocating for mandatory labeling for GMO products because \nconsumers have a right to know what is in their food. I agree--\nconsumers have a right to know--and the standards set by the USDA under \nthis legislation will provide consumers with all the information \nnecessary to make informed decisions and choices on their grocery \nstores purchases. This bill protects and enhances consumer choice by \nestablishing a voluntary non-GMO labeling program--without costing them \nan extra $500 a year per family that economists at Cornell University \nestimate mandatory labeling would.\n  Mr. Chair, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 1599--over 470 \nagricultural and food organizations that represent the entire food \nchain have already done so. The legislation enhances consumer choice, \nclears up confusion in the marketplace, and enhances consumer \nconfidence in the food we eat.\n  Vote ``Yes'' on H.R. 1599.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by \nthe Committee on Agriculture, printed in the bill, it shall be in order \nto consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the \n5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of \nthe text of Rules Committee print 114-24, modified by the amendment \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-216.

Pursuant to House Resolution 369, the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. DeFazio) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, there was a time when Monsanto supported \nlabeling. Of course, 64 countries have adopted labeling, including the \nUnited Kingdom.\n  Here is what Monsanto said back then: Monsanto fully supports U.K. \nfood manufacturers and retailers in their introduction to these labels. \nWe believe you should be aware of all the facts before making a \npurchase. We encourage you to look out for these labels.\n  That was then; this is now. Now, Monsanto and Monsanto's allies say \nsuch labeling is impossible, impractical, and unnecessary. There was a \ntime when Monsanto was proud of their genetically modified organisms. \nWhy not now?\n  We have heard all of these arguments, some of which aren't exactly \naccurate, about the great benefits of GMOs. Why not put on there, \n``GMOs solve global warming.'' Put it right there on the label. For all \nthe people who are concerned about climate change, that would be \nsomething.\n  Now, 64 countries around the world require labeling; and many, many \nlarge U.S. firms actually do label in those countries. The countries \nare all the European Union--that is a pretty big slice of the world \neconomy--China, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Brazil, India, New \nZealand, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Saudi Arabia. Now, all of \nthose countries require it; U.S. manufacturers ship products to those \ncountries, and they put it on the label.\n  Now, Hershey's is not the only company that does this. This is a \nHershey's label, and it is ``made in the USA.'' We like that. We like \nexporting things around the world, so we are very proud of the exports \nof Hershey's and other food manufacturers, but because of laws in \nSweden, they have to say ``contains genetically modified organisms.''\n  Now, somehow, they can do that there. I mean, the EU has consistent \nrules, and my bill would have rules consistent with the EU. They could \nmake one label, which would go to about half the world's economy. If it \nreally costs money to print different labels, that would actually save \nthem money, and it would do away with this argument about a \nproliferation of various different labels across the U.S.\n  There are some other countries that have different requirements, and \nthey do still export to those countries, too. They can't have a uniform \noverseas label, but they could get darn close with all of the European \nUnion, United States; and New Zealand and Australia are virtually \nidentical.\n  Now, it isn't just Hershey's. These large companies go into--at \nleast--50 of the 64 countries that require labeling: Pepsi, Tyson, \nNestle, Coke, Mars, Hershey, Kellogg, and Heinz.\n  Now, I was contacted by Hershey, and they said: We can't deal with \nthe proliferation in the States.\n  Then they should support my bill. Get a uniform national label. Let \nconsumers know it contains GMOs. Monsanto can go out and tout the \nbenefits or others can tout the benefits of GMOs, and then they could \nhave one label for the EU and the United States.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Kansas is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, the United States should not let other \ncountries dictate U.S. food policy. This would be absurd. It is exactly \nwhat this amendment does.\n  The proponents of this amendment seemingly wish to scare the public \nwith unjustified warning labels on all products produced with any \ntechnology or, short of that, punish companies that have the audacity \nto engage in foreign commerce.\n  Just because European policy has been driven by fear-mongering, we \nshould not allow it to be so here in the United States. We should not \nsuccumb to this angry rhetoric. We should lead the world in getting \nthis policy right.\n  Now, let's just say, for sake of argument, we were to pass this \namendment. I would like to ask: Who would be responsible for \nenforcement of such a quagmire? What agency licenses exports of food? \nWhat agency would be responsible for monitoring where in the world \nthose products went and what specific requirements were placed on them \nby the countries receiving those products?\n  Assuming such information is actually obtained, that information is \nlikely proprietary business information, exempted from disclosure \nbetween agencies by the Freedom of Information Act.\n  Here in the United States, we rely on the FDA for responsibility for \nfood inspection, but as many proponents of\n\n[[Page H5431]]\n\nmandatory warning labels are quick to point out, the FDA inspects less \nthan 1 percent of the products.\n  Are the proponents just doing this for show? Or do they actually \nexpect an agency to fulfill its enforcement obligation? If so, has this \namendment been scored?\n  I can only imagine what the cost will be to the agency to ensure that \nlabels mandated by this amendment's sponsors are accurate.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment would take us backwards. It would \nrequire an even more patchwork set of rules. I urge that we get to \nuniformity. The logistics of enforcing every product label and their \ncounterpart in 1 of 195 other countries in the world would be costly \nand a waste of taxpayer dollars.\n  I urge the defeat of this ill-conceived effort to punish American \nbusinessmen and -women who are doing their best to grow our economy.\n  I reserve the balance of my time\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, 64 countries require labeling, including the \nEuropean Union. This would give companies an opportunity to have a \nconsistent label across the United States and into the European Union.\n  Consumers want this. The polls are consistently 88 percent. Monsanto \nspends $20 million, $30 million like they did in Oregon convincing \npeople it would drive up food costs; and then they won by one one-\nhundredths of 1 percent in that election, after spending a record \namount of money.\n  Americans want to know what is in their food; don't put them in the \ndark.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, we should not create a system whereby U.S. \nfood producers are at the complete mercy of global actors all around \nthe world. Goodness knows what the requirements would be for their \nlabels here.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon will be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Huffman\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-216.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 369, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Huffman) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to ensure \ntribal sovereignty is not inadvertently harmed by this legislation, the \nDARK Act.\n  I am joined by several colleagues in support of this amendment, \nincluding cosponsors Representatives Polis, McCollum, Grijalva, and \nRuiz.\n  Now, much of the debate this morning has focused on how and if this \nbill will preempt State and local laws, which would include ordinances \nin my district that have been adopted by Marin, Mendocino, Humboldt, \nand Trinity Counties.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  I agree with my colleagues: we deserve to know what is in our food, \nand this bill prevents local and State governments from providing \nconsumers with that information, the information they want.\n  But in today's debate, little has been said about the need to protect \nthe principle of tribal self-governance. I recognize that some of my \ncolleagues believe the manager's amendment addresses any concerns \nregarding preemption and tribal sovereignty. I disagree. That is why I \nam offering this amendment to address any potential ambiguity in the \nbill, and to ensure that tribes can continue to take action on GMOs, as \nmany of them have sought to do. If the underlying bill is supposed to \nprotect tribal sovereignty, I would hope that the bill supporters \nwouldn't mind making that protection explicit by passing this \namendment.\n  In 2013, the National Congress of American Indians, which supports my \namendment today, passed a resolution calling on Congress and the \nFederal Government to ``preserve, protect, and maintain the integrity \nof traditional native foods, seeds, and agricultural systems . . . \nsupport the labeling of seeds or products containing GE technology and \ningredients . . . create GE and transgenic crop-free zones; and oppose \nthe use and cultivation of GE seeds in the United States.'' But this \nbill would preempt the creation of a national standard for GMOs that \nNCAI has asked for.\n  Now, this is not just about crops, Mr. Chairman. The Affiliated \nTribes of Northwest Indians, which includes several tribes in my \ndistrict, are strongly opposed to the FDA approval of genetically \nengineered salmon due to the potential for harmful impacts on wild \nsalmon that are so important to the tribes and to, frankly, the \ncommercial economy in my district. Under this legislation, it is hard \nto see how FDA could ever require the labeling of genetically \nengineered salmon.\n  With the significant concerns over GE foods and the proactive steps \nthat tribes are taking on their lands and resources, we ought to make \nclear that this bill will not affect tribes' authorities to prohibit or \nrestrict the cultivation of GE plants on or near tribal lands.\n  The Congressional Research Service has taken a look at this bill's \nnew preemption section, and they have said that the effects of the \npreemption language are ambiguous. In the case of impacts to tribes, we \nought to leave no ambiguity.\n  I urge support of this amendment. No matter how we feel about the \nlegislation as a whole, I would hope, at the very least, we could \nclarify that tribes should retain the authority to restrict GE plants \non their own lands, if they so choose.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Kansas is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, simply put, H.R. 1599 does not prohibit \nlocal governments from passing and enforcing bans on cultivation of \ngenetically engineered crops. Similarly, it does not do that with \nrespect to tribal sovereignty either.\n  The bill before us applies only to the food use and labels. There is \nnothing in this legislation that any opponent can point to that \nsuggests or implies interference with State or local ordinances related \nto plant cultivation, period.\n  Likewise, the preemption provision that the amendment seeks to modify \nonly applies to States and political subdivisions thereof. Tribal lands \nare sovereign. They are not affected.\n  If the amendment sponsor wishes only to clarify sovereign rights of \ntribal governments on their land, then we would be happy to work with \nhim, but the structure of this amendment appears to provide tribal \ngovernments with some level of authority over land outside of their \nboundaries. This may or may not have been the intended purpose of the \namendment, but it has serious unintended consequences.\n  I urge the sponsor to withdraw this amendment and allow us the \nopportunity to work together to address their concerns.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, if the intent is not to prohibit or \nrestrict or preempt tribal sovereignty, why not make it clear, why not \npass this amendment?\n  I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Oregon (Mr. \nDeFazio).\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, there are three preemption sections in \nthis bill: one prohibits States from labeling GMOs; another establishes \nsomething for a label called ``natural,'' which will contain GMOs and \ncan contain GMOs and still be labeled ``natural''; and then\n\n[[Page H5432]]\n\nfinally, a very poorly written big section that seems to preempt all \nState regulations and tribal regulations.\n  The Navajo Nation has a ban on the cultivation of genetically \nmodified crops. They are trying to preserve their indigenous crops.\n  States have provided for buffer zones in 30 States. This bill, I \nbelieve, will preempt those 30 States from establishing buffer zones to \nprotect conventional crops.\n  We had conventional wheat in Oregon that was banned from export \nbecause of GMO pollution--conventional wheat, let alone organic wheat, \nwhich would be worthless if it had GMO pollution.\n  So in this bill I had an amendment to clarify this section and say, \nno, no, no, not preempting State Departments of Agriculture \nestablishing reasonable rules to protect conventional and organic \nfarmers from preemption. They say they fixed it. I don't believe they \nhave. That part of the bill is very vague. This, I believe, could both \npreempt tribal sovereign entity, State sovereign entity, and reasonable \nregulations to protect other farmers.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, the language is very clear. It says that \n``no State or political subdivision of a State may directly or \nindirectly establish under any authority or continue in effect as to \nany food in interstate commerce any requirement with respect to \ngenetically engineered plants for a use or application of food that is \nnot identical to the requirement of section 461 of the Plant Protection \nAct.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I respectfully disagree that that language \nis clear, but I would note that that language says nothing about tribal \nsovereignty.\n  Mr. Chairman, colleagues, this is a bill that is deeply flawed. It \nshould be opposed for all sorts of reasons. But here is an amendment \nthat would at least make it a little better for those of us that \nrepresent Indian Country, for those of us that care about tribal \nsovereignty.\n  For those of us that want to protect the tribes who have taken action \non their land, who have in some cases partnered with States for buffer \nzones near tribal land, we ought to at least take this additional step \nto make it clear that they can do that, that we are not running \nroughshod over their tribal sovereignty.\n  With that, I request an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, nothing in this amendment will impact \ntribal sovereignty one iota. It talks about States and political \nsubdivisions. That doesn't apply in any way to tribal land.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Huffman).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Ms. DeLauro\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-216.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 33, lines 13 through 17, amend paragraph (2) to read \n     as follows:\n       ``(2) A claim described in subparagraph (1) may be made \n     only if--\n       ``(A) the claim uses terms that have been defined by, and \n     the food meets the requirements that have been established \n     in, regulations promulgated to carry out this paragraph; and\n       ``(B) the food is not produced using, does not contain, and \n     does not consist of a genetically engineered plant.''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 369, the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut (Ms. DeLauro) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment would make clear that foods labeled \n``natural'' cannot contain genetically modified material.\n  I want to emphasize right from the outset it is about our basic right \nto know what we are eating and what we are feeding to our children.\n  FDA already requires clear labeling of over 3,000 ingredients, \nadditives, and food processes. One example: fruit juice must indicate \nwhether or not it is from concentrate. Clearly, that is not a judgment \non food safety; it is a simple matter of transparency.\n  Calling GMO foods ``natural'' is not transparent. It is confusing, \nand we have the data to back that up.\n  As Members can see from the chart behind me, almost two-thirds of \nAmerican adults believe that ``natural'' already means GMO-free, and 84 \npercent agree that that is what it should mean.\n  We need to make sure that food labels reflect that commonsense \nunderstanding. As drafted, this bill would do the opposite. It would \ncodify the status quo, being that food companies can put ``natural'' on \na product, even if it was genetically engineered, which allows \nmisleading labels. It would perpetuate misunderstandings and confusion. \nIt would keep American families in the dark.\n  This is not what the American public wants. More than 90 percent of \nus want clear GMO labeling. In response to this overwhelming demand, \nthree States--Vermont, Maine, and my home State of Connecticut--have \npassed laws restricting the ``natural'' label to foods that do not \ncontain GMOs. Several other States are considering similar laws.\n  Without my amendment, this bill would nullify those State laws. This \nwould represent a serious setback for the right to know in these States \naround the country.\n  Mr. Chairman, American families want clear information about GMOs. \nThey deserve that information. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I wish to rise in \nopposition.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. DeFazio), my colleague.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, this bill would deceive consumers. It \nwould say that there will now be an FDA definition of ``natural.'' The \nFDA has never, ever wanted to try and define ``natural'' and that it \nwould include GMOs. Something labeled as ``natural''--Cheerios, \nnaturally flavored--if it contained GMOs, they wouldn't have to say \nthat.\n  So consumers often, in fact, confuse the ``organic'' and the \n``natural'' label. In fact, some polls show that consumers more often \nthink ``natural'' is natural and they are not quite sure what \n``organic'' is. This bill is going to muddy those waters further, \ndeceive consumers, and have them buy things labeled ``natural'' that \ncontain genetically modified organisms.\n  Why is that in this bill? We can fight over the labeling standards \nfor disclosure. Why are you going to muddy the waters and confuse \nthings and create a new mandatory Federal definition and label for \n``natural'' that contains GMOs?\n  Again, here we have all natural vodka creamy marinara. Wow, that is \nsomething. And again, this has a number of things in it that very \nlikely contain GMOs that wouldn't be disclosed. But they do have to \ndisclose, and she does, cellulose, sorbic acid, whey, xanthan gum, \nvodka--of course, it is vodka sauce. But in the future, natural, \ncontains GMOs, no disclosure.\n  This is really, really I think probably the most egregious part of a \nvery egregious bill--preempting states' rights. Remember, this is the \nparty of states' rights. Until a State does something they don't like, \nthen we have got to preempt it.\n  Then they say, well, we can't have proliferation of labels. Well, \nthere is a very simple solution, my bill, one mandatory standard \nFederal label that would say, ``contains GMOs.'' Then that label could \nbe sold into the European Union. You would be able to sell to about \nhalf of the world's economy with one label; whereas, today, you have \ngot to have one label for the EU, one label for the U.S., and then a \nmultiple of other countries where 50 major corporations sell their \nproducts.\n\n[[Page H5433]]\n\n  This is so disingenuous. It is very discouraging.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, how much time remains?\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Connecticut has 1 minute remaining.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, as I said at the beginning, this is not a \nquestion of safety or otherwise of GMO foods. We need to ask ourselves \na simple question: Does the word ``natural'' really mean to a salmon \nengineered to grow at double the normal rate? a cereal created in a \nlaboratory to be resistant to herbicide? a tomato with fish genes? Are \nthese things natural? Our common sense says no. A clear majority of \nAmericans agree. By overwhelming margins, we want to know when our food \ncontains GMOs.\n  We are what we eat, and whether it is the number of calories in our \nkids' Happy Meals, the country where our beef was raised, or the GMO \ncontent of the food we buy at the supermarket, as consumers, as \nparents, as Americans, we have a right to know.\n  As drafted, this bill would fly in the face of that broad consensus \nand keep us in the dark. For the sake of transparency and for \ncommonsense, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, it is interesting; this \nwhole entire debate we have talked about science. The science clearly \nshows that genetically modified seeds, genetically modified foods, are \nsafe for every single American family.\n  It is also interesting that my colleague brought a box of Honey Nut \nCheerios to the floor. My colleague talked about claims made on that \nbox. Well, it is interesting that my colleague didn't bring a box of \nregular Cheerios that sometimes contain a label of non-GMO.\n  Well, it is a marketing ploy, and that is what we are trying to \ncorrect here, because there is no GMO oat. It is all to convince \nconsumers that it is somehow safer, even though there is no distinction \nbetween that Cheerios that has that label and the other Cheerios box \nthat doesn't.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  It is interesting to see those specific points brought to the floor \nto try and make this case. It is just clearly not resonating with the \nAmerican people.\n  There are no clear and consistent standards for the term ``natural,'' \nwhich is why we are trying to correct this in this bill.\n  We need to make sure that consistent litigation that has come about \nbecause of the very definitions of what the term ``natural'' means can \nstop. Let's put a clear standard in place.\n  H.R. 1599 also requires the FDA to file a notice and comment \nrulemaking process to define and set standards for the term \n``natural.'' I thought this was exactly what the rulemaking process was \nsupposed to be used for.\n  This will allow for an open, transparent, public process so that the \nFDA can establish such standards based on the facts, the science, and \nthe input received.\n  This amendment would predetermine that outcome and not allow for a \nscience-based, fact-driven process--that is open to the public--to \ncontinue to move forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. Let's get on the path \nof passing H.R. 1599 in this House.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Connecticut will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 4 Offered by Ms. Pingree\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in \npart B of House Report 114-216.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 1, strike line 1 and all that follows through the end \n     of the bill, and insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Non-GMO Disclosure Act of \n     2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NON-GMO FOOD CERTIFICATION PROGRAM.\n\n       The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1621 et \n     seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subtitle:\n\n            ``Subtitle E--Non-GMO Food Certification Program\n\n     ``SEC. 291. CERTIFICATION OF NON-GMO FOODS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish a \n     voluntary certification program for food produced without the \n     use of genetic engineering to be known as the Non-GMO Food \n     Certification Program.\n       ``(b) Consultation.--The Secretary shall consult with other \n     relevant parties to develop the Non-GMO Food Certification \n     Program.\n       ``(c) Certification.--The Secretary shall implement the \n     Non-GMO Food Certification Program through certifying agents. \n     Certifying agents may certify that products were not produced \n     with the use of genetic engineering or a genetically \n     engineered plant, in accordance with this subtitle.\n       ``(d) Seal.--The Secretary shall establish a seal to \n     identify products that were not produced with the use of \n     genetic engineering or a genetically engineered plant in \n     interstate commerce using terminology the Secretary considers \n     appropriate, including terminology commonly used in \n     interstate commerce or established by the Secretary in \n     regulations.\n\n     ``SEC. 292.

Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous \nconsent to dispense with the reading.\n  The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from \nMaine?\n  There was no objection.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 369, the gentlewoman from \nMaine (Ms. Pingree) and a Member opposed each will control 10 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Maine.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate the lively debate that has gone on today, and I want to \nspeak in favor of this particular amendment.\n  This is the Pingree-DeFazio-Polis amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, which strikes all of the anticonsumer and antifarmer \nprovisions of the underlying bill.\n  This comes down to a very simple proposition: Do consumers have a \nright to know what is in the food they buy and that they feed to their \nfamilies?\n  As we have heard many times today, 9 out of 10 consumers say, yes, \nthey support GMO labeling. The public wants to know, as more and more \npeople care about what is in their food and where it comes from. People \nwant to know more, not less, about what they eat.\n  We already know a lot about our food. We know how many calories are \nin it, thanks to the labels. We know how much vitamin C we get per \nserving. We know if a fish is farm raised or wild caught.\n\n[[Page H5434]]\n\n  We want to know those things. We actually know if our orange juice is \nmade from concentrate or not. Maybe not everybody wants to know that, \nbut it is right there on the label. Shouldn't we also be able to know \nif the food we are buying has GMO ingredients?\n  I know some of the opponents of labeling have suggested that \nconsumers might be frightened by GMO ingredients if they were to see \nthem on the labels.\n  Do we really think that consumers are not smart enough to handle this \ninformation? Do we really think that 90 percent of Americans are wrong \nto want GMO products labeled?\n  Not only does this bill make it very unlikely that we would ever see \nthe labeling of GMO products on a national basis, but it goes after the \nlaws that have already been passed at the State level, just like in my \nState of Maine.\n  Our law was passed by a Democratic legislature, was signed by a \nconservative Republican Governor, and it has a huge amount of public \nsupport.\n  Now Congress wants to tell the consumers of my State and my State \nlegislators that they cannot have this basic piece of information.\n  I guarantee you, if Congress passes this law, my State legislature \nand my constituents will not be happy. They do not want to see their \nability to make those decisions taken away.\n  Not only does this bill go after State labeling laws, but it may also \npreempt laws and regulations at a local level that protect farmers from \ncontamination by drift from GMO crops.\n  In my State and in many others, local organic farms are contributing \nto the economy by growing high-value, high-demand crops.\n  Some local and county governments have created buffer zones to \nprotect those farms from contamination from GMO crops, and we have \nheard from experts who say this bill would preempt these laws.\n  Why would we want to do that? Why would we want to undercut one of \nthe fastest growing sectors in our farm economy that has been very \nbeneficial to rural States like mine--that has revitalized many \ncommunities and that has provided economic opportunities for our \nfarmers? What reason would we have to go in the opposite direction?\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It would strike the \ndangerous parts of this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Kansas is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would completely gut the \nprimary purpose of the legislation before us today.\n  In order to prevent a patchwork of 50 different labeling laws for \ngenetically engineered ingredients, preemption is necessary to protect \ninterstate commerce.\n  Of course, we have heard a lot today about states' rights, but the \nFounders understood what was important about interstate commerce.\n  They knew that local governments were at risk of trying to put in \nplace rules that favored local activities; so they accounted for this. \nThey created what is called the Interstate Commerce Clause.\n  It is right there in the Constitution, and it is pretty darned clear. \nIt was about trade between the States. It said that the Federal \nGovernment shall have the authority to regulate this trade. It is \nimportant that we do this today, but this amendment would deny us the \ncapacity to do that.\n  Current State labeling initiatives include a number of varying \nexemptions, loopholes, and caveats, making it very confusing for not \nonly food producers, but for consumers to understand what it is they \nare truly consuming.\n  H.R. 1599 builds on this idea of a uniform standard to provide \nclarity and consistency to consumers that they can depend upon, \nregardless of where they shop for food.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Farr), my good friend and the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and \nDrug Administration, and Related Agencies.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment. \nThe author is an organic grower. She knows how people care about what \nis in their food.\n  I represent one of the most successful agricultural counties in the \nUnited States--Monterey County. I challenge anybody to find a county in \nthis country that makes $4.5 billion a year by growing over 100 \ndifferent crops in one county.\n  Food is just like politics--it is all local. What the underlying bill \ndoes is strike local control--local control where people care about the \nmethodology of growing.\n  My area is the area that blossomed into creating the California \nOrganic Standards Act, which I authored in the California State \nLegislature, which became the model for the Federal Organic Standards \nAct. This preempts some of the regulations in there. That is not a good \nthing to do.\n  Although the Federal Government may have the authority on interstate \ncommerce, I don't think that people want the Federal Government to \npreempt the ability for them to know their farmers, to know their food, \nand to have it be labeled as they so choose in a local area.\n  Labeling is really important, but what you do is change the \ndefinition of labels here to one size fits all. That is not the way \nthis country works. That is not the way farming works. And it is \ncertainly not the way that consumers want it to be.\n  It is too early for the Federal Government, for Congress, to jump in \nand try to mix up this field. Allow local politics to exist. Allow \npeople to choose to know what is in their food by allowing it to be \nlabeled locally.\n\n  Let's support American agriculture so that we can sell it abroad. \nThis bill does everything but gain confidence. The amendment is to be \nsupported.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I am honored to follow my \ncolleague from California. Less than a year ago I was in his fine \ndistrict, and I saw the benefits of the agricultural industry in \nMonterey, California.\n  I actually toured an organic food processing facility in and around \nmy colleague's district, and I saw firsthand the impact of California \nagriculture.\n  I want my colleagues to be assured that the organic labeling program \nis exactly what this bill is modeled after.\n  The words that may have been developed in the California State Senate \nand in the California State Assembly are part of our national organic \nstandards because they work. Organic is a voluntary program just like \nwe are trying to put forth.\n  This is exactly what we are trying to do, Mr. Chairman--address the \nconcerns of many Americans who want a label and who have contacted our \noffices.\n  Americans also want standards; so, when we hear words like \n``contamination,'' unfortunately, it connotates negativity to consumers \nthat somehow GMOs are bad for them. The science, though, clearly shows \nthey are not.\n  As a matter of fact, I just walked over to the Senate side and sat \ndown with some of my colleagues who probably will not vote for this \nbill. We didn't know, because there was no label, whether or not that \nsandwich we ate contained genetically modified organisms--seeds--if it \nwere produced with GMOs.\n  We are trying to fix that. We would allow that sandwich shop to \nactually meet a set of standards, just like how our organic growers do \ntoday, to determine what a GMO product means.\n  When we hear about trade, earlier today, I was with a member of the \nEuropean Parliament, Julie Girling. We were talking about some of the \nimpacts of the GMO rules and regulations in the EU on their ability to \nget cheap food into their supermarkets.\n  I would urge my colleagues to talk to those who are experiencing the \nexact same thing right now in our European countries that are our \nallies. Talk with Ms. Girling. Talk to her about the problems that \nEurope is experiencing.\n  We are trying to stop those problems from happening here in America. \nI want to make sure that we use science--that we use the facts--and \nthat we use a model of a very successful organic labeling program to \nwrite this bill.\n  Therefore, my colleagues should be in favor of this if they are so in \nfavor of the existing program today.\n\n[[Page H5435]]\n\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, who cares deeply about issues surrounding our environment \nand public health.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, the amendment offered to H.R. 1599 by \nCongresswoman Pingree and Congressman DeFazio would replace the \nunderlying bill with a voluntary certification program for non-\ngenetically engineered foods, enabling companies that elect to go \nthrough this process to certify that their food is non-GE and share \nthis information with consumers through a seal established by the USDA, \nsimilar to the organic program.\n  This amendment is a step forward in providing consumers with the \ninformation they want. While this amendment would preserve the ability \nof States and localities to act in regards to the labeling of non-GE \nand GE foods, it unfortunately does not address the problem many of us \nhave heard about today, and that is a patchwork of food labeling \nrequirements across the country.\n  As I have said previously, I can't support preempting State labeling \nlaws without establishing a national mandatory labeling standard in its \nplace. Moving forward, I hope that we can work with the Senate to \nstrike a balance that will address concerns we have heard on both sides \nof this issue.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer), a hard-working Congressman who cares deeply, \nas well, about agriculture issues and about the consumers in his State.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I thank the gentlewoman who represents the other \nPortland. I deeply appreciated her leadership and insight in this area.\n  Mr. Chairman, these are areas that touch Americans on a whole host of \nlevels, but one of the things that is important to note is that the \nextreme provisions of the preemption bill, of the underlying bill that \nwe are discussing, actually have significant negative consequences on \nhard-working farmers in our State.\n  There are vast world markets that we export to, and most of the world \nmarkets care about whether or not the product is genetically engineered \nor not. You can argue the merits, but the world market has made a \njudgment.\n  We had some cross contamination in wheat for the genetically \nengineered strain, which set off alarm bells. Oregon farmers lost \nbusiness as a result of that.\n  The underlying bill would undercut the efforts of 40 States in \nworking with their local communities to try and provide protections.\n  Whether or not you are going to label it, there is no reason that you \ncan't provide reasonable buffers around crops that are genetically \nmodified so that you can help provide some protection.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Why would we want to strip away the ability of State and local \ngovernments to provide those sort of protections?\n  Now, in the long run, Mr. Chairman, what we need to do is just have a \nuniform national policy that labels these, that gets rid of all the \nproblems of multiplicity of labels and the costs and the confusion. My \ngood friend from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) has legislation that would do \nprecisely that. But in the meantime, I deeply appreciate my friend from \nMaine stepping up to get rid of the most egregious part of the \nunderlying bill, create a program that they can label their products GE \nfree, and get rid of these egregious preemption provisions.\n  Mr. POMPEO. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Would the Chair please inform how much time I have \nremaining.\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maine has 2 minutes remaining. The \ngentleman from Kansas has 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We have heard a lot of arguments about this bill today and the \nvarious components of it, why the bill is not a good idea, and why my \namendment, which would strike most of the egregious parts of the bill, \nwould be a beneficial way to change this.\n  Just to go back to my favorite example about labeling, the next time \nyou go into a grocery store, take a look at the carton of orange juice. \nRight there on the front of the label you will see the words ``from \nconcentrate'' on most of the juice boxes. By law, those words have to \nappear right there on the front of the label in letters at least half \nas tall as the name of the brand. We are that specific.\n  Now, the fact that we need to know the difference in that carton \nbetween fresh squeezed and made from concentrate or any other process \nthat might have been used shows me that we have decided to have labels \nfor almost everything you can think of except GMO ingredients.\n  If it is so important for Americans to know whether or not their \norange juice is made from a concentrate, don't you think it is \nreasonable to put a label somewhere on the back of a package of food \ntelling consumers whether or not it contains GMO ingredients?\n  This bill, if it is passed by the House, will effectively guarantee \nthat consumers won't have access to that information when they go to \nthe grocery store. This bill will take away the rights of States like \nmine in Maine to pass laws that protect our consumers. States like \nMaine and Vermont, who have already passed laws like this, will not \nhave the right to proceed. The Pingree-DeFazio-Polis amendment will \nstrike the worst parts of this bill. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POMPEO. I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment would put us right back where we are \ntoday, with a patchwork of laws confusing consumers and making it \ndifficult on American food companies to compete around the world to \nfeed the next billion people.\n  This amendment would drive up the cost of food for every consumer in \nthe United States of America by relegating them to the set of patchwork \nrules, which would drive costs throughout the food safety and supply \nchain.\n  We have heard today that this puts farmers at risk, it makes life for \nfarmers difficult. We have heard from Representatives from Maine who \nsaid that, and yet the Maine Beverage Association and the Maine Potato \nBoard both endorsed this legislation.\n  We have heard that this will hurt Oregon farmers and Oregon \nconsumers, and yet the Oregon Farm Bureau, the Oregon Feed and Grain \nAssociation, the Oregon Potato Commission, the Oregon Retail Council, \nthe Oregon Seed Association, the Oregon Wheat Growers League, and \nOregonians for Food & Shelter endorsed this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment will gut this entire legislation. It \ntakes away the important balance that has been struck in order to make \nsure that, in fact, consumers do have the right to know.\n  We have heard these vague epithets trying to rename this bill the \nDARK Act, Denying Americans the Right to Know, but as a good \nconservative, I can promise you, this bill doesn't deny any consumer \nany right to know what is in their food product.\n  If a consumer, like my cousin, who likes her non-GMO food, wants to \ncontinue to feed that to herself and her family, when this bill becomes \nlaw, she will still be able to do so. I would never deny any American \nthe right to know what is in their food.\n  This is about freedom and consumer choice and affordability. Our bill \nwill achieve that, and this amendment would destroy that. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                       Announcement by the Chair\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings will now \nresume on those amendments printed in part B of House Report 114-216 on \nwhich further proceedings were postponed, in the following order:\n  Amendment No. 1 by Mr. DeFazio of Oregon.\n  Amendment No. 2 by Mr. Huffman of California.\n  Amendment No. 3 by Ms. DeLauro of Connecticut.\n  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any \nelectronic vote after the first vote in this series.\n\n[[Page H5436]]\n\n                 Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. DeFazio\n\n  The CHAIR.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 3009, currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I support H.R. 3009, the Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act, \nand commend Representative Hunter for introducing this legislation. It \nhelps to address one of the main factors contributing to the collapse \nof immigration enforcement in the United States, ``sanctuary cities'' \nthat prohibit their law enforcement officers from sharing information \nwith Federal immigration authorities to enable the removal of unlawful \nand criminal aliens.\n  Nearly 20 years ago, Congress realized that sanctuary cities were \nimpeding the Federal Government from enforcing our immigration laws and \njeopardizing the safety of our residents, immigrant and native-born \nalike.\n  Legislation cowritten by former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nLamar Smith, prohibited States and localities from becoming sanctuaries \nfor unlawful aliens.\n  The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of \n1996 ensures that jurisdictions cannot prohibit or restrict government \nofficials from sending to or receiving from Federal immigration \nauthorities information regarding the immigration status of any person.\n  Unfortunately, despite the proliferation of sanctuary jurisdictions, \nthe Justice Department has never initiated a prosecution for violation \nof the 1996 act. If the administration won't act, Congress must, and \nthat is what Mr. Hunter's bill does.\n  It withholds key Federal law enforcement grants from sanctuary \njurisdictions that violate the 1996 act. Enactment of Representative \nHunter's legislation will help persuade sanctuary jurisdictions to \nsimply abide by current Federal law and, in doing so, advance public \nsafety.\n  Representative Hunter's bill is an important first step, but there is \nmuch more we will need to do to rebuild immigration enforcement in the \nUnited States. Once jurisdictions notify DHS of arrested unlawful and \ncriminal aliens, it is crucial that they hold these aliens for transfer \nso that DHS can launch removal proceedings.\n  The Center for Immigration Studies has revealed that, in the first 8 \nmonths of 2014, sanctuary cities refused to comply with DHS detainers \nfor 8,145 aliens. After releasing these aliens, in only an 8-month \nperiod, 1,867 were arrested again for a criminal offense. Most \nrecently, San Francisco's refusal to honor a DHS detainer resulted in \nthe tragic death of Kathryn Steinle.\n  This is why it is so important that jurisdictions honor DHS \ndetainers. In fact, just this morning, we held a hearing in the \nJudiciary Committee where a representative from the Steinle family \ntestified.\n  The conclusion of the witnesses was that we need to make crystal \nclear that compliance with ICE detainers is mandatory; yet this \nadministration openly proclaims that detainers can be ignored and has \nchosen to dramatically scale back their issuance.\n  This administration has chosen to create enforcement-free zones for \nmillions of unlawful and criminal aliens. It has turned the U.S. into a \nsanctuary Nation. That is the current reality.\n  Despite DHS' pledge to prioritize the removal of serious criminal \naliens, in the last year, the number of administrative arrests by \ncriminal aliens has fallen by a third. U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement continues to release thousands of criminal aliens onto our \nstreets, 30,558 in 2014, of which another 1,423 have already been \nconvicted of new crimes.\n  There are almost 180,000 convicted criminal aliens currently in \nremoval proceedings living in our neighborhoods and almost 170,000 \nconvicted aliens who have been ordered removed from the country also \nstill living free and causing crimes on our streets.\n  Under the Obama administration, the total number of convicted \ncriminal aliens who are not being detained has jumped 28 percent since \n2012 to a total of nearly 350,000.\n\n[[Page H5441]]\n\n  We must prevent this or any other administration from being able to \nturn off the switch on immigration enforcement. Representative Gowdy, \nchairman of the Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee, has \noffered us a way forward to ensure enforcement of our immigration laws, \ndespite the purposeful inaction of any administration.\n  His legislation, the Michael Davis, Jr. and Danny Oliver in Honor of \nState and Local Law Enforcement Act, allows States and localities to \nenact and enforce immigration laws of their own, as long as they are \nconsistent with Federal law. Jurisdictions could proactively take \nresponsibility for protecting their communities and ensuring the \nintegrity of our immigration system.\n  Today, we are making an important down payment on protecting our \nconstituents, and I appreciate the majority leader's commitment to me \nthat we will take additional action to ensure compliance with our \nimmigration laws in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3009, the Enforce the Law for \nSanctuary Cities Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3009, the Enforce the Law for \nSanctuary Cities Act.\n  This thoroughly flawed measure is a blatant attempt by most of the \nmajority to insert its anti-immigrant status agenda into local policing \ninitiatives. It does this by prohibiting State and local governments \nfrom receiving critical criminal justice funds if they have policies \nthat prioritize public safety and community policing over Federal \nimmigration enforcement.\n  The bill absolutely makes no sense because, rather than improving \npublic safety, it will achieve the complete opposite; and that is not \njust my conclusion. Law enforcement agencies from across the United \nStates and numerous organizations--such as the Major County Sheriffs \nAssociation, the Fraternal Order of Police, the Law Enforcement \nImmigration Task Force, the United States Conference of Mayors, and the \nNational League of Cities--all oppose this bill.\n  In effect, this bill would punish law enforcement officers by \nwithholding the funds they need to do their jobs, and it would require \nStates and localities to prioritize Federal immigration enforcement \nahead of enhancing public safety.\n  Reactionary proposals such as this legislation will only make our \ncommunities less safe because immigrants will not report crimes or \notherwise cooperate with the police if they fear they or their family \nmembers may be asked for their immigration status. As a result, crimes \nwill go unsolved and unpunished while criminals are free to victimize \nmore people.\n  In addition, withholding crucial United States Department of Justice \nfunds from local communities will not lower crime. Studies have \ndemonstrated that these programs, particularly the COPS and Byrne JAG \nfunds, provide crucial support services to fight criminal activity, but \na vote for H.R. 3009 is a vote to take these funds away and to risk \nmaking communities less safe.\n  All of us, on both sides of the aisle, are opposed to violent crime. \nThere is simply no debate about that. Not one of us would condone what \nhappened to Kate Steinle in San Francisco, but H.R. 3009 is simply the \nwrong approach.\n  I agree with the Major Cities Chiefs Association that the best way to \nreduce crime in their cities is to gain the community's trust and \ncooperation. I also believe that the majority of immigrants in this \ncountry are hard-working, law-abiding residents; and comprehensive \nimmigration reform would allow these law-abiding individuals to come \nout of the shadows and get right with the law.\n  Such legislative reform would enable Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement to focus its limited resources on deporting the worst \nelements, while ensuring that our entire community, citizens and \nimmigrants alike, are protected from harm.\n  Instead of considering this commonsense solution, the majority--most \nof them--have repeatedly voted to deport DREAMers; to deport the \nparents of United States citizens; and to deport vulnerable children \nfrom fleeing persecution, violence, and trafficking.\n  Now, the majority, in the form of H.R. 3009, asks us to override the \npublic safety mission of State and local enforcement agencies to \nincrease deportations.\n  I strenuously urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous \nlegislation.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Hunter), the chief sponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, let me say to Chairman Goodlatte, thank \nyou very much for your leadership on this and thanks for moving this so \nquickly. This is a timely bill, and I just want to thank you and your \ncommittee for moving it so quick.\n  This legislation is about one thing. That is accountability. The \nAmerican people have the right to not give their Federal tax dollars to \nmunicipalities and States that do not follow Federal law.\n  There are lots of changes to enforcement that must be imposed on \nsanctuary cities, and we are going to work toward those things. This \nRepublican Congress is going to work toward those things, just as we \nare putting in motion a mechanism today that holds sanctuary cities \naccountable.\n  I think we can all agree that any locality must comply with the law, \nand they are required to coordinate and cooperate with the Federal \nGovernment. If an arrest is made, the Federal Government should be \nnotified.\n  The fact that San Francisco and L.A. and other cities disagree with \nthe politics of Federal enforcement does not give them a free pass to \nsubvert the law. If they do, there has to be consequences.\n  The way that we impose consequences on these sanctuary cities is by \nhitting them where it hurts, and that is in their pocketbook. It is \nsimple.\n  If you don't comply with the law as it stands now, then you don't \nreceive coveted Federal money intended for law enforcement. And that \nmoney allocated for fiscal year 2015 alone almost adds up to a billion \ndollars.\n  $800 million are going to municipalities, cities, counties, and \nStates that care more about illegal alien criminals, felons, than they \ndo their own citizens. It is time we stand up to sanctuary cities and \nbegin holding them accountable for their failure to uphold the law.\n  I come as a representative that has sanctuary cities in my district. \nThey are going to lose money for this. They are going to lose money \nbecause they are not complying with Federal law.\n  This Federal money that they get is taxpayer money from States like \nWisconsin, from New York, from South Carolina, from Florida, and \nthroughout the entire country. People around this country don't want \ntheir money going to States and cities that don't care to follow the \nFederal law.\n  Again, if you are a State, city, or locality and you choose to defy \nFederal immigration law, you will be cut off from three Federal \nprograms: the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, the Community-\nOriented Policing Services program, and the Byrne JAG program.\n  These are the three funds that will get cut if you are a sanctuary \ncity. All you have to do to receive these funds is comply with the \nFederal law.\n  This bill is just the first step in restoring accountability in our \nimmigration system. Our border infrastructure continues to fall short \nin too many places, and I am as frustrated as anyone in this Congress \nthat the administration refuses to enforce Federal immigration law.\n  These are all serious issues that need to be addressed, and I look \nforward to working with this Congress and Chairman Goodlatte in the \nfuture to advance these goals.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3009.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Zoe Lofgren).\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, we have an immigration system that is \nbadly broken. There are 11 million undocumented people in this country. \nContrary to what Donald Trump may think, the majority of these people \nare not rapists.\n\n[[Page H5442]]\n\n  They are hard-working people, spouses and parents of U.S. citizens, \nDREAMers, entrepreneurs who want an opportunity to come forward, submit \nto background checks, and become fully American.\n  Faced with a broken system, State and local law enforcement have \nadopted policies to enhance public safety and maintain community trust.\n  Because when people are afraid of the police, when they are afraid \nthat the police might ask them or their family about their immigration \nstatus, they are afraid to report crimes, unlikely to cooperate with \ninvestigations, and then criminals thrive and the general public \nsuffers.\n  This bill puts an impossible choice between State and local law \nenforcement agencies. They can either abandon policies that work or \nthey can lose the Federal funds they rely on to police their \ncommunities and protect them.\n  The dangers posed by this bill are real. 144 national, State, and \nlocal advocacy organizations have written opposing this bill because of \nthe detrimental impact it would have on public safety, big cities, but \nalso little ones like Dayton, Ohio, a place that most people don't \nthink of as a sanctuary city.\n  In Dayton, police officers are told not to check immigration status \nof witnesses and victims, nor to ask about immigration during minor \ntraffic stops.\n  The police chief there has explained that this policy has helped them \nhave a safer community. According to the chief, after the policy was \nadopted, serious violent crime dropped nearly 22 percent and serious \nproperty crime decreased almost 15 percent.\n  Madam Speaker, why should Dayton, Ohio, be barred from receiving \nfunds for policing when their policies work?\n  Now, punishing the law enforcement officers by withholding the funds \nthey need is not only incorrect, it is why the bill is opposed to by \nthe Major County Sheriffs' Associations, the Fraternal Order of Police, \ndozens of sheriffs and police chiefs.\n  The President has said we should deport felons, not families, and \nthat is what his priority enforcement program does.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security told the Judiciary Committee just \nlast week that withholding funds from communities would be a huge \nsetback in efforts to improve the relationship between DHS, State, and \nlocal law enforcement in communities across the country.\n  It has been said that this bill is a response to the tragic murder of \nKathryn Steinle in San Francisco, just up the road from my district.\n  However, nothing in this bill would have prevented that outrageous \nmurder of Ms. Steinle. Nothing in the bill would have required the \nBureau of Prisons and ICE to consult with San Francisco, to ascertain \nwhether or not the 20-year-old warrant would lead to a prosecution.\n  Nothing in this bill would have required ICE to obtain a warrant, as \nis necessary to hold people beyond the term of their criminal sentence.\n  Nothing in the bill would even have affected the sheriff of San \nFrancisco's decision to release the individual charged with murdering \nMs. Steinle.\n  So that tragedy should not be used to advance a different agenda, \nthis bill.\n  Over the last year we have come to the floor to vote on bills to \ndeport the DREAM Act kids, to deport the parents of U.S. citizens, to \ndeport vulnerable children fleeing persecution and sex trafficking.\n  Today we are asked to vote on a bill that overrides the public safety \nmission of State and local law enforcement agencies and to increase \ndeportations all around.\n\n  We had the votes to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the last \nCongress, and I hope we can get back to that point.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. CONYERS. I yield 15 seconds to the gentlewoman.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I would note that we have an opportunity \nhere to learn from the tragedy in San Francisco to come up with real \nsolutions that would make our community safer instead of using that \ntragedy as an excuse to promote a different agenda.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to make very \nclear nothing in this bill requires any officer of the law to ask any \nquestion of any victims of crime about their immigration status.\n  All it does is prohibit cities and counties from ordering their \nofficers to not communicate with ICE or gather information from ICE \nabout the status of individuals. This is a good bill.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), the former \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee and the current chairman of the \nScience Committee.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, first of all, let me thank the \ngentleman from Virginia and a good friend and the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee for yielding me time.\n  Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 3009, the Enforce the Law for Sanctuary \nCity Act. The bill is appropriately named, since sanctuary cities \nviolate current laws that require these jurisdictions to share \ninformation with Federal authorities about illegal immigrants who have \nbeen arrested.\n  H.R. 3009 helps enforce an immigration bill I introduced several \nyears ago that became law. This legislation withholds certain Federal \nfunds from sanctuary jurisdictions that hide the immigration status of \nillegal immigrants charged with crimes. These reforms serve as a first \nstep in keeping dangerous criminals off our streets and out of our \nneighborhoods.\n  Sanctuary cities have increased under this administration, which has \ndone nothing to discourage them.\n  During only an 8-month period last year, sanctuary cities released \nalmost 9,000 illegal immigrants charged with or convicted of serious \ncrimes. One-quarter have already been arrested again for committing \nmore crimes, like murder and sexual assault. When does it end?\n  I don't understand how anyone could oppose enforcing immigration \nlaws. The victims are not Democrats or Republicans. The victims are \ninnocent Americans.\n  Many of the crimes committed by illegal immigrants could have been \nprevented if the Obama administration had enforced immigration laws. \nInstead, it has chosen to ignore them and innocent Americans continue \nto pay a steep price.\n  I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) for authorizing \nthis legislation, and I urge its approval.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Nadler), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3009, \nwhich would make communities across the country less safe from crime.\n  This legislation would withhold needed Federal funding from cities \nthat prohibit their law enforcement authorities from collecting \ninformation on a person's immigration status or that have policies \nrestricting the disclosure of this information to other governmental \nentities.\n  Many cities, including New York, have made the reasonable \ndetermination that they will not question victims of crime or witnesses \nto a crime about their immigration status. They believe it is \ncounterproductive to make them afraid to cooperate with law \nenforcement.\n  But this bill says that we in Congress know better, and, in the name \nof protecting public safety, we will deny such cities the funds that \nthey need to protect the public safety.\n  Many cities think that their communities are safer when a victim of \ndomestic violence feels comfortable asking the police for protection \nfrom their abuser without fear of deportation.\n  They believe that witnesses to a murder ought to step forward and \nassist law enforcement in tracking down the perpetrator without fear \nthat they will face consequences of their own if they step forward.\n  They think that good policing depends on building trust with their \nresidents and that striking fear among immigrants that they may be \ndeported if they report a crime makes everyone less safe.\n  Punishing residents of cities whose officials have made such \ndecisions is both unfair and unwise. New York City alone could lose $57 \nmillion under this legislation.\n  This would not only punish the public officials who set these \npolicies and the undocumented residents in their\n\n[[Page H5443]]\n\ncommunities, but it would punish all innocent people who depend on \nthese Federal resources to protect public safety.\n  My heart is with the Steinle family, and we all share their outrage \nat Kate's senseless murder. But this bill and other attempts to punish \nso-called sanctuary cities would do nothing to address the issues that \nmight have prevented her death.\n  Instead of taking positive steps to improve communication between \nFederal, State, and local authorities, this bill simply demonizes \nimmigrants and perpetuates the myth that they are more prone to commit \na crime than is the native-born population.\n  This legislation might fit comfortably in Donald Trump's campaign \nplatform, but it has no business on the House floor.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. CONYERS. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. NADLER. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I just want to make clear that the \ngentleman from Virginia, the chairman of the committee, is wrong about \nthis bill. He says it only prohibits States and localities from \nadopting policies about not communicating with ICE. This is not true.\n  The bill also prohibits State and local law enforcement agencies from \nadopting policies directing their officers not to collect information \nabout immigration status for the general public.\n  Any individual, the bill says. So it doesn't state that State and \nlocal police must gather immigration status information for the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to say again, \nnothing in the bill requires any officer to ask any question of any \nvictim of crimes about their immigration status. All it does is \nprohibit cities and counties from ordering their officers to not \ncommunicate with ICE or to gather the information status of \nindividuals.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), a member of \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I appreciate this bill coming to the \nfloor.\n  I hear this discussion, and it seems to me there is a consistent \ntheme that the people on the other side of the aisle are opposed to \nbringing leverage to political subdivisions to bring about law \nenforcement. They assert that nothing in this bill could have prevented \nthe tragic murder of Kate Steinle.\n  I would suggest that if we had no sanctuary jurisdictions in America, \nthere is a lot greater chance that his deportation would have stuck; \nand if we had a President of the United States who worked to get our \nlaw enforcement officers to coordinate at each level of our political \nsubdivisions rather than litigate when they do mirror Federal law, \nlikely we would have had a chance to prevent not only her tragic death \nbut that of thousands and thousands of others.\n  I support this bill. It is encompassed within an amendment that I \nbrought to the floor here on June 3 that passed with 227 votes. I \ncongratulate Duncan Hunter for his persistence on this legislation that \nis 6 years long. I am grateful to be working on an immigration issue \nwith the second generation of Hunters.\n  I see there is much more enforcement that is ahead of us, but this is \na step, and it is a step that helps us find out are people for a thread \nof enforcement and bringing some leverage to try to bring the political \nsubdivisions in line rather than having them flout the law, which they \nhave consistently done, and it has grown dramatically under the Obama \nadministration.\n  I would add that there is much more that I would like to do, much \nmore to do. I would like to move Kate's Law. Matt Salmon has brought \nsome of that. I would like to make it incremental so it goes from a 5-\nyear mandatory to a 10-year mandatory on second offense and move it up \nthe line. I would like to make E-Verify mandatory. I would like to pass \nthe New IDEA Act so the IRS can help enforce this. I would like to \nbuild a fence, a wall, and a fence, Madam Speaker, and I would like to \nrepass the border bill that we did last summer. There are a number of \ngood things.\n  By the way, we need to make detainers mandatory, and we need to \ntighten up the loophole language. All of that we have a chance to do \nafter Labor Day. Today we need to do what we can do, and that is pass \nthis bill.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Price).\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to \nthis misguided legislation offered under the false pretense that it has \nsomething to do with the tragic murder of Kathryn Steinle in San \nFrancisco. Make no mistake, Miss Steinle's killer should not have been \non the streets. We must get to the bottom of the official misjudgment \nand negligence and the bureaucratic breakdown that led to this tragedy.\n  As the former chairman of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security of \nthe Committee on Appropriations, I take a backseat to no one when it \ncomes to deporting dangerous criminal aliens who pose a threat to \npublic safety. But we also need to be very clear about this: this \ntragedy has nothing to do with so-called sanctuary cities.\n  The bill before us would punish some of the most vulnerable cities \nhigh on the UASI list--places like San Francisco, New York, Miami, \nChicago--punish them for exercising their lawful discretion in dealing \nwith noncriminals or those with minor violations. They do this in order \nto protect the public and enforce the law, which requires trust and \ncooperation with immigrant communities. To scapegoat entire cities and \nmake law enforcement less effective through this bill is simply \ninexcusable.\n  I urge its defeat.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to say to the \ngentleman from North Carolina, this bill has everything to do with what \nhappened in San Francisco. The tragic murder of Kate Steinle was \nbecause the city of San Francisco was not following the law and \ncontacting the immigration service and doing things to make sure that \nhe was deported. Instead, they released him back onto their streets.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill, in \nsupport of American families.\n  This week, we have heard powerful and heartbreaking stories from \nfamilies who have lost a loved one at the hands of an illegal \nimmigrant. Oftentimes, these individuals were able to operate freely \nbecause of the sanctuary policies of certain U.S. cities, policies that \nignore Federal immigration law.\n  It is time this Congress put the lives and welfare of American \ncitizens and legal residents first. It is time to protect the innocent. \nThis means not another Kate, Josh, Dennis, Danny, Grant, and countless \nothers. It is time to penalize cities that willfully ignore Federal law \nto the detriment of citizens and legal residents.\n  I encourage my fellow Members to read the testimony from this week's \nSenate hearing. Read about the lives lost, the brutality of the crimes, \nthe lack of remorse by the perpetrators, and the heartbreak of the \nfamilies. Today we have a choice: protect fellow Americans or give \nsanctuary to criminal aliens.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez), an excellent member of the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Madam Speaker, just a few weeks into his campaign and \nDonald Trump has a bill on the floor of the House. That is better than \nsome of the Senators he is running against. Donald Trump announces his \ncampaign, saying Mexican immigrants are mostly murderers, drug dealers, \nand rapists. What is the response from the Republican Party? Do they \ndenounce him? No, they only denounce people when they go after war \nheroes who ran for President. I denounce him for that, too.\n  Some tried to distance themselves from his comments. Okay. But here \nwe are on the floor of the House passing a bill to jump on the Trump \nbandwagon, cynically exploiting a family's tragedy in San Francisco to \nscore political points.\n\n[[Page H5444]]\n\n  I have been very clear from day one, despite efforts to spear me by \nhard-line advocates, that the person, this Lopez-Sanchez, who pulled \nthe trigger in San Francisco should have been deported and never turned \nover. I have no sympathy for him. I have said it on this floor, and I \nwill say it again today: murderers should rot in hell.\n  The breakdown by the Federal Government--the Federal Government--to \ndeport a known criminal, as they have done before, to keep them in \njail, is what led to an American woman losing her life. She was just \nabout the age of my daughters when she was killed. A tragedy, and a \npreventable tragedy, if the Federal Government had done what it is \nsupposed to do, and preventable if this Congress had done what it was \nsupposed to do and address immigration years ago, as my side of the \naisle has been pleading for you to do.\n\n  But this Republican proposal is not a serious attempt at fixing the \nproblem. Instead of piecemeal measures aimed at maximizing deportation, \nthe long overdue solution is for Congress to enact comprehensive \nimmigration reform that combines smart enforcement at the border and in \nthe interior with a clear plan for reducing the size of the \nundocumented population in America.\n  We do this by having a modern visa system so people can come with \nvisas and background checks, not with smugglers or overstaying visas \nand just blending in. We do this by telling millions of people who have \nnever committed crimes: Come forward; admit you are here illegally; go \nthrough a background check; and work your way to the right side of the \nlaw. Get the millions of immigrants inside the system and on the books \nso they no longer need to worry about their local police working with \nor without the deportation system.\n  If you get millions and millions of immigrants inside the law, then \nthe ones who are criminals can't qualify to get inside the law. They \nwill stick out like sore thumbs, not blend in to our communities across \nAmerica and cause havoc, as they did in San Francisco.\n  But this is very specifically the approach the Republican majority \nrefused to touch with a 10-foot pole because they see demagogues like \nDonald Trump.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the \ngentleman.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. But this approach of bringing millions and millions of \nimmigrants inside the law so that we can get after the criminals that \nstick out like sore thumbs outside of the law, this approach is what \nhas been the approach that the Republican majority refuses to touch \nwith a 10-foot pole because they see demagogues like Donald Trump \nfiring up frustrated voters and want to take the easy way out.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Salmon).\n  Mr. SALMON. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague Duncan \nHunter for working with me in crafting this important piece of \nlegislation. As the coauthor of this bill, I am very proud to see the \nHouse taking action on this front. I also want to thank leadership for \nbringing this bill to the floor.\n  We are hearing some strange rhetoric here today, especially from the \nother side of the aisle. I hear about vulnerable cities. How about \nvulnerable taxpaying Americans? I hear about sanctuary for thugs like \nthe one that killed Kate Steinle. Shouldn't our cities be a sanctuary \nfor law-abiding American citizens who have a right to walk on safe \nstreets?\n  Make no mistake, this is a very, very important bill. From 2010 to \n2014, the number 121 should stick in everybody's minds; 121 illegal \nimmigrants with lengthy criminal records went on to commit murder after \nthey were let out to do their heinous crimes.\n  That is why I was so appalled to hear one of my colleagues from \nacross the aisle call the murder of American citizens like Kate Steinle \nand my constituent, Grant Ronnebeck, a little thing. Such disgusting \nremarks and flagrant disregard for life, especially the lives of those \nthat we claim to represent, I find repulsive. In fact, such callous \nremarks only serve to highlight the fact that it is time for the \nmajority of Americans who want to see government fulfill its most basic \nconstitutional duties, protecting its borders and its citizens, stand \nup and take America back. It is time to stand up and be heard and \ndemand that our government fulfill these most basic duties.\n  These sanctuary cities that refuse to uphold the law and openly \nbroadcast the fact that they are flouting the law make our country less \nsafe and only serve to perpetuate tragedies like the one that we saw in \nSan Francisco. Not only are these supposed sanctuary cities ignoring \nthe law, but they are broadcasting the fact to illegal immigrant felons \nlike Kate Steinle's murderer, a seven-time felon who flat out admitted \none of the reasons that he chose to stay in San Francisco--in fact, the \npredominant reason he chose to stay--was because he knew that they \nwould protect him.\n  Well, who is going to protect law-abiding Americans? When will \nAmerican cities be sanctuaries for Americans and not for illegal \nfelons?\n  Unfortunately, these sanctuary cities are not being held accountable \nby this administration, which has demonstrated time and time again it \nhas no interest in securing the border or upholding existing \nimmigration law. With this in mind, I think that we have a \nresponsibility to stand up and do what is right. This sanctuary cities \npolicy and fixing it so that they have to abide by the laws that we \npass here in Congress to protect our borders and protect our citizens \nhas to be adhered to. It is just common sense.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to \nRepresentative Lofgren and ask unanimous consent that she be permitted \nto control the time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. O'Rourke).\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Madam Speaker, I would like to bring the perspective of \nmy community, the community I have the honor of representing in \nCongress, El Paso, Texas, to bear in this discussion.\n  El Paso is the safest community with an over 500,000 population in \nthe United States today, and it has been for the last 4 years in a row. \nThat is, some people think, despite the fact that it is connected to \nCiudad Juarez at the U.S.-Mexico border and despite the fact that it \nhas a large number of immigrants in the community. I say, and the \npeople who live in that community agree with me, that it is, in large \npart, because of immigrants who come to participate and contribute to \nthe American Dream.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  On issues and matters of law enforcement, I tend to defer to the \nexperts. Big city police chiefs and county sheriffs, like the sheriff \nin El Paso, Texas, say for them to prevent crime and solve crimes, it \nis necessary to be able to work with everyone in the community without \nfear that they are going to be enforcing Federal law enforcement \nmandates to the exclusion of the public safety of the people that I \nhave the honor of representing.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against \nthis proposal, a solution in search of a problem.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to say, yet \nagain, nothing in this bill requires any officer to ask any question of \nany victims of crime about their immigration status. All it does is \nprohibit cities and counties from ordering their officers not to \ncommunicate with ICE or to gather information status about individuals.\n  It is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for \nso consistently working on this issue of how we deal with the criminal \nillegal alien population and also with the sanctuary cities.\n  I thank Mr. Hunter for the work that he has done on this bill. I \nchuckled when Congressman King and the gentleman from Iowa mentioned \nthe second generation of Hunters because, yes, we do know that his \nfather was very involved in this issue and focusing on making certain \nthat we keep our cities safe.\n\n[[Page H5445]]\n\n  As we have this debate and as we look at these sanctuary city \npolicies that certain counties and cities and State have exercised, we \nhave come to realize that through the years, every State has become a \nborder State and every town a border town because of the criminal \nillegal alien population that will gravitate to these sanctuary cities.\n  Los Angeles was the first sanctuary city in 1979. We hear people say, \nOh, this is an issue that has been around for a long time. Mr. Speaker, \nthat does not mean you do not address the issue. It means you solve the \nproblem; you bring forward solutions, and that is what we are doing \nhere today.\n  The U.S. Sentencing Commission recently released some data that I \nthink is instructive to this debate. Illegal aliens accounted for \nalmost 75 percent of Federal sentencing for drug possession and made up \nmore than a third of all Federal sentences in 2014. That is why we are \ndealing with this issue.\n  Our constituents are saying, You need to put this on a front burner \nand deal with this issue. That is what we are doing here. Look at the \nState of Texas. I just recently read the stats from them.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Byrne). The time of the gentlewoman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nTennessee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. In Texas, the department of public safety released a \nreport that, between 2008 and 2014, foreign aliens committed over \n600,000 crimes and almost 3,000 murders in the State of Texas. That is \nthe reason that we come here to address this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, the crime rate for illegal aliens in this country should \nbe zero. It should be zero because it should not be tolerated.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Becerra).\n  Mr. BECERRA. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  The man who killed Kathryn Steinle should be punished to the fullest \nextent of the law. Perhaps more importantly, the officials who released \nthe person who killed her--released this man from custody--dropped the \nball, they should be held accountable.\n  This bill punishes the police in my city of Los Angeles, the police \nin the city of Knoxville, and the police in Manchester, New Hampshire. \nIt punishes police that had nothing to do with the crime that occurred \nin San Francisco. It takes away money from the police departments in \nLos Angeles, in Knoxville, and Manchester, when we need to put people \nand police on the street to protect all of us.\n  This would deprive our cities of monies we have earned because we \npaid our taxes. Why? It is because the proponents of this bill say that \nour cities are violating the law. If we are violating the law, name the \nlaw we are violating. We are not violating any law. You just don't like \nthe policy.\n  Don't take the Donald Trump bait. Don't punish others for the crimes \nof someone else. In our country, you go after the person who is \ncriminally liable; you go after that individual and lock them up \nforever, but don't tell the police in Los Angeles, Manchester, or in \nKnoxville, Tennessee, or other cities that are trying to have a working \nrelationship between their police and growing immigrant communities \nthat they won't be able to collaborate so we can go after the \ncriminals--because that is what you are doing.\n  You are taking money away from L.A., even though this crime did not \nhappen in my city, and you are telling my police department and the men \nand women in uniform in L.A. that they will have fewer officers by \ntheir side because you are going to take money away because you don't \nlike that some guy committed a criminal act. He killed someone; he \nshould be punished for it, but we had nothing to do with it. Go after \nthe folks that are accountable.\n  This is not the way we do justice in America, and it is wrong. It is \nwrong for you to tell all these communities who have a working \nrelationship between their police officers and their growing immigrant \ncommunities that they are now going to lose funds to hire more police \nofficers. That is the wrong way to do it.\n  That is the Donald Trump bait. Don't take it. Let's vote this down.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded that their remarks must \nbe directed to the Chair.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond to \nthe gentleman from California to tell him that the law that sanctuary \ncities are violating is title 8, section 1373 of the United States \nCode, communication between government agencies and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service.\n  The failure to do that has resulted in 8,000 criminal aliens being \nreleased onto our streets just last year by sanctuary cities. Those \n8,000 criminal aliens have since then already committed nearly 1,900 \nadditional crimes. This is about not just San Francisco, but other \nStates as well.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold).\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Enforce \nthe Law for Sanctuary Cities Act because we have got to stop the \nmadness of not enforcing our laws.\n  In the last weeks, we have seen coverage of two terrible murders that \noccurred because our laws went unenforced. My thoughts, prayers, and \ncondolences go out to the families of the victims. Sadly, these \ntragedies are but a representation of a larger, deeper, and more \ntroubling problem.\n  While I wish today we were also considering legislation by Mr. Gowdy \nto address the administration's abysmal lack of respect for our \nimmigration laws, Chairman McCaul's bill to secure the borders, or \nChairman Lamar Smith's bill to implement E-Verify to stop businesses \nfrom exploiting undocumented workers, this bill is a step in the right \ndirection. It will stop the American people from subsidizing local law \nenforcement departments that refuse to do their jobs and enforce the \nlaw.\n\n  Let's take the emotion out of this. Let's take it out of the \nimmigration and border security issue, which are emotionally charged. \nThis is a fiscally responsible bill. If we were spending money for a \ndefense contractor to develop a new weapons system and they weren't \ndeveloping that weapons system, we would take the money back.\n  Well, here we are, giving money to law enforcement to work with ICE \nto deal with criminal aliens, and they are not doing it. Of course, we \nhave got to take the money back. It would be foolish to do anything \nelse.\n  Mr. Speaker, this horrible loss of life that we have seen is a result \nof the negligence and complete lack of respect for the rule of law that \nthis administration and the mayors of sanctuary cities took an oath to \nuphold. It is appalling. Today, we are going to be able to deal with \none part of that problem, and I am going to encourage all of my \ncolleagues to vote with me to support H.R. 3009 and put our Nation back \non the path to sanity.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 9\\3/4\\ \nremaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, we have only one additional speaker, and \nI reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Community trust policies result in more efficient policing. When \nState and local law enforcement agencies promote community trust \npolicies, public safety is increased.\n  The current New York police commissioner and former chief of police \nin Los Angeles, William Bratton, said: ``When officers can speak freely \nwith victims and witnesses, it goes a long way towards making every \nAmerican neighborhood much safer.''\n  Here is a case study in New Haven, Connecticut. According to a 2010 \nreport by the Police Executive Research Forum, New Haven, Connecticut, \ndeveloped a community trust policy in which New Haven police assured \nimmigrant communities that the police department's goals were to \naddress crime and to make the streets safer.\n  They encouraged people to report crime and to cooperate, regardless \nof their immigration status. The city law prohibited immigration status \ninquiries of crime victims, witnesses, or others who approached police \nfor assistance.\n\n[[Page H5446]]\n\n  I would note that the bill before us would prohibit this policy, this \nlaw that New Haven adopted. The result of New Haven's policy and their \nother community trust policies were stronger ties between law \nenforcement and the immigrant community. Over the next several years, \nNew Haven experienced a 46 percent decrease in murders and a 13 percent \ndecrease in rape incidences. This policy, which this bill would \nprohibit, worked.\n  This was a very important result. After learning of it, the United \nStates Conference of Mayors, a group that most of us trust pretty much, \ndid a survey of cities around the United States who adopted the same \ntrust policies.\n  They include Alameda, California; Augusta, Georgia; New Brunswick, \nNew Jersey; and a whole host of others. They found that all of these \ncities also reported the same kind of reduction in crime after they \nadopted these policies. Adopting these policies is an important \ncomponent of keeping communities safe, and this bill would prohibit \nthat. It would prohibit it.\n  Now, I understand the outrage over Mr. Lopez-Sanchez. In fact, I \nshare it. Obviously, he has been accused of murder. Even when we have a \nsituation like this, we have to have a trial, but I believe personally \nthat he is guilty, based on all the evidence.\n  I believe he should not have been out on that street in San \nFrancisco. If you look at his record--and I will go through it a little \nbit--it actually makes certain points. I have heard people say, Well, \nwe have got open borders, and that is why he was here.\n  In fact, that is not the case. This individual attempted to enter the \nUnited States repeatedly, and he was caught by the Border Patrol, just \nas they are supposed to do their job.\n  What happened then is he was deported repeatedly in the nineties, and \nthen they started prosecuting him for felony reentry after removal. He \nserved 16 years in Federal prison for the felony of reentering after \nremoval.\n  Our laws went after him. He should not have been released in San \nFrancisco, but I think some of what we need to do is see what policies \nwould have kept him off that street, and I will deal with those later.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Becerra).\n  Mr. BECERRA. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  I took a look at the statute, the code section that the chairman \ncited as the authority that a law has been violated by San Francisco.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend.\n  The gentleman will direct his remarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. BECERRA. Mr. Speaker, I will direct my remarks to the Chair.\n  May I ask, Mr. Speaker, if any of my time has been consumed as a \nresult of the Chair's interruptions of my remarks?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It has not.\n  Mr. BECERRA. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the committee made a statement that the \nlaw that had been violated by San Francisco, and the law that would be \nviolated by places like Los Angeles that would cause this legislation \nto have my community of Los Angeles lose money for its police officers \nwas a particular section in the code.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  I have read the code. I am looking it up right now. That section \nrelates to information being provided about the immigration status of \nan individual. We are not talking about the immigration status of an \nindividual. We all knew that this individual was not documented. We \nknew his status. The information that was not conveyed in this \nparticular case is that the individual is going to be released from \ncustody. This bill doesn't change that.\n  There was no law violated by the city of San Francisco. Certainly, my \ncity of Los Angeles didn't violate any law. The city of Knoxville, \nTennessee, didn't violate any law. The city of Manchester, New \nHampshire didn't violate any law. And I could name to you any number of \nother cities and towns in America who are trying to establish working \nrelationships with their immigrant community who did not violate any \nlaw. But this bill would punish all those cities and towns simply \nbecause this legislation wishes to extract punishment for any city that \nhas established a policy working with its immigrant community.\n  There is no State or city law in America that supersedes Federal law. \nFederal law is the law of the land. The chairman knows that. We all \nknow that. And so, to pretend that somehow cities are violating Federal \nlaw is a farce. It is the sort of attack that Donald Trump is using \nright now as he goes out and campaigns for President.\n  We should not fall for that, and we should not deny our police \ndepartments funding because of a policy that some people don't like.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just want to close by posing some of the questions that this bill \ndoes not deal with and that I think should command our attention.\n  In this case, we had an individual who had a criminal record. He had \nattempted to enter the United States, was apprehended, deported, was \nprosecuted and convicted for illegal entry after removal. After serving \nover 4 years for the last felony prosecution, he was ready to be \ndeported, but they found, even though he had been deported many times \nbefore with an outstanding bench warrant from 1995 where the underlying \noffense was marijuana possession, all of a sudden, this year, he was \nsent to San Francisco.\n  I think one of the questions we need to ask is: What is the process \nof outstanding warrants and its interface with the Bureau of Prisons \nwhen someone really should be deported?\n  Apparently, there was no communication between the Federal Government \nand the prosecuting attorney in San Francisco. He was sent to, \napparently, San Francisco, but the district attorney did not see this \nmatter until he was already in custody.\n  Now, I don't fault the district attorney for not prosecuting on a 20-\nyear-old marijuana possession case. Where would you find the witnesses? \nAnd, in fact, in California today, marijuana possession is an \ninfraction, not a misdemeanor. But the point is he should never have \nbeen in San Francisco to begin with.\n  So I think we need to take a look at the processes that we have to \nmake sure that we don't have this kind of situation again. Clearly, he \nshould not have been released when the district attorney declined to \nprosecute.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to my colleague from California (Mr. \nFarr).\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I represent many small communities in \nCalifornia that have a lot of gang violence. It is mostly Hispanic \nyoung men against Hispanic young men. They are not undocumented. They \nare actually second-generation gangs, a lot of killings. In fact, it is \nlabeled the murder capital of the world, or in the United States.\n  What the community has been trying to do is work out what we call \ncommunity policing, where you really trust the cops. What happens is \nthey asked them to be a sanctuary city, because what the local cops \ndidn't like about the INS and la migra coming in is that they would \njust come in and do raids and they would round up innocent people, and \nthere was just lots of confusion. Our office would get involved trying \nto trace people down, where are they, and all these things.\n  What the sanctuary city says is, look, let's not just turn over the \nname to everybody we stop on an infraction to the Federal cop. Let them \ncome down and do what they call jail checks. Well, they don't want to \ndo jail checks. That is not fun and fancy.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. FARR. The problem is that this community policing, the problem is \nthis bill just busts all that, all the trust that has been built.\n  As Congresswoman Lofgren said, the San Francisco deal was a big \nscrewup between law enforcement. But don't penalize all these other \ncities that are doing a lot of wonderful things to do community \npolicing and lead to confidence in law enforcement, not disconfidence.\n  You are going to create more problems than you ever imagined, like \npeople not wanting to report crimes, not wanting to talk to cops, and \nyou are just using the heavy hand of government to bust good community \nrelations.\n\n[[Page H5447]]\n\n  I just think this is the wrong way to do it. Let's let this thing air \nout and address the problems that Congresswoman Lofgren talked about \nand not adopt this bill.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to respond to \nboth gentlemen from California.\n  First, with regard to Mr. Becerra, the fact of the matter is that \ntitle 8 of the United States Code, section 1373, related to \ncommunication between government agencies and Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, is an important statute, and sanctuary cities \nviolate that statute when they pass ordinances that prohibit--\nprohibit--their law enforcement officers from communicating with the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service.\n  This yields situations like what occurred in San Francisco, because \nthe sheriff there has a policy saying they could not communicate with \nthe INS. Already, one San Francisco supervisor has called upon the city \nto change the policy so that they will communicate.\n  This bill, which cuts off funds to cities that have provisions that \ncontradict and violate the United States law does the same thing by a \ndifferent route, and it will save many lives in the future if local law \nenforcement will communicate with the INS.\n  Now, to the gentleman from California (Mr. Farr), I just want to \nrepeat again what I have said several times here.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield myself an additional 15 seconds.\n  There is nothing in this bill that requires any officer to ask any \nquestion of any victims of crimes about their immigration status or to \nreveal that information to the INS.\n  So I would urge folks to look at what this bill, very \nstraightforward, simple bill says. Federal law governs immigration \npolicy, and local governments shouldn't have hundreds of different \nimmigration policies of their own.\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I \nwould just close by saying that we have been asked by law enforcement \nagencies, by domestic violence advocacy groups, by the faith community \nnot to adopt this bill. I know we can come together to make a safer \ncommunity. This bill is not the answer, and I urge Members to vote \n``no.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 6\\1/4\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Gowdy), the chairman of the \nImmigration and Border Security Subcommittee, to close our debate.\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Goodlatte for his \nleadership on this and so many other issues of significance on the \nJudiciary Committee. His steady hand and brilliant legal mind are \nwithout equal on our committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank the family of Kate Steinle for the \ngrace that they have shown during this time of unspeakable grief.\n  Burying a child, Mr. Speaker, is what each of us who has ever been \ncalled Mom or Dad fears the most. After Trayvon Martin was killed, the \nPresident said, ``That could have been my son,'' Mr. Speaker.\n  And when I see a picture of a beautiful Kate Steinle smiling, that \ncould have been any of our daughters. And it still can be, because what \nhappened to her, Mr. Speaker, can and will happen again if we do not \nget serious about enforcing the law.\n  Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, Mr. Speaker, had a quarter century's \nworth of lawlessness. Dating back to 1991, he committed local, State, \nand Federal crimes in five separate States, I hasten to add, Mr. \nSpeaker. He was deported five times, and each time had so little regard \nfor the law of this country that he reentered that border that we are \nsupposed to have functional control over.\n  His procedural history, Mr. Speaker, is every bit as disturbing. In \nMay of 2011, this defendant was convicted and sentenced to 46 months \nimprisonment for illegal reentry again. At the conclusion of that \nsentence, he was released from the Bureau of Prisons to a known \nsanctuary jurisdiction for the ostensible prosecution of an old drug \ncase.\n  Of course, Mr. Speaker, San Francisco did not prosecute that old drug \ncase. They dismissed it, which surprises exactly no one, and then they \nreleased this defendant.\n  They did not return him to the Bureau of Prisons. They did not return \nhim to Federal probation. They did not honor the detainer that had been \nplaced by ICE. They released him, who was not supposed to be in the \ncountry in the first place, with this horrific criminal history. They \nreleased him so he would be free to walk around and shoot someone's \ndaughter, which is exactly what he did.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are given a litany of excuses. I have heard them this \nmorning, Mr. Speaker, for policies like this. We are told that we need \npolicies like the one in San Francisco so people will cooperate with \nlaw enforcement.\n  I want you, Mr. Speaker, to consider just how utterly illogical that \ncomment is. We need to release known criminals back into society so \nsociety will help us catch known criminals. How absurd is that, that we \nare going to release people that should be deported, that are \nrecidivist felons, so other people will help us catch those who should \nbe deported and are recidivist felons?\n  For almost 5 years, Mr. Speaker, I have worked alongside Chairman \nGoodlatte, and I have heard a litany of phrases, with almost catatonic \nfrequency, as if repeating something enough will make it true--phrases, \nMr. Speaker, like ``functional control over the border''--but I have \nyet to hear how somebody can reenter five times if you have functional \ncontrol over the border.\n  I have heard we need citizenship for 11 million undocumented aspiring \nAmericans, as if 11 million of any category can pass a background \ncheck.\n  I have heard arguments against empowering State and local law \nenforcement to assist in the enforcement of our immigration laws, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  Now, stop and think. We trust them to do murder cases, sex assault \ncases, kidnapping cases, narcotics trafficking. You even trust them to \nprovide security, Mr. Speaker, at their own functions back in the \ndistrict. But when it comes to immigration law, oh, no. No, sir. We \ndon't trust you to enforce immigration law. Everything else, including \nour own security both here in Washington and back in the district, but \nGod forbid we trust State and local cops to help us with immigration \nlaw.\n  The President says we need immigration reform so folks will, to use \nhis words, Mr. Speaker, come forward, get on the books, get right with \nthe law.\n  I want you to ask yourself, what in Mr. Lopez-Sanchez' background \nmakes you think he would ever come forward? And why in the hell does he \nneed to be on the books? He is in the Bureau of Prisons. You don't need \nhim on the books. He is in the Bureau of Prisons. And you had him, and \nyou let him go.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Which brings me to my favorite phrase, Mr. Speaker, ``sanctuary \ncities.'' It has almost a Utopian sound to it, doesn't it?\n  Well, as the Speaker knows, the definition of a ``sanctuary'' is a \nplace of refuge or safety. And my question for folks in San Francisco \nand my colleagues who support this policy is: A refuge for whom? A \nsanctuary for whom? A refuge for Kate Steinle? A sanctuary for Kate \nSteinle? A refuge for a convicted felon with a 25-year-long criminal \nhistory?\n  So the phrase sounds benign, but it was no sanctuary for her. It may \nhave been for him, but it sure as hell wasn't for her.\n  Mr. Speaker, my message to San Francisco would be simple: You won't \nhonor our detainers, we won't honor your warrants. If detainers are too \nmuch trouble for you to handle, perhaps Federal money will be too much \ntrouble for you to handle, too. If you can't honor our detainers, you \nare not going to get any more money.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my concerns about \nthe Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act. I am completely appalled \nby the tragic and senseless death of\n\n[[Page H5448]]\n\nKathryn Steinle and those responsible should be held fully accountable. \nDangerous criminals, including those who are in the United States \nillegally, should not ever be released into the community.\n  However, H.R. 3009 does not address this problem. In fact, if H.R. \n3009 becomes law it will only make it more difficult for law \nenforcement agencies to prevent future tragedies like this one. The \nsystem failed to catch this felon, not because of our nation's \nimmigration policy, but because there was a breakdown in communication \nbetween agencies. The suspect, who has confessed to the shooting, has \nseven prior felony convictions, and has been deported five times, was \napprehended by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and \nturned over to the custody of the San Francisco Sheriff's Department at \nits request on an outstanding drug warrant. ICE issued a detainer, \nrequesting to be notified before the suspect's release. Unfortunately, \nthe suspect was released back onto the streets after the prosecutor \ndeclined to pursue the drug charges.\n  This individual should never have been released from the custody of \nlaw enforcement, and the events that followed reflect a systemic \nfailure on the part of local law enforcement and prosecutors. And while \nI believe that Congress has a moral responsibility to prevent future \ntragedies like this from occurring in the future, this legislation \nfalls far short in addressing any of the failings in our immigration \nsystem that led to it. If enacted, H.R. 3009 would not have required \nlocal law enforcement to certify that the suspect would be prosecuted \nbefore taking custody of him. Nor would it have required the Bureau of \nPrisons or ICE to consult with local law enforcement or prosecutors to \ndetermine whether justice would be better served by having the suspect \ndeported rather than being transferred to face an unlikely prosecution \nfor a 20-year-old drug possession charge.\n  H.R. 3009 purports to address this tragedy by stripping local law \nenforcement agencies of necessary federal funding to fulfill its \nresponsibilities to the public. More specifically, the legislation \nwould strip funding for state criminal alien assistance programs. \nInstead of aiding local law enforcement, this bill would cripple the \nefforts of these agencies to support federal law enforcement. In a \nnaked attempt to score political points, this legislation deliberately \nignores and neglects the roots of the tragedy. As such, a wide \ncoalition of groups oppose H.R. 3009, including the Major County \nSherriff's Association, the National Fraternal Order of Police, the Law \nEnforcement Immigration Task Force, the National League of Cities, the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors, AFL-CIO, AFSCME, ACLU, LULAC, and LCCHR. \nWhile I remain committed to substantive and constructive reform of our \nnation's immigration system, this legislation falls far short of what \nis necessary.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on \nthe Judiciary and on Homeland Security, I rise in strong opposition to \nH.R. 3009, the so-called ``Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act.''\n  I oppose this legislation because it undermines public safety, fails \nto address needed immigration reform, promotes a deportation-only \napproach, and will not achieve the Republican leadership's stated \npurpose in bringing the bill to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, nothing in H.R. 3009 would have prevented the tragic \nkilling of an innocent young woman in San Francisco.\n  Instead, this bill is being rushed to the floor for the sole purpose \nof exploiting that tragedy by scapegoating immigrants and undocumented \npersons, holding them responsible for the actions of one person, and \navoiding action on comprehensive immigration reform.\n  It is undisputable that victims of murder deserve justice.\n  H.R. 3009 the ``Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act'' would push \nundocumented immigrants further into the shadows and create and an \nenvironment with heightened threats to our safety and ability to seek \njustice.\n  Stripping state and local law enforcement agencies of key funding and \nresources impedes their ability to combat crime and protect our \ncommunities.\n  Surely, House Republicans do not want to tie the hands of law \nenforcement when it comes to preventing and investigating criminal \nacts.\n  Rather than taking positive steps to promote better cooperation and \ncommunication between Federal, State and local authorities, where \nappropriate, H.R. 3009 punishes State and local law enforcement \nagencies that prioritize public safety and community policing over \nimmigration enforcement efforts.\n  Nearly every major law enforcement association in the country, from \nthe Major Cities Chiefs Associations, the Major Counties Sheriffs \nAssociation, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the Law Enforcement \nImmigration Task Force, opposes H.R. 3009 and the host of other similar \nand related proposals set forth by Republicans.\n  H.R. 3009 simply spreads the myth that all immigrants are criminals \nand threats to the public--despite decades of research that demonstrate \nthe fact that immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes than \nnative-born persons and are less likely to end up in prison.\n  In fact, thousands immigrant populations throughout the country have \nresided within our country for decades as law-abiding, tax-paying, \nhard-working model persons who contribute to our nation's economy and \nculture of diversity and inclusiveness.\n  Additionally, thousands of immigrant populations are actually here \nseeking safety and refuge because they too are victims of horrific \nabuse, torture and massacre that plagues their native countries.\n  Yet, once again we are discussing measures that simply seek to \nenhance and promote mass criminalization, racial profiling and \ndiscrimination, and deportation of immigrants.\n  In just this past year, House Republicans have voted to:\n  1. Deport hundreds of thousands of Dreamers who came to the country \nas children and are American in all but name;\n  2. Deport millions of parents of US citizens who are playing by the \nrules, contributing to their communities and working to support their \nfamilies; and\n  3. Deport without due process tens of thousands of unaccompanied \nchildren who came to the US fleeing persecution, extreme violence and \ntrafficking.\n  Just this past Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit \nissued an opinion dismissing immunity claims by ICE Agents who \nunlawfully detained an American citizen.\n  A U.S. citizen who was born in Guatemala and has resided here since \nthe 1980s and was naturalized in 1995, was subjected to multiple ICE \ndetainers in violation of her Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights.\n  On at least two occasions the plaintiff was detained by ICE and \nquestioned about her citizenship--despite her repeated claims and \nassertion of her legal status.\n  No efforts were made to confirm or investigate prior to her detention \nby ICE which allowed her to be booked, strip-searched and held in jail \nfor up to 48-hours.\n  ``Detain first, question later'' practices and policies should not be \nsupported--yet H.R. 3009 penalizes law enforcement for refusing to \ngather information about one's citizenship or immigration status where \nsuch actions are unwarranted.\n  President Obama issued a statement today advising that H.R. 3009 will \nget vetoed if presented to him for signature.\n  It cannot be said that immigration reform is being taken seriously, \nwhen proposals are rushed and fail to go through regular order.\n  Serious reform requires bringing to the floor for debate a \ncomprehensive immigration bill that reforms our broken immigration \nsystem by making it fairer and more humane, and secures our Northern, \nSouthern, and maritime borders and our ports.\n  The House Homeland Security Committee proved this can be done last \nyear when it reported out of committee on a unanimous vote, H.R. 1417, \nthe Border Security Results Act of 2014.\n  Instead of wasting time on legislation that is designed to attract \npublicity rather than have any realistic chance of becoming law, we \nshould be bringing to the floor for debate legislation that will \naddress the real problems and challenges facing the American people.\n  Instead of squandering valuable floor time on this irresponsible \nlegislation, the House should be allowed to work its will on issues \nthat matter, like raising the minimum wage, protecting the right to \nvote of all Americans, and passing criminal justice reform that builds \ntrust and respect between law enforcement agencies and the communities \nthey are to protect and serve.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3009, \nthe so-called ``Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act.''\n  This misguided legislation is purportedly a response to the \nheartbreaking and tragic shooting of Kathryn Steinle earlier this \nmonth. However, the reality is that this legislation cynically uses \nthis isolated incident to scapegoat all undocumented immigrants and \nundermine community policing. Specifically, H.R. 3009 would withhold \ncritical funding for State and local law enforcement agencies as well \nas victims of crimes unless these jurisdictions bear the burden of \nenforcing Federal immigration statutes.\n  If passed, this bill would tie the hands of local law enforcement \nagencies who are working to promote safety and build community trust. \nRequiring local police to enforce Federal immigration laws often times \ndissuades undocumented individuals from reporting crimes, offering \ntestimony, and serving as witnesses in court proceedings. For example, \nthe evidence shows that victims of domestic violence will be afraid to \nreport these crimes to police for fear of deportation. A survey \nconducted by the National Domestic Violence Hotline in 2013 found that \nnearly 50-percent of foreign born individuals were afraid to seek help \nbecause of their\n\n[[Page H5449]]\n\nimmigrant status. As Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson \ntestified earlier this month, ``mandating through legislation the \nconduct of sheriffs and police chiefs'' is not the way to go.\n  Instead of pushing these failed policies, we need to come together \nand pass bipartisan legislation to address our broken immigration \nsystem. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition to HR \n3009. First and foremost, my heartfelt sympathies go out to the Steinle \nfamily for the loss of their daughter, Kate. There is no question that \nher death is tragic and unjust.\n  However, this bill neither avenges her death nor effectively prevents \nsimilar tragedies from happening in the future. Absent comprehensive \nimmigration reform, we are forcing local police to act as federal \nimmigration officials. That is wrong, wrong, wrong.\n  I represent one of the largest agriculture districts in CA that is \ndependent on migrant workers who toil the fields to feed our nation. We \nalso have a significant gang violence problem in ``the Salad Bowl of \nthe World'', yet, I am not aware that any of our local law enforcement \nofficials think this bill is a good idea.\n  In some of the harshest neighborhoods, our local law enforcement \nofficials have established satellite facilities and programs for the \nkids in the neighborhood that provide alternatives to joining gangs. \nThis type of 21st Century Policing encourages community partnerships, \nproblem-solving and organizational transformation.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have already seen the willingness of the Republicans \nto shut down the government over immigration issues by failing to fund \nthe Department of Homeland Security for 4 months. While compromising \nthe safety of our communities and the effectiveness of our local police \nmight be good for Donald Trump, it is bad for America.\n  I urge a no vote.\n  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, the recent killing of Kathryn Steinle \nin San Francisco is a tragedy, and my thoughts are with her family \nduring this very difficult time.\n  Unfortunately, the Majority has chosen to politicize this tragedy by \nbringing this misguided and unacceptable bill to the floor.\n  H.R. 3009 would withhold Department of Justice grants specifically \ntargeted to enhance public safety, support community policing, and \nassist crime victims from states and law enforcement agencies that do \nnot collect information regarding a person's immigration status.\n  We can and should ensure that serious criminals who are dangerous and \nenforcement priorities for ICE are not released from the custody of \nlocal law enforcement. However, it is misguided and counterproductive \nto force local law enforcement officers to inquire about a person's \nimmigration status at any time and for any reason in order to be \neligible to receive critical public safety funding.\n  It is also wrong and irresponsible that this bill misrepresents the \nimmigrant community as one comprised entirely of criminals. In fact, \ndecades of research show that immigrants are less likely to commit \nserious crimes than native-born persons.\n  Earlier this year, many Republicans insisted that our Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations bill include anti-immigrant riders, and \nthreatened to shut down the Department of Homeland Security if they did \nnot get their way. Sadly, H.R. 3009 is just more of the same from the \nMajority, who apparently think it is more important to incite hatred of \nour immigrant population for political purposes than it is to keep our \ncommunities safe and secure.\n  If we truly want to deal with our broken immigration system, we must \npass comprehensive immigration reform that treats immigrants humanely, \nfocuses on deporting those who threaten our safety and national \nsecurity, and better secures our borders. Unfortunately, the House \nMajority has no interest in passing such reforms and instead chooses to \nrob local law enforcement of the money they need to keep our \nconstituents safe from harm.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 370, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I am opposed to it in its current form.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Jeffries moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3009 to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary, with instructions to report the \n     same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendment:\n       Add at the end the following:\n\n     SEC.__. PROTECTING LOCAL COMMUNITIES FROM CUTS TO LAW \n                   ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       The Attorney General may not reduce or eliminate, under \n     this Act or the amendment made by this Act, any sums provided \n     to a State (or a political subdivision of a State) if the \n     Attorney General determines that such reduction or \n     elimination would result in--\n       (1) an increase in the overall crime rate in that State or \n     political subdivision, including an increase in domestic \n     violence, sex trafficking, or crimes against children; or\n       (2) a decrease in the number of trained law enforcement \n     officers in that State or political subdivision, including \n     community police, that are available to protect the public.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthe bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\n  The murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco was a national tragedy \nthat certainly shocked the conscience of America. We must continue to \nmourn her passing. We must continue to stand behind her family.\n  We must continue to make sure that her killer is prosecuted to the \nfull extent of the law, but we should not respond with irresponsible \npublic policy.\n  Our Founders indicated that the House of Representatives is supposed \nto reflect the passions of the people, but the passions should be \nproperly channeled into an appropriate legislative vehicle.\n  On December 14, 2012, 20 children were brutally gunned down in Sandy \nHook Elementary School. More than 30,000 additional Americans have died \nas a result of gun violence since that fateful day. Mr. Speaker, 952 \ndays have passed. This House has done nothing.\n  On June 27, 2013, the Senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill, 52 Democrats, 14 Republicans, 2 Independents. \nThat bill would have secured our borders. That bill would have reduced \nthe deficit by more than $850 billion over 20 years. That bill would \nhave required undocumented immigrants to learn English, pay back taxes, \npass a criminal background check, and then get at the back of the line. \nMr. Speaker, 757 days have passed. This House has done nothing.\n  Instead, we are here today considering a misguided legislative \nresponse to a terrible tragedy. That is why I offer this amendment, \nwhich will prevent the elimination or reduction of funds to State or \nlocal law enforcement organizations if the Attorney General determines \nthat the elimination of funding would result in an overall increase in \nthe crime rate, particularly with respect to domestic violence, sex \ntrafficking, and crimes against children, or if it would result in a \ndecrease in the number of trained law enforcement officers on American \nstreets.\n  The COPS and Byrne-JAG programs are essential to public safety and \nshould not be used as a blunt force weapon to carry out a reckless and \nirresponsible antiimmigrant agenda. That is why the National Fraternal \nOrder of Police, the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, and the \nMajor County Sheriffs' Association of America all oppose the underlying \nlegislation.\n  In a letter dated July 15, the National Fraternal Order of Police \nexpressed their ``strong opposition to any amendment or piece of \nlegislation that would penalize law enforcement agencies by withholding \nFederal funding or resources from law enforcement assistance programs \nin an effort to coerce a policy change in so-called sanctuary cities.''\n  In offering this amendment, I stand with law enforcement. In offering \nthis amendment, I stand with the Statue of Liberty that sits in New \nYork Harbor with the inscription ``Give me your tired, your poor, your \nhuddled masses yearning to breathe free.''\n  In offering this amendment, I stand with the United States \nConstitution and the 10th Amendment limitation on the Federal \nGovernment's ability to commandeer State or local police authorities \ninto the service of Federal areas of enforcement.\n\n[[Page H5450]]\n\n  In offering this amendment, I stand with the Scripture in Matthew \n25:35, where it says: I was hungry, and you gave me food. I was \nthirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you welcomed me.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of \norder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation is withdrawn.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \nmotion to recommit. It would give the discretion to the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States and the ability to determine whether or \nnot such reductions provided in this legislation would take place.\n  This is the same Attorney General of the United States who is new to \nthe position, but has already indicated her unwillingness to enforce \ntitle VIII, section 1373, of the United States Code related to the \nrequirement that cities and all other government agencies communicate \nwith the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n  The Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act helps to address one of \nthe main factors contributing to the collapse of immigration \nenforcement in the United States.\n  Hundreds of sanctuary cities are violating Federal law by prohibiting \ntheir law enforcement officers from sharing information with Federal \nimmigration authorities to enable the removal of unlawful and criminal \naliens.\n  This bill will finally establish penalties to persuade these \njurisdictions to comply with longstanding Federal law.\n  Sanctuary cities present a clear and present danger to their \ncitizens. In the first 8 months of 2014, they released 8,145 aliens who \nthe Department of Homeland Security wanted to deport.\n  Very quickly, almost a quarter of these aliens were arrested again \nfor new criminal offenses. Most recently, San Francisco's refusal to \nhonor a DHS detainer resulted in the tragic death of Kate Steinle.\n  This is not an isolated incident. This is something that will \ncontinue again and again and again unless these cities start \ncooperating with law enforcement.\n  And, yes, there are many other things that need to be done to protect \nAmerican citizens from unlawful criminal aliens besides this bill. \nThose should be brought to the floor as well.\n  But this bill represents an important first step in making rogue \njurisdictions comply with Federal law and safeguard their communities. \nWe will take further steps in the months ahead to ensure enforcement of \nimmigration laws, but we have to start today.\n  Federal grants--and there are three categories of grants covered by \nthis legislation--are not entitlements to the States. They are \ngratuities that Congress has chosen to give to the States.\n  The Supreme Court has held that Congress can place restrictions or \nconditions on the receipt of Federal funds to further policies that are \naimed at protecting the general welfare.\n  I support these law enforcement grants, but the solution to potential \nloss of these funds is simple: eliminate the policies that violate \nFederal law, eliminate the policies that prohibit information sharing \nwith the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, and they will \nreceive this funding. They will also receive safer communities, \ncommunities that are sanctuaries for law-abiding citizens, not \nsanctuaries for criminals.\n  This legislation must be passed to protect American citizens and do \nright by them and do it in honor of people like Kate Steinle, who gave \nher life because of these bad policies.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to recommit, support this \nlegislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by \n5-minute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered, and the question on \nagreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal, if ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 181, \nnays 239, not voting 13, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 465]\n\n                               YEAS--181\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Castro (TX)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Cleaver\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Costa\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeFazio\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Fattah\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Gutierrez\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Jackson Lee\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcCarthy), my friend, the majority leader.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour \nand 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 \np.m.\n  On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning \nhour and noon for legislative business.\n  On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. \nLast votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.\n  On Friday, no votes are expected in the House.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next \nweek, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business \ntomorrow.\n  In addition, the House will consider H.R. 427, the Regulations from \nthe Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2015, sponsored by \nRepresentative Todd Young.\n  Last year Federal regulations burdened job creators with trillions of \ndollars in costs. This bill, commonly referred to as the REINS Act, \nwill ensure that Congress has a say in whether\n\n[[Page H5452]]\n\nmajor rules should be imposed on the American people.\n  The House will also consider H.R. 1994, the VA Accountability Act, \nsponsored by Chairman Jeff Miller.\n  Getting the best possible service to our Nation's veterans starts \nwith having the best possible personnel in charge VA programs.\n  This critical bill will give the administration additional tools to \nturn things around at the VA and ensure veterans have the kind of care \nthey deserve.\n  I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his information with reference \nto the two bills that will be considered next week.\n  We are coming now to the end of the scheduled work period, and we \nwill be going into the August break. We just passed a bill, Mr. Leader, \nwhich dealt with a tragedy--or purportedly dealt with a tragedy--that \noccurred in San Francisco.\n  Every Member of this House believes, I think, that a mistake was made \nby the sheriff in San Francisco in releasing this individual who had \nbeen convicted of numerous felonies.\n  We also believe, if we had passed a comprehensive immigration reform \nbill similar to the one the Senate passed in the last Congress, that \nthis problem itself would not be solved--because we believe that the \nsheriff should not have released this individual irrespective of the \nstatus of immigration reform--but we believe this would go a long way \ntowards enhancing the ability of both law enforcement and of \ncommunities to deal with the immigration issue as well as giving \nconfidence to people of their status.\n  Does the gentleman believe that there is any possibility of a \ncomprehensive immigration bill being considered in the next work \nperiod?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  What happened in San Francisco was not just a mistake. This \nindividual had seven felonies. It is not miscommunication. Kate lost \nher life and should not had to have.\n  Sanctuary cities are made up of individuals who believe they can make \ntheir own law and disregard the law of the Federal Government.\n  I think today's bill was a good first start. I do look forward to \ncontinuing the conversations on both sides of the aisle on immigration \nreform, but I have nothing scheduled at this time.\n  Mr. HOYER. Just to make it clear, the mistake was the sheriff's. He \nshould not have done what he did. It was a tragedy. We all agree on \nthat.\n  Very frankly, we don't think that he was compelled to do so by the \nsanctuary law that San Francisco had in effect.\n  I will tell the majority leader that we had a difference of opinion \nin a previous bill, the Violence Against Women Act, where you did not \ninclude protection for immigrants when they came forward to law \nenforcement authorities and complained of domestic violence.\n  We had a disagreement on that, and the disagreement was that we \nthought they ought to be protected, which is why so many law \nenforcement officials opposed the bill that was brought forward.\n  I will tell you again, Mr. Leader, that we do not believe that the \nstatute that was in San Francisco compelled or led to the actions of \nthe sheriff in releasing a felon who had committed the numerous \nfelonies and should not have been released. It was a tragedy.\n  Let me go on, Mr. Leader, to the appropriations process.\n  There are no appropriation bills listed on your schedule for next \nweek. We have after next week some, I think, 16 legislative days left \nbetween now and the end of the fiscal year.\n  Again, for the next period that we are going to be back and in light \nof the fact that we know what it is going to be at least--and I will \nhave some questions on some things that may be on, but we know what is \nscheduled for next week--does the gentleman believe that our Members \nought to anticipate the further consideration of appropriation bills \nprior to the end of the fiscal year?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  As I mentioned last week, yes, it is our intention to get back to the \nappropriation process as soon as possible.\n  As the gentleman knows, we are halfway done. We should finish our \njob, but I will make sure to keep the Members updated on the \nappropriation bills as they are scheduled and continue to be \nconsidered.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the majority leader. I am pleased to hear that.\n  I know the Speaker observed--and I think he is probably right--that \nthere will have to be a CR. In light of that, I would hope that the \nmajority leader, in league with the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, perhaps with the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, \nand with the Speaker, would initiate the conversations now in \npreparation so that we would not have a crisis on September 30, but \nwould, in a logical and, hopefully, a cooperative way, have gotten to \nwhat action would be taken with respect to a CR. I would urge my friend \nto pursue those discussions.\n\n  I would be glad to participate with him in those discussions with \nothers on our side who will be involved in that process--our ranking \nmember on the Appropriations Committee, our ranking member on the Ways \nand Means Committee, and our ranking member on the Budget Committee.\n  I yield to my friend if he wants to make a comment.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. No.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman.\n  The gentleman and I have had discussions about highways. We know that \nnext week the highway authorization ends. We are planning on leaving \nhere, if the schedule is kept, on Thursday of next week.\n  Will the gentleman tell me what he believes is the status of the \nhighway bill?\n  I know the Senate is discussing a longer term highway bill. Neither \nthe majority leader nor I are very enthusiastic about that bill as I \nhave learned in my discussions with you.\n  Will you tell me what your plans are with respect to the highway bill \nso that we don't leave here without some sort of authorization having \nbeen passed?\n  I yield to my friend.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Well, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him \nfor his discussions with me regarding highways. Just last week, we \npassed a bipartisan bill that would ensure critical infrastructure \nprojects continue throughout the year.\n  I know the Senate has their debate. Our bill goes to the end of the \nyear with a long-term solution. The Senate currently is debating a bill \nthat is not funded long term. I think the best bit of advice is to urge \nthe Senate to accept our bill.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman.\n  Lastly, as the gentleman knows, I have been very much involved with \nthe authorization of the Export-Import Bank through the years. As the \ngentleman knows, Mr. Cantor and I worked together and came up with a \nbipartisan proposal in 2012 that passed this House overwhelmingly with \napproximately 140 Republicans and about 185 or more Democrats, so it \npassed overwhelmingly.\n  Can the gentleman tell me whether or not there is any possibility of \nassuring that the majority of this House can work its will and the \nmajority of the Senate--and I say that because Mitch McConnell, the \nleader of the Senate, is quoted as saying the supporters of the Federal \nExport-Import Bank have the Senate votes to revive it and will get a \nchance to do so.\n  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, It looks to me like they have \nthe votes--and I am requesting to give them the opportunity. McConnell, \nwho opposes the Bank, said he expects supporters to try to attach the \nreauthorization to a highway bill.\n  Assuming that we get a bill from the Senate with the Export-Import \nBank attached to it, does the majority leader believe that we will have \nthe opportunity--and I think the majority of the Members of the House \nwould vote in favor of it--will have the opportunity to vote on the \nExport-Import Bank before we leave here on Thursday?\n  I yield to my friend\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I thank my friend for his weekly questions. I think you may have \nasked these questions actually more times than we repealed ObamaCare, \nbut my answer remains the same.\n\n[[Page H5453]]\n\n  Mr. HOYER. I could not possibly stand on this floor long enough to do \nthat.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. My answer still remains the same to the gentleman. \nThere is no action scheduled in the House on Ex-Im.\n  Mr. HOYER. I keep asking that question, and I keep getting the wrong \nanswer. I will be faithful to asking that question.\n  I say that with humor, but the gentleman knows that I believe this is \nan extraordinarily serious issue. The gentleman knows I agree with the \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Boehner, that we are \nlosing jobs right now as a result of our failure to extend the \nauthorization of the Export-Import Bank past June 30.\n  The gentleman knows I believe that 165,000 jobs are at risk. The \nIndian director of their export-import bank is quoted as saying in the \npaper, just the other day, that he believes they are going to pick up \njobs and orders because of the failure of the Export-Import Bank to be \nreauthorized.\n  I think this is not something that is not real. It is a loss of jobs \nand a loss of competitive status for our country if we do not \nreauthorize this and do so as quickly as possible.\n  I will keep asking the question because I feel it is so very \nimportant to our country and to our competitiveness, but I appreciate \nthe gentleman's faithfulness in his answer. I am hopeful that it will \nchange.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. We will keep repealing ObamaCare.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I didn't notice that ObamaCare had been \nrepealed. I simply noticed the Supreme Court said it was a \nconstitutional piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/house-section/article/H5453-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ADJOURNMENT FROM THURSDAY, JULY 23, 2015, TO MONDAY, JULY 27, 2015\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY.

Mr. Speaker, it is painful to hear the words in the \nrecently released video showing Planned Parenthood trafficking in body \nparts.\n  At one point, the doctor talks about a customer wanting ``lower \nextremities,'' that is legs in everyday language.\n  ``I don't know what they are going to do with it. Maybe they want \nmuscle,'' she says.\n  These are legs that will never run to a mom or a dad, never run to a \nbrother or a sister, never run to a spouse, never run to protect \nanother child.\n  It has been 42 years since the Supreme Court did what Justice White \ncalled an exercise of raw judicial power. Since then, we have seen more \nthan 55 million abortions in this country; yet we are still shocked by \nwhat these videos show.\n  This is a teaching moment, Mr. Speaker. There is a lot of pain \nimplicit in these videos, pain for kids, pain for moms, pain for dads \nand families. Perhaps these videos can become the moment where our \nNation can begin to heal that pain.\n  Stopping taxpayer dollars flowing to organizations responsible for \nthis horror is a good place to start that healing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/house-section/article/H5453-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FALLEN HAYWARD POLICE DEPARTMENT SERGEANT SCOTT LUNGER\n\n  (Mr. SWALWELL of California asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask that \nthis House honor Sergeant Scott Lunger, 48 years old, who was murdered \ntragically yesterday as a Hayward police officer while on routine \npatrol.\n  His murder is a reminder that the work we call our police officers to \ndo puts them and their lives in jeopardy every day, every stop, not \nknowing if it is going to be their last or if they are going to return \nhome to see their families.\n  Sergeant Lunger leaves behind a wife, two daughters, a brother, \nfamily, and friends; but he died doing what he loved, his second career \nworking as a police officer.\n  For 15 years, he did so to help people in the community. He served on \nthe SWAT team and on the gang unit. He was described by his police \nchief as a warrior cop, an ethical police officer. He was described by \nothers as that ideal officer, that go-to guy. A lieutenant said: He is \nthe best cop and crimefighter I have ever seen.\n  The East Bay and Hayward community mourns the loss of Sergeant Scott \nLunger. Long live the memory of Sergeant Scott Lunger.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize former Notre \nDame basketball player and Army veteran, Danielle Green, who was \nrecognized at last week's ESPYs ceremony with the Pat Tillman award.\n  The award is named after former NFL player Pat Tillman, who joined \nthe Army Rangers following 9/11, served several tours in combat before \nhe died in a friendly fire incident in Afghanistan in 2004. It \nrecognizes an individual with a strong connection to sports who has \nserved others in a way that echoes Pat's legacy.\n  Danielle Green could not be more deserving of this prestigious honor. \nWhile bravely serving her country in Iraq, she lost part of her left \narm from a rocket-propelled grenade attack.

Mr. Speaker, today, my colleague Congressman David \nCicilline, an unparalleled champion for LGBT rights, introduced the \nEquality Act. I rise today as a proud cosponsor in support of this \nbill.\n  Recent gains, from public opinion to the Supreme Court, have \nundoubtedly accelerated our ongoing civil rights march, but real \njustice will be served in this country when the LGBT community is \nguaranteed--not just legal equality, but lived equality.\n  The ability to experience everyday life without fear of \ndiscrimination is something most of us take for granted. Walking into a \ngas station without worrying about being denied service because of your \ngender identity, heading into a movie theater without fear of being \nturned away because of the hand you held when you walked in, that \nthreat of judgment, rejection, and prejudice is injustice in its purest \nform.\n  Today, through the Equality Act, we can help root out the dangerous \nintolerance that continues to define too many American lives. I urge \nall of my colleagues to join this fight, cosponsor this bill, and get \nit signed into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/house-section/article/H5453-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5453-H5454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SECRET SIDE DEALS WITH IRAN CONCERNING INSPECTION OF THEIR NUKES\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special \nOrder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by looking \nat headlines. All you have got to do is just read the headlines that \nare blaring at us, coming at us in print, over our Internet, and \nothers. They say things like: ``Five children among 94 crucified, \nflogged, and caged by ISIS for eating during Ramadan''; ``Hundreds \nKilled in Nigeria Anti-Christian Violence''; ``ISIS Plants Land Mines \nin Christian Civilian Homes, Ancient Ruins Across Iraq, Syria.''\n  If we have the stomach for it that particular day, we may read the \narticle that follows. We might say a prayer or silently wonder at the \nbrazen face of evil. But ultimately, we go on with our lives. We do not \nfear for our personal safety or that of our families because of \nsystemic religious violence.\n  Yet millions of our brothers and sisters around the world do not have \nthe luxury of walking away from real religious persecution. They don't \nread the news stories; they live them day in and day out. They have \nwatched family\n\n[[Page H5455]]\n\nmembers die. They have had friends simply vanish into thin air, never \nto be heard from again. Their homes and businesses are seized by the \ngovernment. Even as they place their hope in eternity, they fear for \ntheir future here on Earth.\n  Today, my colleagues and I come to the House floor to tell our \nstories. We come because this body and this administration have a \nresponsibility to use our position to promote religious liberty around \nthe world. Millions of lives are literally depending on America's \nwillingness to export our most precious commodity, religious freedom, \nand it is time to step up our efforts.\n  As a pastor and currently a chaplain in the United States Air Force \nReserve, defending religious liberty at home and abroad is near and \ndear to my heart. I have had the honor of serving folks of many faiths, \nas well as those with no faith, and I am convinced that the \nfoundational importance of religious liberty is not just in America, \nbut in every country.\n  No nation is truly free unless its citizens can practice their \nreligious beliefs without fear of losing their life or livelihood \nbecause of state-sponsored opposition or unchecked persecution by their \nneighbors. Yet even in democratized societies, we are witnessing a \nsharp increase in violent religious persecution worldwide.\n  If America is to be a shining city upon a hill in the 21st century, \nwe must redouble our commitment to fighting for those around the world \nwho do not enjoy the basic right to worship as they choose.\n  I am grateful that my colleagues who share my passion for religious \nliberties have joined me for this Special Order, and I am especially \ngrateful to my friend from California, Representative Vargas. We have \ngotten to know each other and travel, but on this issue, party lines \nare diminished, party lines are laid aside. When we think about our own \nfreedoms and religious liberty, he is a champion for that.\n  I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Vargas) as we continue \nto discuss this issue.\n  Mr. VARGAS. I thank the gentleman from Georgia, Representative Doug \nCollins, for his opening remarks and especially for his courage to \nspeak out for religious freedom around the world and also for his \ncourage serving our Nation in uniform.\n  At this moment, religious freedom around the world is in a state of \nemergency. The recently released International Religious Freedom annual \nreport describes ``humanitarian crisis fueled by waves of terror, \nintimidation, violence,'' and ``the horrific loss of human life, \nfreedom, and dignity that has accompanied the chaos.''\n  From the brutality of ISIL in Iraq and Syria to Boko Haram's mass \nmurders at mosques and churches and the displacement of over 140,000 \nRohingya Muslims and 100,000 Kachin Christians in Burma, the past year \nhas seen unspeakable violations of the basic right to practice one's \nreligion. Additionally, blasphemy laws, the vast displacement of \nreligious minorities, and the persistent attacks on religious \ncommunities and places of worship should all be a cause for concern.\n  Today, I would like to highlight the plight of religious minorities \nin ISIL-held territories a year after the fall of Mosul.\n  The Nineveh plains have been inhabited by Christians for the past \n2,000 years and was first settled in 6000 BCE. In the Bible, the \nProphet Jonah was ordered by God to ``Arise, go unto Nineveh, that \ngreat city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.''\n  Based in modern-day Mosul, with the Tigris River to the east, the \nNineveh plains is rich in cultural history and religious diversity. \nBefore the fall of Saddam Hussein, the number of Christians in Iraq had \nbeen estimated to be between 800,000 and 1.4 million. This included \nArmenian Catholics, Chaldean Christians, Assyrian Church of the East \nmembers, and Protestants. In 2013, the Christian population was \nestimated at 500,000 and shrinking significantly.\n  Last year, the world watched in horror as a transnational Sunni \ninsurgency initiated a political and religious insurrection in the name \nof establishing a caliphate across Iraq and Syria.\n  After ISIL established its control over northwestern Iraq, these \nIslamist insurgents warned religious minorities living under its \njurisdiction to either convert to Islam, pay a cumbersome religious \ntax, or be executed. These religious minorities included Christians, \nYazidis, Turkmen, and Shabak, all of which have a long and rich history \nin the region and have historically coexisted peacefully with Muslims.\n  Since ISIL's declaration, thousands of families have packed their \nbelongings and fled to neighboring communities in Kurdistan, Syria, \nLebanon, and Jordan. Many thousands have been murdered or abducted, and \nan unknown number of women and girls have been sexually assaulted and \nforced into marriage.\n  We all witnessed in August 2014 thousands of Yazidis fleeing to Mount \nSinjar to escape the brutality and persecution as ISIL advanced in the \nsurrounding areas. I would like to read the testimony of a Yazidi \nrecounting that horrible time:\n\n       Hours later, ISIS forces attacked the Yazidis in Sinjar. \n     The Yazidis in towns and villages of the south side of Mount \n     Sinjar had some light weapons, such as AK-47 rifles, with a \n     small amount of ammunition. They fought against ISIS forces \n     for 4 or 5 hours. While this minimal defense was proceeding, \n     many Yazidis fled to Mount Sinjar.\n       Finally, the defenders ran out of bullets and our positions \n     were overrun. The lucky few Yazidis who made it to Mount \n     Sinjar stayed for several days without any food or water. \n     Hundreds then died from starvation and dehydration, \n     especially infants, young children, sick people, and \n     elders.\n       On August 6, while ISIS forces flushed other Yazidi and \n     Chaldo-Assyrians from their Nineveh plain homes, ISIS also \n     advanced toward Mount Sinjar. Then the Yazidis had no choice \n     but to flee by foot, a journey that took days.\n       On Friday, August 15, more than 210 Yazidi families in \n     Kocho village, which is just south of Sinjar City, received \n     an ISIS order to convert to Islam or be killed. In that \n     village, the ISIS militia beheaded more than 70 young men, \n     killed hundreds, and took all women, girls, and children to \n     Badush Prison near Mosul. The women and children were sold as \n     sex slaves by ISIS commanders.\n\n  While American leadership assisted in providing humanitarian relief \nas events unraveled, little was done to alleviate ISIL's reign of \nterror. Since then, over 2 million people have been displaced, and \nthousands continue to face crimes against humanity. These include \ntorture, enslavement, rape, forced prostitution, imprisonment, and \nextermination.\n  Additionally, as a means to eradicate the history and heritage of \nthese different groups, ISIS has led a campaign to destroy cultural and \nreligious properties. Assyrians and other Christians have seen the \ndestruction of the statue of the Virgin Mary at the Immaculate Church \nand the tomb of the Prophet Jonah, and numerous churches have been \ndestroyed, looted, and burned down.\n  In closing, I would like to echo the words of Pope Francis, who \neloquently stated: ``Our brothers are being persecuted, chased away, \nthey are forced to leave their homes without being able to take \nanything with them. I assure these families that I am close to them and \nin constant prayer. . . I know how much you are suffering. I know you \nare being stripped of everything.''\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I think what you have stated shows what we \nare dealing with here. What we are finding is the intolerance, \nsomething that is just so atypical of what we find here in America.\n  I think the reason we are here today and actually talking about this \nis to again raise that level and to understand that this is not \nsomething in the past, not something beyond. It is something that is \ngoing on right now.\n  It is not easy to hear about, but you had spoken of it as well, the \nISIL victims who reject forced conversion. As we think about that in \nour religious freedom context, just because they say, ``I am not going \nto convert to your faith,'' Mr. Speaker, is what they are saying, they \nare crucified, beheaded, tortured, raped, and countless other \natrocities, sold into slavery, simply because they stand on their own \nfaith and won't be forced into the faith of another.\n  ISIL, frankly, is just evil. They hide behind the cloak of \nreligiousness. The problem is evil is just evil. You call evil what it \nis. Religious freedom has to be protected, and we have to be purveyors \nof that.\n  When we look around, just in the Iraq community alone, just a few \nyears\n\n[[Page H5456]]\n\nago, there were 1.5 million Christians in Iraq. Now, the best estimates \nare 200,000, at best estimate. And it just continues to drive. This is \nsomething that we are going to have to continue, I believe, to watch.\n  There is a dear friend of mine here tonight who is a fighter for not \nonly religious liberties, but I have fought with him for the lives and \nthe birthdays of newborns everywhere. He is a fighter for religious \nliberties. The gentleman from Arizona speaks with authority on these \nissues because he has been there and he has been fighting on the front \nlines for a while.\n  It is my privilege to yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \nFranks) to continue this discussion on the need for religious \nliberties.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. It is a \nprivilege for me to be here on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives tonight with Congressman Collins and Congressman \nVargas.\n  I consider them both precious friends and colaborers in this vital \nstruggle for religious freedom, which is the cornerstone of all other \nfreedoms; and without which, there can be really no other kind of \nfreedom to exist for any length of time.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is nothing that I fear more for my colleagues and \nmy fellow Americans than the danger of growing numb to the evil that \nincites these horrific atrocities being committed against people around \nthe world today based on their faith.\n  I submit that we are, in these days, witnesses to some of the most \nglaring and brutal attacks on this universal right of religious freedom \nin all of our history.\n  The Islamic State, that metastasizing cancer spreading throughout the \nMiddle East and north Africa, is especially targeting Christians, \nYazidis, and other ancient religious minorities and communities for \nextinction.\n  The world has watched this insidious campaign of terror unfold day by \nday for over a year. More than 407 days now have passed since the \nancient city of Mosul fell into the hands of the Islamic State.\n  Their campaign of terror drove hundreds of thousands of Christian \nmen, women, and children out of the land of their spiritual heritage, \nwhich dates back for nearly 2,000 years.\n  Nearly 1 year has passed since the Islamic State's attack on the \nYazidi community. Thousands were slaughtered, Mr. Speaker. At least \n5,000 women and young girls were taken captive as sex slaves. Nearly \n1,000 boys between the ages of 4 and 10 were captured and forced into \nISIS training camps.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is no room for Christians, Yazidis, or other \ndissidents in the Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliphate. Innocent \nmen, women, and children are forced to choose between their deeply held \nreligious beliefs and their lives.\n  They are subject to torture, mass executions, beheadings, and \ncrucifixions. They are drowned and burned alive in cages. They are \nraped, abused, and sold as commodities in a modern day slave market.\n  They are tied to chairs and thrown off high-rise buildings. They are \ndesecrated, violated, humiliated, and stripped of their dignity. Their \nancient places of worship and sacred sites are destroyed.\n  Mr. Speaker, how many more unimaginable atrocities must occur before \nthis administration takes off its heartless blinders and finds the \ncourage and determination to decisively address this evil slaughter of \ninnocents based on their religious beliefs?\n  German Lutheran pastor and anti-Nazi dissident Dietrich Bonhoeffer \nsaid: ``Silence in the face of evil is evil itself. God will not hold \nus guiltless. Not to speak is to speak, and not to act is to act.''\n  Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration can no longer remain \nconspicuously silent on the plight of religious minorities caught in \nthe wake of the Islamic State. It is vital that America and the world \nmake the necessary responses to stop this campaign of terror and \npreserve these ancient religious communities from extinction.\n  In the middle of this scourge, the administration has allowed the \nSpecial Envoy to promote religious freedom of religious minorities in \nthe Near East and South Central Asia position to remain vacant now for \nnearly a year. Very little effort has been made to equip regional \nsecurity forces to protect these communities from ISIS' advance.\n  This administration's response is shameful and an astonishing \nfailure, and it only affirms the Islamic State's barbaric strategy and \nencourages what they proudly boast to be a ``battle between faith and \nblasphemy, truth, and falsehood.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I would just adjure the President of the United States \nnot to continue to stand by and let this evil relentlessly proceed.\n  The assault on religious freedom we are witness to in the Middle East \nis just one of the many attacks against this most sacred and basic \nright of religious freedom. There are thousands of innocent people \naround the world who are antagonized, oppressed, tortured, and killed \nbecause of their belief or disbelief in a particular religion or \nideology.\n  I know these are challenging subjects, Mr. Speaker, but God help us \nto remain committed to echoing the voices of these innocents in the \nhalls of Congress.\n  May we all be relentlessly committed to pursue that day when the \nlight of hope will fall across all of the lonely faces of God's \nchildren all over this world and that this ``most inalienable and \nsacred right of true religious freedom will be the possession of every \nlast human being, and the destiny of future generations will be to walk \nin the sunlight of liberty for as long as mankind inhibits the Earth.''\n  May it be so.\n  I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I thank you again, Congressman Franks, for \nyour friendship. Thank you for your outspokenness on this issue for \nmany years, and I think we continue to bring this forward as we go \nforward.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the things I want to overlook before I turn it \nover to another colleague is the area of Pakistan--and this is \nsomething that is many times overlooked when we start, but in Pakistan, \nblasphemy laws carry a potential death sentence.\n  Now, think about this for just a second--and, again, in our area, we \nget numb to the fact because of what we have--but blasphemy laws there \ncarry a potential death sentence for anyone who insults Islam or \nprofesses another faith.\n  In November 2014, two Pakistani parents were burned alive because of \ntheir Christian faith. These individuals were accused of burning a \nKoran and subsequently killed by a mob of their countrymen.\n  A Pakistani court also convicted a Christian woman, mother of five, \nAsia Bibi, of blasphemy and sentenced her to death. Yesterday, after \nmuch prayer and concern from the Christian community, Reuters News \nreported that the Pakistani Supreme Court temporarily suspended her \ndeath sentence.\n  While the suspension is welcome news, the international community \ndesires that Ms. Bibi is released from prison because of the trumped-up \ncharges.\n  These are just two examples of persecution in a nation in which all \nminorities must grapple with the devastating impact of the notorious \nblasphemy law, as well as the danger posed by Islamic militant \norganizations that enjoy a strong foothold in the region.\n  We must, as Congress and the administration, implore, put pressure--\nwhatever we need to do--to say to Pakistan: This is something that has \ngot to be removed. This is something that needs to be done away with. \nThese blasphemy laws must be put away, to be a part of a free and \norderly society that actually recognizes the beliefs and religious \nliberties.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. \nWalker), my friend and fellow pastor to speak on this issue and bring \nhis perspective on what he has seen across the world, but also in his \ntime in Congress.\n\n  Mr. WALKER. Thank you, Congressman Collins. I appreciate you raising \nthis issue and bringing it to the House floor. It is one of a growing \nconcern internationally, that we have seen organizations like Boko \nHaram and others who have done great damage to those, really, to the \nleast of these.\n\n[[Page H5457]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, our Nation was founded on the right to believe and to \nlive according to one's beliefs, and our commitment to allow people to \nlive out their religious values without fear of discrimination is \nreally the cornerstone that developed our country into a force for \nfreedom; but this liberty isn't just an American right. It should be a \nfoundational element for all people groups.\n  Who would have ever thought that we would be in a position to \nreference the United Nations? This right is so universal that it was \nincluded as article 18 of the U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human \nRights.\n  Article 18 recognizes that the right of all people to freedom of \nthought, conscience, and religion--this right includes freedom to \nchange his religion or belief, freedom to manifest his belief in \nteaching, practice, worship, and observance.\n  However, members of the very institution that is supposed to \nsubscribe to this declaration proactively seek out and punish \nindividuals in groups for their very own religious beliefs.\n  In violation of international law--and his inherent human rights--\nIran is currently imprisoning a gentleman by the name of Saeed Abedini \nfor the mere fact of being a Christian, a man who was working with \nchildren who had little hope, if any.\n  I have communicated on multiple occasions with his wife, Naghmeh, \nwhose children have pleaded and begged this administration and Iran to \nbe able to release.\n  In fact, in 2012, the history, during a visit to Tehran to meet with \nhis family to talk about helping out with orphanages and building board \nmembers, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard arrested Saeed for his \nChristian faith.\n  Without any due process, Saeed was summarily given a sentence of 8 \nyears. Throughout Saeed's imprisonment, he has spent weeks in solitary \nconfinement. The prison guards have allowed other prisoners to come and \nbeat him. He is denied medical treatment for infections that resulted \nfrom beatings because he is labeled an infidel.\n  I am more than proud that this House unanimously passed H. Res. 233, \nthat demands the immediate release of Pastor Saeed, along with former \nU.S. marine, Amir Hekmati, and Washington Post journalist, Jason \nRezaian; but we need to do more. We need to return Pastor Saeed to his \nhome family now.\n  As I was thinking about this whole process and speaking about it, I \nactually thought back to the original Mayflower Compact, so I looked it \nup. The words--it is amazing--still ring true, Mr. Speaker.\n  Allow me remind us just for a moment of those words. It reads:\n\n       IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN. We, whose names are underwritten, \n     the Loyal Subjects of our dread Sovereign Lord King James, by \n     the Grace of God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, \n     King, Defender of the Faith, etc., Having undertaken for the \n     Glory of God, and Advancement of the Christian Faith, and the \n     Honour of our King and Country, a Voyage to plant the first \n     Colony in the northern Parts of Virginia; Do by these \n     Presents, solemnly and mutually, in the Presence of God and \n     one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a \n     civil Body Politick, for our better Ordering and \n     Preservation, and Furtherance of the Ends aforesaid: And by \n     Virtue hereof do enact, constitute, and frame, such just and \n     equal Laws, Ordinances, Acts, Constitutions, and Officers, \n     from time to time, as shall be thought most meet and \n     convenient for the general Good of the Colony; unto which we \n     promise all due Submission and Obedience.\n       IN WITNESS whereof we have hereunto subscribed our names at \n     Cape-Cod the eleventh of November, in the Reign of our \n     Sovereign Lord King James, of England, France, and Ireland, \n     the eighteenth, and of Scotland the fifty-fourth, 1620.\n\n  Ronald Reagan--in closing--said it best. He said:\n\n       The most essential element of our defense of freedom is our \n     insistence on speaking out for the cause of religious \n     liberty.\n\n  That is why we are here today, and I hope and am proud to stand with \nRepresentative Collins in continuing to stand for those who cannot \nstand for themselves.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate those words, and \nI think it is not just in faraway places. We are also dealing with this \nkind of issue in this hemisphere as well.\n  Just a little closer to home, southern Mexico even has experienced \ngrowing religious tensions over the past year. In a country in which 90 \npercent of Mexico's population identifies as Catholic, the Mexican \nConstitution even has long protected freedom of worship.\n  There is growing hostilities against Protestantism. In fact, the \nhighlands of southern Mexico have a history of sectarian violence. Just \na few decades ago, conflict led to hundreds of deaths and the \ndisplacement of 30,000 Protestants.\n  Right now, the conflict has arisen once again. Protestants have had \ntheir lands seized, utilities cuts, and appeals for government \nassistance has fallen on deaf ears. There are also reports of violence, \ndeath threats, and forcible expulsions of hundreds of victims from \ncommunities in recent years.\n  You don't have to go all over the world to see that we have this rise \nof religious intolerance around. That is a basic right, as Congressman \nWalker stated. Even in the U.N., it is one of those rights that is laid \nout in article 18, that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, \nconscience, and religion.\n  A right includes freedom to change his religion or belief in freedom, \neither alone or in a community with others or in public or private, to \nmanifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and \nobservation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my dear friend from California, \nRepresentative Vargas, for more, as we have been hearing from our \nfriends.\n  It is all over, and we need to continue to shine this light.\n  Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to thank Mr. Franks from \nArizona and Mr. Walker from North Carolina and especially you, \nRepresentative Collins, for your remarks and your leadership on this \nissue. Thank you.\n  I would also like to conclude my remarks today by highlighting a few \nother key issues. According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, \nthere are more than 50 million refugees around the world, half of which \nare women and children.\n  Religion is a key factor in humanitarian crises worldwide, as we saw \nearlier this year, with a record number of refugees attempting to cross \nthe Mediterranean to seek asylum.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  In this Congress, I have also introduced legislation--the Protecting \nReligious Minorities Persecution by ISIS Act of 2015--to address the \nplight of religious minorities in ISIS-held territories.\n  Additionally, there are far too many people imprisoned for religious \nbelief and religious freedom advocacy. We heard already about Mr. Saeed \nAbedini.\n  I would also like to take a moment to focus on the issue of prisoners \nof conscience around the world by highlighting the plight of Behnam \nIrani of Iran, as detailed in the U.S. Commission on International \nReligious Freedom's Defending Freedom Project Prisoner's List: Behnam \nIrani is an evangelical Christian leader from Iran who led a 300-member \nchurch of Iran in Karaj, a city less than 15 minutes outside the \ncapital of Tehran. In 2011, Irani was sentenced to 6 years' \nimprisonment for his Christian activities after a raid on a house \nchurch in Karaj. In September 2014, Mr. Irani was hit with 18 \nadditional charges, including Mofsed-e-filarz, which means ``spreading \ncorruption on Earth,'' a crime punishable by death. However, in October \n2014, this charge was dropped and Irani was sentenced instead to 6 \nyears' imprisonment due to his alleged acting against national security \nand forming a group to overthrow the government. In total, Pastor Irani \nis expected to serve a total of 12 years in prison and is, therefore, \ndue for release in 2023. Mr. Irani has faced numerous health problems \nwhile in prison, including severe bleeding due to stomach ulcers and \ncolon complications. Mr. Irani is married and has a daughter and a son.\n  Lastly, I would like to bring a spotlight to the increase in anti-\nSemitism in Europe. According to numerous reports, there has been an \nincrease of anti-Semitic acts in France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, \nAustria, Italy, and Germany between 2013 and 2014.\n  These include violent acts and attacks with an anti-Jewish \nmotivation. Earlier this year, the world saw four Jewish patrons being \nmurdered during an attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris, France.\n\n[[Page H5458]]\n\n  We must continue to partner with and support Jewish communities \naround the world to mitigate these anti-Semitic attacks.\n  With that, I again would like to thank my Republican colleagues and \nall of my colleagues for their support on this issue. Again, I would \nlike to thank, in particular, my colleague and friend from Georgia (Mr. \nCollins).\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Thank you for being here, Congressman Vargas.\n  I think there are many things that we can stand for. Nothing, I \nthink, more basic to our liberties not only here in our country, but \naround the world, is just standing for, as Congressman Walker just \nsaid, those who can't stand for themselves, who are right now being \npersecuted simply for the act of a conscious belief, the act of having \na faith that others disagree with.\n  I think that is why we are here tonight, Mr. Speaker, to talk about \nthis in terms of things that we can do and things that we can \nhighlight.\n  One of the issues that is concerning to me--and it is going to be \ndebated in this Chamber later--is, when we are dealing with countries \nwho have--and we have talked about this today with Iran--dealing with \ncountries who encourage religious persecution. They have issues with \nthis. And we yet enter into agreements without discussing those.\n  My concern is, in matters of trade and business, all international \nleaders come to our President, our Ambassadors, our State Department, \nour government officials. Whenever they come and trade in business--and \nthey want to do business because this is the market that everybody \nwants--then this is our time to bring this up.\n  It is in those times that we bring up the persecution. It is in those \ntimes that we bring up the five that are held in Iran. It is in those \ntimes that we stand for them while they are shackled and cannot stand \nfor themselves.\n  We have to get over this ridiculous notion that we shouldn't bring up \nreligious liberty in certain contexts because we don't want to offend \nanyone.\n  We are worried about causing offense while men, women, girls, and \nboys are being raped, killed, crucified, and losing their lives. No \nAmerican faces a barbaric State-sponsored death sentence simply because \nhe or she believes a different religion than a neighbor.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is part of the freedom that we have. It is a part \nof the freedom that has been given to us by those who have passed \nbefore us.\n  I have always believed that we stand on the freedoms in this country \ntoday of the Constitution and the charters that have gone before us and \nnot only what they did to sign their names to the Declaration of \nIndependence, to sign their names to the Constitution, but to say that \nwe will fight for those rights and those men and women who have died \nover the years, to say these are worth fighting for.\n  There have even been issues in our own country of intolerance. And \nwhat we have to understand, from my perspective even as an Air Force \nchaplain, is there have been more discussions on what is right and how \nwe are going to stand up for what we believe.\n  As an Air Force chaplain, I am there not only from my faith \nbackground that I have, but for all, whether they have a hard-and-fast \nfaith, a faith that is just being developed or they have no faith at \nall.\n  That is what a chaplain is there for, is to present encouragement and \nto preserve the religious freedoms and protections that we have.\n  If we back up on that, if we back up on the basic freedoms such as \nreligious liberty, freedom of conscience, these things that we take for \ngranted, this human rights issue in our country, then what else are we \ngoing to back up on? If we start messing with the fundamental pillars, \nwhere will it end?\n  The light that shines brightest here is the one that shines brightest \nacross the seas. We cannot let this issue continue to just become dull \nto us by simply reading headlines on a page, maybe saying a prayer for \nthose in need, or believing that a book of martyrs is something that \nused to happen and not anymore.\n  Today there are those around the world who are simply dying or being \npersecuted because of their own conscience, because of their belief \nthat they hold. That is wrong.\n  It is time for us to use all of our resources here in the freest \ncountry in the world, to say: We are not going to stand for it. We need \nto make this the light.\n  I thank Congressman Vargas again and those who have come in to be a \npart of this, to make sure that this light is not dim. It is something \nthat will continue to shine brightly.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/house-section/article/H5458-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5458-H5461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER \n                             PROTECTION ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today on this fifth \nanniversary of Dodd-Frank to reflect a little bit on a signal piece of \nlegislation that, to this day, remains controversial.\n  Dodd-Frank, of course, was a response to the worst economic meltdown \nthat we have seen in this country since the Great Depression of the \n1930s.\n  I want to reflect back on what led to the need for Dodd-Frank, the \nimpact that that Great Recession, as we have come to call it, had on \nAmericans and American families all over this country and then think a \nlittle bit about what Dodd-Frank has and has not done in the 5 years \nsince its passage.\n  It remains a controversial piece of legislation. All you have to do \nis look at the steady stream of press releases from the majority party \non financial services.\n  I have a few here:\n  Dodd-Frank has enshrined too big to fail into law.\n  Obama claimed Dodd-Frank would lift the economy. It has done the \nopposite, despite the fact that we learned today, of course, we have \ngot one of the lowest jobless rates in a very, very long time.\n  Financial crisis was caused by Washington's dumb regulations. That \nwould come as a surprise to pretty much anybody with economic know-how \nwho saw the long chain of malfeasance and irresponsibility in the \nmortgage market that actually led to the crisis.\n  Dodd-Frank is setting the stage for the next crisis.\n  ``Dodd-Frank Act leaves America less stable, less prosperous, less \nfree.''\n  These are truly extravagant claims.\n  So let's back up a little bit and remember January of 2009. That \nhappens to be the month that I was given the privilege of serving in \nthis Chamber.\n  It came after the last quarter of 2008 in which the United States' \neconomy actually shrank at an 8 percent rate on an annualized basis.\n  The economy was very literally melting down. The stock market was \nhalf of what it is today. Businesses were closing.\n  Americans saw literally trillions of dollars of value--let's talk for \na second about what ``value'' means.\n  ``Value'' means that retirement fund that you were relying on in \norder to retire. It means the money that you had set aside in a \nbrokerage account to educate your children.\n  It means those savings that you had accumulated over many, many years \nof foregoing that vacation or scrimping on the budget, those things. \nAll of that, for many Americans, was wiped out or cut in half, \ndevastation.\n  And, by the way, in January of 2009--I remember this--though the \nbailout had passed this House what was known as the TARP, the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program, and though that had been put into place by the \nUnited States Congress and seemed to have stabilized the market, at \nleast temporarily, we worried day in and day out as to whether this--\nlet's face it--obnoxious measure--I don't think there is anybody who \nthinks in a free market system there should be bailouts--this \nobnoxious, politically toxic measure which, nonetheless, reasserted \nsome stability in the financial services sector--nobody really knew if \nit was enough.\n  I remember wondering whether we might not see a bankruptcy in a money \ncenter bank, a moment, perhaps, in which ATMs wouldn't have money in \nthem. This was January of 2009.\n  Most importantly--there are a lot of big words--asset values, this, \nthat, and the other thing, money center banks--this meant devastation \nfor millions of\n\n[[Page H5459]]\n\nAmericans who lost their jobs, for families who weren't going to be \nable to send their kids to school, who were going to have to postpone \nretirement, unemployment going into double digits, meaning that--and I \nspoke to one of my constituents yesterday who has an Ivy League degree \nwho found himself working as a clerk at Home Depot, surrounded by other \npeople with lots of education who were fortunate to have that job back \nin 2009, 2010 because the economy had been devastated by a financial \nservices industry and, yes, by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and \ninsufficient regulation and irresponsibility on the part of some of the \nregulators had devastated the economy and left the American people \nholding the bag.\n  So what happened? We went to work. We went to work in 2009. In 2010, \nwe passed the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act is a complicated, big \nthing, but it addressed every stage of that chain of irresponsibility \nand malfeasance, starting with the selling of toxic and explosive \nmortgages to families that brokers and others knew couldn't possibly \nrepay those mortgages to the bundling of those toxic mortgages into \ncomplicated securities which, frankly, you needed a Ph.D. to \nunderstand, to the fact that some of the credit rating agencies then \nput investment-grade AAA ratings on these toxic securities, to the fact \nthat derivatives were then written on these securities, derivatives \nthat were largely unregulated as the result of an act of this Congress, \na long line of malfeasance and irresponsibility of insufficient \nregulation and of regulation insufficiently enforced, a terrible market \npractice.\n  And, of course, in the middle of 2008, the chickens came home to \nroost and the economy was devastated and the American people, almost \nwithout exception, suffered.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  We saw the Troubled Asset Relief Program--the bailout--passed. \nImagine how shocking that is to the American people. I have lost my \njob; I have lost my home, and there is a bailout of these institutions \nthat I don't know a whole lot about; but I suspect, correctly, were at \nthe heart of this crisis.\n  No wonder we had political upheaval in this country after that \nhappened. Every step in that chain, Mr. Speaker, from toxic mortgages \nto securities that nobody understood, to credit rating agencies doing \nan awful job in evaluating those securities, to Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac acting irresponsibly, to regulators being asleep at the switch, \nDodd-Frank addressed every element of that set of problems which \ncombined to devastate the American economy and to hurt American \nfamilies.\n  Did it do it perfectly? Of course, it didn't do it perfectly. We were \nlegislating under conditions of great fear and heightened emotions, and \nat the end of the day, we are mortals addressing very, very complicated \nissues.\n  It was a good-faith effort to address what had clearly caused this \nproblem. This notion that the Republicans are peddling that it was \ncaused by Washington's dumb regulations is beyond insane because Dodd-\nFrank looked at what actually caused the problems of 2008 and addressed \nthem.\n  What happened? We were told that Dodd-Frank would be a job killer. \nThis was back in 2010 when anything that the then-Democratic Congress \ndid was going to be a job killer.\n  The Affordable Care Act which, as it turns out, has provided health \ninsurance to 16 million Americans, was going to be a job killer. Dodd-\nFrank was going to be a job killer. Everything was going to be a job \nkiller. When we turned the lights on in this room, it was a job killer.\n  You don't hear that much anymore because, since those fantastic \ndescriptions of job-killing legislation, we have added almost 13 \nmillion jobs to the economy. The unemployment rate today is as low as \nit was before the meltdown of 2008.\n  The stock market has doubled since then, business confidence is up, \nbusiness investment is up, and our capital markets are healthy. This \nidea that it was going to be job-killing was just flat-out wrong, \ncertainly compared to the crisis, which was the true job killer.\n  Mr. Speaker, the other accusation that was made, of course, was that \nDodd-Frank was going to crush credit markets, that the sources of \nfinancing that a family needs to buy a home or to send a child to \ncollege, the sources of financing that give rise to startup companies, \ncompanies like Google which didn't exist 25 years ago, venture capital, \nthe stock market that, of course, gives equity to our businesses to \ngrow and expand and employ more, those were going away because of Dodd-\nFrank. The criticisms leveled and the predictions made about the credit \nmarkets were apocalyptic.\n  Let's take a look at what actually happened. I assembled a little bit \nof the data here just to show what has happened in the credit markets. \nWe all love venture capital, that iconic image of the entrepreneurs in \nthe garage developing a product that grows into a multibillion-dollar \ncorporation that provides an electronic device that changes our lives \nand that makes our lives better--venture capital.\n  Here is the line. Venture capital at the start of Dodd-Frank and, \ntoday, that is a line running up and to the right.\n  Let's look at total consumer credit. You want to buy a car; you want \nto buy a television set. Consumer credit, we all use it. At the start \nof Dodd-Frank, 5 years ago--and today--a dramatic increase in consumer \ncredit.\n  Stock market--the stock market, of course, is where established \ncompanies go to raise money and where we put money hoping it will grow. \nWhat has happened there? A near doubling of the stock market--robust.\n  Commercial and industrial loans--what if you are a business and you \ndon't want to raise money in the stock market, you want to borrow \nmoney? Commercial and industrial loans--every one of these lines which \ncapture most of the financing mechanisms and how healthy they are \nrunning at the point in time when Dodd-Frank was started to today is \nrunning strongly upwards.\n  All of those criticisms that it was going to crush the credit markets \nare completely rebutted by pretty much anything that is happening in \nthe credit markets today.\n  Let's just spend a minute, Mr. Speaker, on what was actually in Dodd-\nFrank because this is pretty complicated stuff. What was actually in \nDodd-Frank were a couple of important ideas, that we should have \nsomething called a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that says to \ncredit card companies, No, you can't switch the order of a purchase to \nmake it look like somebody overdrew an account or spent too much money \nso that you can charge a $25 fee; that said to mortgage brokers, No, \nyou can't put somebody into an inappropriately risky or high-cost \nmortgage just because you make more money for doing so.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have standards in our country. You can't buy a \ntoaster that will burn down your house. You can't buy a car that will \nexplode when you turn on the ignition. That happens because we have \nminimum safety standards.\n  If you can't buy a toaster that will burn down your house, why should \nyou be allowed to be sold a mortgage that very clearly will cause you \nto lose your house? That is what the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau does, and it has returned literally millions and millions of \ndollars to the American public as a result of its telling those cheats, \nthose people who would prey on the financial naivete of the American \npeople: You can't do that anymore; and if you do it, we are going to \nshut you down, and you are going to give the money back.\n  That is what the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is doing today.\n  Mr. Speaker, the second important thing that Dodd-Frank did was to \nsay, for the first time, that maybe we ought to regulate this \nderivatives market. Now, derivatives are a fairly complicated financial \ninstrument.\n  Most Americans don't use derivatives directly and don't necessarily \nknow what they do. They are essentially bets, and that is okay. If you \nwant to bet that oil prices are going to go up or down because you use \noil, you ought to be able to take that bet to hedge your risk. That is \nokay.\n  But in the early 2000s, the derivatives market had become very \nliterally nothing but a betting game for people who simply wanted to \nroll the dice on the mortgage market or on the direction of a corporate \ncredit or on the stock market.\n\n[[Page H5460]]\n\n  You could take any bet. People would lend you money; you could place \nthat bet, and off you went. That is, of course, what brought down what \nwas otherwise an iconic American insurance company, AIG. This was truly \na storied insurance company that got into the derivatives business and \ntouched off the crisis.\n  Shockingly, by law, the derivatives market, even though it is more \ncomplicated and larger than the stock market, by law, was not \nregulated. When you wanted to buy or sell a derivative, you picked up \nthe phone; you called your broker; you did the deal, and nobody \nnecessarily knew about it.\n  That obviously doesn't happen in the stock market. You go through a \nbroker; the trade gets registered, and the SEC looks over the shoulder \nof the market to make sure it operates in a safe and sound fashion.\n\n  By law, the derivatives market was unregulated and untransparent, and \nDodd-Frank said that does not make sense and said that, if you are \ngoing to trade derivatives, you are going to do it over an exchange, \nthe way we trade stocks. If you are going to trade derivatives--\nparticularly risky ones--you are going to put up capital against the \nbet you are taking so that if you lose, you can pay it off.\n  That is what happened with AIG. They took a whole lot of very big \nbets that they had no ability to pay off when they lost.\n  Who lent them the money to take those bets, Mr. Speaker? It was banks \nand brokerages who, when they found out that the bet they thought they \nwon, there was no money coming to them, that is when we got into real \ntrouble at places like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.\n  We said, crazy though it may sound, a market as complicated and as \nlarge as the derivatives market ought to be subject to the same \ntransparency and regulation that the stock market has been subject to \nsince the 1930s. That is what Dodd-Frank did.\n  Finally--Dodd-Frank did a lot, but this is another really big thing--\nDodd-Frank said we ought to actually have a mortgage market that is a \nlittle friendlier to the American people because, for most Americans, \nthe savings that they have is in their homes.\n  For generations, until 2008, generally, home prices had gone up. \nLet's face it, the middle class works pretty hard not making a lot of \nextra money. The growth in the value of their home was the way you \namassed a nest egg to retire or to buy that vacation cabin, whatever it \nwas you aspired to do; yet by 2008, this had become yet another \ndangerous casino.\n  It was true at the time, though it is not true anymore, that a broker \ncould sell a mortgage to a family that was a lot more expensive and a \nlot riskier than it needed to be because that broker could get paid \nmore in commission for selling that more complicated, more risky \nmortgage than that broker would get paid for selling a plain vanilla \nmortgage.\n  Those days are gone. Those days are gone, and that is a very, very \ngood thing for the American people. Remember, homes are where people--\nmost people--have their savings. That is what Dodd-Frank was.\n  My friends on the Republican side who have these incredible \nstatements, like the financial crisis was caused by Washington's dumb \nregulations, fail to see that Dodd-Frank was actually a proportionate \nand targeted response to a truly devastating financial crisis that had \nreal impact on an awful lot of families.\n  I am sorry about that. The reason I am sorry about that is because \nDodd-Frank, of course, is not perfect. There are clearly issues around \nsome things like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which Dodd-Frank was \nsilent on.\n  Today, the vast majority of American mortgages are still explicitly \nbackstopped by the Federal Government because we didn't reform Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac.\n  Shame on both parties for that, by the way. We had a lot to do when \nthe Democrats were running the show, and we didn't get to that point. \nIn the many years since the Republicans have been controlling this \nChamber, they have not taken that up. We should take that up. I am very \nproud to be, along with Congressman Delaney and Congressman Carney, a \nsponsor of legislation which would do just that.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is still difficulty for Americans who should \nprobably qualify for a mortgage in getting that mortgage. It is \npossible that Dodd-Frank swung the pendulum a little far in the \nmortgage market in a way that we ought to look at and be very, very \ncareful about because, remember, at the core of the crisis in 2008 were \nmortgages that an awful lot of people shouldn't have been in, an \novercommitment on the part of public policy and others to make every \nAmerican a homeowner, to make it cheap, and to have outrageously \ncomplicated mortgages so that could happen. Carefully, we ought to look \nat what is happening in the mortgage market today.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are more technical issues. There are questions \nabout whether there is enough liquidity in the mechanisms, particularly \nbonds, that companies use to finance themselves.\n  There are fair questions about whether we have adequately dealt with \nthe question of too big to fail. Dodd-Frank certainly put profound \nstrictures on large institutions. It gave the government unprecedented \nauthority to look into the so-called too-big-to-fail institutions and \nsay: Sorry, you have got to shrink down. You have got to get out of \nthis business.\n  It put additional capital--in fact, just this week, the Federal \nReserve announced the additional capital that large institutions will \nbe required to set aside. It is a fair debate as to whether or not we \nhave truly dealt with the question of too big to fail.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the rub: as long as the discussion we have about \nDodd-Frank is a near religious discussion with my friends in the \nRepublican Party making statements like Dodd-Frank should be repealed, \nthe Dodd-Frank Act leaves America less stable, less prosperous, and \nless free; and, yes, frankly, as long as the Democrats don't open the \ndoor to the notion that we may not have gotten it perfectly right on \neach one of its pages, we won't be able to come together to do \nsomething which is essential in any piece of legislation, but \nparticularly in financial regulation, which is to adapt and allow the \nregulatory structure to change to reflect changing conditions.\n  There are very few markets as adaptive, that change more rapidly, \nthat innovate for good and for ill, as rapidly as the financial \nservices market. As a result, we need a regulatory apparatus that \nadapts along with the market, that looks for new threats, and that \nrealizes that the regulation of 40 years ago actually doesn't make a \nlot of sense today.\n  This near religious conflict that we have with the Republicans \nsaying, You ought to do away with the whole darn thing--they say that, \nof course, they have never actually brought legislation forward to \nrepeal Dodd-Frank which should cause you to ask, Mr. Speaker, how \nserious they are about truly repealing it, but as long as that is the \nconversation--repeal or don't change a word of this legislation--we \ngive up the opportunity to make it better and to make it change with \nthe underlying conditions that it seeks to regulate.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  That is where we need to go. We need to acknowledge that Dodd-Frank \nhas done some very, very good things, that it has addressed some \ncatastrophic problems, that it took on behavior that is embarrassing to \ncontemplate when looked back 5, 10 years, but that maybe we didn't get \nit 100 percent right and start that conversation.\n  We should do that to make sure that American families are never put \nin the position they were put in back in '09. We should do that because \nthe truth is that the financial services industry is crucial to \nprosperity in this country.\n  If you want to buy a house, educate a child, buy a car, invest in a \ncompany, start a company, grow a company, you have to have access to \ncapital. One of the competitive advantages of this country is our \nincredibly liquid and efficient capital markets. It is a big part of \nwhy we are as prosperous as we are today.\n  But if we can't acknowledge that the regulatory structure has to \nadapt and change, we risk either putting Americans at risk one more \ntime or damaging these incredible capital markets that are truly a \nnational competitive advantage of the United States, one of the reasons \nwe are the center of innovation on the planet.\n\n[[Page H5461]]\n\n  I think, Mr. Speaker, we can get that balance right. I think we just \nneed to take the temperature down, approach this from the standpoint of \nwhat makes sense, acknowledge that we all have good ideas, and move \nforward so that we remain innovative, we keep our competitive \nadvantages, but we never, ever allow the American people to suffer the \nway they did starting in 2008.\n  So looking back over 5 years, I think Dodd-Frank was a tremendous \naccomplishment. It really addressed a cataclysmic problem. But it \ndoesn't stop there. I urge my colleagues to recognize that we have \ntaken a very big step in the right direction, but the next step demands \nus to be constructive and remember that we can find a balance between \ninnovation and liquid and strong capital markets and the protection of \nour constituents.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/house-section/article/H5461-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5461-H5463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Buck). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we had a statement from the White House \nspokesman yesterday at a White House press briefing in which he had \nsaid that the Republicans have ``no one to blame but themselves.''\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I thought it would be helpful if we looked at the \nstatements he made about the vast amount of crime in America \ndisproportionately being committed by people who are illegally in the \nUnited States.\n  First, the White House spokesman said it included--and he is talking \nabout the President's bill and how if the House had passed that, then \nall our problems are over. And he said about the President's bill, it \nincluded a historic investment in border security.\n  Well, let me help. Obviously, he is just not up on what the law said. \nHe hadn't read it as I had. But what it did is it set forward a plan to \nhave a plan made by Homeland Security within so many months. It has \nbeen a good while since I looked at it, but they had all kinds of time \nto put together a plan. And then that would be looked at by GAO, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, as I recall, and then they had so \nmuch time, a vast amount of time, to analyze that to see if the \nsituational awareness and occupational control would be adequate under \nthe plan that was being proposed by Homeland Security, the very people \nthat have not secured the border so far.\n  And then as time went on, I believe at the end of 5 years, it got \nreally serious. If the border occupational control and situational \nawareness were not adequate, then there was a real tough penalty, and \nthat was that the, I believe it was, Secretary of Homeland Security had \nto give a report on why it was not adequately controlled.\n  Look, the Senate bill was a disaster. It did nothing to control our \nborder. It was the same kind of gobbledygook we have been dealing with \nfor quite some time from the White House.\n  And we have said consistently, as Republicans in this House, most of \nus, if the President will secure the border, we will pass an \nimmigration bill that takes care of everything else. It is pretty \nbasic: secure the border, then we will deal with the people that are \nhere illegally.\n  Until the border is secured, then you are going to keep having people \nlike Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez coming back across. So it won't \nmatter how expansive a bill is and how much situational awareness there \nis on our borders or in our country; it won't matter because people \nlike Mr. Lopez-Sanchez will keep coming back.\n  We have got to have border security. That is all there is to it. Once \nthe border is secure, we can work everything else out. And I pointed \nout many times what I have learned on the border, what I have heard \nrepeatedly from our immigration officers, our border patrolmen, that \nthey are not allowed to properly secure the border.\n  We had this massive influx of people coming in, and apparently it is \nexpected to grow some more again this year, but we are not securing the \nborder. We let them come in. And once they are on our side of the \nborder, then we go ahead and ship them off. This had been going on for \nsome time.\n  One of the border patrolmen told me that, among the drug cartels and \nthe gangs in Mexico, the Homeland Security Department is called \n``logistics,'' after the commercial. I forget if it is FedEx or UPS, \none of them that say: Hey, we are the logistics. You give us your \npackage, and then we get it wherever you want it to go.\n  I asked just in the last couple of weeks the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity: Are you still shipping people all over the place? I didn't \nget an adequate answer. I am afraid the answer is: There is still the \nlogistics. We won't stop you at the border if you come across the \nriver, we are not going to have people out there at the river to stop \nyou from coming onto United States property. Now we are going to let \nyou get onto United States property, and then we are going to take you \nwhere you need to go. You may have to stay in a facility here or there. \nThat's the kind of thing that was going on that was luring more and \nmore people.\n  And as the border patrolmen, multiple, told me, Chris Crane has \ntestified about himself that every time somebody in Washington talks \nabout amnesty, talks about legalizing people that are here, it becomes \na massive draw, a lure to people to come into this country illegally. \nThat lures people to their deaths. It lures young girls into situations \nwhere they end up being sex slaves, we are told, that the sex \ntrafficking is horrendous, and that young girls coming up here are \noften raped on the way by the gangs bringing them.\n  And as one border patrolman had said, since he was Hispanic and he \nspoke better Spanish than many of the people coming across, he would \nask them the question they are required to ask about why did you come \nto America, and 90 percent of the time he said they would say to get \naway from gang violence. He would say in Spanish: Hey, some gringo may \naccept that, but you and I both know you paid a gang, some gang to \nbring you up here. So don't be telling me you came to get away from the \ngangs; you used a gang to get here.\n  And 90 percent of the time, their responses were: Well, yeah, that is \ntrue, but we were told to say we are getting away from gang violence.\n  Well, the spokesperson for the White House also said about the Senate \nbill it would also have ramped up Interior enforcement of immigration \nlaws against dangerous individuals.\n  Well, in Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez' case, the immigration laws \nwere being enforced to some extent, not completely, but to some extent. \nHe had been to prison a number of times. He violated the immigration \nlaws and had illegal reentry, been deported five times. So at least on \nfive occasions, the Interior enforcement was happening. The issue was \nthat the Bureau of Prisons released him to a sanctuary city of San \nFrancisco and not to ICE, and San Francisco released him then to walk \nfreely.\n  So, even if we followed the White House advice and ramped up Interior \nenforcement, which clearly this administration has no intention \nwhatsoever of doing--and I have stories to back that up shortly--then \nit would not have changed, in all likelihood, the outcome of that case. \nFor those who are tempted to say, ``You are making a big deal about one \ncase where a sweet young daughter was shot dead by somebody deported \nfive times, a criminal, a felon, multiple-time felon, but it is not \nthat big a deal,'' well, it is a big deal.\n  Just recently, we had an article, the 7th of July of this year, \nwritten by Caroline May, headline, ``Illegal Immigrants Accounted for \nNearly 37 Percent of Federal Sentences in FY 2014.''\n  According to fiscal year 2014 USSC data, of 74,911 sentencing cases, \ncitizens accounted for 43,479, or 58 percent; illegal immigrants \naccounted for 27,505, or 36.7 percent; and legal immigrants made up for \n4 percent of those sentences.\n  As far as drug trafficking, illegal immigrants represented 16.8 \npercent of all drug trafficking cases. They represented 20 percent of \nthe kidnapping and hostage taking cases. They represented 74.1 percent \nof the drug possession cases, 12.3 percent of money laundering cases, \nand 12 percent of murder convictions.\n  Of the Federal murder convictions in America, 12 percent would not \nhave happened. Since this President has taken office, there are \nthousands of people who would not have been murdered if we enforced our \nimmigration\n\n[[Page H5462]]\n\nlaws and had a secure border. It is not just this precious girl in San \nFrancisco.\n  It is not a race issue. There are Hispanics being killed. There are \nHispanics being taken hostage. There are Hispanics being raped.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  There are Whites, Blacks, Asians--you name it. They are victims of \nillegal immigrant criminal activity.\n  It is absolutely outrageous for anyone in a government position to \nbelittle thousands of people being murdered, raped, kidnapped, and to \nbe so cavalier about it.\n  The White House says, well, the bill that they were plugging for \nwould have enhanced penalties for repeat immigration violators with \nsentences up to 20 years for certain illegal aliens who were convicted \nof felonies.\n  Look, there were laws in place, and they were violated. He had been \nto prison. Until you secure the border, people like Mr. Lopez-Sanchez \nare going to keep coming back. You have to secure the border.\n  He also said the bill would have increased penalties for passport and \nimmigration document trafficking and fraud.\n  Yes, like that would have stopped him. He came back across illegally \nfive times. It wasn't a passport issue. It is just pretty dramatic what \nkind of things have occurred.\n  I also filed a bill today--we have got some cosponsors--regarding the \nDistrict of Columbia. The District of Columbia, by authority of the \nConstitution, was empowered to Congress. We set up local control.\n  Some would say: Well, wait a minute. If you are trying to punish a \nsanctuary city like the District of Columbia, the only real Federal \ncity in the country, the only real city under congressional, \nconstitutional control, why don't you just leave it to the locals?\n  We did, and the local officials allowed it to become a sanctuary city \nthat was not enforcing the law.\n  So the bill that was passed today wasn't near as tough as I felt like \nit should have been. It wasn't near as tough of a bill as the King \namendment had been that we had previously passed with plenty of votes.\n  We could have passed it again today, but that is not the bill that \nwas brought. It is a good first step. It is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  That is why I ended up voting for it even though it was not as strong \nas the original King amendment. It is important to avoid having \nsanctuaries, refuges, for people who are felons, like the man who \nkilled Kate Steinle.\n  Then we have this story from July 22 by Elizabeth Harrington. It \npoints out that the Obama administration is not only planning on not \nenforcing the law, despite all the hogwash coming out of the White \nHouse press room, and not only are they not going to enforce the law, \nbut here is what is coming out.\n  The article points out:\n  ``The Obama administration is moving forward with plans to expand a \nwaiver program that will allow additional illegal aliens to remain in \nthe country rather than apply for legal status from abroad.\n  ``The Department of Homeland Security issued a proposed rule on \nTuesday that would make changes to a waiver program created by \nPresident Barack Obama's executive action on immigration in 2013,'' \nunconstitutional as it was.\n  ``The action created a waiver that primarily allowed illegal \nimmigrants with a U.S. citizen spouse or parent to stay . . . '' and it \ngoes into the specifics. ``The new rule expands eligibility to a host \nof other categories of illegal immigrants.''\n  Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for \nImmigration Studies, said:\n  `` `It's a very bad policy. It makes it possible for illegal aliens \nto avoid the consequences established by Congress to deter people from \nsettling here illegally and then laundering their status by adjusting \nto a green card.'\n  ``Vaughan, who has been following the issue for over 2 years, said \nthe changes to the waiver program would increase fraud.\n  `` `It is a slap in the face to the many legal immigrants who abide \nby the law, follow the process, and wait their turn,' she said. `In \naddition, it will increase the likelihood of fraud in the marriage \ncategories, which produce tens of thousands of new green cards each \nyear.'\n  `` `The President should not be issuing executive actions that serve \nonly to expedite the legalization process for those who have ignored \nour laws. This legalization gimmick is undermining the integrity of our \nlegal immigration system, and Congress should take steps to block it.'\n  ``The public will have 60 days to comment on the proposal.''\n  It appears to be yet another unconstitutional act by our President, \nstill seeming to thumb his nose at the judge in south Texas who had put \nan injunction on the last amnesty that was issued by the President. So \nthey are just going to keep going, apparently.\n  This article by Julia Preston has a title from The New York Times: \n``Most Undocumented Immigrants Will Stay Under Obama's New Policies, \nReport Says.''\n  ``Under new immigration enforcement programs the Obama administration \nis putting in place across the country, the vast majority of \nunauthorized immigrants--up to 87 percent--would not be the focus of \ndeportation operations and would have `a degree of protection' to \nremain in the United States, according to a report published Thursday \nby the Migration Policy Institute.\n  ``The report found that about 13 percent of an estimated 11 million \nimmigrants without papers, or about 1.4 million people, have criminal \nrecords or recently crossed the border illegally, making them \npriorities for deportation under guidelines the administration \nannounced in November.''\n  It makes it very clear that there is so much disingenuousness coming \nout of the White House.\n  Oh, yes, if we had passed this ridiculous bill that the Senate \npassed, which really was not going to address the issue of enforcement \nadequately, we were going to have studies and plans.\n  If it did not work in 5 years, heck, we would let the Secretary give \nus a report on why it didn't all work. I mean, it is absurd. Secure the \nborder. It is very basic. The President has got the power, and he has \ngot the money.\n  Heck, they just blew off the $4 billion virtual fence a few years ago \nthat we had appropriated money for. What are they doing with that \nmoney? Why haven't they secured the border with that? They could do it.\n  Just when you think news about people acting illegally and being \ngiven amnesty couldn't get much worse, this story by Steven Green, on \nJuly 20, by PJ Media, reads:\n  ``Iranian worshippers chant slogans during their Friday prayer \nservice at the Tehran University campus in Tehran, Iran, Friday . . . \nThe main prayer service in the Iranian capital has been interrupted by \nrepeated chants of `death to America'--despite this week's landmark \nnuclear deal with world powers that was welcomed by authorities in \nTehran.''\n  The devastating revelation from Mitch Ginsburg and the Times of \nIsrael reads:\n  ``Mojtaba Atarodi, arrested in California for attempting to acquire \nequipment for Iran's military-nuclear programs, was released in April \nas part of back channel talks, Times of Israel told. The contacts, \nmediated in Oman for years by close colleagues of the Sultan, have seen \na series of U.S.-Iran prisoner releases''--not exchanges, but \nreleases--``and there may be more to come.''\n\n  I mean, it is incredible. We are told we have seen the deal. Oh, yes. \nThere are parts, like the IAEA has got to work out its side deal that \nwe don't see here in Congress, but it is a good deal.\n  Let's not forget my friend who spoke last from the other side of the \naisle was talking about how great the Dodd-Frank bill is. Let me just \nsay this quickly about that.\n  As for the Dodd-Frank bill that was passed, supposedly, to punish \nthose evil investment banks on Wall Street, what has it really done? It \nhas punished the community banks that didn't do anything wrong.\n  They weren't invested in mortgage-backed securities. They weren't \ndoing all kinds of machinations to try to create new forms of legalized \ngambling on Wall Street. They weren't engaged in that.\n  Yet, Dodd-Frank has so punished community banks that every month\n\n[[Page H5463]]\n\nthere are fewer community banks. They are getting gobbled up by the \nguys who caused the problems. That is what Dodd-Frank did.\n  It added so much expense and burden on the local banks, and it \nprovided a lot of benefits to the biggest banks. They are the ones that \ncould absorb the parts of the law. We are losing banks constantly.\n  As far as the great economic news, we know we have at least 93-plus \nmillion people for the first time in our history--94 million people, \nmaybe, now--who have given up looking for jobs. It has never gotten \nthat high before.\n  It had gotten close once before, I think, under Carter, but it has \nnever gotten this high before. People have just given up looking for \njobs. You have got more on food stamps than ever before. Is that really \nsomething to be proud of? It is if you want indentured servitude of the \npeople of the United States.\n  The middle class, we hear now recently, is growing smaller. The gap \nbetween the ultra rich and the poor is growing bigger under this \nPresident's redistribution model because it doesn't work.\n  The most troubling economic statistic that anybody should have been \nseeing over the last few years--over the last 2 years--came out in \n2013, that, under President Obama, for the first time in American \nhistory--ever--95 percent of all of the income went to the top 1 \npercent income earners.\n  It still bothers me greatly. But I read, actually, that, even though \nthe top 1 percent is making 95 percent of all the income, it was a \nslower growth to them than in the last two expansions.\n  So it really was not that great of news for them. Well, it isn't \ngreat for America when 95 percent of the income is made by the top 1 \npercent.\n  It is just this wink and nod with Wall Street from this \nadministration of: We are going to call you fat cats. We are going to \npunish you. We are going to hit you with Dodd-Frank.\n  And what happens? You kill the smaller banks. You hurt the middle \nclass. You overburden the middle class. You make it more difficult for \nthem to live. More people end up on food stamps. It is a disaster.\n  That is why it was no surprise in the last couple of days when we saw \na report that there is a great majority of Americans who feels like \nthis President has hurt the economy more than he has helped it. I don't \nknow that that is true, but I do know that more people, according to \nthe poll, are saying that.\n  Capital markets and Wall Street, oh, they have done well. Yes, that \nis what happens when we create more money than at any time in American \nhistory. We are creating money.\n  Notice, Mr. Speaker, I am saying ``creating money'' because I learned \nit was improper to say we are printing more money than ever before.\n  I was told by someone with the Fed--some years back when I asked: \n``How much more money are we printing than we have ever printed?''--\n``Oh, none, really.''\n  ``But there is more money in the system.''\n  ``Oh, yes. We couldn't possibly print all of the money we are \ncreating.''\n  Are you kidding me? We are just adding numbers. We aren't even \nbothering to print it anymore as we are increasing money so fast. It is \nan outrage what has happened.\n  The bottom line is Americans are suffering. Government does not make \nthings better. It is better when they get a job, not more food stamps.\n  It is time that we knock Dodd-Frank down to size where it does deal \nwith the investment banks that caused the problem of 2008 and doesn't \npunish the banks that didn't get us in that trouble.\n  In the time I have left, I have just got to go back to this \nhorrendous Iranian deal. It is putting the United States and all \nfreedom-loving people at risk.\n  Iran cannot be trusted, and I am still concerned about the language, \nlike, if you say in a bill or in the Iran agreement, oh, yes, you can't \nuse ICBMs or develop them for 8 years or, at the broader conclusion of \nthe IAEAs, that nuclear material is being used for peaceful purposes, \nwhichever is earlier.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  That concerns me about the 8-year requirement. Is it really an 8-year \nrequirement, seriously? I mean, what does that mean? I went down and \ncleared that that was not classified, so I could speak of that. There \nare a few places where I have seen that that language, the broader \nconclusion by the IAEA, holy cow, that is completely out of our \ncontrol. That is one of the time deadlines that some of the important \ntiming can be?\n  Iran continues to make clear, as this story from July 12 from Adam \nKredo says, that Iran is saying, ``We will trample upon America.''\n  ``Iranian cleric Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Movahedi Kermani, who was \nhandpicked by the Islamic Republic's supreme leader to deliver the \nprayers, delivered a message of hostility toward the United States in \nthe first official remarks since a final nuclear deal was signed \nbetween Iran and world powers in Vienna last week.''\n  ``Analysts who spoke to the Washington Free Beacon about the anti-\nAmerican tone of last week's prayers said it is a sign Tehran believes \nit bested the United States in the talks.''\n  You think?\n  The article further down says: ``Iran's defense minister on Monday \nsaid the deal also will prohibit all foreigners from inspecting Iran's \n'defensive and missile capabilities' at sensitive military sites.''\n  You don't have to have my SAT scores to know they are going to be \nclassifying as many sites as they can as defensive sites that we cannot \nhave inspected.\n  It is time to say ``no'' to the deal. Americans need to rise up and \ndemand it, and let's crush the Iranian deal before Iran crushes Israel \nand the Great Satan, United States.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/house-section/article/H5463-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Clawson of Florida (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on \naccount of a family emergency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/house-section/article/H5463-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n EXPENDITURES BY THE OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL UNDER HOUSE RESOLUTION \n                          676, 113TH CONGRESS\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on House \n           Administration,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2015.\n     Hon.
