Mr. Speaker, a new report by U.S. Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement reveals that last year the Obama administration \nreleased 20,000 illegal immigrants convicted of crimes into our \ncommunities. Together, they had committed 64,000 crimes, including \nkidnapping, homicide, drunken driving, and sexual assault.\n  Instead of putting the safety of Americans first, the Obama \nadministration often gives a free pass to violent criminals who are in \nthe United States illegally.\n  This report should have been national news. However, many outlets, \nsuch as the L.A. Times, Washington\n\n[[Page H2346]]\n\nPost, and Associated Press, as well as the major television networks--\nABC, NBC, and CBS--failed to cover this horrific report.\n  The American people deserve to know the truth about our immigration \npolicies and the damaging consequences of the Obama administration's \nactions. When the national media intentionally fail to report the \nfacts, the American people are the ones who literally suffer the \nconsequences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/13/house-section/article/H2346-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TITAN ROBOTICS FROM TRINITY SCHOOL AT GREENLAWN\n\n  (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. WALORSKI.

And they proposed \na different label to inform consumers if the product is not recyclable.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend these kids for their hard work and wish them \nthe best of luck at their competition.\n  I also want to thank the parents, coaches, teachers, principals, and \neveryone in the community who supported them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/13/house-section/article/H2346-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE\n\n  (Mr. HARDY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HARDY.

That is why we are taking steps to \nprotect those endangered by this epidemic.\n  With bills passed this week, we are improving training and providing \nresources for medical providers and pharmacists, making sure that \nFederal agencies work better together, and reducing excess amounts of \nunused meds in the homes of patients with short-term needs so that \nexcess medicine can be available for those still in need instead of \nfalling into the hands of children and family members.\n  There is always more we can do and will do in the future, but today \nis the day that America has started on the road to recovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/13/house-section/article/H2346-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING MAYOR JOHN G.

Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise before \nthis body of Congress to recognize Dr. John Warner of Breckenridge, \nColorado. John has served on the town council of Breckenridge for 14 \nyears and the last 8 years as mayor.\n  Being mayor of one of the country's premier resort communities has \nits challenges, but John has guided his community through both growth \nand uncertainty with integrity and passion. His steadfast commitment to \nmaking the place that residents call home a better place is an \ninspiration to us all.\n  The hallmark of John's tenure was sustainability, and many important \nprojects resulted from his efforts, like the new recycling facility, \nthree solar projects, hybrid vehicles in the town's fleet, and a \nsustainability certification program for businesses.\n  Despite many complicated issues, John took each one with a calm \nassuredness and a balanced approach.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise to pay tribute to Dr. \nJohn G. Warner on behalf of the residents of the Second Congressional \nDistrict and myself.

Mr. Speaker, this week is indeed National Police Week, \na time to honor and commemorate the sacrifices of the courageous men \nand women who serve in law enforcement. They keep our communities \nstrong and our neighborhoods safe.\n  Today, I want to particularly recognize Sergeant John Schultz of the \nWheeling Police Department for his 20 years of service and for always \nputting others first.\n  Sergeant Schultz has not only been a proud police officer, but he has \nalso served abroad in Desert Storm and Desert Shield. For the last 5 \nyears, he has mentored local kids as a PRO at Wheeling Middle School.\n  His selfless service was evident last year when on June 2, he dove \ninto a public pool fully clothed in boots, shoes, and weapons to \nsuccessfully rescue a student who was unconscious at the bottom of the \npool.\n  For this courageous deed and his admirable and respected career, he \nhas been recognized by the National Association of Police Organizations \nfor honorable mention for the prestigious TOP COPS Award.\n  Let's congratulate him for this honor and thank all of his law \nenforcement colleagues who dedicate their lives every day to the well-\nbeing of all of our fellow citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/13/house-section/article/H2346-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2346-H2354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF S. 524, COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND \n                          RECOVERY ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, \nI yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. \nPolis), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on House Resolution 725, currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring this rule \nforward on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for \nconsideration of S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.\n  The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided among and \ncontrolled by the chairs and ranking minority members of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee and the Judiciary Committee.\n\n                              {time}  0915\n\n  The rule also provides for an amendment in the nature of a substitute \nthat consists of the 18 bills passed by the House this week to combat \nthe opioid epidemic. Under the rule, if S. 524 is passed, it will be in \norder for the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee to request \na conference with the Senate on the House-passed package of bills.\n  Let me just emphasize this again for Members so they will understand \nthe process. What we will do under the rule, if S. 524 is passed, it \nwill then be made in order for the chairman of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee to request a conference with the Senate on the House-passed \npackage of bills.\n  Each of these 18 bills included in the House package passed the House \nwith strong bipartisan support. The level of support for these bills is \na sign of the recognition that something must be done about the opioid \nepidemic.\n  You have seen Members who represent urban areas, Members who \nrepresent suburban areas, and Members like me who represent more rural \nareas support these bills. This problem does not discriminate. It is a \nnationwide issue, and it is taking a toll on communities all over our \ncountry. We need to act. With the passage of these bills, we are taking \ndecisive action.\n  The Senate bill, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, \nreceived unanimous support in that Chamber. I want to thank Senators \nPortman and Whitehouse for their leadership on that bill.\n  The House bills include elements of the Senate bill as well as \nadditional measures. It is my hope that the conference provided for by \nthese bills will yield the strongest possible measure. We need strong, \nswift, and decisive action to address the growing crisis of the opioid \nepidemic.\n  In the United States, more people die every year from drug overdoses \nthan car accidents. As the debate has taken place here on the floor \nthis week, I think the numbers have just been amazingly stark.\n  When you realize that a statistic like that, when the deaths from \ndrug overdoses surpass car accidents, then we are dealing with \nsomething that begins to put it in perspective.\n  My home State of Georgia has 159 counties. In 2012, prescription drug \noverdoses led to deaths in 152 of those 159 counties, totaling 592 \ndeaths. The opioid bills in the House package before us today help \nimplement measures to prevent these tragedies.\n  Addiction is happening far too often with devastating consequences. \nFurther, it is shown that prescription opioid abuse often leads to \nheroin abuse, compounding the problem. In fact, according to the \nCenters for Disease Control, 45 percent of people who used heroin were \naddicted to prescription opioid painkillers.\n  I mentioned this earlier in the week, but it is worth mentioning \nagain now. I have had many conversations with sheriffs in my area in \nthe Ninth District, which really runs on the I-85 corridor out of \nAtlanta and up into the northeast, and I keep in contact with them \nregularly.\n  My background with my father being in State Patrol, I know the law \nenforcement community very well. One of the first questions I always \nask them--and in my 10 years, I was in the State House for over 6 \nyears, and I have been up here now into my second term--I always ask: \nWhat is the biggest thing that you are seeing? What is the epidemic or \nwhat is the issue you most see?\n  Early on, it was methamphetamine. Especially in my rural area, my \nmountain area, methamphetamine still is very prevalent. But due to many \nof the restraints that were put in in Georgia--and I notice my friend \nhere from Georgia as well--we worked in the State legislature to \ncontrol the methamphetamine problem, and then the prescription opioid \nproblem has developed.\n  Now what my sheriffs will tell me and my law enforcement community \nand my city police and others will tell me is that heroin is by far \ntheir fastest growing issue that they are seeing. It is hitting not \njust urban areas, it is hitting suburban areas, it is hitting very \nrural areas, and it is hitting across the income gap. Those who have \nbeen addicted to prescription opioids now find that heroin is cheaper \nto purchase and is cheaper to access.\n  The problem is, unlike many of the prescription opioid painkillers, \nthe heroin issue is one in which they can take the first dose and it \nwould be their last. This is something we cannot continue to look away \nfrom.\n  In Georgia, heroin deaths have increased 300 percent. That statistic \nalone should be a call to action. Nationwide, the number of people it \naffects is staggering. CDC statistics on opioid abuse show 18,893 \noverdose deaths related to prescription painkillers, and 10,574 \noverdose deaths related to heroin in 2014.\n  The opioid epidemic affects everyone. I believe that most people \ncould tell you of a family member or friend who has suffered in some \nway because of this problem. And these problems aren't only affecting \nadults. They are affecting college-age students, high schoolers, \nchildren, and even the littlest among us, babies.\n  Every 25 minutes in our country babies are born with a dependency. \nThis is tragic. Babies born addicted to opioids often struggle to \nsurvive, have dangerous health complications, and suffer from serious \nwithdrawals.\n  These innocent children don't deserve this. They deserve a life full \nof promise. Instead, they face life-threatening challenges from the \nmoment they are born. We can do better, and should do better. In fact, \nthey suffer not only from the moment they are born, they are also \nsuffering in the womb as well. This is an epidemic we have got to \naddress.\n  Importantly, several of these bills in the House-passed package will \nhelp address this problem. For example, Congressman Lou Barletta \nintroduced H.R. 4843, the Infant Plan of Safe Care Improvement Act.\n  This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to \ndistribute information to States on best practices to develop safe care \nplans for infants affected by substance abuse and withdrawal symptoms.\n  H.R. 4978, the NAS Healthy Babies Act, introduced by Congressman Evan \nJenkins, requires a report on neonatal abstinence syndrome.\n  Another bill in this package deals with the problems that youth \nathletes may face if they are prescribed opiates for a sports-related \ninjury. H.R. 4969, the John Thomas Decker Act of 2016, introduced by \nCongressman Pat Meehan from Pennsylvania, requires the CDC to study \ninformation and resources available to youth and families regarding the \ndangers of opioid use and abuse.\n  Still other bills relate to veterans and how we can help them. For \nexample, the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act, introduced by \nMr. Sensenbrenner from Wisconsin, authorizes investments in veterans \ncourts.\n  I believe there is another conversation that is going on in Congress \nright now concerning our criminal justice and criminal justice reform \nand things that we need to do to make sure that not only are we not \nusing our jails as mental health facilities, but we are getting people \nthe help that they need.\n\n[[Page H2348]]\n\n  Some of the ways that you do that is found in treatment courts. Many \nof those are found in newer treatment courts, not just simply the \nsubstance abuse, but in veterans courts as well. We are going to \ncontinue to look at that.\n  In doing so, H.R. 4063, the Jason Simcakoski PROMISE Act, introduced \nby Congressman Gus Bilirakis, directs the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to jointly update the VA/DOD Clinical \nPractice Guideline, Management of Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain. The \nbill also requires the VA to expand opioid safety initiatives.\n  I am a chaplain still in the Air Force Reserve. I served in Iraq. I \nsaw firsthand the scars that the battlefield can leave, both physical \nand mental. We need support systems for our veterans like the ones \nprovided for in H.R. 5046 and H.R. 4063.\n  We need to address their pain, and we need to ensure they have an \navenue to get the help they need. I believe the bills this rule \nprovides for will take steps to make that happen. Our veterans deserve \nour very best.\n  We cannot discuss this package without mentioning the resources that \nthis bill provides for law enforcement. As the son of a Georgia State \nTrooper, this component is critically important to me.\n  The bill provides for law enforcement training. These measures also \nprovide for the expanded use of naloxone by law enforcement. Naloxone \ncan effectively reverse opioid overdoses, so it is a valuable tool to \nhave on hand.\n  Through the establishment of a comprehensive grant program that will \nprovide resources to law enforcement, communities, and States, and \ncombined with other bills, we have a real chance to make a difference \nhere today.\n  Mr. Speaker, addiction issues are often related to other co-occurring \ndisorders, including mental health issues. Addiction claims victims, \nand addiction is a disease. We must not turn a blind eye to those in \nneed.\n  We must work to halt the opioid epidemic. We must act to prevent more \ndeaths and to stop the growth and spread of this problem. The Senate \nbill, the House-passed bill, and the motion to go to conference are \nsteps towards doing that.\n  These bills were brought forward due to the hard work of many \nMembers. Over the course of this week, we have seen Members from every \nwalk of life, representing people from every walk of life, come to the \nfloor to speak on the opioid epidemic.\n  Each and every one of these Members have made statements to show the \ndepth and breadth of this problem to the real people that we are sent \nhere to represent. Through the 18 House-passed bills and the conference \nwith the Senate, we have a chance to ease that problem, to actually \ncombat it.\n  These bills call for further studies to examine the response of the \nopioid crisis, provide support for doctors' treatment of abusers, and \nalso to help law enforcement efforts to combat drug trafficking.\n  Neighborhoods and families are being torn apart by heroin addiction \nand opioid abuse. Communities like my home in northeast Georgia need \nhelp to address this problem.\n  Through these bills, we are helping to provide that. Importantly, we \nare also providing enough flexibility so that States can determine what \nwill work best for their specific populations and communities.\n  Many communities, many Members, and many staffers have worked hard to \nbring together these important reforms. I want to thank them for their \ndedication and hard work. These reforms are a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding me 30 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule today that provides \nfor consideration of S. 524.\n  As has been discussed on the floor this week, Mr. Speaker, our Nation \nis in the midst of an epidemic. While opioid abuse is nothing new, the \nnumbers are getting more and more alarming. Addiction claimed over \n28,000 lives in 2014 and drastically altered many more for the worst.\n  All week we have heard stories from both sides of the aisle speaking \nto how addiction is breaking apart families and communities. Today we \nare considering a package of bills that will hopefully take some \nmeaningful steps towards addressing this crisis.\n  Prescription drug addiction is a very complex issue. There is no \nsimple solution. It is a subject that deserves comprehensive debate and \nfull consideration of ideas that Democratic and Republican Members have \nto be able to address: this public health crisis.\n  While I and many of my Democratic colleagues are supportive of the \nunderlying legislation, there are problems with the process that have \nlocked out ideas that can save lives that are being prevented from \ncoming to the floor under this rule.\n  Of the 18 bills included under this rule, all but 2 were brought to \nthe floor on suspension. What does that mean? It means no Members--\nDemocratic or Republican--were allowed to amend or improve 16 of these \n18 bills.\n  The scope of the two bills that were brought forward in a manner that \nallowed amendments was so narrow that it closed out many of the \namendments that we considered in the Rules Committee because they \nweren't germane to these two particular bills. I find that very \nfrustrating. It limits discussion on a major public health crisis, \nsomething that is an issue that is not at all partisan.\n  Many bipartisan amendments that I will talk about in a moment, many \nideas from Republicans and Democrats, were simply not even allowed to \nbe considered in this process. Amendments that would save lives, \namendments that families would be grateful for, and amendments that \nwould reduce opioid abuse in our country are not even allowed to be \nconsidered here on the floor of the House.\n  These were not amendments with an ideological agenda. Sometimes we \nare down here on a bill that is highly ideological and there are \namendments that are locked out that would change it drastically or gut \nit. No, these are good faith efforts and ideas from the experiences \nthat many of us have had back in our own districts as to how we can \naddress this opioid abuse crisis that we are facing nationally.\n  Among the amendments that should have been allowed this week and why \nI am urging my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule--one amendment \nthat was locked out was a bipartisan amendment by Representatives Ann \nKuster and Frank Guinta, my colleagues from New Hampshire, which is \nreally one of the ground zero areas for this crisis, offered a \nbipartisan amendment to H.R. 4641 that would have allowed HHS to award \ngrants to recovery community organizations.\n  Their amendment acknowledges that recovery is a long road. For any of \nus, including myself, who have known people who have been in recovery \nfrom drug addiction, they know it is difficult. It is a real test of \ninternal fortitude for them. Of course, their community and family need \nto rally around and support their sobriety.\n  We need to be supporting not only prevention and initial treatment, \nbut also lifetime support for the lifetime struggle to pull people out \nof the vicious cycle of addiction. This amendment that was blocked \nunder this rule took the long view that, to address this crisis, we \nneed the long-term support of recovery community organizations.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Now, we know how pressing this issue is for our New Hampshire \ncolleagues, Republican and Democratic. So why not open up this process \nto allow their idea to be debated on its merits?\n  If Members of Congress found it lacking merit, of course, it would be \nthe prerogative of Members of this body to vote it down; but at least \nhave that debate, and I honestly think that it likely would have \npassed.\n  Representatives Katherine Clark and Evan Jenkins offered a bipartisan \namendment to H.R. 4641--again, locked out under this rule. We are not \nallowed to debate it, and we are not allowed to vote on it.\n  Their proposal, very simply, would have authorized grants for the \ncreation of comprehensive systems to provide support for prescribers \nwith regard to patient pain and substance abuse. According to a study \nin the Journal of Opioid Management, fewer than half of primary care \nproviders felt sufficiently\n\n[[Page H2349]]\n\ntrained in prescribing opioids. This would have helped address that \ntraining gap of prescribers so that they would less often use opioids \nand more frequently use alternative pain reduction prescriptions. It is \nour doctors and nurse practitioners and nurses who are on the front \nlines. They need to be adequately prepared to deal with patients in \npain and with patients who are in the throes of addiction.\n  Again, unfortunately, under this rule, Katherine Clark and Evan \nJenkins' amendment is not allowed to be considered by this body.\n  I, personally, offered a bipartisan amendment with Mr. Rohrabacher of \nCalifornia that would have required the Pain Management Task Force, \ncreated in H.R. 4641, to take into consideration the potential for \nmarijuana to serve as an alternative to opioids for pain management.\n  Several private studies have yielded promising results. In 2014, the \nJournal of Pain found that those who suffer from chronic pain reduced \ntheir use of opioids by a significant margin when using marijuana for \nmedicinal purposes. Marijuana likely won't work in every instance where \nsomebody has chronic pain, but, where it does, you have a far less \nharmful, less addictive option with much more limited side effects than \nopioids and painkillers. We shouldn't be taking an option with limited \nside effects off the table when it could help free millions of \nAmericans from excruciating pain and crippling addiction.\n  Unfortunately, that amendment--simply an amendment to take into \nconsideration and study the issue--was also blocked under this rule.\n  Those are some of the many examples. As I mentioned, none of the \namendments made it out of the Rules Committee, and our colleagues will \nnot have the opportunity to weigh in on the House floor. A wide variety \nof amendments were blocked.\n  From a process perspective, this is really irresponsible of this \nbody, when responding to an epidemic of this complexity, to not debate \nand solicit ideas--bipartisan ideas, Republican ideas, and Democratic \nideas--from Members of this body and to find creative solutions that \ncan actually save lives and would be of great comfort to families who \nare affected.\n  My other concern is that the majority has authorized, but has not \nfunded or appropriated any of the programs under these bills. In \nFebruary, the President submitted a proposal that would have provided \n$1.1 billion in new funding to address this epidemic in enforcement and \ntreatment. Despite that, this bill has no funding for these efforts.\n  Combating addiction is truly a bipartisan effort. When close to 100 \nAmericans are dying from drug overdoses every day, we have to work \ntogether to change that. I think that, unfortunately, under this rule, \nwhile this might be some baby steps forward, we are falling short of \nthe mark of really being able to put our very best thinking and very \nbest solutions forward.\n  According to the CDC, since 1999, the number of prescription opioids \nsold in the United States has quadrupled despite no discernible change \nin the pain that Americans are reporting. So in a 15-year period, \nopioids are used four times as much. That is the precursor to this \nopioid addiction problem, and we need to do more to address that \noverprescription of opioids.\n  In my home State of Colorado, the statewide rate of drug overdose \ndeaths increased from 9.7 percent per 100,000 residents to 16.3 percent \nper 100,000 residents. Opioids were a major component of that.\n  Nationally, there have been even larger increases. Since 1999, deaths \nfrom prescription opioids, like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone, \nhave quadrupled. So it is no surprise the number of prescription \nopioids sold in the United States have quadrupled and deaths have \nquadrupled. It is no coincidence that those numbers are similar.\n  In 2014, almost 2 million Americans had some level of dependence on \nprescription pain relievers. This trend has especially dire \nconsequences during pregnancy, which one of our bills addresses. In the \nlast decade alone, over 130,000 infants were born with newborn drug \nwithdrawal symptoms.\n  Given the extremity of circumstances surrounding opioid abuse in this \ncountry, I am glad that this body is devoting some effort towards \ncasting a critical eye on what we can do; and I am saddened that this \nbody didn't have a more open process to include many of the ideas, \nwhich I mentioned earlier, from bipartisan Members of this body and \nothers that are simply locked out under this rule.\n  The Committee on Energy and Commerce reported out 12 bills. The \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs considered a bill to allow the Treasury \nDepartment to block international drug traffickers from using the U.S. \nfinancial system. The Committee on Veterans' Affairs passed out a bill. \nI was also pleased that the committee that I serve on, the Committee on \nEducation and the Workforce, took up a bill that I coauthored along \nwith Representatives Barletta and Clark and Chairman Kline and Ranking \nMember Scott and Representative Walberg--the Infant Plan of Safe Care \nImprovement Act--which directs child protective service agencies to \ndevelop a safe care plan to closely monitor the health outcomes for \ninfants who are born with this syndrome.\n  The scourge of opioid addiction has touched families in my district \nand across the country. No State has managed to avoid it. I stand in \nopposition to this rule because, truly, we need to do everything we can \nto address this emergency, including debating good ideas, creative \nideas from both sides of the aisle, and letting the Members decide, \nbased on their own experiences, their own creative solutions as to what \nwe can do to help combat this scourge that has affected our country.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), our only pharmacist \nin Congress, who, I think, has a very good insight into this.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nthank him for his long-time support of these types of issues, both as a \nmember of the Georgia State legislature and as a Member of this august \nbody. Representative Collins has consistently and very diligently \nworked on these issues. As the son of a law enforcement officer, he \nunderstands all too well the importance of making sure that our \ncommunities are safe, and I thank him for his support of this.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and of the House \namendment to S. 524. This week, the House has worked hard to pass 18 \nbills that address almost every facet of the opioid abuse epidemic.\n  We called for the creation of a task force to develop best practices \nfor pain management and prescribing pain medication. We have authorized \ngrants for local and State agencies to better fight this epidemic \nthrough better resources. We have expanded care for newborn infants who \nare affected by illegal substance abuse. We have improved comprehensive \nopioid abuse treatment to pregnant and postpartum women. We have also \ncreated safety measures for the use of opioids when treating veterans \nwho have chronic pain.\n  I am proud of the measures this body has passed that make up the \nHouse amendment to S. 524.\n  Mr. Speaker, our Nation is facing an opioid epidemic, and no \ncommunity is safe. It affects all communities across the Nation whether \nthey be urban, suburban, or rural.\n  Serving more than 30 years as a community pharmacist, I have \nwitnessed and participated in some of the greatest advances in the \nhistory of medicine. I have seen diseases that once required \nhospitalization become illnesses that are treated from home with \nmedication. I have seen an antibiotic regimen that once required four \ntablets each day for 10 days replaced with six tablets over 5 days. I \nhave seen a deadly disease, like hepatitis C, cured by medication in \njust 90 days. The advances that I have witnessed in medicine can truly \nbe called nothing more than miraculous, and that is important.\n  We need to recognize that this fight against the opioid epidemic is \ngoing to have to be a team effort. We are going to have to have \neveryone--all healthcare professionals--involved in this. Whether they \nbe doctors, nurses, pharmacists, PAs, APRNs--whoever--they have to be \ninvolved. Families\n\n[[Page H2350]]\n\nhave to be involved. Our communities have to be involved. Our \nlegislature has to be involved. This week, our Congress has taken the \nlead. I am very proud of that. I am very proud of the work that it has \ndone.\n  It is also going to take tools like the Prescription Drug Monitoring \nPrograms. While a member of the Georgia State legislature, I had the \nhonor of sponsoring the legislation that led to the creation of the \nGeorgia Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. That program has been a \ngreat tool in our toolbox to fight the opioid epidemic. Since that \ntime, we have tweaked that program and have made it even better, and it \ncontinues to get better. It continues to help us in our fight against \nthe opioids.\n  I mentioned the advances that I have witnessed in medicine. I am a \nbig fan of the pharmaceutical industry--a big fan, perhaps its biggest \nfan. What I have witnessed, again, has been miraculous. I call on the \npharmaceutical companies because right now there exists a gap, a gap in \ntreating pain. Right now we have available to us medication such as \nibuprofen and acetaminophen, and then we go to the opioids. There are \nvery few alternatives in between there in that gap--in that void, if \nyou will. Very few. Once you get past tramadol and a couple of others, \nthere is nothing else for us to use, there is nothing else for us to \nprescribe. I have confidence in the pharmaceutical manufacturers, and I \ncall on them to fill in that gap, to fill in that void. We need more \nalternatives, more choices.\n  Whether it is true or untrue, I can tell you that many patients don't \nbelieve that ibuprofen or acetaminophen, which you can buy without a \nprescription, will work as well as something that you can buy with a \nprescription. That is something we have to overcome, but there is \ndefinitely a void there that needs to be filled. Again, I am very, very \nconfident that the drug manufacturers and that the pharmaceutical \ncompanies can help us fill this void, and I call on them to do just \nthat.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a lifelong pharmacist, I have seen the struggles \nfirsthand that Americans face with opioid addiction. I have witnessed \nmy colleagues in the pharmacy profession, some who just could not \novercome that weakness and who succumbed to prescription drug abuse. I \nhave witnessed that. I have witnessed it with patients. I have \nwitnessed it with customers who have ruined their careers, who have \nruined their families, and who have ruined their lives because of \nopioid abuse. This is an epidemic. Certainly it is something that has \nto be addressed in our country.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this measure so we can \nimprove our efforts to raise awareness while working towards solutions \nto solve this health crisis. I encourage my colleagues to support this \nbill, and I applaud my colleagues.\n  This has been a very, very proud week for me to be a Member of the \nUnited States Congress. To see what my colleagues in this House have \ndone this week--as a pharmacist, as a healthcare professional--has made \nme very, very proud. We did good this week, and I am very proud to be a \nMember of this House.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nOregon (Ms. Bonamici), a member of the Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the critical legislative efforts on \nthe House floor this week to begin fighting the opioid crisis--an \naddiction crisis that has swept our country. There is much more work to \nbe done to combat this epidemic. This is an encouraging start, but we \nmust do more.\n  Too many communities in Oregon and across the Nation have seen the \ndestruction that is caused by addiction, and too many have experienced \nthe heartbreak of losing a child, a neighbor, a friend, or other loved \none to overdose. Last year, just in Portland, Oregon, there were an \naverage of two opioid deaths per week.\n  I think about Kerri, who is a mom from Knappa, in northwest Oregon. \nShe lost her son, Jordan, after a 7-year struggle. Jordan's addiction \nbegan when he had a football injury in high school, and his doctor \nprescribed Vicodin. My own family has not been immune to this \ndevastation. My brilliant and talented sister-in-law, Valerie, \nstruggled with chronic pain and struggled in her life with the many, \nmany opioids that were way too available. She relied on them to dull \nthat pain until she lost her life a few years ago.\n  Countless families and doctors and nurses and public safety officers \nhave all pleaded with us here in Congress to please act, to please save \nfamilies from this loss and heartbreak.\n  I am glad we have come together today to answer this call, but these \nare only the first steps. Healthcare and treatment providers must have \nthe resources they need to effectively curtail opioid abuse and \naddiction, and that means robust funding and better research and better \neducation. We have all stood on this floor today and called this an \nepidemic. Let's treat it as such. Let's continue building on this \nprogress.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, some of the things also we have \ntalked about today are education and prevention. It is also looking at \nthings that we can be a part of and do.\n  As I have said earlier today, the things that have stuck out to me \nare some of the statistics that have jumped out. I mentioned the one \nearlier that more are dying from prescription overdoses than in car \nwrecks.\n  Also, there are other practical ways that we can be a part. If you \nare suffering out there--and, Mr. Speaker, if there is someone who is \ngoing through this with either prescription opioid abuse or through \nheroin abuse and addiction--there are toolkits available.\n  In fact, we have posted on our social media a place where people can \ngo. It is from the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic. \nThere are places where they can go to find a parent toolkit, where they \ncan help their young children, also the young adults in their house, \nfrom middle school up through their 20s, on how we can best address \nsome of these real issues.\n  It was very disturbing to me recently in a magazine article that I \nread that someone who was addicted, not only to heroin but was going \nthrough it, made the statement--and this just shows you the concern \nthat is here--made the general statement that they were--there was this \nadrenaline rush when they were getting ready to shoot the heroin--is \nthat this may be the last time I shoot up. That was almost driving them \nto do that.\n  To think about how that plays out, think about a young person who is \nso addicted and who is so wrapped to a drug that they really, when they \ngo to put it in their body, knowing full well it could be the very last \ntime they do anything, and yet that was part of the reason that they \nwere doing it, that is just disturbing as we look at this.\n  There are also many other things that have come out. I think, as we \ngo through this--we had a constituent who, knowing what we are doing \nhere today, had looked to the pharmaceutical industry and who found \nideas that are out there, such as this one from a pharmaceutical \ncompany that is looking at abuse-resistant opioids that don't have the \nsame problems as we see in some of the others, such as OxyContin and \nsome of the others that we have out there.\n  I think this is about proper management. I appreciate what Mr. Carter \nfrom Georgia said on dealing with this and finding that balance. I \nthink when we have the study, especially on how doctors prescribe how \npain medication is used, these are all the kinds of things that get us \nto a point in which we limit the good uses that they may have, but also \nof preventing the addiction and the preventative steps that are putting \nus in the situation that we currently have.\n  So there are a lot of issues out here, and I think this is why this \nrule is effective. This rule is a good first step. It is something we \nmove forward on. In doing so, I think we make a statement to the \nAmerican people that we are looking to the problems that they are \nexperiencing. We are addressing those needs, and we are going to \ncontinue to do so.\n  If there is any indication that this was the last step, I think that \nis a misperception that is out there. This is\n\n[[Page H2351]]\n\na first step toward continuing this process. It will continue into the \nappropriations, I am sure, process as well. But these are the tools \nthat we need to get into the toolbox right now and to be a part of \nthat.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, this package before us cannot be the final \nword. Congress needs to approve funding to develop a comprehensive \nresponse to this epidemic and save lives.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up legislation that, in addition to \nincluding all of the opioid bills passed this week, which I do support, \nwill also provide $600 million in funding to address the opioid \nepidemic.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \ngentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) to discuss our proposal.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado for \nyielding, and I also thank the Representative from Georgia (Mr. \nCollins) for his words.\n  In New Hampshire, right now, we have a four-times-greater chance of \ndying from a heroin or opiate overdose than a car accident, as you have \npointed out in national statistics.\n  This morning, I rise to say that I am proud of what the House has \nbeen able to accomplish this week in a bipartisan way by working to \naddress this critical challenge of substance use disorder that is \ndevastating communities in my home State of New Hampshire and all \nacross the country.\n  Last year, I had the honor to cofound with my colleague from New \nHampshire (Mr. Guinta) the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin \nEpidemic to address the critical problems that heroin and opioid \naddiction are bringing to every corner of my district and most parts of \nthe country. The membership of the task force now includes 83 members, \nabout half Republicans and Democrats, who are dedicated to fighting \nthis problem.\n  Last month, we unveiled a legislative package of 15 bills to fight \nthis epidemic, and we are pleased that many of these bills and \nprovisions have been included in the package this week.\n  To mark the start of opioid week, we held a Special Order on Tuesday \nevening, when over 20 Members from both sides of the aisle came to the \nfloor to share personal stories of friends and family who had been \naffected by the heroin epidemic.\n  As part of the Special Order, I told the story of Carl, the son of a \nconstituent and friend of mine, Sue Messinger. Carl, at 24 years old, \nwas working hard in college. He wanted to become a dentist. He was a \nrecent graduate. He earned good grades, and he had his eye set on \napplying to dental school.\n  But it turned out, unbeknownst to his family, Carl had been using \nheroin. His was another face of addiction.\n  When he finally spoke to his parents, they began the long journey \nwith him to recovery. They were able to secure a place in a detox \nprogram, and they then moved toward his recovery. He was passing every \ndrug test. He remained resolutely committed to avoid drugs and alcohol, \nand his family was overjoyed to see him get better.\n  But when Carl came down with an upper respiratory infection shortly \nthereafter, a fatal error occurred. Unaware of Carl's history of \naddiction and his recent completion of detox, the doctor who he saw for \nthe upper respiratory infection prescribed a narcotic cough \nsuppressant.\n  Triggered by the codeine in the cough syrup, Carl's addiction to \nheroin was instantly reawakened, and he could not resist the craving. \nHe injected heroin and died that day of pure fentanyl, 50 times more \npowerful than heroin, in his own home.\n\n  There were no labels on the bottle that indicated that the cough \nmedicine could trigger drug-seeking behavior. There was no way for Carl \nor his mother or his parents to know that the cough medicine could pose \na fatal danger.\n  Since his death, his mother, Sue, has spoken out about the need to \nreform labeling requirements. And I am pleased to be a sponsor of \nRepresentative Walberg's bipartisan bill seeking to ensure that medical \nprofessionals have full knowledge of a patient's previous opioid \naddiction.\n  Sadly, that bill is not in the package of bills this week, and it is \none among many that we will need to address at a later date. So I am \nhopeful that I can continue to work with the chair of this committee \nand so many others on the other side of the aisle to bring forward \nbills such as this that will make a difference in people's lives.\n  Earlier this week, I introduced the Drug Abuse Crisis Act that will \nprovide $600 million in critical funding to finally address this heroin \nepidemic.\n  I want to close my remarks by talking about hope. So many of the \nbills that we have passed will finally bring hope for recovery, for \ntreatment, for long-term recovery to the families, to the users, and to \nour communities. This legislation will build and expand upon the work \nthat we have done this week by dramatically increasing resources for \nmedication-assisted treatments, funding competitive programs for law \nenforcement and for those hardest hit by this drug crisis.\n  I am opposing this rule before us today and the previous question so \nthat we can move to consider my Drug Abuse Crisis Act.\n  Let's bring hope to our families and communities, and please oppose \nthe previous question.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I went through in my opening statement, I mentioned a \ngood many of the bills that were part of the House package this week. I \nwant to go back through just a few more that we went through just to \nlet people know the breadth and scope of what we have been doing.\n  H.R. 4982, Examining Opioid Treatment Infrastructure Act, is a bill \nthat requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the \ninpatient and outpatient treatment capacity, availability, and needs in \nthe United States. And that was by Mr. Foster of Illinois.\n  We also have H.R. 4599, Reducing Unused Medications Act of 2016, from \nRepresentative Clark of Massachusetts.\n  We also have H.R. 4586, Lali's Law, sponsored by Representative Dold \nof Illinois.\n  H.R. 3691, Improving Treatment for Pregnant and Postpartum Women Act \nof 2016, sponsored by Representative Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico.\n  H.R. 3680, Co-Prescribing to Reduce Overdoses Act of 2016, sponsored \nby Representative Sarbanes of Maryland.\n  We also have H.R. 1818, Veteran Emergency Medical Technician Support \nAct of 2016, sponsored by Mr. Kinzinger of Illinois.\n  Again, as you see the breadth of what we are doing here and why I \nbelieve moving forward on this rule is important and going through, \nmany times what we have said is: look, these issues all address \nspecific needs. They all are encompassing of our body, as a whole, all \n435 of us, because, as I read here, these were a mix of both Republican \nand Democrat bills that have been passed on this floor this week.\n  So, as we look ahead, we look to the serious nature of what we are \ndoing, it also really looks at the breadth and the scope of what we are \ndealing with here. This is why this needs to move forward today, why \nthis package needs to be approved and also go to conference so we can \ncontinue to move forward with these ideals and with the things that \nhave been put before us this week.\n  We can do that by making a positive step and acknowledging the good \nwork that has gone on here. I appreciate all of the speakers today on \nboth sides of the aisle who have come forward to talk about this issue \nand talk about the real problems that we see that are occurring, really \nunfortunately, in kitchens and living rooms all across our country \nevery day. So this is something that so many people can relate to.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I rise today to honor a constituent of mine, Mr. Timothy J. Gagen of \nBreckenridge, Colorado. Tim is retiring from 40 years of civil service \nin municipal government. He has served towns\n\n[[Page H2352]]\n\nand cities across Colorado, Illinois, and Indiana and recently received \nthe Colorado City and County Management Association's Lifetime \nAchievement Award.\n  During his tenure in Colorado, Tim was instrumental in working with \nvarious entities, including the EPA, U.S. Army, Colorado State Health \nBoard, and the U.S. Attorney General on two Superfund sites.\n  Tim was influential in the formation and success of our Highway 70 \nCoalition, an organization of governments that works with the Colorado \nDepartment of Transportation to improve safety and reduce congestion \nalong our important Highway 70, the main artery to our mountain \ncommunities.\n  He spearheaded a crucial land exchange with the U.S. Forest Service \nthat provided for much-needed workforce housing, and we were able to \nget a bill passed here and signed into law to get it done.\n  Tim's steadfast focus on the most important elements to our \ncommunity--the people who live and work in the area--resulted in the \nBreckenridge Vision, developed by citizens. Tim's accomplishments are \nhighlighted by two early learning centers, a scholarship program to \nassist parents from the county, and nearly 1,000 workforce affordable \nhousing units in the town with a population of 4,500.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise to pay tribute to Mr. \nTimothy J. Gagen on behalf of the residents of the Second Congressional \nDistrict. His contributions to the town of Breckenridge will remain his \nlegacy for many years to come.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I inquire of the Chair how much \ntime remains.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining, and the gentleman from Colorado has 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from Colorado \nis prepared to close, I am prepared to close as well.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  Mr. Speaker, there have been harrowing tales told here on the floor \nof the House, and there is no doubt opioid addiction is a segment of \nthat. It is a public health crisis in this country that is hurting \ncommunities, hurting families, killing people.\n  In 2012, enough prescriptions were written for opioids to give every \nsingle adult in this country their own bottle. Prescriptions for \nopioids have increased four times in the last 15 years. That is four \ntimes as many prescriptions.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  We need to do something. It is a start today. It is not enough. It is \nnot enough.\n  Unfortunately, these rules block out and prevent many creative and \neffective ideas from both sides of the aisle from coming to the floor. \nWe also have missed the opportunity to provide funding to address \ntreatment and enforcement.\n  The fact that both parties in both Chambers have come together to \ntackle opioid addiction is a testament to how far the reach of this \nepidemic is. Every district has been affected; every Member of this \nbody has taken note. I and many of us know families and individuals \nwhose lives have been devastated or ended prematurely from the opioid \ncrisis.\n  It is crucial that we approach the problem from every possible angle: \nsupport for providers, training for law enforcement, well-funded \ntreatment centers, thoughtful policies for addicted parents, education \nfor our youth, innovative dispensing technologies, alternative pain \nmanagement therapies. There are so many ideas to consider.\n  This rule packages 18 bills that address part of the problem \ntogether. Unfortunately, 16 of them don't allow amendments, and the 2 \nthat do, many amendments were ruled out for lack of being germane. \nGiven the rate of deaths from prescription opioid abuse, we should \nallow a full debate of amendments and ideas on the floor of the House \nto address this issue.\n  Yes, we are taking a first step today, but there is a lot more work \nto do to save lives and help families across our country. We need to \nfund these programs so they are not just words on a page.\n  This is a very real issue with real implications for American \nfamilies, and we owe it to American families across the country to have \na more open and thorough process to do more to combat the opioid \nscourge.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so we \ncan bring forward Ms. Kuster's amendment, ``no'' on the underlying \nrule, and ``yes'' on the underlying bills.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, just the other day I had an opportunity to speak to a \nlongtime friend, and there was a general discussion about what was \ngoing on up here and the steps that were being taken.\n  During this time, my friend began to list and talk about folks close \nto him that either had addiction to prescription pain medications or \nwere dealing with the aftereffects of that problem. This came, frankly, \nout of nowhere and even to my friend, who basically said, ``I had no \nidea.'' And yet, within just the matter of a few weeks, he had found \nout within just his own sphere of influence that there were a number of \npeople in his family and in his friendship connection who were dealing \nwith this abuse.\n  That tells you that this is something that a lot of times is hidden \njust below the surface, unfortunately dealt with in very private, very \nconcerning ways, because so many times they are trapped in a cycle of \naddiction in which the addiction is found and then treated and it comes \nback again and it reexpresses itself in many different ways.\n  As a pastor and as a chaplain, I have dealt with these issues before, \nand there is nothing more heartbreaking than to see someone who wants \nto break free from an addiction and break free from the abuse that they \nare perpetrating basically on their own body and to see progress made \nand then get a call or not see them for a week or two and then find out \nthat they fell back into their old pattern or they unfortunately found \na new addiction that has taken over.\n  But when we come to the floor of the House--and we have spoken this \nweek on 18 bills and the promise of the Senate bill and the promise of \na conference committee going forward--it is saying that we have heard \nthese sometimes silent screams, these sometimes silent tears of those \nwho may not know how to deal with it but yet they are looking for ways.\n  We have heard the anguish of law enforcement officers and first \nresponders who come to scenes, and if they have the proper medication, \nif they have the proper treatments, then they can reverse some of these \ndisastrous effects. Now we are making sure that we can get that to \nthem, we can look for better ways of helping them do their job that \nthey so heroically do every day.\n  We are looking at ways of looking at a task force so that we can look \nat how we prescribe and how we treat pain and those things in people's \nlives that are chronic and ongoing, how do we treat them better so that \nwe don't have to deal maybe with this addiction side and we don't have \nto deal with possible aftereffects of that.\n  We have to also look at our ways on how we deal with folks who are \naddicted and how we deal with them in treatment, not only from the \nveterans' perspective, from the son or daughter perspective, from the \nmom or dad perspective, the aunt or uncle, even the grandparent \nperspective. How do we do that? How do we do it effectively?\n  How do we make sure that when we get to our spending and we get to \nour appropriations and we make sure that these appropriations are going \nout that they are done so in appropriate ways? That is the function, I \nbelieve, of the Republican majority.\n  That is why we are bringing this forward today as we are, is to make \na difference in the lives of people but do so in a way that is \nconstructive and ongoing. As we have heard today and over the course of \nthe week, the opioid epidemic is out of control, but we have an \nopportunity to start addressing the problem.\n  Again, the rule provides for consideration of legislation that will \nenact measures to address this problem through multiple avenues to \nensure that we are taking a comprehensive approach to stopping this \nscourge. It\n\n[[Page H2353]]\n\ntakes important steps to address the serious and growing threat of \nopioid abuse. It keeps a promise that we won't sit idly by while people \ncontinue to battle addiction and die.\n  For that reason, I would urge my colleagues to support this rule, the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, and the motion to go to \nconference on the House-passed amendment in the nature of a substitute.\n  This is something we can do. This is a very positive step in a week \nin which, for the most part, we have come to the floor to hear \nbipartisan unity in saying, ``We will act.''\n  Do not let this day go by because we may not have gotten everything \nthat everybody wanted. It is the time to vote ``yes'' on the previous \nquestion, it is the time to vote ``yes'' on the rule, and it is the \ntime to vote ``yes'' to move forward so that we can conference with the \nSenate and put together a product that can make not only this body \nproud but make the American people know that we have heard their voice.\n  We agonize with them, many of us who have felt it firsthand. And in \ndoing so, we are doing the people's business.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n            An Amendment to H. Res. 725 Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n       On page 2, line 2, strike ``the respective text of the \n     bills specified in section 2(a) of this resolution'' and \n     insert ``the text of H.R. 5189, as introduced,''.\n       Strike section 2 and redesignate subsequent sections \n     accordingly.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime, and I move the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be \nfollowed by 5-minute votes on adopting the resolution, if ordered; and \nagreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 232, \nnays 172, not voting 29, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 190]\n\n

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to insert extraneous material on S. 524.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Indiana?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this week in Congress, we passed 18 bills to address the \nheroin and opioid crisis that is impacting every community in this \ncountry.\n  I am thankful that my bill, H.R. 4641, which I worked on with \nRepresentative Kennedy of Massachusetts, ensures that healthcare \nprofessionals have access to up-to-date guidelines and best practices \nfor treating patients with acute and chronic pain.\n  Many of these proposals we considered this week enjoyed nearly \nunanimous support, and I can't express to you how refreshing it was to \nwork with all of my colleagues on meaningful solutions to this public \nhealth crisis.\n  As we learned from the multitude of Members this week that shared \ntheir stories on the House floor, we are facing a public health crisis \nthat crosses every socioeconomic, every geographic, generational, and \nethnic boundary. It is a rural, urban, and suburban problem. It reaches \ninto our schools, our places of work, and our hospitals. It is tearing \napart and devastating families and people's lives.\n  However, in the midst of this crisis, as with many past crises faced \nby our Nation, we, as Members of Congress, have set aside our political \ndifferences and have crafted a package of thoughtful reforms that will \nsupport our communities ravaged by this scourge.\n  I am proud of the work done by the Energy and Commerce Committee and \nthe strong, bipartisan leadership by Chairmen Upton and Pitts and \nRanking Members Pallone and Green. We cannot overlook the hard work and \ncountless hours spent by both the majority and the minority committee \nstaff on this effort, and I want to thank them for their hard work.\n  Members of the Energy and Commerce Committee have pursued answers to \nthis epidemic through roundtables and meetings with individuals and \nfamilies on the front lines of this crisis--health workers, first \nresponders, and community leaders seeking to guide their communities \nthrough this crisis.\n  We, as Members, have visited neonatal intensive care units in \nhospitals to see firsthand the devastating effects of infants born \naddicted to opioids and who must already fight for survival through \ntheir withdrawal in their very first days of life.\n  We have met with juvenile court judges and social workers whose \ncaseloads have doubled over the past few years as more and more \nchildren are being removed from their parents' care because their \nparents are more concerned about where to find their next high than the \nwelfare of their child and it is no longer safe for them to remain in \ntheir homes.\n  It is important to note that it is National Police Week this week. \nAnd it is our first responders, whom so many of us have talked to, \nthose we have heard from in Indiana, who keep naloxone in their police \ncruisers because they are seeing this unprecedented increase in drug \noverdoses, and they are saving lives each and every day.\n  In a minute, my colleague from the Judiciary Committee will highlight \nall of the great work that their committee has also done to fight this \nscourge, but I would like to take a moment to highlight the bills \nrolled into this legislation that my colleagues from the Energy and \nCommerce Committee have painstakingly crafted.\n  The Opioid Review Modernization Act, led by Representatives Carolyn \nB. Maloney of New York and Lance, would require the FDA to work closely \nwith expert advisory committees before making critical opioid approval \nand labeling decisions, develop recommendations regarding prescriber \neducation programs that address extended-release and long-acting \nopioids, and encourage the development and approval of generic opioids \nwith abuse-deterrent properties.\n\n[[Page H2369]]\n\n  Representative Sarbanes led the Co-Prescribing to Reduce Overdoses \nAct, which would establish a grant program for co-prescribing of opioid \nreversal drugs for patients who are at a high risk of overdose.\n  Representative Evan Jenkins and Representative Bustos crafted the \nNurturing and Supporting Healthy Babies Act, which will expand our \nknowledge of care and treatment for babies with neonatal abstinence \nsyndrome and fixes an unintended consequence with the Medicaid drug \nrebate program that discourages drug manufacturers from producing \nopioids that are harder to abuse.\n  Representative Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico led efforts to establish a \npilot program that will provide grants to State substance abuse \nagencies to promote innovative service delivery models for pregnant \nwomen who have a substance use disorder, such as opioid addiction.\n  Representative Kinzinger's Veteran Emergency Medical Technician \nSupport Act will improve the quality of care within our communities by \nproviding grants to States with emergency medical technician shortages \nso as to help streamline State requirements for our veterans to enter \nthe EMT workforce without there being an unnecessary duplication of \ntheir training.\n  Representatives Meehan, Kind, and Veasey led the legislation \ndirecting the CDC to study what information and resources are available \nto youth athletes and their families regarding the dangers of opioid \nuse.\n  Lali's Law, authored by Representative Dold and Representative \nKatherine Clark of Massachusetts, would create a competitive grant \nprogram to help States increase access to the overdose reversal \nmedications that save lives.\n  The Reducing Unused Medications Act, led again by Representatives \nClark of Massachusetts and Stivers, clarifies when Schedule II \ncontrolled substances, including opioid pain medications, can be \npartially filled.\n  Representatives Foster and Pallone spearheaded the Examining Opioid \nTreatment Infrastructure Act, which requires the GAO to collect the \ndata necessary to assess the opioid infrastructure in our country, \nlooking at the numbers of hospital beds and treatment facilities.\n  Finally, my Hoosier colleague, Representative Bucshon, along with \nRepresentative Tonko, championed a bill that will expand existing \nopioid treatment capacity substantially by providers, all while \nensuring that the care that individuals receive is high-quality and \nminimizes the risk of diversion.\n  Each approach that I have just set out has been a reflection of much \neffort put into crafting this bipartisan, thoughtful, and comprehensive \npackage to give each of our communities, families, and individuals with \naddictions the support they need.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Engel).\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, my heart goes out to the thousands of American families \naffected by the opioid epidemic. I am pleased the House is working in a \nbipartisan manner to address this crisis. However, we could be doing \nmore.\n  The prescription opioid death rate has more than quadrupled since the \nlate 1990s. In 2014, prescription opioids played a role in more than \n28,000 overdose deaths.\n  We must equip our communities with the resources needed to reverse \nthese trends. Yes, authorizing new grant programs, reports, and studies \nis an important step, but without new funding, communities won't be \nable to fully implement these initiatives.\n  On Wednesday, the majority blocked a Democratic substitute opioids \npackage which would have provided $600 million--paid for, I might add--\nto fund the initiatives we have considered this week. I understand the \nneed to get our fiscal house in order, but I don't understand the \nimpulse to do so on the backs of millions of Americans grappling with \nopioid abuse.\n  These bills are great, and I wholeheartedly support them, but we need \nto put our money where our mouth is. This epidemic does not \ndiscriminate. It has touched every corner of our Nation, from my \nhometown of New York City to the shores of the Pacific.\n  So many Americans have already felt its impact. We need to do \neverything we can to keep it from impacting more of our families, our \nfriends, and our constituents.\n\n  We are on the right path, but, again, without money, this becomes \nirrelevant. We need to make sure that we have adequate funding so what \nwe all want to do on both sides of the aisle can become a reality.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek).\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, it is past time to give our healthcare \nproviders the tools they need to confront the growing epidemic of \nopioid abuse in our country. This is an emergency.\n  As a doctor who has treated patients in northern Michigan for over 30 \nyears, both in private practice and in the VA system, I know how urgent \nthe need for immediate action is.\n  The amendment to the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act that we \nare considering today will be a giant step forward in how we provide \ntreatment and care for those suffering from opioid addiction.\n  The bill will also improve the quality of care available to our \nNation's veterans. The rate of abuse for legal prescription drugs is \nsignificantly higher among our veteran population than it is in the \ngeneral population, and this problem is only continuing to grow.\n  We have an opportunity today to take a first step in fixing a major \nnational problem and pass meaningful legislation that will help save \nthe lives of thousands and thousands of Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and \ncontinue working together on bipartisan solutions for our Nation's \ngrowing epidemic of substance abuse.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Tonko).\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, this week, we have seen a number of well-\nintentioned bills come to the floor with good ideas on how we can \naddress the Nation's opioid epidemic that is sweeping our entire \ncountry.\n  I was proud to lead one of those efforts with my good friend \nRepresentative Bucshon with a bill that endeavors to lift the cap on \nthe number of patients a provider may treat with buprenorphine to 250, \nwhile expanding prescribing privileges to nurse practitioners and \nphysician assistants.\n  This is a good bill, and it would make a real, immediate difference \nfor individuals facing months-long waiting lists for effective \ntreatment, like the gentleman that I met last week when touring an \naddiction clinic in my district. He had struggled with addiction for \ndecades and, after making the decision to try to get clean, was faced \nwith a closed door and a 7-month waiting list due to outdated Federal \nrules that our bill would have fixed.\n  Unfortunately, when this bill came to the floor, we were told the cap \nlanguage had to be temporarily replaced with placeholder sense-of-\nCongress language until we go to conference because our bill was going \nto cost too much.\n  Now, when we talk about the cost of this bill, what we are really \ntalking about is the fact that more people will have access to \neffective treatment and more lives--more lives--will be saved. It is an \nunfortunate truth that, in the distorted budgetary terms of Washington, \ndead people cost less than the living.\n  So we can talk all we want and we can pass all the bills we want, but \nunless we put our money where our mouth is, we will simply be peddling \nfalse hope. We will be condemning more of our brothers and sisters to \nthe death spiral of addiction when we could have done something to \nhelp.\n  A sense of Congress won't end months-long waiting lists for effective \ntreatment. A sense of Congress won't get lifesaving overdose reversal \ndrugs out to our first responders. If this Congress has any sense, as \nwe move into conference committee, we will support this epidemic with \nthe robust resources this country deserves for a real and meaningful \nresponse.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Matsui).\n  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, the opioid and heroin crisis has hit home \nfor everyone, impacting our coworkers, our\n\n[[Page H2370]]\n\nneighbors, and our friends in every corner of this country.\n  In Sacramento, my district, the deadly consequences of fentanyl are \ndevastating our families. The faces behind this tragedy are people like \n28-year-old Jerome Butler, a young father whose life was cut short \nbecause of a tainted pill.\n  The human toll of this crisis demands our leadership. This week, we \ntook a step forward by passing a number of bipartisan bills to address \nthe opioid epidemic, many of which we worked on in the Energy and \nCommerce Committee.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  But we can and must do more. We need new funding to confront this \ntragedy.\n  My Democratic colleagues and I are ready to fund the President's $1.1 \nbillion request for this crisis. We need a real investment to meet the \nchallenges our committees are facing every day.\n  As we advance substance abuse legislation and continue our important \nwork on comprehensive behavioral health reform, I urge my colleagues to \nfocus on solutions that both adequately address the immediate crisis \nand long-term community prevention strategies.\n  The families reeling from the tragedies of this epidemic deserve \nnothing less than our swift action and full support.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise this morning to speak in favor of the House amendment to S. \n524.\n  Over the last 2 days of floor debate, we have heard heartfelt \nspeeches from Members of Congress about how the opioid epidemic is \naffecting their constituents and, for some, their own families. We have \nheard from both Democrats and Republicans, Members from urban \ndistricts, suburban districts, and rural districts, as well as Members \nfrom every region of the United States.\n  What is clear is that no community has been immune to this crisis, \nincluding communities in my home State of New Jersey. About 256,000 New \nJersey residents are addicted to heroin and prescription opioids. That \nis nearly the same as the entire population of Newark, the largest city \nin New Jersey.\n  This is a serious crisis that demands an urgent response. A \ncomprehensive solution to the crisis will require real dollars and must \ntake an approach that targets the full spectrum of addiction: \nprevention, crisis response, expanding access to treatment, and \nproviding support for lifelong recovery.\n  The approach must be guided by science and cannot be deterred because \nof stigma or misperceptions about proven treatment and intervention \nstrategies.\n  I am pleased to support the package of opioid legislation that we are \nconsidering today because it takes steps towards that approach.\n  This bill incorporates proven public health approaches to fight \nagainst the heroin and prescription drug abuse crisis. It improves the \ntools available to prescribers to prevent opioid abuse and the \ndevelopment of opioid use disorder. It expands access to lifesaving \nnaloxone, an opioid overdose-reversal drug, to respond to those in an \nacute opioid crisis. It expands access to evidence-based treatments to \nhelp individuals with opioid use disorders enter recovery.\n  However, Mr. Speaker, I want to make clear we must go further to \nensure that the scale of our response is proportionate to the burden of \nthe crisis. We not only need to support individuals' entry into \nrecovery, we need to ensure that we provide access to the support and \nservices that lead to lifelong recovery. We must also further expand \naccess to bupe, or buprenorphine, an office-based, medication-assisted \ntreatment for opioid use disorders.\n  Currently, we do not have adequate treatment capacity to respond to \nthe unprecedented demand for opioid use disorder treatment. That is why \nwe need to expand upon the Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Expansion and \nModernization Act to significantly increase the number of patients a \nphysician can treat with this medication as well as permanently \nallowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to treat patients \nwith this medication.\n  In the committee, Democrats voted to raise the cap to 500 patients \nfor qualifying physicians with appropriate credentials. Additionally, \ncommittee Democrats and Republicans voted unanimously to permanently \nallow nurse practitioners and physician assistants to treat patients \nwith bupe.\n  I am committed to continuing to work with my colleagues as part of \nour conference with the Senate to ensure that we lift the arbitrary and \nharmful physician treatment cap and to ensure that nurse practitioners \nand physician assistants in every community can permanently use their \nskills and experience to serve those in need of opioid use disorder \ntreatments in their community.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear that we should not be under \nthe illusion that we can adequately respond to this crisis without \nproviding urgently needed resources. Waiting on the appropriation \nprocess isn't suitable. Our States and communities urgently need money \nnow.\n  Additionally, we should not be forced to cut other discretionarily \nfunded public health programs to provide resources for substance abuse \nprograms. The discretionary funding caps have already left many of our \nvital public health programs underfunded.\n  Forcing additional cuts to those programs in order to provide funding \nto respond to the opioid epidemic will limit our ability to adequately \nrespond to the opioid crisis as well as to meet the remaining public \nhealth needs of our communities.\n  We don't have to guess how it turns out if we fail to provide the \nurgent, robust funding that is desperately needed. Sadly, the evidence \nis already staring us in the face. There will be more lives lost to the \nepidemic and will be thousands more Americans who will continue to be \nleft behind to battle without the treatment and recovery support \nservices they need.\n  We are losing now, we estimate, 78 Americans each day, and we can't \nafford anything less than a comprehensive well-funded Federal response.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to this legislation because I \nbelieve it takes important steps in turning the tide on this crisis \nthat is taking the lives of 78 Americans every day.\n  But I also urge my colleagues to support providing the financial \nresources and additional tools necessary to meet the burden of this \ncrisis.\n  I urge support for this package and once again stress that we are not \nproviding enough funding. As much as I believe that this package is \nvery important, I certainly would agree with my colleague on the \nRepublican side how important it is.\n  We are not providing enough resources. I hope that, when we go to \nconference and before this package goes to the President, we can \nprovide the additional resources.\n  I urge everyone to support the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  In closing, I would like to emphasize that, as my colleague, the \nranking member from New Jersey, indicated, we have made real strides \nthis week in turning back the epidemic, but we agree it is not enough \nand it is not over. This fight is not going to be over. There is still \nmore to be done.\n  But I do hope that this week's productivity will lead to more weeks \nwhere we can continue to engage in a healthy and robust debate about \nthe issues that matter. This week has proven we are stronger as a body \nwhen we focus on the things that unite us and bring us together.\n  Sadly, it shouldn't take an epidemic or a national crisis to bring us \ntogether. This week has taught us that, with enough will and \ndedication, we can get to yes.\n\n  The conference committee, which this bill will initiate, will need \nsimilar fortitude to swiftly come to a resolution on the differences we \nhave with the Senate. That accomplishment is within our grasp.\n  We have come too far to turn back now rather than let this issue \nlanguish. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this \nbill, support the motion to go to conference.\n  Beyond the 78 Americans who are dying every day, we have 1.9 million \nAmericans addicted to or abusing prescription opioid-based painkillers \nacross the country. Because of their lives and their families' lives, \nwe must pass this bill.\n\n[[Page H2371]]\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  It has been quite a week. This week the House has passed 18 bills \ndesigned to address various facets of America's opioid epidemic. Most \nrecently, yesterday, the House passed by an overwhelming 413-5 vote the \nJudiciary Committee's flagship bill.\n  H.R. 5046, which was authored by Crime Subcommittee Chairman Jim \nSensenbrenner, creates a comprehensive Justice Department grant program \nto provide States with the resources needed to fight opioid addiction. \nIt authorizes $103 million a year for 5 years for the grant program. It \nallocates precious resources responsibly by leveraging and streamlining \nexisting programs and fully offsetting the legislation in compliance \nwith the House's CutGo protocol.\n  In addition to that bill, the House passed four other Judiciary \nCommittee bills this week to address drug abuse and protect American \npeople.\n  H.R. 5052, the OPEN Act, increases the transparency and \naccountability of the comprehensive opioid abuse grant program in H.R. \n5046 by requiring grantees to report on the use of grant funds and \nrequiring a publicly available analysis of whether the grants have \nachieved their intended purposes.\n  H.R. 4985, the Kingpin Designation Improvement Act, protects \nclassified information from disclosure when a drug kingpin challenges \nhis designation as such in a Federal court.\n  H.R. 5048, the Good Samaritan Assessment Act, requires the GAO to \nstudy State and local Good Samaritan laws that protect caregivers, law \nenforcement personnel, and first responders who administer opioid \noverdose reversal drugs or devices from criminal or civil liability as \nwell as those who contact emergency service providers in response to an \noverdose.\n  Finally, S. 32, the Transnational Drug Trafficking Act, improves law \nenforcement's ability to pursue international drug manufacturers, \nbrokers, and distributors in source nations. I am pleased that the \nHouse took up the Senate version of this bill.\n  As a result, that legislation is on its way to the President's desk \nto be signed into law so that Federal prosecutors can begin using that \ntool to pursue foreign drug traffickers.\n  Along with the excellent legislation prepared by our sister \ncommittees, spearheaded by Chairman Upton, Chairman Miller, and \nChairman Kline, four of the Judiciary Committee bills will be included \nin the House amendment to S. 524, the Senate's Comprehensive Addiction \nand Recovery Act.\n  As a package, these bills make substantial policy changes at the \nFederal agencies responsible for fighting addiction. They take real \nsteps to address the opioid epidemic and provide real relief to a real \nproblem affecting real Americans. Members of this body should be proud \nof these accomplishments.\n  In addition to the committee chairmen I mentioned, I also want to \nthank Chairman Harold Rogers, who spoke in support of H.R. 5046 \nyesterday and is a strong ally in the fight against elicit opioid \nabuse. I have no doubt that he will make every effort during this \nCongress to provide the critical funding authorized by the bills that \nhave passed the House this week.\n  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to sending this legislation back to the \nSenate and moving to conference expeditiously. Congressional action to \ncombat the opioid epidemic is sorely needed, and there is bipartisan, \nbicameral support for these efforts.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support and hard work. I urge \neveryone to support the House amendment to S. 524.\n  I thank my colleague, the ranking member of the committee, Mr. \nConyers, for his hard work on this as well. This truly is a bipartisan \neffort.\n  I commend all to support this motion to go to conference.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Members of the House, I rise in support of the House amendment to S. \n524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.\n  Before starting out on the merits of the legislation, I want to \ncommend the Judiciary Committee chairman, Mr. Goodlatte, for \nshepherding our committee's five bills to House passage.\n  I also commend the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Sensenbrenner of \nWisconsin, for authoring the legislation that is largely responsible \nfor bringing us together today.\n  I also want to recognize the leadership of the Crime Subcommittee \nranking member, Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, who was an original \ncosponsor of the primary Judiciary Committee bill and who has helped us \nfind common ground in addressing the issue of drug addiction and \ntreatment.\n  This week the House considered and passed a wide range of bills aimed \nat combating the devastating impact of drug abuse and addiction that is \nafflicting communities all across our Nation.\n  We must take this action because our Nation is in the midst of a \nmajor public health crisis caused by an epidemic of prescription and \nopioid abuse. It is a crisis that affects Americans of all ages, of all \nraces, and of all income levels. It has devastated communities across \nthe United States. It affects families, the workplace, and also our \nNation's economy.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of injury-related deaths in \nour Nation. In my State of Michigan, for example, there were 1,745 drug \noverdose deaths in 2014, and more than half of those overdose deaths \nwere attributed to opioids and heroin. In fact, 78 Americans die from \nan opioid overdose every single day. Without question, this is a crisis \nthat cries out for immediate relief.\n  Fortunately, there may be effective solutions. For example, several \nStates have undertaken various innovative measures to better respond to \nthe rapid increase of individuals who are addicted to prescription \nopioids and heroin and to prevent individuals from dying as a result of \ndrug overdose.\n  As I mentioned only yesterday during debate with respect to our \nconsideration of H.R. 5046, which has been incorporated into the House \namendment to S. 524, this measure would fund new, innovative ways to \naddress the nationwide epidemic of opioid drug abuse addiction. These \ninnovations include, for instance, the Law Enforcement Assisted \nDiversion approach, which has been utilized with great success in two \ncities of which I know--in Seattle and in Santa Fe. Programs such as \nthis diversion approach underscore the fact that we cannot arrest our \nway out of opioid abuse addiction. Treating addicts as criminals only \nmakes matters worse for them and also for the rest of us.\n  The diversion approach, which reduces, by the way, recidivism by 60 \npercent, is just one example of innovation at the State and local \nlevels that we must encourage through increased funding assistance, and \nit is more evidence that treatment alternatives to incarceration work.\n  The funding authorized under this measure would establish a \ncompetitive grant program to provide funds to State and local \ngovernments to continue and improve their efforts to protect Americans \nfrom the dangers of opioid abuse and heroin use; and it will help \nensure that addicts have access to the services that are provided.\n  These funds would support such initiatives as providing treatment \nalternatives to incarceration; fostering better collaboration between \nState criminal justice agencies and state substance abuse systems; \nproviding first responders with the ability to purchase naloxone and to \nreceive training on how to administer this lifesaving drug; \nestablishing medication-assisted treatment programs by criminal justice \nagencies; in addition, investigating more of the illegal distribution \nmethods of opioids; creating Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs; \naddressing juvenile opioid abuse, which is, unfortunately, increasing; \nand establishing comprehensive opioid abuse response programs.\n  The House amendment to S. 524 also includes a number of important \nprovisions that have been added pursuant to a series of amendments that \nwere passed by the House only yesterday.\n  In sum, these additional provisions expand the range of allowed \npurpose areas under the new program to more fully address the range of \nproblems and\n\n[[Page H2372]]\n\nsolutions that are presented by opioid abuse. Whether we provide \nseparate, new grant programs for each of these approaches or whether we \nconsolidate them into one grant program, it is critical that we change \nour ways of addressing addiction. The scourge of drug abuse and its \noverwhelming impact on our communities requires us to address this \nproblem not only immediately, but effectively.\n  I thank all of the committees and individuals who have participated \nin this effort. Accordingly, I support House amendment S. 524.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I do not have any speakers remaining, and \nI am prepared to close.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I support the House amendment to S. 524 because it will help address \nour Nation's crisis of opioid abuse and heroin use. My support for this \nlegislation is based, in part, on the fact that it includes H.R. 5046, \nwhich is legislation that I have worked on with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, that would provide critical grants to States and \nlocal governments, intended to prevent and treat opioid abuse \naddiction. Most importantly, I support this legislation because it \nwould help save lives.\n  The House amendment to S. 524 provides a comprehensive approach to \nthe opioid substance abuse public health emergency that is currently \nravaging our Nation. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank Mr. Goodlatte, Mr. Conyers, the \nJudiciary Committee, and Mr. Sensenbrenner, who mentioned yesterday \nthat he had been working on this for 2 years. We have joined him as the \noriginal cosponsors in supporting this on the Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, of which I am the \nranking member, along with Mr. Sensenbrenner, and this is a moment that \nall of us are appreciative of.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I thought about this week, during which we are \nhonoring police and we are also acknowledging those who have fallen in \nthe line of duty, this bill, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery \nAct, becomes even more important. This week, the House adopted a number \nof bills that, together, are intended to provide a response to the \nopioid crisis that is commensurate with the scope of the problem.\n  Yesterday the House passed, by an overwhelming vote, the primary \ncontribution of the Judiciary Committee's to this effort, H.R. 5046, \nthe Comprehensive Opioid Reduction Act. I am an original cosponsor of \nthat bill, and I was a cosponsor of the predecessor bill, both of which \nwere introduced by my colleague, Jim Sensenbrenner, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee.\n  I commend him for the years of work and persistence on this issue. I \nalso commend Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers for their \nleadership, for it would not have been shepherded through the committee \nif we had not all worked together to find common ground on this very \nimportant issue.\n  That has been the trend of the Judiciary Committee's as we work on \ncriminal justice reform, which includes sentencing reduction and prison \nreform--provocative, innovative bills that are going to change the \nlives of many of those who are incarcerated for many, many years. We \nare going to turn mass incarceration upside down and on its ears and \ncause it to be extinct. This new approach to opioids is part of that.\n  This bill has no mandatory minimums. As we take the steps today which \nwill allow us to engage in discussions with the Senate so that we may \nsoon send a bill to the President for his signature, I am pleased of \nthe progress that has been made. I can only hope that our work on \nsentencing reduction, prison reform, and juvenile justice will have the \nsame kind of impetus and will wind up on the President's desk. That is \nthe vision, I believe, of many Republicans and Democrats in and out of \nthis House. As well, it is the vision of the President's; but, more \nimportantly, it is the vision of suffering families' who do not have \ntheir loved ones with them.\n  The reason we must work together is that the leading killer of \nAmericans today, which is drug overdose, started first by prescription \nuse in many instances. Between 2000 and 2014, almost half a million \npeople died from drug overdoses. That is a startling number. In 2014 \nalone, more than 47,000 people died of drug overdoses. The largest \npercentage of overdose deaths in 2014 was attributed to opioids, like \nprescription painkillers, methadone, morphine, and heroin. \nSpecifically, 28,647 people overdosed and died because of an opioid in \n2014.\n  This is an emergency, and it is a combination of prescription \npainkillers and heroin. Prescription painkillers abuse is the strongest \nrisk for the future use of heroin. That is our athletes or those who \nhave had surgery--just everyday Americans who find themselves caught in \nthe trap of addiction. Approximately three out of four new heroin users \nreport that their use began with the abuse of prescription drugs. \nHeroin use becomes appealing to those who are addicted to prescription \ndrugs because it is cheaper and easier to obtain, and due to its \npotency, heroin use tends to lead to addiction. We know that from the \n1980s and 1990s with crack cocaine in that crack was a more potent \nextraction of cocaine, and we saw many of those individuals not get \ntreatment. They actually only got incarceration. Heroin addiction is \noften deadly just as crack cocaine was in leading to overdose or to \nother chronic diseases.\n  The rate at which the occurrence of heroin overdose deaths has \nincreased is cause for alarm. In the 4 years between 2010 and 2014, \nheroin overdoses more than tripled. In 2013, 11 million people admitted \nto the improper use of prescription painkillers and, therefore, were at \na heightened risk of becoming addicted.\n  That is why we have worked together this week on legislation to put \ntogether something like an omnibus in order to reduce the risks of \naddiction and to fund appropriate treatment responses for those who \nabuse these drugs. The bill that was passed yesterday reflects the \nstrategy by proposing to establish a grant program to be administered \nby the Department of Justice to assist States and local governments.\n  It is important to note these statistics: the rate of deaths from \nheroin overdoses that account from the White population saw a 267 \npercent increase between 2010 and 2014; in African Americans, there was \nan increase of 213 percent in 2010 to 2014; in Hispanics, there was a \n137 percent increase from 2010 to 2014; and in Native Americans, there \nwas a 236 percent increase.\n  No aspect of American life has been uninfluenced by the devastation \nof heroin overdoses and deaths--many of it impacting families whose \nyoung, bright, talented, athletic, and, otherwise, young people have \nfallen victim to this. This grant program is extremely helpful, for \nwhich I am very pleased, because it deals with monitoring the \nprescription drugs, and it deals with matching those who are committed \nto working with police officers. It is truly an important bill.\n  Let me close by saying that we must have money to support all of \nthis, and I am hoping that this will not be the last stop we will make.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this amendment to S. 524, the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.\n  This week, the House adopted a number of bills that--together--are \nintended to provide a response to the opioid crisis that is \ncommensurate with the scope of the problem.\n  Yesterday, the House passed--by an overwhelming vote--the primary \ncontribution of the Judiciary Committee to this effort, H.R. 5046, the \nComprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act.\n  I am an original cosponsor of that bill, and I was a cosponsor of the \npredecessor bill, both of which were introduced by my colleague, Jim \nSensenbrenner, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime.\n  I commend him for his years of work and persistence on this issue, \nand I also commend Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers for \ntheir leadership and work to find common ground on this very important \nissue.\n  As we take the steps today which will allow us to engage in \ndiscussions with the Senate so that we may soon send a bill to the \nPresident for signature, I am pleased at the progress we have made.\n\n[[Page H2373]]\n\n  The reason we must work together is that a leading killer of \nAmericans today is drug overdose.\n  Between 2000 and 2014, almost half a million people died from drug \noverdoses.\n  In 2014 alone, more than 47,000 people died of drug overdoses.\n  The largest percentage of overdose deaths in 2014 was attributed to \nopioids--like prescription painkillers, methadone, morphine, and \nheroin.\n  Specifically, 28,647 people overdosed and died because of an opioid \nin 2014.\n  This emergency is compounded due to the perilous connection between \nprescription painkillers and heroin.\n  Prescription painkiller abuse is the strongest risk factor for future \nheroin use.\n  Approximately three out of four new heroin users report that their \nuse began with their abuse of prescription painkillers.\n  Heroin use becomes appealing to those addicted to prescription \npainkillers because it is cheaper and easier to obtain.\n  Due to its potency, heroin use tends to lead to addiction.\n  Heroin addiction is often deadly, leading to overdose or other \nchronic diseases.\n  The rate at which the occurrence of heroin overdose deaths increased \nis cause for alarm.\n  In the four years between 2010 and 2014, heroin overdoses more than \ntripled.\n  In 2013, 11 million people admitted to improper use of prescription \npainkillers and therefore were at a heightened risk of becoming \naddicted to heroin--with its attendant risks and dangers.\n  That is why we have worked together this week on legislation to \nreduce the risks of addiction and to fund appropriate treatment \nresponses to those who abuse these drugs.\n  The bill we passed yesterday, H.R. 5046, reflects this strategy by \nproposing to establish a grant program, to be administered by the \nDepartment of Justice, to assist states and local governments, \nparticularly by helping criminal justice agencies to tackle the opioid \nproblem from a variety of angles.\n  This bill, included in this amendment, encourages the development of \nalternatives to incarceration that provide treatment as a solution to \nthe underlying motivation for criminal behavior or conduct associated \nwith mental disorders.\n  We must make our best efforts to prevent individuals from moving from \npainkillers to heroin by making treatment for addicts more accessible \nby encouraging the use of evidence-based programs, such as medication-\nassisted treatment.\n  Life-saving overdose reversal drugs, like naloxone, are most valuable \nin the hands of trained individuals who regularly come in contact with \nindividuals who are prone to drug overdoses.\n  This legislation will increase the use and availability of naloxone \nand other overdose reversal drugs to first responders.\n  Addiction is a disease that affects the brain and eventually changes \nthe behavior of addicts, causing them to experience mental health \nissues and encounter legal problems.\n  Treatment is the most reasonable and effective approach to diverting \nthese individuals away from homelessness and prison.\n  There are also specific provisions we have proposed that allow for a \nwide range of services to be offered to our veterans who tend to suffer \nfrom mental health issues and addiction.\n  I support this legislation because I believe that it will help save \nlives and prevent and treat opioid addiction.\n  The approach Congress is taking with the crisis of heroin and other \nopioids is thoughtful and comprehensive.\n  I hope it signals a departure from some of the failed approaches \nconcerning other drug crises in the past.\n  For instance, our response to the surge in crack cocaine in the 1980s \nwas to enact draconian mandatory minimum penalties with vastly \ndisparate treatment for crack and powder cocaine.\n  At that time, we in Congress took action that we are still trying to \nrectify.\n  At one point, more than 80% of the defendants sentenced for crack \noffenses were African American, despite the fact that more than 66% of \ncrack users are white or Hispanic.\n  As we work on other legislation to address the enforcement and \nsentencing disparities related to the crack issue, we must re-examine \nour approach to that and other drug issues.\n  While law enforcement has an appropriate role and the bills recognize \nthat, the bills we adopted this week and that we put forth as an \namendment to the Senate bill today reflect a broader strategy that \nreflects the fact that this is an addiction issue.\n  Accordingly, we are not raising sentences or impacting mandatory \nminimums but we are funding anti-addiction mechanisms such as treatment \nalternatives to incarceration.\n  We are not adding to mass incarceration--with all of the related and \ndevastating collateral consequences--but instead we are incentivizing \nstate and local governments to prevent, treat, and heal.\n  That is what we should be doing, and that is what we should have done \nfor crack and cocaine addicts.\n  With that history in mind and with the chance to take smarter and \nmore effective steps now, I look forward to continuing to work with my \ncolleagues in the House--and in the Senate--to apply this more \ncomprehensive approach, including treatment alternatives, to those \nsuffering from crack and cocaine addiction.\n  Yesterday, in my closing remarks on H.R. 5046, I stated my intention \nto ensure that we make progress on addiction not only involving opioids \nbut drugs like crack and powder cocaine as well.\n  As I express my support for this legislation, I urge my colleagues to \nwork with me in this broader initiative as well as join me in voting \nfor this

Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to instruct conferees at the \ndesk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Esty moves that the managers on the part of the House \n     at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses \n     on the House amendments to the bill S. 524 (an Act to \n     authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the \n     national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin \n     use) be instructed to recede to title III of the bill \n     (relating to treatment and recovery programs).\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 7 of rule XXII, the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty) and the gentlewoman from \nIndiana (Mrs. Brooks) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer a motion which would instruct the \nappointed conference committee to prioritize prevention, treatment, and \nrecovery programs for folks suffering from prescription opioid or \nheroin addiction, but all of the good legislation that we worked on so \nhard this past week in the House is close to futile without appropriate \nFederal funding.\n  It is all too easy for us to say we support helping folks who suffer \nfrom addiction to get the treatment and resources they so desperately \nneed or to support community programs that spread awareness about the \ndangers of prescription drug use or to instruct and support medical \nprofessionals about the risks of opioid addiction, but it is time for \nus to put our money where our mouth is.\n  This year, the President requested that we appropriate $1.1 billion \nto help the American people to prevent and treat addiction. It is time \nfor us to act on that request. It is not enough to adopt important \npolicies that we have this week on prevention and on treatment; we need \nfunding.\n  We must provide adequate Federal funding to prevent addiction from \noccurring in the first place by expanding our prescription drug \noverdose prevention strategies. We must provide adequate Federal \nfunding to help save the lives of those who have intentionally or \naccidentally overdosed by improving access to the overdose reversal \ndrug naloxone and support targeted enforcement. And we must help our \nlocal law enforcement by supporting targeted enforcement activities.\n  Families across my district in Connecticut and across this great \nNation are reaching out to our offices asking for support and help, \nasking us to come together and to address this public health crisis.\n  Recently, I was contacted by a family from my hometown about a young \nwoman who was a classmate of one of my three children. They have lost \ntrack of this young woman. She has fallen into the grips of addiction \nand has disappeared for years from her family. They are trying to seek \nher out, find her, and get her treatment.\n  We were successful in finding her in a court. We were successful in \ngetting her a bed. Sadly, she turned down treatment at this time. That \nis the story of what addiction does to families. We are hopeful that \nshe will heed the voices of her family, that she will come back in and \nget treatment.\n  But that is also why prevention matters. Because it is so hard to \ntreat addiction, we need to do everything we can to prevent folks from \ngetting addicted in the first place.\n  That is why some of the provisions I included in this bill are so \nimportant:\n\n[[Page H2375]]\n\nto make sure the public understands the risk of prescription drug \naddiction, to make sure that our medical professionals get continuing \nmedical education to understand their responsibility to look out for \ntheir patients, to seek out alternative pain management strategies, and \nto understand those risks.\n  The sad truth is we don't have enough treatment beds. The sad truth \nis we don't have dissemination of best practices. The sad truth is we \ndon't have the funding right now to address this crisis in the way that \nthe American people want and need us to do.\n  So let's work together. Let's work together to prevent our children, \nour families, and our friends from being so poisoned by this addiction \non our streets. We can't do it without funding. It is just unfair. Not \njust unwise, it is unfair to claim credit for solving a problem and \naddressing it without the funds that need to go there.\n  So let's work together to provide funding. In our conference with the \nSenate, let's seek to put the resources there to back the wonderful \npolicies that we adopted this week in this House.\n  So, again, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to instruct \nour conferees.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer).\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, my good \nfriend, the gentlewoman from Indiana, for her important work on this \nlegislation.\n  I rise in support today of S. 524.\n  Mr. Speaker, an astounding 78 people die every day of opioid overdose \nin America--78 people each day, 78 families crushed in the wake of this \nepidemic. And that will continue to leave devastation in its path \nunless we act.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  Austin, a city in my district, is all too aware of opioid addiction's \ndevastating consequences. It has become the epicenter of an HIV \noutbreak connected to opioid addiction.\n  The community of Austin is rallying to that crisis, but Hoosiers \naren't the only ones suffering. That is why this week we came together \nas a House to pass 18 bills to tackle this epidemic, including the bill \nwe are debating right now.\n  These bills are an important first step. We must continue to work \ntogether to end this devastation and help the families crushed by this \ncrisis.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nConnecticut (Mr. Himes), my friend and fellow Nutmegger.\n  Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to join my colleague from \nConnecticut (Ms. Esty) in supporting this motion to instruct because \nthis is an issue that deserves not just the attention and the focus of \nthe House, but it deserves a meaningful commitment of resources to \naddress the problem that is plaguing every town and city in Connecticut \nand in this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, this year we will see 30,000 fatalities to this opioid \ncrisis. In the 20 years of the Vietnam war, from 1955 to 1975, this \nNation suffered just shy of 60,000 fatalities in the entire Vietnam \nwar. In 2 years, the opioid crisis will claim more Americans than died \nin the Vietnam war; yet, we this week--and I salute the majority for \nacting on the opioid crisis--decided to make roughly $106 million \navailable to this scourge.\n  For those watching at home, we didn't actually make that money \navailable. In Congress, we authorize--which says, legally, you can \nspend the money--and we appropriate. Appropriate is actually when we \ntake out the checkbook and write the check. And just to be clear for \nthe American people, we authorized, but we did not appropriate.\n  So, again, I salute the majority and I salute the bipartisan tenor \nthat we have had this week in addressing this very, very serious \nproblem through so many bills, but now is the time to actually put our \nmoney where our mouths are. The reason for this is the number I gave \nyou earlier: 30,000 Americans every single year.\n  I spoke earlier this week about a young man from my district named \nAlex Recupido, a 2010 graduate of Trumbull High School. He was a young \nman and was on his way to becoming a nurse.\n  He had moved to Florida to pursue that career when, in 2014, he fell \nprey to a heroin overdose that, like so many of these things, started \nwith the abuse of prescription opioids and moved into a heroin \naddiction and then, of course, a tragic end, as so many Americans have \nexperienced. There were 415 in my small State of Connecticut.\n  I had the opportunity to speak to Alex's mom this week. Like so many \nof these cases, there were any number of steps along the way where this \nhorrible outcome could have been prevented. People knew that he had a \nproblem, but nothing happened with treatment and recovery to stop the \noutcome of this young man dying in Florida in 2014.\n  Thirty thousand is a big and abstract number, but I wish you could \nhave heard Alex Recupido's mom, who has now devoted her life to working \nand advocating for us to do our jobs to commit the resources we need to \ncommit to address this opioid crisis in this country.\n  I wish you could have heard her. If you had heard her, we would \nprobably be working through the night tonight to make sure that we \nadequately address this unbelievable problem.\n  This is really about treatment and recovery. It is about training our \nfirst responders. And let's face it. We can use a lot of words and we \ncan talk about money, but until we write the checks to help our States \nand our municipalities and our treatment organizations and recovery \norganizations to actually make a difference on the ground, we are just \ntalking.\n  I salute that. And I do salute the majority for devoting this week to \nthese really, really important bills. But I also hope that we can do \nbetter than talking about $106 million and, through this motion to \ninstruct, actually put the resources that we need on the table to try \nto stop those 30,000 deaths that are going to occur this year unless we \nact in a meaningful way.\n  So again I salute the majority for prioritizing this week, and I \nthank my colleague, Elizabeth Esty, for offering this motion to \ninstruct. I hope we can get behind it and I hope we can actually do \nsomething good for an awful lot of tragic outcomes that will happen \notherwise.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  This legislation was crafted in collaboration with colleagues from \nboth sides of the aisle and it is in the best interest of the American \npeople as a whole.\n  Regardless of which side of the Chamber we sit on or which State we \nrepresent, the number 78 has come up time and time again. Those are 78 \nAmericans who are dying of heroin and opioid epidemic every single day \nfrom communities large and small, rural, urban, from coast to coast.\n  It is time we come together, as we have done this past week, on \nbehalf of the millions of Americans and their families who are \nstruggling with this horrible epidemic and desperately need our help.\n  The Senate has acted and now the House has put forward a powerful \nbipartisan package that reflects our priorities. This will not be all \nthe work we do together. So the package of bills that we have done will \nnot be all that this Congress does forever.\n  Together, in conference, we can enhance our collective response to \nthis crisis. I look forward to resolving the issues that have been \nraised by my colleagues across the aisle with our Senate colleagues, \nand I look forward to the conference committee, where we will resolve \nso many issues on behalf of the American families and people who have \nlost loved ones to this crisis.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, as previous speakers have already noted, 30,000 \nAmericans are likely to die this year from drug overdoses.\n  In the small cities in my district, like Waterbury, a town of about \n100,000 people, 38 people died last year from drug overdoses. In New \nBritain, Connecticut, it was 31 people. Each one of those individuals \nhad friends and family and loved ones. Each one of those deaths was \nmourned. Each one of those deaths was an unnecessary tragedy.\n\n[[Page H2376]]\n\n  Our constituents send us to Washington to work together to solve \nproblems, and this is the most basic and fundamental issue we deal \nwith, literally, matters of life and death.\n  I am pleased that my good friend, my colleague from Indiana, Susan \nBrooks, has worked so hard and that the majority has worked hard with \nthe minority this week on it. But at the end of the day, our budgets \nare also our priorities.\n  We have to find a way to provide the resources so that these \nwonderful programs and the good policies that we adopted this week are \nreflected and put into place to actually save lives.\n  We cannot claim credit for good policies when we do not provide the \nresources to the first responders on the streets, to the substance \nabuse counselors, to the coaches who need to understand the risks for \ntheir young athletes, to parents to understand those risks, to our \ndentists who are doing wisdom tooth extractions. All our work is for \nnaught if it is simply a bill passed that appears in lawbooks.\n  Our job is not yet done. So I urge my colleagues in the strongest \npossible way to continue our good work and to put into effect the \nresources so that these policies adopted in the Senate and the House \nhave the impact we all want and the American people need, which is to \nhelp save lives, to prevent our fellow citizens from becoming addicted \nto prescription drugs or to heroin, and to actually help them remove \nthemselves from that addiction and return to life in its fullest form.\n  So, again, I urge my colleagues to take these instructions and take \nthis charge to heart in the meeting in the conference committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life of Ann Day, a dedicated public servant of southern \nArizona who was tragically killed last weekend in a car crash.\n  Ann was the sister of former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor, but that did not keep her from making a mark on Arizona that \nwas uniquely hers. She came from a ranching background and brought a \n``cowgirl commonsense'' approach to problem solving that marked her \nmany years of service.\n  Ann represented Tucson in the Arizona State Senate for 10 years, \nfollowed by 12 years as a Pima County supervisor. Her efforts led to \nthe establishment of local landmarks like the Rillito River Path and \nBrandi Fenton Park, where a memorial service in her honor will be held \non Saturday. She also will be remembered for her love of nature and \nsubstantial conservation efforts in Pima County.\n  Thanks to her, generations of people from across our country will \ncontinue to be able to come to southern Arizona and experience the \nbreathtaking landscapes that we call home. She is truly someone whose \nimpact and legacy will live on far beyond her years and someone who \nwill be deeply missed by many in our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/13/house-section/article/H2376-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORIZED USE OF MILITARY FORCE\n\n  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to challenge this House to live up \nto our constitutional duty to debate the ongoing war in the Middle \nEast.\n  For nearly 2 years, our brave servicemen and -women have been \nfighting yet another war. As they face snipers and mortar rounds, \nincredibly, some claim that they are not in combat.\n  How can we claim this is not combat? And, worse, how can we ask them \nto go to war when Congress cannot muster the courage to debate it and \nauthorize it or not?\n  The last four Presidents have bombed the Middle East with little or \nno congressional oversight. Will we allow a fifth President to continue \nthese wars unchecked?\n  As the National Defense Authorization Act comes to the floor next \nweek, I submitted an amendment to force a debate on this war and repeal \nthe 2001 blank check for endless war that got us into these perpetual \nwars.\n  As you can see, the Congressional Research Service has indicated that \nthis 2001 resolution has been used over 37 times. These are some of the \nareas in which that has been used. That is just wrong.\n  The Rules Committee should allow this important debate to come to the \nHouse floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, let us debate this war, its costs, its consequences, and \ntalk about a real strategy to end ISIL's reign of terror.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/13/house-section/article/H2376-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

In fact, \nI was proud to sign on this week to the legislation creating this \ndistinction.\n  National Foster Care Month was established more than 25 years ago to \nbring foster care issues to the forefront, highlighting the importance \nof permanency for every child and recognizing the essential role that \nfoster parents, advocates, and social workers play in the lives of \nchildren in foster care across the country.\n  With nearly 415,000 children in foster care across America, it is \nsafe to say that we all know a child in foster care. Furthermore, I \nwant to recognize the families who have selflessly decided to open \ntheir homes to these boys and girls, providing good homes at a very \nchallenging time for these young people.\n  Madam Speaker, the foster care system has and always will hold a \nspecial place in my heart.

Madam Speaker, last night, my colleague, Congressman \nReichert, had a Special Order honoring our police officers for National \nPolice Week here. And though I had wished to take part in that, I \nwasn't able to; but I certainly feel the need and desire to honor our \npolice officers across this country for what they do, for being on the \nline for all of us here, and sometimes being unappreciated for that in \na strange media setting that we have these days.\n  We hearken back to 2014, when 136 officers lost their lives. Fresh on \nour mind in northern California is the loss of two of our Placer County \nofficers, Michael Davis and Danny Oliver, in a terrible run-and-gun \nsituation that was going on with a released inmate. These\n\n[[Page H2377]]\n\ntwo officers served many years in their role for the people of Placer \nCounty and northern California.\n  Like them, many others around the country have lost their lives in \nthe line of duty to protect us. We need to honor them. We need to be \nbehind them at all times. The thin blue line is between us and a lot of \nreally bad things in this Nation. They go to work each day willing to \npay the price, if it is necessary. We honor them.\n  In the midst of everything going on these days in the news and the \nmedia, it is important that we always remember their sacrifice, and \nstop and thank them, and get to know them as they are trying to get to \nknow the people in the community. We find out they are just human like \nus and are after the same things, as Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/13/house-section/article/H2377-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR CARL WHITMARSH\n\n  (Mr. AL GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I stand today in the well of \nthe House to pay tribute to a great and noble American, a person who \ngave a lot to his country.\n  He was a loyal Democrat. He was a Democrat's Democrat, but he was \nmore than that. He was a person who was a voice for the voiceless.\n  He was one of those persons who had a publication that was widely \ncirculated in Houston, Texas, and this publication was the means by \nwhich those of us who could read the front page, but not understand the \nrest of the story, we could acquire that intelligence by simply reading \nhis words.\n  He made things not only clear, but perspicuously clear. He was a \nperson that went out of his way to get truth to those who would be \nconfused, if not but for what he would do.\n  So I am honored to say that Carl Whitmarsh was a great and noble \nAmerican. But I am also honored to say that he was a person who made it \nvery much possible for the Democratic Party to thrive in Houston, \nTexas.\n  Lane Lewis, who is the current chair, benefited from his presence.

Madam Speaker, I want to begin by yielding to the \ngentleman from Montana (Mr. Zinke), one of the great freshmen here \nleading our institution.\n\n\n            Honoring the Service of Rear Admiral Brian Losey\n\n  Mr. ZINKE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of Rear Admiral \nBrian Losey, the current commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, \nour Nation's top U.S. SEAL. He is entrusted with the honor of \ncommanding all SEALs, all special boat units, and all support staff \nacross this great country and across many theatres.\n  I have had the privilege of serving with Brian Losey, SEAL Team 6, \nRed Team, and I can tell you that Brian is an outstanding officer.\n  It is an obligation of every officer to take action when he sees \nwrong, and Brian Losey did just that. He saw a problem and took action. \nHe took decisive action because he knew the actions of others around \nhim were wrong.\n  Yet, once again, an entrusted, entrenched bureaucracy was allowed to \nhide behind threats, hide behind whistleblowers, hide behind rules that \nwere intended to protect command and not to erode it. And yet, those \naccusations discredited a great officer and the head of the United \nStates Navy SEALs.\n  I understand these protections are important, and they are necessary, \nbut we cannot allow such protections to go against accountability and \nagainst the sanctity of command.\n  In this case, the Navy reviewed the investigation on Admiral Brian \nLosey. They found him to be innocent and wrongfully accused. I have \nseen the evidence and went through it line by line. I fully support the \nNavy's conclusion and believe that they properly reviewed this case.\n  The DOD had different conclusions, and I believe those DOD \nconclusions from the IG are flawed and are cherry-picked.\n  Admiral Losey is highly regarded by his subordinates, all of the \nNaval Special Warfare community, and all SEALs who have served with him \nand under his command. This includes the Navy SEAL standing before you. \nI have known this man and his family for 30 years.\n  Let me just give you a snapshot of Admiral Losey's leadership under \nhis command of Naval Special Warfare. The SEALs, and those under his \ncommand, have executed 654 total missions, have killed 461 high-value \ntargets--every one of those targets, if given a chance, would do \ngrievous harm to our Nation--have captured 60, wounded 32, rescued an \nAmerican hostage, deployed an average of 250 days of the year.\n  In 2015 alone, in Iraq, Naval Special Warfare Command and its \ncomponents were responsible for the killing or capture of over 3,000 \nenemy combatants.\n  Admiral Losey personally deployed to Operation Inherent Resolve, \nOperation Enduring Freedom in the Trans-Sahara. He has deployed to 30 \ncountries. Naval Special Warfare forces under his command are deployed \nto 70 countries across this great globe. They advanced partner forces' \nsecurity capabilities, training over 6,000 of our allies.\n  Madam Speaker, America, our men, women, and children, both at home \nand abroad, are able to sleep at night due to the leadership of Admiral \nLosey and those forces that he commands.\n  Admiral Brian Losey, I thank you for your dedicated service to this \ncountry. As a former teammate and United States Navy SEAL, I am proud \nof all that you have done for our community, for the United States \nNavy, and our grateful Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Rear Admiral Brian Losey, the \ncurrent Commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, our Nation's top \nU.S. Navy SEAL, entrusted with the honor of Commanding all Navy SEALs. \nI had the privilege of serving with Brian in the SEALs and am proud to \ncall him a team mate.\n  It is the obligation of every officer to take action when they see \nwrong, Admiral Losey did just that. He saw a problem and took action. \nYet once again, our entrenched bureaucracy has allowed senior civilian \nindividuals to hide behind anonymous accusations and whistle blower \nprotections, in an attempt to discredit a great man and cover-up their \ntransgressions.\n  While these protections are important and necessary, they cannot be \nallowed to be abused or shield them from being held accountable.\n  In this case, after the Navy reviewed the investigation of Admiral \nLosey, they found him to be innocent and wrongfully accused. I have \nseen the evidence. I fully support the U.S. Navy's conclusion and \nbelieve they properly reviewed the case and fairly adjudicated this \nmatter.\n  Admiral Losey is highly regarded by his subordinates and all of the \nspecial warfare community as a true selfless and humble leader. This \nincludes the Navy SEAL standing before you that has had the honor to \nserve with him and know him for the last 30 years. He has sacrificially \nserved our nation with distinction and honor.\n  Let me just give you a snap shot of Admiral Losey's leadership under \nhis command Naval Special Warfare Forces have:\n  Executed 654 total missions.\n  Killed 461 High Value Individuals.\n  Captured 60, Wounded 32.\n  Rescued an American Hostage.\n  Deployed an average number of 250 days.\n  NSW strives to maintain a 1:3 deploy-to-dwell ratio.\n  In 2015 Iraq alone, NSW was responsible for the coordinated capture/\nkill of over 3,000 enemy combatants.\n  Participated in Operation Inherent Resolve, Operation Enduring \nFreedom (AFG/PI/H0A/TransSahara).\n  Deployed to 30 countries as Crisis Response Forces.\n  Deployed to 70 countries to support 550 training events for allied \nand partner nations, advancing partner forces' security capabilities, \nultimately training approximately 6,000 foreign partner and allied \nmilitary personnel per year.\n  American men, women, and children, both at home and abroad, are able \nto sleep soundly in their beds due to the leadership of Admiral Losey \nand the actions of the men and women he leads.\n\n[[Page H2378]]\n\n  Admiral Brian Losey thank you for your dedicated and faithful service \nto the United States of America. As a former teammate and U.S. Navy \nSEAL, I am proud of all that you have done for the NSW community, the \nUnited States Navy, and our great nation.\n  The following in a more in depth background of the situation:\n  There has been significant public media interest in the Whistleblower \nReprisal Investigations against Rear Admiral Brian Losey, currently \nserving as Commander, Naval Special Warfare Command while serving as \nCommander, Special Operations Command Africa. My professional interest \nin these issues as a member of House Armed Services Committee, and as a \nformer member of the Naval Special Warfare Community, was drawn by the \napparent divergence in reporting put forth by the DoD Inspector \nGeneral, and the adjudication conclusions of the Navy--and further \nhighlighted by a divergent Senate address by Senator Chuck Grassley and \na pointed op-ed by the former Commander, U.S. Special Operations \nCommand Admiral (ret) Bill McRaven, which raised concerns about the \nunjust and destructive politicization of the matter. I looked into \nthese cases and identified the following significant, and not all-\ninclusive, items of concern from the evidence submitted to the DoD \nInspector General:\n  Rear Admiral Losey relieved an Air Force Lieutenant Colonel of his \nduties as Director of Personnel and Administration (J1 Director). This \nofficer was responsible for the processing of awards and evaluations \nfor service members assigned or conducting duties in support of Special \nOperations Command Africa (SOCAFRICA), and was delinquent in the \nprocessing of over 300 awards and evaluations spanning a timeframe \ngreater than two years.\n  Rear Admiral Losey and the Deputy Commander of SOCAFRICA counseled \nthis officer well before any IG complaints were raised. By word and \ndeed, this officer signaled that he was unwilling to step up his \nefforts to take care of service members, citing his family life as his \nprimary concern, and arguing against establishing the normal \nadministrative trackers for awards, evaluations, and pending transfers \nand gains in personnel as requested by Losey. After discovering that \nthis officer allowed the use of Admiral Losey's legal signature via \nauto pen 36 times without the necessary authorization, and then not \nbeing truthful about it, Rear Admiral Losey relieved him and properly \nreferred the placement of this officer to the Air Force chain of \ncommand.\n  In the same timeframe, an Army Captain assigned to the J1 filed an 8 \npage complaint against the J1 Director, citing a hostile work \nenvironment, lack of compliance with various administrative policies, \nand many of the same issues that SOCAFRICA leadership had already \naddressed in counseling with the J1 Director. An investigation was \nconducted by SOCAFRICA's higher headquarters, U.S. Africa Command, \nwhich determined that the J1 Director was culpably negligent and \nderelict in the execution of his duties on multiple counts. The \ninvestigation noted that the Senior NCO in the J1 among others, had \nreflected this officer ``was seldom in the workplace for 40 hours a \nweek.'' The AFRICOM Judge Advocate Office endorsed the investigation \nand an Air Force Major General at AFRICOM issued a Letter of Counseling \nto the SOCAFRICA J1 Director citing ``a lack of; professionalism, \nselfless service, self-discipline and duty'' and further recommending \nthat this officer ``approach future situations with the integrity and \nprofessionalism expected of an Air Force officer''.\n  The AFRICOM investigation further recommended that this officer be \nissued an adverse fitness report. Admiral Losey did not issue an \nadverse fitness report and instead, recommended this officer for all \nfor promotion requirements and promotion. It is apparent that Admiral \nLosey exercised considerable restraint and care in handling this \nofficer.\n  The written and verbal testimony as well as the substantial \nsupporting documentation submitted to DoD IG by Rear Admiral Losey, the \nDeputy Commander, and the Chief of Staff reflects good faith and \neffective efforts to resolve both performance and misconduct issues \nrelated to the former Chief of Staff and the most senior civilian \nassigned to SOCAFRICA--publicly identified as Mr. Fred Jones through \nmultiple media statements he has made related to these cases.\n  Mr. Jones was provided a written counseling document for necessary \nperformance improvement owing to a lack of staff processes, which he \nwas responsible for developing and implementing over the four years he \nwas the Chief of Staff, as well as deficiencies in staff organization \nand execution of his assigned duties. In addressing the increasing \nworkload and levels of risk brought to SOCAFRICA service members \ndeploying to Africa in the shadow of the Arab Spring and exacerbated by \nlonger term and growing Al Qaeda, Al Shabaab, and Boko Haram terrorism \nconcerns, Mr. Jones agreed amicably in writing to the creation of a \nDirector of Staff position to help level the workload not being \naddressed in his role as Chief of Staff. This parallels the common \nDeputy Commanding General for Operations and Deputy Commanding General \nfor Support structure in Army Divisions. Rear Admiral Losey, with the \ndiligent work of the staff was able to create a GS-15 position for Mr. \nJones with no decrement to pays, benefits or stature. The new Chief of \nStaff, an Army Colonel, offered Mr. Jones workspace in the Chief of \nStaff office. Mr. Jones had a couple of other choices and selected an \noffice co-located with a longtime friend, remote from the command \ngroup.\n  Shortly after the new Chief of Staff assumed his duties, he gained \naccess to the SOCAFRICA pay report. He noted and confirmed significant \nirregularities in pay benefits drawn by several SOCAFRICA civilian \nmembers with AFRICOM, who issued the report. A formal, command-wide, \nand broad scoped investigation was initiated and spanned a timeframe of \none and a half years prior to Rear Admiral Losey's arrival to \napproximately one and a half years after his arrival. The investigation \nof over 1,000 pay record entries revealed that Mr. Jones, along with 3 \nother civilians identified in allegations against Losey, comprised 92% \nof the major pay violations in SOCAFRICA in that three year period. \nThis was particularly egregious as Mr. Jones, a retired Army Reserve \nSpecial Forces Colonel, was accountable for maintaining the integrity \nand compliance of the pay system, and was the single largest violator \nof DoD Financial Management Regulations and policies in SOCAFRICA by \nroutinely seeking pay and leave benefit approvals from his \nsubordinates. This investigation and a subsequent AFRICOM IG inspection \nfurther revealed that several civilians in SOCAFRICA held unauthorized \nsuper user/system administrator privileges in the pay system and were \ncircumventing the normal benefit approval and verification processes. \nRear Admiral Losey directed Mr. Jones to personally comply with proper \nprocedures--but Mr. Jones disregarded this direction and continued to \nseek approvals of pay benefits through his subordinates. The \nwhistleblower complaints against Rear Admiral Losey were raised AFTER \nthe pay investigations were initiated and Mr. Jones implicated in \nmisconduct. To not investigate this misconduct given the data presented \nwould have been a dereliction of duty by Rear Admiral Losey.\n\n  This misconduct was further amplified when the new Chief of Staff \nwent to work with staff experts to include Mr. Jones, in creating an \napparently absent pay policy within SOCAFRICA. Weeks into this work, \nthe new Chief of Staff discovered that a policy had already been \ncreated years earlier under the hand of Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones did not \ndisclose that there was already a policy in effect that was not being \ncomplied with.\n  After designation as Director of Staff, Mr. Jones was properly \ndetailed in accordance with his job description and duties to complete \nthe body of instructions and policies that should have been in place \nfor a command that was 4 years old. With persistent management \noversight, he satisfactorily completed his tasks months after the \nagreed to suspense date, and was rated as ``successful'' in his \nperformance evaluation. This evaluation was fully supported by civilian \npersonnel policy, was not a ``lowering'' of his ratings, as this was \nRear Admiral Losey's first report on Mr. Jones. This rating did not \nrequire any Performance Improvement Plan as incorrectly asserted by DoD \nIG, and is required only for evaluations reflecting ``failure''. It \nappears that Losey did not reprise in addressing these issues. It \nappears that the responsible management officials (RMOS) as a whole, \ntook considerable care in ensuring Mr. Jones' pay and stature in the \ncreation of a GS-15 Director of Staff position were not decremented or \ncompromised.\n  In another disturbing demonstration of a lack of process, internal \nmanagement, and compliance, SOCAFRICA's executive oversight agency for \ncommunications security (COMSEC) and specifically, the handling of \nsensitive cryptographic keying material noted a pervasive lack of \ncompliance in SOCAFRICA's COMSEC program during a staff assist visit. \nDiscrepancies in COMSEC are a national security concern, and reportable \nat all times. Their discovery during the assist visit threatened to \nshut down SOCAFRICA's communications, and the numerous operations they \nsupported. Rear Admiral Losey learned that his COMSEC vault and COMSEC \nmanagers were not certified, and that there were a significant number \nof cryptographic keys in Africa that had not been documented as \nproperly destroyed. The was perplexing as Rear Admiral Losey recalled \nthe receipt of commendatory correspondence from USSOCOM for an \nexcellent internal management control program only a couple of months \nbefore his arrival at SOCAFRICA. This program is designed to apply \nadditional oversight on sensitive or high impact functions of a \ncommand, to include COMSEC. Given that the program was commendable on \none hand, and failing on another, an investigation was initiated. The\n\n[[Page H2379]]\n\ninvestigation revealed that the COMSEC oversight portion of the \ninternal management program was falsified with backdated compliance \nchecklists, and an unsupported statement of compliance. Staff \nprocesses, staff function and compliance, fell squarely in Mr. Jones \njob responsibilities. Again, Rear Admiral Losey handled the correction \nof this issue administratively at the lowest level possible. By all \nevidence reviewed, it appears that Rear Admiral Losey did his best to \nensure that SOCAFRICA was able to provide critical support to service \nmembers deploying into complex security situations and at risk, while \npreserving Mr. Jones equities as a civil servant. These areas included \nSomalia and boundary states, South Sudan, Libya, Uganda and countries \nimpacted by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and Joseph Kony, as well \nas a dozen more countries in the Trans-Sahara and Islamic Maghreb \nregions--areas where Al Qaeda and Boko Haram were spreading.\n  Civilian A, a named party in the allegations against Rear Admiral \nLosey, served as the SOCAFRICA Executive Officer (XO), and was a \nretired Army Major. He was subordinate to and rated by, Mr. Jones. He \nwas the primary unauthorized approval authority for Mr. Jones' pay \nbenefits as revealed in the broadly scoped, command wide investigation \ninto the matter.\n  As XO, Civilian A was properly detailed in accordance with his job \ndescription and duties to assist Mr. Jones in completing the body of \ninstructions and policies necessary to define and formalize SOCAFRICA's \nstaff processes and functions. Along with Mr. Jones, Civilian A \nsatisfactorily completed this task with persistent management oversight \nmonths after the agreed suspense date. In accordance with personnel \npolicy, he was given ``successful'' evaluation marks in a report \nrendered by Losey. This was Losey's first report on the member, and was \nnot a ``lowering''. As with Mr. Jones, a performance improvement plan \nwas not required, and is triggered when a member is assessed to be \n``failing''. As reflected in evidence submitted to DoD IG by RMOS, \nCivilian A had repeated clashes with senior management officials, and \nwas constant in his efforts to assert alternative realities of \ndiscussions and agreements. He was particularly resistant to direction \nto removing his liquor displays from the government workplace.\n  At the request of Civilian A, and as agreed to at the outset of the \ndetail period, Civilian A was moved to the SOCAFRICA Directorate for \nPlans (J5) upon completion of his work detail with Mr. Jones. As there \nwas no civil servant position available for him in the J5, Rear Admiral \nLosey and management officials ensured his placement by creating a GS-\n13 non-compete billet in the J5 to support and ensure Civilian A's \nprofessional placement and development desires. DoD IG instructions \nrequire that investigators assess the motives and character of \nwitnesses. In the case of Civilian A and Mr. Jones, it is apparent that \nthe whistleblower complaint against Rear Admiral Losey was likely not \ntriggered by the distant allegation of a travel infraction, but more \nproximately triggered as a shield to the long standing misconduct \nassociated with padding their compensatory time and overtime pay \nbenefits, and circumventing the very processes they were accountable \nfor instituting and enforcing in SOCAFRICA. DoD IG questioned Losey on \na ``locker room'' discussion from which nearly every quote that is \nattributed to Losey and his alleged reprisal motives emanate. After \nmisrepresenting Rear Admiral Losey's transcribed testimony in \npreliminary reports, and after separate questionings a year apart, DoD \nIG concluded that they could not substantiate that any ``locker room'' \ndiscussion occurred--this was revealed finally as an allegation made by \nCivilian A as a ``one on one'' conversation. It is a significant \nconcern, but likely an simple administrative oversight to see the \nelements of a conversation that could not be substantiated cascaded \nthrough every DoD IG investigative report as though they actually \noccurred. It is equally concerning that DoD IG enables these \ncomplainants seeking the title of ``whistleblower'' to exercise a \nseemingly unlimited dominion over truth and forthright character. \nCivilian A, as an Army Officer and Battalion XO, ordered a cover up in \nadvance of a CID investigation into a drowning death of an Iraqi \ncitizen. He later testified on the matter in exchange for immunity from \nprosecution, while soldiers from the Battalion that followed his orders \nwere tried in court. Civilian A's character is well chronicled in the \nbook ``Drowning in the Desert'' by V.H. Gambera. He was ultimately \ncensured by the Chief Staff of the Army for obstruction of justice. \nThese motive and character assessments are clearly relevant.\n  I reviewed the separate investigation into Rear Admiral Losey's \nleadership, as referenced by Admiral (ret) McCraven. Rear Admiral \nLosey's effectiveness as well the respect he generates in mission \nexecution is well documented. Additionally I note that he has exceeded \nDoD and Navy averages for every command climate assessment area based \non DEOMI Survey records.\n  I commend the Navy for its careful and forthright review of relevant \nevidence in this matter. Mission execution and ensuring proper support \nof service members in harm's way while bringing SOCAFRICA's processes \nand compliance to acceptable levels were evident drivers in RMO and \nRear Admiral Losey's actions, and clearly supports the Navy's \nadjudication conclusions.\n  I am deeply concerned that three and a half years of investigating, \nover 100 witness interviews, and 300,000 e-mails were digested to \nproduce biased reports at the near complete exclusion or distortion of \nthe testimony, evidence, and documentation that provided credible \nsupport and justification for the actions of RMO's and for a \ncommander's duty obligations and responsibilities. I am equally \nconcerned at the disregard for timeliness in the execution of these \ninvestigations, and note there is still a ``phantom investigation'' \nopen for over a thousand days? There are also legitimate concerns with \nDoD IG's handling of sensitive case material and its' release to the \nmedia. There is something seriously amiss at DoD IG.\n  Finally, I wholeheartedly agree with my colleague Senator Grassley--\nthere needs to be an independent, in depth investigation into the \nDeputy IC for Administrative Investigations, Marguerite Garrison. I \nhave substantial misgivings in the integrity, investigative practices, \ntimeliness, and compliance under her leadership in this matter based on \nmy review.\n\n                [From the Tampa Tribune, Apr. 24, 2016]\n\n                        (By William H. McRaven)\n\n       When I was a young boy my father, a veteran of World War II \n     and Korea, schooled me on the downfall of Gen. Douglas \n     MacArthur. MacArthur, he explained, had overstepped his \n     authority and shown blatant disrespect for the civilian \n     leadership of the country. President Harry Truman relieved \n     him of his command, and MacArthur retired soon thereafter.\n       Civilian rule of the military was one of the most \n     fundamental principles of the armed forces. To believe \n     differently was dangerous, my father told me. Dad strongly \n     supported Truman's action, and he made me understand the \n     value of the civil-military relationship--a lesson I never \n     forgot.\n       But over the past decade I have seen a disturbing trend in \n     how politicians abuse and denigrate military leadership, \n     particularly the officer corps, to advance their political \n     agendas. Although this is certainly not a new phenomenon, it \n     seems to be growing in intensity. My concern is that if this \n     trend of disrespect to the military continues it will \n     undermine the strength of the officer corps to the point \n     where good men and women will forgo service--or worse the \n     ones serving will be reluctant to make hard decision for fear \n     their actions, however justified, will be used against them \n     in the political arena.\n       Take the recent case of Rear Adm. Brian Losey.\n       Adm. Losey is the commander of all Naval Special Warfare \n     forces--the SEALs and Special Boat sailors. I have known \n     Losey for more than 30 years. He is without a doubt one of \n     the finest officers with whom I have ever served. Over the \n     past 15 years no officer I know in the SEAL Teams has given \n     more to this country than Brian. None. As a young officer he \n     was constantly deployed away from his family. After 9/11, he \n     was sent to Afghanistan in the early days to help fight the \n     Taliban. From there, Losey participated in the final march to \n     Baghdad and then stayed in country as a SEAL Task Unit \n     Commander. Afterward he served as the deputy and then the \n     commanding officer of SEAL Team Six during more tough \n     fighting in Afghanistan.\n       Later he was posted to the White House in the Office of \n     Combating Terrorism. He made rear admiral in 2009 while at \n     the White House. He was subsequently sent back overseas to \n     Djibouti, Africa, to do a 15-month isolated tour as the \n     commander of all U.S. forces in the Horn of Africa. As a \n     result of that successful tour, he was given command of \n     Special Operations Command, Africa (SOCAFRICA).\n       SOCAFRICA was a relatively new command, which had been \n     established to address the growing threat in North Africa. \n     Located in the beautiful Swabian city of Stuttgart, Germany, \n     it was initially staffed with military and civilian personnel \n     from another nearby special operations unit. Although most of \n     the men and women were incredibly capable, hard-working \n     staffers, there was a small core who had been living in \n     Europe for years enjoying the comfortable lifestyle in \n     Stuttgart.\n       Upon Losey's arrival in Germany, the situation in North \n     Africa changed dramatically, and the fledgling SOCAFRICA had \n     to quickly get on wartime footing. Brian Losey did just that.\n       Losey is a no-nonsense officer who knows what it takes to \n     get results. Combat is hard. Lives are at stake. Being \n     genteel and considerate of everyone's feelings are not the \n     qualities that will engender success. But although Losey can \n     be a tough taskmaster, he is a ``by-the-book'' officer. \n     Unfortunately for Losey, along the way to strengthening the \n     command there were those who fought the change and through a \n     series of whistleblower complaints sought to seek his \n     removal.\n       At the time, I was the commander of the U.S. Special \n     Operations Command in Tampa.\n\n[[Page H2380]]\n\n     I worked with Gen. Carter Ham, who commanded U.S. Africa \n     Command and had operational control of Adm. Losey, to \n     investigate the complaints.\n       The investigation we initiated determined that Losey's \n     leadership style, while brusque and demanding, did not \n     warrant his removal. The Navy subsequently recommended Losey \n     for two stars, and he was confirmed by the Senate in December \n     2011.\n       Although the Navy inspector general absolved Losey of any \n     wrongdoing, his promotion was put on hold pending DOD \n     inspector general resolution of the complaints. Nevertheless, \n     the secretary of the Navy agreed to reassign Adm. Losey to \n     the premier job in Naval Special Warfare--command of all the \n     SEALs.\n       During the past three years as commander of Naval Special \n     Warfare Command (WARCOM), his staff has consistently ranked \n     WARCOM to be one of the best places to work in the Navy. He \n     has passed all Navy IG inspections with flying colors, and \n     the retention statics for his young officers and enlisted is \n     exceptional.\n       However, in the course of those three years, the \n     whistleblowers from Stuttgart continued to pursue Losey's \n     removal and resignation, routinely submitting new complaints \n     to prolong the process and hold up his promotion.\n       A series of DOD inspector general investigations were \n     reviewed by the Navy leadership and, once again, Adm. Losey \n     was found not to have violated any law, rule or policy. In \n     fact, it was clear to the Navy that the personnel action \n     taken by Losey against the complainants was not reprisal. He \n     was recommended again for promotion to two stars.\n       Despite the Navy's multiple endorsements, certain members \n     of Congress chose to use Losey's case to pursue their own \n     political agenda. They held hostage other Navy nominations \n     until Losey's promotion recommendation was rescinded. The \n     ransom for their congressional support was Brian Losey's \n     career and, more importantly, his stellar reputation.\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, folks wonder sometimes what kind of men \nand women serve in this Chamber. And when I am asked, What did you \nlearn new, Rob, that you didn't expect when you got to Congress, I talk \nabout the caliber of the men and women who serve here.\n  If you have not had any time to spend with the gentleman from \nMontana, the former commander at Navy SEAL Team 6 spent 20 years \nserving his country in the SEALs and said: I have more leadership to \nprovide. I want to run for Congress because I want to be able to make a \ndifference in that way.\n  And he is making that difference here every day.\n  Madam Speaker, there is so much time where we spend tearing each \nother down and talking about all the problems that exist in Washington, \nand certainly, they are multiple. But to confront serious problems, you \nhave to have serious people; and we do have serious people in this \nChamber. Congressman Zinke is one of those, and I am proud to serve \nwith him, and I appreciate his leadership.\n  Madam Speaker, I want to talk about another topic that I think lets \npeople--again, we can talk about all the challenges that exist in this \ncountry, but figuring out what the problem is and who to blame for it \nshould not be our primary goal. Our primary goal should be solving \nthose problems.\n  Madam Speaker, I want to talk about unleashing America's economic \npotential, and I want to talk about the FairTax. You know about the \nFairTax. The FairTax is not two words, as you know. FairTax is one \nword.\n  FairTax is the name of a bill in Congress. Not many bills in Congress \ncommand the notoriety that FairTax does, but it is H.R. 25. Anybody can \npull it from congress.gov and read it. It is short, about 100 pages.\n  But it says, for Pete's sake, Madam Speaker, if we are going to try \nto make America competitive in the world, if we are going to try to \ncreate American jobs, if we are going to try to make America the \ncountry that you follow, if we are going to make America that leader in \nthe world, what are we going to do it on?\n  Madam Speaker, if you want to create more jobs in America, you could \ndepress salaries. We could pay everybody pennies, as some nations do, \nand try to create more jobs. That is an awful plan. That is not the \nright way.\n  If we wanted to create more jobs in America, we could stop caring \nabout clean water and clean air and just throw our environment out with \nthe job creation. But that is not what we want to do. That is a \nterrible idea.\n  Madam Speaker, as we sit here today, one thing that all the men and \nwomen in this Chamber control is the United States Tax Code. And the \nUnited States Tax Code, time and time again, is rated as the single \nworst Tax Code on the planet, the single worst Tax Code on the planet.\n  Once a week, you can open up a newspaper, find a story of a company \nleaving America to pursue incorporation outside of America's borders so \nthat they can face a lower tax rate. And folks say: Oh, how \nunpatriotic; what an awful thing to do.\n  Madam Speaker, I would tell you that the law of the land requires \nthem to do that. The law of the land says if you are the board of \ndirectors of a publicly traded corporation, you have a fiduciary duty \nto maximize return to shareholders. If you are trying to incorporate in \na company that is punishing you, and you can go to a country that \nrewards you, you must make that. It is not optional. It is required.\n  So we can either try to pass laws that trap companies here, or we can \ntry to pass laws that encourage every Nation on the planet to locate \nhere. The FairTax does exactly that.\n  Madam Speaker, let me tell you a little bit about what the FairTax \ndoes. It is a fair chance for every American family to build a better \nlife.\n  We talk so much about the income tax in this Chamber, but the truth \nis that 80 percent of American families pay more in payroll taxes than \nthey do in income taxes.\n  All the time we spend complaining about the IRS, complaining about \nthe American Tax Code, the Income Tax Code, it is the payroll tax that \nis the largest tax burden that 80 percent of American families face.\n  If you are a millionaire, a billionaire, if you are running your own \ngiant, megacorporation, you can accept your salary any way you want to. \nYou can do it from capital gains, stock options. You can have your \nprivately held company pay you dividends. You have your choice about \nhow you receive your income and, depending on what the Tax Code \npunishes and encourages, you can manipulate your income accordingly.\n  Madam Speaker, but if you are the rank-and-file American middle class \nfamily, you don't have a choice. You don't have capital gains or \ndividends or stock options to choose from. You get a paycheck, and out \nof that paycheck, the government takes the first dollar, and it is 15.3 \npercent that the government takes in payroll taxes alone.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  Now, Madam Speaker, payroll taxes are a valuable tool in this \ncountry. They fund the Medicare program, and they fund the Social \nSecurity program. These are two very important programs to America, but \nthey are both threatened. The revenue stream for those two programs is \ninsufficient to fund the demands on those programs. We have to find a \nbetter way.\n  The FairTax says: don't take the money out of an individual's \npaycheck. The power to tax is the power to destroy. When you tax \nproductivity, you destroy productivity. Rather than taxing income, \nlet's tax consumption.\n  We all wondered on April 15, Madam Speaker, what our neighbors paid \nin income taxes. Don't you wonder? Money magazine did a study one time. \nFifteen different accountants worked on the same tax return, and they \ncame up with 15 different answers. It was impossible to figure out \nwhich one was right, and none of those was the answer that Money \nmagazine came up with for themselves. But you wonder what you are \nneighbor is paying, and you wonder if they are paying their fair share.\n  What the FairTax says is we are going to charge you not based on what \nyou produce but what you consume.\n  So if you have a brand-new Mercedes sitting in your driveway, we \nthink you ought to be able to help fund the American way of life. If \nyou have a used Ford Festiva sitting in your driveway, maybe we ought \nto cut you some slack.\n  If you have just built yourself a new, 9-bedroom, 12-bathroom house, \nwe think you ought to be able to afford to pay to help grow America. If \nyou are a family of six living in a two-bedroom apartment, we think we \nought to cut you some slack.\n  If you are working hard trying to improve your life, don't punish \nproductivity, as today's Tax Code does; tax folks based on consumption. \nThat is not a crazy idea, Madam Speaker. In fact, America is one of the \nonly OECD countries, one of the only industrialized countries that \ndoesn't have a consumption tax.\n\n[[Page H2381]]\n\n  But America was founded on a consumption tax. That is exactly the way \nAmerica began, saying that if you have enough money to import silver \nfrom Europe you ought to be able to pay the tax on that. It was excise \ntaxes at that time. I am talking about a simple retail sales tax.\n  But people spend at different rates, Madam Speaker. People spend at \ndifferent rates. What I have here--you can't see it; the print is going \nto be too small--but it is the relative tax rates of a two-adult, two-\nchild household.\n  What the FairTax says is, listen, we all have basic expenses in our \nlives. If you are struggling and you are trying to make a better life \nfor you and your family, you are going to have to buy your food, you \nare going to have to have an apartment, you are going to have some form \nof transportation, whether it is a car or riding public transportation, \nand you are going to have to have clothing. These are the basic \nnecessities of life.\n  So we have created a system so that no American family pays retail \nsales taxes on those basic necessities. That is what we will call \npoverty-level spending. When you go above and beyond that, you begin to \npay the taxes.\n  What that means, Madam Speaker, is that if you are earning $32,000 a \nyear in that family of four, you are not paying a penny in taxes. \nAgain, payroll tax is today the largest tax that American families pay. \nWe are not asking you to pay a penny.\n  But if you are earning $50,000 a year, then you start to pay an \neffective rate of about 7\\1/2\\ percent. If you are earning $64,000, \nthen it is about 11 percent, and on and on and on until you get all the \nway up to a 23-percent tax.\n  There are no exceptions, no deductions, and no exemptions. Everybody \npays on everything after that poverty-level spending.\n  Again, Madam Speaker, if you can afford to have a boat and a new jet \nski sitting in your driveway, then I think you can afford to help \nstruggling families in America succeed. If you are one of those \nstruggling families and you are saving every penny that you have \nbecause you want to send your child to college one day, then we ought \nto cut you some slack.\n  Madam Speaker, the FairTax was created by a group of economists, a \ngroup of public citizen activists, who said: If we started from scratch \ntoday, then what Tax Code would we write?\n  There is not a man or a woman in Congress, Madam Speaker, who \nbelieves that if we wrote a Tax Code today that we would write the one \nwe have. The one we have is atrocious. It is atrocious.\n  What that does is it targets every individual working at the IRS. The \nIRS is the most vilified institution in this town. By moving the burden \nof taxation from income to consumption, the FairTax would close the IRS \nforever.\n  Madam Speaker, the problem with the IRS could be the occasional rogue \nman or woman that works there, but most of the men and women that work \nthere are conscientious and hardworking civil servants charged with \nimplementing the atrocious Tax Code that this Congress has passed.\n  Milton Friedman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, said: The best \nway to escape this trap that we are in is to throw the whole thing out \nand start over from scratch. He is exactly right.\n  Madam Speaker, #PassTheFairTax is the way we are driving this \nparticular debate. Imagine if working American families never, ever, \never had to deal with the IRS again. If you are a sophisticated \nbusiness, you are going to collect that tax in sales taxes. You are \ngoing to have to deal with a State tax collector, and you are going to \nhave to deal with an occasional Federal audit. But if you are a rank-\nand-file American family, you will never be threatened by the IRS \nagain.\n  Madam Speaker, you know, as I do, we handle casework all the time \nfrom constituents being pushed around by the IRS, getting threatening \nletters from the IRS and having their home threatened by the IRS. Why? \nBecause, despite their very best efforts, they messed up their tax \nreturn.\n  Money magazine hired 15 professional accounting groups to fill out a \ntax return. They all got different answers. But when an American family \nmakes that same mistake, they are punished.\n  I want to close the IRS for good, Madam Speaker. I want to get folks \nout of the business of being threatened by their government. I don't \nthink folks mind paying their fair share, but they would like a thank-\nyou for paying their fair share, not a threatening letter from the IRS \nat the end of the day.\n  What are we talking about in terms of productivity, Madam Speaker? \nThe Tax Code grows longer and longer and longer every year. The \nNational Taxpayers Union this year, by this April 15, said that in this \n1 year alone we spent 6.1 billion--billion--hours filling out tax \nreturns, that we spent collectively $330 billion to comply--$330 \nbillion to comply.\n  Madam Speaker, what would have happened to the economy if we had \ndedicated that $330 billion to economically productive activities? We \ncould have dedicated that $330 billion to paying down the debt.\n  It is not just the $330 billion that we lose because we are spending \nit on taxes. Our Tax Code is so convoluted. The New York Times reported \nlast month that $458 billion, almost one-half-trillion, go uncollected \nevery year, sometimes through fraud, sometimes through deceit, and \noftentimes just through an inability to understand the Tax Code and \nfolks not reporting it properly. Collectively, we are talking about $1 \ntrillion in lost productivity here in this country.\n  There are 11 million words of laws and regulations in the Tax Code. \nMadam Speaker, you know that you haven't read it. I haven't read it \neither. We are paying people to help us with our taxes; they haven't \nread it either. You call the IRS Help Line for help; they haven't read \nit either. Eleven million words, nobody has read it, and nobody \nunderstands it. We make a criminal out of every family in this Nation \nwhen we ask them to comply with it.\n  Madam Speaker, sadly, particularly over the last 2 years, we have \nbeen reading about abuses at the IRS, whether it is targeting groups \nbased on what their conservative beliefs are, whether it is \ninappropriately leaking confidential information, selectively leaking \nthat information to support one effort or another.\n  Madam Speaker, the IRS knows more about each and every one of us than \nmany of us are willing to tell our children, and it is wrong. You \ncannot give that kind of power to an agency without having agency \nabuses.\n  We can close the IRS. We can get every American family out of the \nbusiness of dealing with the IRS on April 15 by simply paying a retail \nsales tax when they shop at their local stores.\n  Madam Speaker, we are talking about igniting America's economy. We \nare talking about doing those things that encourage productivity, doing \nthose things that encourage risk-taking, and doing those things on \nwhich America's economy was founded but many of which we have lost \nsight of in the past several years.\n  We can't avoid paying taxes. Death and taxes are certain. What we can \ndo is make it easier, what we can do is make it more effective, and \nwhat we can do is make it less punishing.\n  We are having a debate right now, Madam Speaker, about what kind of \nnew Tax Code to provide for America. I believe we are going to get \nthere. I don't think we are going to get there this year. I think it is \ngoing to require some Presidential leadership. I think all the \nPresidential candidates remaining are talking about what they would do \nto change the Tax Code.\n  We all realize we are getting shellacked by the rest of the globe. \nAll of our major trading partners are bringing their corporate rates \ndown and down and down, creating the kind of corporate flight that we \nare talking about.\n  I don't want to talk about changing America's Tax Code so it fits in \nkind of the middle of the pack, so that we are kind of average with all \nof our peers around the globe. I would tell you, America has no peers \naround the globe. America is a leader around the globe. America stands \nalone around the globe, and America should lead the world with the \nsingle best Tax Code around the globe.\n  I don't want to lower wages, I don't want to impact environmental \nregulations, and I don't want to change those things that deliver \nvalue. I want to change those things that don't. And a complicated Tax \nCode benefits no one except lobbyists in Washington, D.C.\n  Madam Speaker, Americans for Fair Taxation, again, hired some of the \nbest\n\n[[Page H2382]]\n\neconomists we have in the land, who predicted that we could create 13 \nmillion more jobs--13 million more jobs--with a Tax Code that \nencouraged investment, that encouraged savings, and that got us out of \nthe business of punishing productivity and into the business of \nrewarding.\n  Michael Boskin, the former chairman of the Council of Economic \nAdvisers, Madam Speaker, said that the long-term gain to GDP from a \nconsumption-based tax reform would be roughly 10 percent--a 10-percent \nchange to GDP simply because we take away a punitive Tax Code and put \nin one that makes sense.\n  Madam Speaker, I don't know about families in your district; families \nin my district can't wait. Families in my district don't think the \neconomy is going so great that it is okay if we shave off 10 percent at \nthe top. We can do better and we must.\n  ``Long-run GDP per capita would be 9.7-percent higher under a \nnational sales tax,'' says Alan Auerbach at the University of \nCalifornia, Berkeley.\n  Time and time again, economists from the left and economists from the \nright come to the same conclusion: the power to tax is the power to \ndestroy. Taxing income punishes and destroys productivity.\n  ``Near-term 9- to 13-percent increase in the GDP,'' says Dale \nJorgenson, the former chairman of the economics department at Harvard \nUniversity.\n  There is a reason all of these different economists come together \naround the same figure, Madam Speaker, again, from the left and from \nthe right. We have an opportunity to do better, if only we will agree.\n  Madam Speaker, it is #PassTheFairTax. The FairTax has more \ncosponsors--again, it is H.R. 25--more cosponsors than any other \nfundamental tax reform in this institution. On the Senate side, it has \nmore cosponsors than any other fundamental tax reform bill on the \nSenate side.\n  Madam Speaker, the FairTax has supporters in every State across the \nNation. It is not coming out of Washington, D.C.\n  Passing the FairTax would take away so much of the power that this \ntown can exercise over people. We will give you a tax credit for buying \nan electric car, we will give you a tax credit for buying a windmill, \nwe will give you a tax credit for having more children, and we will \ngive you a tax credit for this, that, and the other. With the FairTax, \nall of those exceptions and exemptions go away. Hear that.\n  I started telling you about the amazing men and women who serve in \nthis Chamber, folks who come to work every day to try to build a better \nAmerica in cooperation with their bosses, their constituents back home.\n  We talk so often about how the Washington culture creates all these \nexceptions and exemptions and somebody is benefiting from it and \nsomebody is getting paid off for it. Nonsense.\n  There is one bill in this Chamber that abolishes every single \nspecial-interest exception, exemption, carveout, and credit in the \nentire United States Tax Code. That bill is the FairTax, and that bill \nhas more support in this Chamber than any other fundamental tax reform \nbill in Congress.\n  Madam Speaker, we have an opportunity to do this together. We have an \nopportunity to build a better economy together. We have an opportunity \nto take the IRS out of every single one of our constituents' lives \nforever.\n  It is going to take a lot of courage. It is going to take a lot of \ncourage to abolish all of those exceptions and exemptions. It is going \nto take a lot of courage to hit the reset clock on the American Tax \nCode. It is going to take a lot of courage to get out of the business \nof trying to be mediocre with the rest of the world and kind of settle \nright there in the middle and to move from the very worst Tax Code on \nthe planet to the very best Tax Code on the planet.\n  Worst to first, Madam Speaker. That is what the FairTax offers. I ask \nthe support from each and every one of my colleagues that has not yet \ncosponsored this bill.\n  With that, Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/13/house-section/article/H2382-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1245\n  APPOINTMENT OF INDIVIDUALS TO COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS \n                                FREEDOM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the great \nAmerican bathroom controversy.\n  On my right, this is a picture of someone who may or may not be \nrecognizable to many Americans today. I will say her name. The name may \nbe more recognizable to some. Her name is Christine Jorgensen.\n  Christine Jorgensen was born in 1926. She grew up in the Bronx, like \nI did. She went to high school at Christopher Columbus High School, \nwhich was near the public housing where I grew up in the Bronx. In \nfact, my father taught history at Christopher Columbus High School. I \ndon't know whether he taught Christine or not, but it is possible.\n  In 1945, Christine was drafted and served in the U.S. military. Now, \nthat may be a puzzle for some of you listening to me right now who say: \nI didn't realize that women were drafted in the 1940s. Well, at that \ntime, Christine's name was George, George Jorgensen. That is the name \nshe was born with.\n  She was, in fact, on her birth certificate male, something that she \nstruggled with greatly all through the time that she was growing up--\nbeing a male--something that she struggled with being in the military, \nand then after leaving military service.\n  In 1951, she heard about the possibility of changing her gender. So \nshe went to Denmark and underwent three or more surgeries, plus a very \nsubstantial amount of estrogen treatments, came back to the United \nStates, and then forever thereafter, after 1953, was known as Christine \nJorgensen.\n  Christine Jorgensen was out. She was well known in America as someone \nwho was transgendered. I knew about her story when I was growing up in \nthe 1960s and 1970s. She made no effort to hide. She didn't feel any \nshame about it.\n  In fact, she was proud of the fact that she had been able to take \nadvantage of what medicine had to offer and live the life that she felt \nshe would have been able to live from the beginning if she had the \nproper gender.\n  She had some degree of fame. Republican Vice President Spiro Agnew \nreferred to her once in a speech to mock one of his political \nopponents. She performed both as a singer and as an actress all through \nthe 1950s, through the entire 1960s, and well into the 1970s. She was \nthe most famous, if you will, transgendered person in America probably \nto this day.\n  Now, I have to tell you I don't know exactly where she went when she \nhad to go. I don't know exactly whether she went into a men's room or a \nladies' room. But here is an interesting thing. Even though this is \nsomething new under the Sun, even though America never had to address \nthis issue before, no one ever even bothered to ask.\n  I don't remember anybody saying ``Christine Jorgensen ought to go to \nthe men's room. She was born a male'' or, for that matter, ``Christine \nJorgensen identifies as a female. She should go to the ladies' room.''\n  Isn't it odd that America in the 1950s seems to have shown a lot more \nmaturity than America is showing today with our great bathroom \ncontroversy right now, where the cisgendered people of America try to \ndictate to the transgendered people of America where\n\n[[Page H2383]]\n\nthey can go to the bathroom, or, at least, frankly, the more bigoted \namong us.\n  Now, we had a law passed recently in North Carolina. I am going to go \nout on a limb and say that it passed almost exclusively with \ncisgendered Republican votes in which they tried to dictate which \nbathroom Christine Jorgensen would have to go to if she were alive \ntoday and had to relieve herself.\n  Amazingly enough, they actually decided in their wisdom that \nChristine Jorgensen, if she were alive today, like all of her \ntransgendered brothers and sisters, would have to go to the bathroom \nthat she didn't identify as but, instead, the bathroom that was on her \nbirth certificate.\n  Now, this is particularly ironic. There was one form of \ndiscrimination that Christine Jorgensen did actually face during her \nlifetime. She was not allowed to get married.\n  She was not allowed to get married to a man because her birth \ncertificate said she was a male. She was not issued a marriage license \non account of the fact that a male was trying to marry a male.\n  Well, my goodness, here in America, just in the past 12 months or so, \nwe finally managed to solve that problem. Christine Jorgensen could get \nmarried today to her lover.\n  Now we have a whole new problem. Now, thanks to Republicans and \nbigots in North Carolina, we have a law that would require Christine \nJorgensen to go to the men's room. Think about that. Think about that. \nIn fact, the natural consequence of that law is what I am about to show \nyou right here. That.\n  So you folks in North Carolina who are obsessed with where the \ntransgendered go to the bathroom, this is the result you have come up \nwith, to have people who self-identify as women, people who look like \nwomen, people who act like women--they somehow are being driven into \nthe men's room.\n  The same thing is true of the transgendered who identify as men. You \nare going to force people who look like men, act like men, identify as \nmen--you are going to force them into the ladies' room. My God, what is \nwrong with you? That doesn't make any sense at all.\n  Now, let me tell you something. If I had been back in the day growing \nup in New York and Christine Jorgensen happened to walk into the men's \nroom--it never happened, but let's say it did--I would have thought \nthat is odd, but I wouldn't have said a word about it.\n  I wouldn't have gone over to her and said to her: Excuse me. I don't \nthink you are supposed to be here. On the contrary. I would have just \nmade an appropriate mental note, assumed that she probably found \nherself in the wrong men's room, and I would have let it go.\n  I would not have felt any fear. I would not have felt any hatred. I \nwould not have felt anything that would indicate to me that somehow I \nshould discriminate against this person. Nevertheless, I would have \nthought it was odd.\n  What this law does is guarantee that experience or, worse, to have \npeople who identify and look and dress and act like women forced to go \ninto a men's room, to have people who identify and look and act and \ndress as men forced to go into a ladies' room. Are you nuts?\n  Listen, I have heard that the Republican Party is the party of small \ngovernment. I have also heard that, on the issue of abortion, the party \nof small government wants government small enough to fit into a woman's \nuterus. Now it turns out that the party of small government wants \ngovernment small enough to fit underneath a toilet seat.\n  Can't we all be adults about this? Can't we all be adults about this, \nthe way we were in the 1960s and 1970s and 1980s? Do we really need a \nnew law on this subject, much less a stupid law, a bad law, a \nridiculous law?\n  I understand that it is possible, even in the absence of this law, \nthat there might be some conceivable problems about this kind of \nsituation. I am not sure exactly what they are. I am pretty sure that, \nif everybody exactly acted as an adult, we could get beyond them \nwithout having to litigate over it.\n  I am wondering how you even enforce a law like this. What are we \ngoing to do? Have to give saliva samples every time we want to go to \nthe bathroom to see what gender we were born with? My goodness.\n  Bear in mind that there is a law against loitering. There is a law \nagainst wide stances in a bathroom. A Republican Senator learned that a \nfew years ago. There is a law against disorderly conduct. There is a \nlaw against voyeurism. There is a law against indecent exposure. In \nfact, in a really bad situation, there are laws against assault and \neven rape.\n  So why do we need a law to dictate that people who identify as men \nhave to go to the ladies' room and people who identify as ladies have \nto go to the men's room?\n  We had laws like that once. We used to say that we didn't want White \npeople to have to be uncomfortable going to the room with Black people. \nI represent part of the State of Florida. I can remember when we had \nlaws like that. And then somehow or another we pulled ourselves \ntogether and we realized how ridiculous that was.\n  Well, how is this any different? Thank goodness the Attorney General \nrecognizes that it is not. People who are cisgendered have no right to \ndictate where people who are transgendered urinate any more than people \nwho are White have the right to dictate where people who are Black do \nit. That is not America. Let's show some common sense.\n  Now, if we did actually want to deal with real problems, we could \ndeal with this one. A little boy and a little girl, both looking into \ntheir diapers, and the caption is: Oh, that explains the difference in \nour wages.\n  Now, if you want to talk about gender in America in the early 21st \ncentury, we could start with that. Why is it that women still make only \n79 cents for every dollar that a man makes in countless occupations and \nprofessions even today? Why is that?\n  If you want to get to the heart of what is really going on between \nthe sexes in America today, why don't we do something to address that \nproblem?\n  And if we want to be more dramatic about it, let's remember the fact \nthat, in America today, 91 percent of the victims of rape are women. \nCould we take our legislative energy and possibly apply it toward \ndealing with that problem, which actually is a problem that affects \ncountless women across the country?\n  Let's not protect them from having to go to the same bathroom as a \ntransgendered person by insisting that people who look and act and \nidentify as men go to the bathroom with them.\n  Let's instead try to pass wise laws that would equalize pay between \nmen and women, oh, and if we possibly could, reduce the incidence, the \nterrible incidence, of rape.\n  But getting back to this North Carolina law, there is a deep legal \nprinciple that this law offends. It offends me and it offends a lot of \npeople with a good conscience.\n  That deep legal principle is this. It goes by four letters: M-Y-O-B. \nThat is an even higher law than the law that was passed by the North \nCarolina legislature. MYOB: Mind your own business.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/13/house-section/article/H2383-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Knight (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on account of \nobligations in the district.\n  Mr. Latta (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for Tuesday, May 10, \nthrough Friday, May 13, on account of the passing of his father.\n  Mr. Payne (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \nmeetings in district.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/13/house-section/article/H2383-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON.
