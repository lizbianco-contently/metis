The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Gibson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of \nSean Patrick French and the tremendous community organization that was \nstarted to honor his life on its 15th anniversary.\n  Sean was an amazing kid, a friend to all, a community volunteer, \nhonor roll student, and a record-breaking athlete at Chatham High \nSchool. His father has described him as someone who ``never walked \nanywhere.'' His mother has told a story about him running laps at age \n8.\n  At Chatham High School, he was a standout, both athletically and as a \nmember of the school community. But tragically, at age 17, he lost his \nlife as a passenger in a drunk driving crash on New Year's Day in 2002.\n  Days after Sean's death, the Chatham High School community rallied \naround his family and organized a 100-person strong run from the high \nschool to the memorial on Route 203. His family and friends, some of \nwhom are with us in the gallery today, use this inspiration to preserve \nSean's legacy. They asked themselves: What can we do as a community to \nhelp kids make better choices? And Sean's Run was born. This year, \n2016, marks the 15th anniversary of Sean's Run and what has now \nexpanded into a weekend-long series of events.\n  I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, as a member of this local community, \nSean's Run has made a difference in our county and across the region. \nAnd as the father of three teenagers, I am personally grateful for the \nwork of Sean's Run and what it has done to prevent similar tragedies \nand educate our community on the horrors of drinking and driving.\n  Sean's Run has worked to prevent underage drinking, impaired driving, \nand for increased seatbelt use by teenagers. It has helped kids think \nabout making smart decisions and the tragic consequences that can \nresult when they don't.\n  Sean's Run has grown each year--up to over 1,500 people in 2015--and \nthe organization has become much more than an annual community 5K \nfundraiser and memorial. They regularly contribute to youth groups and \ncommunity events to support anti-underage drinking and impaired driving \nprograms and do pre-prom awareness events.\n  Sean's Run has also dedicated portions of the weekend to honor others \nlost in the community, including Meghan's Mile, a mile-and-a-half youth \nrace for children ages 12 and under. Meghan's Mile is named in honor of \na friend of Sean's, Meghan Kraham, who helped found Sean's Run at age \n16, but lost her life to cancer on August 18, 2007.\n  Since 2002, Sean's Run has awarded almost $200,000 in grant and \nscholarship money. And since 2010, when I retired from the Army and \nreturned to Columbia County, I have had the privilege to run in this 5K \nhonoring Sean Patrick French.\n  This year's event will pay tribute to Sean and others through bike \nraces, the 5K, Meghan's Mile, a prevention expo, seatbelt education, \nand the presentation of the Love of Running, Section II Good Sport, and \nSean Patrick French Memorial Scholarships.\n  I am proud of the entire Sean's Run organization and the steps they \nhave taken to prevent further tragedies such as this. Sean was a \nstrong, smart, and caring young man whose legacy lives on through this \norganization every spring and throughout the year.\n  It is my honor to host some of Sean's family and friends today, \nincluding Sean's parents, Mark and Cathy, and his brother Eric. To \nthem, I say thank you. Thank you for turning this tragedy into \nsomething that helps our community, and please know that you have made \na difference in the lives of so many families in our country and across \nNew York State. I look forward to, once again, honoring your son's \nmemory by participating in Sean's Run next weekend.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from\n\n[[Page H1684]]\n\nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, as we struggle to deal with the epidemic \nof opioid addiction and thousands of deaths from overdose, it is ironic \nthat later this afternoon I will be part of a debate at the Brookings \nInstitution about whether or not marijuana should continue to be a \nSchedule I controlled substance because, according to the statute, it \nhas no medical value and a high potential for abuse.\n  Well, as part of the national drug reform movement, this much is \nclear: marijuana is less addictive, by far, than tobacco, alcohol, and \ncocaine. Indeed, the percentage of people who become addicted is less \nthan 9 percent, as opposed to alcohol, cocaine, and tobacco, which is \nmuch, much higher.\n  It carries this designation of Schedule I despite the fact that \nmillions of people have used marijuana and there has never been a \nsingle documented case of an overdose death.\n  As to medical value, it has repeatedly been confirmed. The New \nEngland Journal of Medicine did a survey in 2013 of practitioners who \noverwhelmingly supported the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. \nIt has been endorsed by 15 State medical associations, the Epilepsy \nFoundation, and the American Nurses Association. People who have looked \nat it objectively agree that there is a huge potential for benefit. And \nthat, most compellingly, is borne out by thousands of years of human \nexistence.\n  It is used by well over a million Americans in 40 States to deal with \nthings like PTSD and chronic pain. It is well known that it helps deal \nwith the debilitating effects of chemotherapy for cancer: nausea and \nthe loss of appetite. Indeed, we are having families move across the \ncountry to be able to get legal access to medical marijuana in States \nlike Colorado because it is the only remedy that they have been able to \nget to give relief to their infant children who suffer a debilitating \ntype of epileptic seizures, torturing their babies, and it works for \nthem.\n  Well, in the 1970s Richard Nixon rejected the advice of his own \nhandpicked Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse and decided to make \nthis the centerpiece of his war on drugs. A trillion dollars later and \nafter millions of lives being affected, we are on the verge of a \nnational effort to right this wrong. We are going to see State after \nState voting to follow Oregon, Colorado, Washington, and Alaska in \nadult legalization.\n  It is time for Congress and the administration to reassess the flawed \nprinciple of making marijuana a Schedule I controlled drug, with all \nthe resulting harms and none of the benefits. It is past time for \naction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1684-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING STANLEY G. TATE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nremarkable individual and one of my oldest and dearest friends, Mr. \nStanley Tate.\n  A Miami-Dade County native, Stanley Tate has successfully served many \nroles in his long life, including businessman, civic leader, and public \nservant.\n  From a young age, Stanley was ambitious and understood the importance \nof a solid education. He enrolled in the University of Florida, where \nhe earned a bachelor's degree, followed by a graduate degree from \nColumbia University.\n  Stanley quickly proved himself to be an intelligent, capable, and \nresourceful individual who was willing to work hard to accomplish his \ngoals.\n  Not long after school, Stanley founded a general contracting firm, \nbuilding private homes and apartment buildings. As a young and driven \nnewcomer to the industry, Stanley quickly became well known and \nrespected for his quality work.\n  Never one to limit himself, Stanley continuously expanded upon his \ncontinued success, starting several other individual firms and entities \nthat focused on consulting and investments, as well as commercial \ndevelopment, including office buildings, shopping centers, and \nrestaurants.\n  While Stanley was focused on managing his companies, he also made it \na point to be very involved in public service, both locally and on a \nnational level. He served with the city council of Bay Harbor Islands \nin several capacities, including mayor and assistant mayor for 20 \nyears. He was also on the board of directors of the Florida League of \nCities and is a former chairman of the Housing Resource Team for Metro-\nDade County.\n  Due to his vast knowledge and expertise, Stanley has served as a \nwitness and testified before committees in both the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and the United States Senate regarding housing and \nbanking issues.\n  In addition, he was appointed by President George Herbert Walker Bush \nto be the chairman of the National Advisory Board of the Resolution \nTrust Corporation, and was then nominated by President Clinton to be \nthe president of the RTC.\n  One of Stanley's strongest positions is one I share. It is the belief \nthat every family should be provided a way to save for their child's \nhigher education. His vision became a reality with the Florida Prepaid \nCollege Plan. His tenure as the program's chairman for the first 18 \nyears was marked by his absolute dedication and selfless devotion to \nmaintaining the program's viability.\n  In recognition of Stanley's efforts, then-Governor Jeb Bush signed \nHouse Bill 263 into law on June 26, 2006, renaming the program the \nStanley G. Tate Florida Prepaid College Program.\n  For all of these efforts and many more, Stanley Tate has been the \nrecipient of numerous civic awards related to his work. This includes \nthe Youth Law Center's Unsung Hero Award, the College Savings Plan USA \nNetwork's Distinguished Service Award, the Miami-Dade County Commission \non Ethics and Public Trust's Arete Award, and was selected as one of \nthe Twelve Good Men of 2004 by the Ronald McDonald House.\n  As a man of strong Jewish faith, Stanley has always been quite active \nin the Miami Jewish community and a strong and early supporter of the \nDemocratic Jewish State of Israel.\n  Mr. Tate served as chairman of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation, \nand he has been heavily involved in the American Israel Public Affairs \nCommittee, or AIPAC, since its early beginnings.\n  Mr. Speaker, throughout his life, Stanley Tate has always made it a \npoint to give back to others by sharing his time, his knowledge, and \nhis passions. So today I ask my congressional colleagues to join me in \nhonoring Stanley Tate and thank him for all he has done for our south \nFlorida community, for our State, and for our Nation as a whole.\n  God bless you, Stanley Tate. May you have many good years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1684-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1684-H1685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1015\n                              PUERTO RICO\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, as we were reminded yesterday by the \nSpeaker of the House, Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, and the \nConstitution explicitly gives Congress the power to ``make all needful \nrules and regulations respecting the territory and other property \nbelonging to the U.S.''\n  Treating Puerto Rico as property is just what is being proposed by \nthe Republicans in addressing the Puerto Rico debt crisis. My friend \nhere, King George of England, would be very proud.\n  I will say, the Governor of Puerto Rico has been working hard to help \nmove a bill forward. He and his staff have been honest and tireless \nbrokers, trying to resolve a crisis decades in the making. He should be \ncommended.\n  But what the Governor and the people of Puerto Rico need are the same \nprotections that any U.S. citizen has when their local government is in \ncrisis and bondholders are circling and demanding payments. Puerto Rico \nneeds the ability to restructure her debt so that the bondholders get \nsomething instead of nothing on their investment, the local government \nis not crippled, and the people are not faced with the collapse of \ntheir basic services.\n  Congress, the colonial power, took away the ability to declare \nbankruptcy, so that was never an option--a move worthy of King George \nhimself.\n  Yes, in the bill the Republicans put forward, there is a \nrestructuring of\n\n[[Page H1685]]\n\nPuerto Rico's debt. There is even a temporary stay of the debt payments \nfor a short period of time. But at what cost?\n  As I understand it, the debt restructuring for Puerto Rico would only \ntake place if two-thirds of the bondholders on Wall Street approve. So \nWall Street fat cats can literally veto what Republicans are proposing. \nOn Wall Street, the fat cats know their Maseratis and yachts are safe, \neven if Puerto Rican schoolbuses, hospitals, and roads fall into \nfurther disrepair. They will live like kings, just like my buddy here, \nKing George. They even bragged about it at the hearing yesterday, \nsaying that the market ``responded positively'' when the Republican \nbill was introduced, because it signaled that Republicans have Wall \nStreet's back, protecting the profits of the hedge funds.\n  I simply do not see things in the Republican bill that justify \nrelinquishing what little sovereignty Puerto Rico has left to an \nunelected Federal control board. It is a new level of colonial rule on \ntop of what Washington already has, what Washington already misuses, \nwhat Washington usually rather ignores. King George of England would be \npleased that, even after 250 years, the U.S. Congress, this Congress, \ncreated to replace his tyrannical rule, has so fully embraced \ncolonialism for its distant territories.\n  As Speaker Ryan said yesterday, the fact that Puerto Rico's \ngovernment is ``ceding its authority to the Financial Control Board is \na huge, but necessary, move that will ensure Puerto Rico will learn \nfiscal discipline from a board of experts.''\n  Oh, yes, those poor islanders, those uncivilized Puerto Ricans, will \nsee how it is done up close and personal.\n  The board will have the power to reduce the minimum wage, block \novertime rules, block laws, regulations, and government contracts \napproved by the island's democratically elected government. It can \noverrule the legislature and the Governor if it does not like the \nbudget, and it can fast-track energy projects at the expense of the \nenvironment.\n  Does that sound familiar to you, Your Highness, King George?\n  Get this: Congress can impose a control board on Puerto Rico that can \nhire whomever they want, at whatever salary they want, and the people \nof Puerto Rico have to pay to for it--period, punto--100 percent. The \ncontrol board is paid for by those it controls. If that is not \ncolonialism, I don't know what is. It is so good, King George here \nwould be jealous.\n  As if to add insult to injury, the bill addresses Vieques, the island \noff the coast of Puerto Rico that the U.S. Navy bombed for decades. It \nturns over the land with no conditions.\n  Now, I am all for the people of Puerto Rico having control of the \nlands of Puerto Rico; but in the current crisis, without protection, we \nall know what is going to happen. Hotels, restaurants, and businesses \nseeking to profit will be looking for bargain prices and will be out to \nprofiteer, just like the pirates who used to control those waters.\n  Mr. Speaker, the people of Puerto Rico want jobs and an economy that \nallows them to live on the island and thrive; but so far, all the \nRepublican majority has offered is more colonial oversight, more \nausterity, and more misery.\n  I once again say this Congress should reject the King George approach \nand free Puerto Rico so that its hardworking people can build the \nisland. We should put them--yes, the people--above all other creditors, \nbondholders, and profit seekers. That ought to be our priority. The \nschoolchildren, the elderly, the working men and women, the police on \nthe beat, they need us to stand up for them as human beings, and I call \non my colleagues to join me in doing just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1685-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATING LOCAL SCHOOLS ON NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MUSIC MERCHANTS \n                              RECOGNITION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \ncongratulate staff and students at several schools in the Pennsylvania \nFifth Congressional District following their recognition from the \nNational Association of Music Merchants, better known as NAMM.\n  Now, I am a big proponent of the importance of quality music \neducation in our schools. I am very proud of what we accomplished with \nthe repeal of No Child Left Behind and its replacement with the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act, which really recognizes the importance of those \nprograms such as music education.\n  In fact, my son is a middle school music teacher in New Jersey. We \nsaw firsthand in our family that experience for all three of our sons. \nBeing involved and being impacted by music education has really helped \nthem with their creativity skills, helped them in so many different \nways. Certainly, exposure to a quality music education for my youngest \nson, Kale, motivated him to pursue further education in music \neducation. He did that with his undergraduate degree and is now a \nmiddle school music teacher in New Jersey, and making such a difference \nin the lives of the kids that he has the responsibility to teach and to \ninfluence. We are very proud of Kale, who, just this year, was selected \nas Teacher of the Year because of his contributions in music education \nand, specifically, in the lives of kids.\n  I am so proud that the efforts of the Moshannon Valley School \nDistrict and State College Area School District have led to their \nrecognition by NAMM as Best Communities for Music Education, drawing \nattention to their support and to their commitment for music education. \nIn fact, these two districts are among only 476 to receive this \ndistinction nationwide--out of America's more than 13,000 school \ndistricts.\n  In addition, I want to mention the DuBois Area Middle School, which \nreceived NAMM's SupportMusic Merit Award, which is given to individual \nschools which have shown a strong commitment to the value of music \neducation. This school is among only 118 in the Nation to be honored.\n  Music education is vital to the education of children across the \nNation and is essential to helping them become well-rounded adults. I \ncommend the staff, the students, and the parents in each of these \ncommunities for placing music in such high regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1685-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PUERTO RICO IS LEFT IN LIMBO\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of our brothers and \nsisters in Puerto Rico who, once again, are left in limbo as Republican \nleaders in Congress fail to act. As jobs are lost and young workers \ncontinue to leave the island, Republican leaders have, not once, but \ntwice, canceled plans to take up legislation in the House Natural \nResources Committee this week.\n  As a member of this committee and a Latino, I continue to be outraged \nby the majority's inability to govern and respond to the humanitarian \ncrisis on the island. Republicans will keep playing politics and use \nthe urgency of time to force a bill that will turn out to be \nsignificantly worse for the Puerto Rican people, all while asking my \nDemocratic colleagues for their support.\n  This is unacceptable. I will not vote for any deal that fundamentally \nmisses the mark when it comes to long-term, meaningful progress, \nincluding addressing wide health disparities in Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. Speaker, Puerto Rico cannot afford to risk its future at the \nhands of Republicans, and we cannot afford to leave behind millions of \nAmerican citizens who call the island home.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Dold) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Captain \nJames Joseph Boyle III, who, sadly, passed away from pancreatic cancer \nearlier this month at the age of 73.\n  Captain Boyle served on my Veterans Advisory Board and was \ninstrumental in helping advocate for veterans in Lake County, Illinois, \nand around our country. I am so proud to have had him as a friend and \nan adviser.\n\n[[Page H1686]]\n\n  A resident of Libertyville, Illinois, for 34 years, Captain Boyle is \nremembered as being a loving husband, father, and grandfather.\n  Captain Boyle graduated from Loyola University in Chicago before \nserving in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968. As an artillery Officer, he \ncommanded both a Marine rifle company and a Marine artillery battery at \ndifferent points in his tour. For his time in Vietnam, Captain Boyle \nreceived a Bronze Star Medal, an honor well-deserved. Even long after \nhis own service ended, Captain Boyle never stopped caring for his \nfellow marines. He was an active member in the Marine Corps League of \nLake County.\n  It is because of veterans like Captain Boyle that we are able to live \nfree from tyranny today. He is an American hero and will be greatly \nmissed.\n\n\n                   Remembering Corporal Richard Vana\n\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I also rise today in remembrance of Corporal \nRichard Vana, a member of our Greatest Generation and a veteran of the \nUnited States Marine Corps.\n  Corporal Vana, sadly, passed away earlier this month at the age of \n92, having lived a long life, with public service at its core.\n  Serving during World War II, Corporal Vana was a member of the Marine \nRaiders and fought in the Battle of Okinawa for 99 straight days. It \nwas during this battle that Corporal Vana and another marine rescued a \nwounded soldier, taking him to shelter. Without the heroic work of both \nmen, the marine surely would have died from his injuries. Corporal \nVana's outstanding service to our country did not go unnoticed, as he \nwas awarded two Purple Hearts.\n  Upon returning home after the war, Corporal Vana operated a Community \ncab, and was a founding parishioner of St. Stephen's Church.\n  A family man, Corporal Vana was a loving husband and father, finding \njoy in his 28 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren.\n  Corporal Vana's passing is a loss not only to his friends and family, \nbut to our community and our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, my thoughts and prayers are with this brave soldier's \nfamily and friends during this trying time.\n\n\nHonoring Mundelein High School Students for Completion of DOORS Program\n\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor students at Mundelein \nHigh School for completing the Doors of Opportunity Relevant to \nStudents, or DOORS, program.\n  DOORS works to help prepare students for future careers by bringing \nreal-world skills into the classroom.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nthe District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, Saturday is Emancipation Day in the District \nof Columbia. It marks the day, April 16, 1862, when 3,100 slaves in the \nDistrict of Columbia led the way to freedom, securing their freedom 9 \nmonths before the Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves nationwide.\n  Isn't it ironic that, because Emancipation Day comes on a Saturday, \nthe American people are going to have 3 extra days to file your income \ntaxes?\n  Even though it is not a national holiday, it is a very special day \nfor those of us who live in the District of Columbia because we are \ntrying to get our full rights, the same rights as every other American.\n  While I vote in committee representing the people of the District of \nColumbia, I cannot vote on this floor. Others can vote on this floor on \nmatters affecting my district and my district only, yet the District \nhas more residents than two States and as many residents as about seven \nStates in the United States. We outnumber Vermont and Wyoming.\n  There on this poster you see the District, Vermont, and Wyoming, yet \nVermont, Wyoming, and every other State in the United States have two \nSenators and at least one Representative.\n  About seven States have one Representative who votes on this House \nfloor. I do not vote on this House floor. The people I represent have \nearned every single right that every other American has.\n  Here on this poster are D.C.'s casualties in the major 20th-century \nwars, where the District of Columbia outpaced many States in casualties \nduring those wars: World War I, more casualties than three States; \nWorld War II, more casualties than four States; the Korean war, more \ncasualties than eight States; and the Vietnam war, more casualties than \nten States.\n  These are American citizens who went to war for their country, died \nwithout a vote, did not come home, and their relatives today still do \nnot have the vote on this House floor and have no vote in the Senate of \nthe United States.\n  The largest irony of all, however, is shown on this poster. The \npeople I represent here in the Nation's Capital pay more taxes per \ncapita--more--than any residents of any State in the United States. \nThey pay the highest taxes--$12,000 per person--and there are almost \n700,000 people here. Who pays the lowest taxes in the United States per \ncapita? It turns out to be Mississippi.\n  But wherever they come from, American citizens pay fewer taxes, less \nin taxes, than the people who live in their Nation's Capital, even \nthough the people who live in the Nation's Capital live in a city that \nis among the oldest American cities, whose citizens still do not have \ntheir full rights as American citizens.\n  This is in violation of a treaty the United States signed in 1992, \nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The United \nStates has been found to be in violation of that treaty because the \nU.S. does not give the residents of the District of Columbia the same \nrights as other Americans.\n  Ours is the only capital city in the world where those who live in \ntheir capital do not have the same rights as others, yet, as you saw in \nthe District's casualties, this city has given and then given again.\n  The District wants to become the 51st State of the United States of \nAmerica. That is the only way we can keep the Congress from interfering \nin our local affairs.\n  The District has to bring its own local budget to the Congress. We \nraise $7 billion in the District of Columbia. Our budget has to come \nhere for the Congress to sign off so that we can spend our own money. \nWhat kind of autocracy is this?\n  Of course, what is most frustrating to us is that most Americans \nthink that we who live in your Nation's Capital have the same rights as \nevery other American. After all, they see me on the House floor and \nthey see me vote in committee.\n  The greatest frustration, of course, to us is that most Americans do \nnot know we do not have the same rights as they, and they would not \ncountenance for a moment that there are in our country any Americans \nwho are treated as unequal citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1686-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1686-H1687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THANKING SHARRA FINLEY FOR SERVING CENTRAL WASHINGTON\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, last month, the Director \nof the Defense Intelligence Agency testified that ISIL-Daesh will \nattempt mass murder within the United States. Sadly, despite these many \nthreats, the President has failed to take ISIL seriously, dismissing \nthem as the ``JV team'' and describing them as ``contained.''\n  It took an act of Congress to compel the President to submit a plan \nto defeat ISIL and violent extremists. Over a month after the February \ndeadline, his plan of a pathetic seven pages was released. This is not \na serious plan to protect American families, eliminating terrorist safe \nhavens.\n  This is not a real plan because it does not directly reference \nradical Islam or jihad once. It is not a real plan because it only \noutlines past activities. It clarifies the President's legacy of \nfailure.\n  Sadly, it is clear that this does not provide a path to defeat ISIL \nand mass murderers. While I have confidence in our servicemembers and \nmilitary leaders, they deserve a clear mission. Seven pages is not \nsufficient, as American families are at risk of attack.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1687-8", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        GOLDMAN SACHS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS ACTIONS\n\n  (Mr. WELCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WELCH.

It is tax deductible.

In Erie County, 11 people die per week from suspected opioid \noverdoses. Yet one in nine Americans with substance abuse problems--\nless than one in nine--are currently receiving treatment for their \ndisorder. One cause is a cap that limits the number of patients a \ndoctor can treat with opioid treatment medications such as Suboxone.\n  I have introduced legislation to raise these caps and expand \nprescribing authority to physician assistants and nurse practitioners, \nwhich is especially important in medically underserved communities. \nWhen treatment was approved for use in France without patient caps, the \nopioid overdose debt rate declined by 85 percent in 5 years.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the TREAT Act, to give professionals \nthe tools they need to treat addiction and our families new hope for \nrecovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1688-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WATER RESOURCES\n\n  (Mr. GIBBS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. GIBBS.

Water transportation is the safest and most fuel-\nefficient, least polluting, and least expensive means of moving goods.\n  The public and private sectors must work together to deliver safe and \naffordable water to millions of Americans every day.\n  In 2014, we wrote a landmark Water Resources Reform and Development \nAct, which was signed into law. It reformed the way the Army Corps of \nEngineers studies and completes their projects; it shortened the nearly \nendless study and environmental review process; and, most importantly, \nit included no earmarks.\n  Our economy cannot afford to see the locks and dams of our Nation's \ninland waterways system fail, preventing cargo from reaching its \ndestination. Our agriculture and energy industries depend on open and \nsecure water transportation systems, and we hope to accomplish that in \nWRRDA 2016.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1688-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FILIPINO VETERANS OF WORLD WAR II CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL\n\n  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Ms. GABBARD.

This yearly event brings thousands of folks \nfrom around the country to experience the culture of southeast \nTennessee.\n  South Pittsburg is also the home of the iconic American company Lodge \nManufacturing, a major sponsor of the Cornbread Festival.\n  Growing up, almost all of us can remember a Lodge Cast Iron skillet \nplaying a prominent role in home-cooked meals.

Mr. Speaker, like many Americans, I spent last weekend \nstruggling through my taxes, and I would like to know, like other \nAmericans, that that money is going to be used in a responsible way and \nthat we are going to move toward fiscal stability around here.\n  I am the lead Democratic sponsor of Mr. Goodlatte's constitutional \namendment to require a balanced budget. In my opinion, the only way you \nare going to get Congress to get serious is to have a constitutional \nrequirement that the budget be balanced and that the President submit \nto Congress a balanced budget.\n  You can't pretend you are going to do it just by cutting the heck out \nof everything. It has to include revenues, has to close tax loopholes \nand overseas tax havens and a whole bunch of other things that are \nleading to revenue losses.\n  So I am introducing an improved amendment over and above that from\n\n[[Page H1689]]\n\nRepresentative Goodlatte which deals with a few concerns I have about \nthat one.\n  This one clearly protects Social Security and Medicare. This one \nclearly closes a loophole that we can't have off-budget spending for \nmilitary operations. We must have a declaration of war if you are going \nto exceed a balanced budget. It would require the budget be balanced \nwithin 5 fiscal years of passing this.\n  We have been kicking this can down the road. It is not a can anymore. \nIt is a mountain of debt that we are giving to our kids. We have got to \nget serious about solving this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1689-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING MORTON PLANT HOSPITAL\n\n  (Mr. JOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Morton Plant \nHospital, which celebrates its 100th anniversary this year.\n  In 1912, Mr. Morton Plant was vacationing in Pinellas County, \nFlorida, when his son, Henry, was seriously injured. He quickly \nrealized the closest medical care was a day's drive, so he offered the \ncommunity a $100,000 endowment to open a local hospital. On January 1, \n1916, the Morton F. Plant Endowed Hospital opened with 20 beds and 5 \nbassinets.\n  In the decades to come, Morton Plant Hospital would emerge at the \nforefront of cardiovascular health, orthopedics, neuroscience, \nemergency care, and neonatal health.\n  It has been awarded the baby-friendly hospital status by the United \nNations Children's Fund. It has also been recognized by the Florida \nHospital Association as the innovation of the year in patient care. \nMost notably, it is the only hospital in the United States to be \nawarded for 13 consecutive years the Top 100 Hospitals designation by \nThomson Reuters.\n  Morton Plant was created out of a community effort, and the hospital \ncontinues to serve the Pinellas County community. I congratulate them \non 100 years of service, and I offer the sincere gratitude of our \nPinellas County community for Morton Plant's tireless work on behalf of \npatients and families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1689-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY\n\n  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, at 3:30 p.m., I am hosting a \npublic discussion at the Community College of Rhode Island Lincoln \ncampus to highlight financial aid opportunities for students and the \nwork we need to do in Congress to address the crisis of student debt.\n  Our young people are drowning in student debt. It is projected that \n65 percent of the job openings by 2020 will require postsecondary \neducation or training beyond high school, so this will become even more \nurgent.\n  The cost of education in a 4-year university has increased 250 \npercent since 1979, while real wages have stayed about the same.\n  Compared to 1979, students pay $26,000 more per year for a private \nuniversity and $11,000 more each year at a public university. The \naverage Rhode Island college student has over $31,000 in student loan \ndebt, the fourth highest in the country.\n  We need to guarantee young people that they can graduate from college \ndebt free. We need to allow students to refinance existing debt at \nlower rates, and we need to increase Pell grants and other investments \nin higher education. This needs to be a national priority. We need to \ndo it now. Our future depends on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1689-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING JUSTIN DEETS\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is April \n15, the deadline for passing a budget. It is clear that the Republicans \nare going to miss it. From the start, this process has been a travesty.\n  Before President Obama even released his budget, Republicans \nannounced that they would refuse to hold a hearing on it. They rejected \nthe President's budget out of hand even before it was printed, a move \nunprecedented in this modern era.\n  Then they passed out of committee a budget that would end the \nMedicare guarantee, take healthcare coverage away from 20 million \nAmericans who received it under the Affordable Care Act, and make deep \ncuts that harm children, students, seniors, and hardworking Americans.\n  Then the Tea Party wing of the GOP insisted on walking away from the \nbipartisan budget agreement inked just last fall.\n  So that brings us to today. My Republican colleagues don't seem to \nhave a budget or a plan to move forward. The process has collapsed.\n  I urge my colleagues to start over and to work with Democrats to \ncraft a budget that invests in our future and meets the challenges \nfacing our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1689-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL VOLUNTEER WEEK\n\n  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS.

Yet, rather than work \nwith Democrats to advance a budget resolution that reflects the \nspending levels of the hard-fought 2-year bipartisan budget agreement \nadopted just 5 months ago, House Republicans have decided not to pass a \nresolution at all because some in their caucus want to undo that \nbipartisan agreement.\n  Budgets are values-based documents, but they don't have to represent \njust one set of values. They can be inclusive and should represent the \nbroad diversity of the interests of the people we represent.\n  Working together, we can demonstrate the power of government to spur \neconomic growth, provide for national security, and meet the needs of \nour people.\n  Mr. Speaker, one only has to look at the growing costs of the Zika \nvirus, the opioid addiction problem, and the Flint water crisis to \nrealize the cost of doing nothing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1690-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          JOE MACALUSO SPILLS THE BEANS ON LOUISIANA HOTSPOTS\n\n  (Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nsubmit extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3791, which is a \nmuch-needed regulatory relief bill and economic growth bill, sponsored \nby an outstanding, energetic, and inspirational freshman on our \ncommittee, the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. Love).\n  As we look at the state of our economy today, we know one thing is \nfor certain, Mr. Speaker, and that is that the economy is still not \nworking for millions of working Americans. The economy is \nunderperforming dramatically by any historic standard.\n  Given how far the economy fell from the Washington induced real \nestate bubble burst of 2008, history shows us that we should have had \nfaster growth than normal during a rapid rebound phase. But it didn't \nhappen, Mr. Speaker. There hasn't been a single year where economic \ngrowth has even reached 3 percent.\n  One published report on this failure noted:\n\n       There is no parallel for this since the end of World War \n     II, maybe not since the beginning of the Republic.\n\n  Last quarter's GDP growth of only 1 percent just punctuates the \nmatter again for working families that find themselves working harder \nfor less. They have seen their paycheck shrink by more than $1,600. No \nwonder 72 percent of all Americans believe the country is still in a \nrecession, because they are living that reality every day. For them, \nthe recession never ended.\n  I don't need polls telling me, Mr. Speaker, that the economy is not \nworking for working families because virtually every day I receive \nemails or letters like these:\n  Carla from Mesquite, Texas, in my district writes:\n\n       We are struggling to make ends meet. My husband had \n     temporary work for 3 months. The last 2 years, he has been \n     looking for work and not finding any.\n\n  Michael from the town of Forney in my district back in east Texas \nwrites:\n\n       I hear on the news how the economy is improving and I see \n     Wall Street making money. Average folks like me are not \n     seeing any economic improvement.\n\n  The painful truth is that the Washington hypercontrolled economy, \nagain, is failing low- to moderate-income Americans. They simply want a \nfair shot, a fair shot at economic opportunity and financial security.\n  Perhaps nowhere--nowhere--is the hyperregulation of Washington being \nfelt more than when it comes to the customers of Main Street community \nbanks. These banks are being buried under an avalanche of red tape, \nwhich is increasing costs for those customers, restricting their \nchoices, and harming their personal finances.\n  Let's just look at a few examples, Mr. Speaker. Credit card rates \nhave risen drastically, making them unaffordable and unavailable for a \nnumber of would-be borrowers. Federal regulations now on auto loans \ncould hit some borrowers hard with a nearly $600 increase in interest \npayments on a $25,000 loan over a 4-year period.\n  Small business lines of credit have been cut back dramatically. And \nincredibly, the incredible regulatory burden placed on home buyers has \nnow complicated the buying process and has led to fewer community banks \noffering home mortgages.\n  The fact is all of these higher costs are being felt at the same time \nthat paychecks and savings are stagnant for working families. It just \ncompounds the problem. The sheer weight, volume, and complexity of all \nof these regulations is killing prospects for new jobs, killing \nopportunities to spur economic growth, and it is harming working \nAmericans. It is killing their ability to achieve financial \nindependence through their home mortgages, through their auto loans, \nthrough their credit card loans, and through their small business lines \nof credit.\n  So it is on their behalf and on behalf of the Carlas and the Michaels \nof America, and millions of others like them, that we are here to pass \na very simple, but very helpful, bill. It is a commonsense piece of \nlegislation.\n  The bill, again, sponsored by the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. Love), \nwill make it easier for our small hometown community banks to raise \ncapital so that capital, this very same capital, can be turned around \nand turned into local jobs and economic growth on Main Street.\n  We know that passing this bill will immediately--immediately--benefit \nmore than 400 community banks all across America. Not big banks, Mr. \nSpeaker, not Wall Street banks, but community banks. Those are the \nbanks, historically, that focus their attention on the needs of our \nlocal families, our small businesses, and our farmers.\n  As a matter of fact, passage of this bill is a longstanding goal of \nthe Independent Community Bankers of America. At the end of the day, we \nshouldn't pass this bill simply because it is good for community banks. \nWe should pass this bill because it is good for their customers--the \npeople who benefit from the loans and services that our community banks \nprovide, the people who will work at the jobs, the people who will help \ncreate this stronger economic growth.\n  Wouldn't it be nice to hear for a change that community banks are \nonce again hiring new loan officers to serve their communities as \nopposed to more\n\n[[Page H1692]]\n\nregulatory compliance officers to serve their Washington masters?\n  That is how you help capitalize more small businesses and help \nfamilies pay their bills, plan for the future, and achieve the dream of \nfinancial independence.\n  I, again, applaud the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. Love) for her \nleadership for fighting tenaciously for working families in her \ndistrict and all across America.\n  I urge all Members to support and adopt H.R. 3791.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are now considering a bill that not only could put \nour community banks at risk, but strikes at the heart of why compromise \nin Congress can be so challenging.\n  H.R. 3791 would direct the Federal Reserve to raise the asset \nthreshold under the small bank holding company policy statement, \nallowing small banks and private equity firms to take on additional \ndebt for mergers and acquisitions. The threshold would be increased to \n$5 billion in consolidated assets from $1 billion. Let me stress that \nthis would be 5 times as much as the current threshold and 10 times as \nmuch as the initial level that was in place before a bipartisan \ncompromise was enacted last Congress.\n\n  The small bank holding company policy statement is important because \nit allows small institutions, like community banks and minority-owned \ndepositories, to access additional debt so they can continue serving \ntheir communities. However, it is important that this threshold is \ncarefully calibrated so it cannot be abused by speculative investors.\n  If the threshold is raised too high, it will have the opposite of the \nintended impact. It will lead to mergers and acquisitions, riskier \nbanking activities, and a reduction in banking services and credit \navailability to rural, low-income, minority, and underserved \ncommunities.\n  Indeed, Democrats and Republicans on the Financial Services Committee \nworked together just a little over a year ago to provide relief to \nalmost 5,000 community banks by doubling the asset threshold under the \npolicy statement to the current level of $1 billion from $500 million \nin assets. We did so after working closely with regulators and \ndetermining that $1 billion was the most appropriate threshold to help \ncommunity banks grow without making them targets for mergers and \nacquisitions. At $1 billion, the policy statement covers 89 percent of \nbanks in the country, providing relief to the vast majority of \ncommunity banks and minority-owned depository institutions.\n  I am trying very hard to understand why my colleagues are reneging on \nthat compromise and undermining the careful, considerate policy that we \nenacted. The administration has threatened to veto this measure because \nof the potential danger to our smaller banks and to the communities \nthey serve. They have called this bill an unnecessary and risky change \nbecause we know what will happen if the Federal Reserve has to make \nthis change.\n  For one, raising the threshold would have a serious impact on the \nconsolidation of community banks. The majority purports to be concerned \nwith consolidation in the banking industry and the disappearance of \ncommunity banks.\n  This bill will all but ensure that larger banks and investors come in \nand purchase smaller banks and then cut branches in the communities \nthat need them the most. We have already seen this happen with banks \nacross the country, both large and small, that have been forced to shut \ndown hundreds of branches because investors and shareholders demand \nhigher and higher returns.\n  I supported the change we made last year to $1 billion because it \nwould help ensure that small community banks are able to continue \nserving their communities. That is the point of the small bank holding \ncompany policy statement. We must help our communities retain access to \nlocal banks that know the specific needs of their consumers and small \nbusinesses.\n  This bill would do the opposite. Even those that did survive wouldn't \nbe able to provide the same personalized service because of their size. \nI am particularly concerned about how this would impact our underserved \ncommunities.\n  Another problem with this legislation is that it would allow banks \nwith as much as $5 billion in assets to operate under lower standards \nand less oversight by regulators. Many community banks failed during \nthe 2008 financial crisis because they became overleveraged. Certainly, \nif a bank makes bad decisions in the amount of risk they take on, then \nit is appropriate to let it fail, but the failure of any bank, and \nespecially a bank with up to $5 billion in assets, has a tremendous \nimpact on the community it serves and on the Deposit Insurance Fund.\n  At the end of the day, more bank failures will increase premiums for \nall the banks protected by the Deposit Insurance Fund. We cannot allow \nreckless behavior that benefits investors and bank shareholders at the \nexpense of small banks and the communities they serve.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3791 is not a small change. It is a risky move that \nthreatens both bipartisanship and these already polarizing times, as \nwell as the safety and soundness of our community banks and the \ncustomers they serve.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``no'' on this bill. Mr. \nSpeaker and Members, allow me to reiterate the point. We worked very \nhard in reaching across the aisle, in making compromise, in making \ncommitments to each other, and in agreeing that we would raise the \nasset limit from $500 million to $1 billion. We had that agreement, and \nbefore the ink was dry on the deal, here we have a bill that says: So, \nwe really didn't mean it. We want to raise it to $5 billion. Ha, ha, \nha.\n  People wonder why we don't compromise more, why we can't get together \nmore, why we can't understand what is in the best interests of all of \nour constituents, to put aside our differences, and work on behalf of \nthose people we say we care about. The other side claims it cares about \ncommunity banks. Then why would it renege on this agreement? If it \ncares about community banks, why would it put them in the position of \nbeing bought up by private equity firms and special money interests, \nwhich only want to find a way to make more money and more profit by \nclosing down branches and firing people? That is what they do. When \nthese private equity firms come in, they borrow a lot of money in order \nto make these kinds of purchases. Then guess what? They have to take \nthe money back. So guess who are the victims of this kind of agreement? \nThey are the small banks and the constituents.\n  While my chairman--a gentleman whom I like very much and get along \nwith very well--opens with statements that have nothing to do with this \nbill and while he talks about the plight of those in our communities \nwho are suffering, let me tell you why they are suffering not only in \nhis community but in communities across this country. It is because in \n2008, we had a subprime meltdown and a crisis that was created by these \nkinds of reckless public policy attempts. We discovered that, because \nof all of the exotic products and all of the recklessness of some of \nthe big banks and others, we put our people at risk, and we put our \nconstituents at risk. Guess what? They lost their homes. Many of them \nare homeless and are on the streets now. Many of them cannot afford the \nrents that have risen because of the crisis that we have come out of.\n  If you really want to help small banks and community banks and if you \nreally want to help your constituents, you will not be for a bill like \nthis one. This only puts them at risk. I ask my colleagues to vote \n``no'' on this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say, number \none, I find it incredible that the ranking member would say that this \nis going to harm community banks, which kind of begs the question: Why \nare they all for it? We already have their endorsements.\n  If the gentlewoman is concerned about big banks gobbling up small \nbanks, then maybe it is time to repeal Dodd-Frank since the big banks \nhave gotten bigger and since the small\n\n[[Page H1693]]\n\nbanks have become fewer, and the small banks tell us that it is Dodd-\nFrank that is killing them. This is a bill that will help small banks \nsurvive. They will merge together as opposed to disappear from our \nrural communities.\n  With respect to increasing risk, I would urge the ranking member to \nread the Fed's policy statement, which reads that the Board may, in its \ndiscretion, exclude any small bank company regardless of asset size. So \nthat takes care of that issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman \nfrom Utah (Mrs. Love), the author of the bill.\n  Mrs. LOVE. I thank Chairman Hensarling for his support of this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, economic freedom and personal freedom run hand in hand. \nIn order to enjoy our personal freedom, Americans need access to credit \nas individuals, on behalf of their families, and in their businesses. \nThat is why I am so proud to have introduced this bill.\n  H.R. 3791 is a very simple bill to help small banks and savings and \nloan companies get access to the capital they need so as to make credit \navailable in their communities.\n  These small banking institutions are critical to the people and the \ncommunities in which they reside. They support the credit needs of \nfamilies, of small businesses, of farmers, and of entrepreneurs. A \ncommunity bank is often the principal lending source for many people \nwhether they are purchasing a home, starting a new business, or \npurchasing a vehicle. In many counties around the Nation, a community \nbank is the only banking presence that residents have.\n  When these community banking institutions are overwhelmed with \nregulations and mandates, many of which are meant for larger \ninstitutions, it is the hardworking middle-income and low-income \nfamilies in those communities who suffer the most. Mr. Speaker, it is \nabout people. Community banks give people the credit they need to \npursue their dreams--to buy a home, to start a business. In fact, \nproximity to a community bank increases the chances that new small \nbusinesses will be approved for loans and will have the chance to \nsucceed.\n  By raising the consolidated asset threshold under the Federal \nReserve's small bank holding company policy statement from $1 billion \nto $5 billion in assets, over 400 additional small bank and thrift \nholding companies will qualify for coverage under the policy statement \nand, therefore, will be exempt from certain regulatory and capital \nguidelines.\n  These capital standards were originally established for larger \ninstitutions and disproportionately harm small holding companies. Many \nholding companies that are above the current threshold face challenges \nwith regard to capital formation just when regulators are demanding \nhigher capital levels. These exemptions provided in the policy \nstatement make it easier for small holding companies to raise capital \nand issue debt. This bill is about making sure regulations fit the size \nof the institution.\n  Mr. Speaker, a similar effort was passed into law during the last \nCongress under suspension in the House and by unanimous consent in the \nSenate. That bill raised the threshold from $500 million, where it has \nbeen since 1996, to $1 billion. That legislation also extended the \nexemption to savings and loan holding companies. While we are glad that \nwe were able to achieve that increase which helped, roughly, 500 small \nbank and thrift holding companies, we would like to extend those \nbenefits further. H.R. 3791 would bring more than 400 additional small \ninstitutions within the scope of the policy statement.\n  One success story that we have already seen from the previous \nincrease was an instance in which 35 bank holding companies pooled \ntheir resources to issue debt under the policy statement. That debt was \nthen downstreamed to the respective banks, where the capital was then \nused to make loans in the communities they serve, illustrating the \ngreat multiplier effect that the policy statement can produce. H.R. \n3791 seeks to extend that flexibility and success to a greater number \nof small institutions and the communities they serve.\n  Opponents of this increase have alleged that changing the regulatory \nthreshold would put communities and the Deposit Insurance Fund at \nhigher risk, but the policy statement contains several safeguards that \nare designed to ensure that small bank holding companies that operate \nwith the higher levels of debt permitted by the policy statement do not \npresent an undue risk to the safety and soundness of their subsidiary \nbanks.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, to sum this up, this bill is not about supporting banks. \nIt is about supporting families, communities, and small businesses. It \nis about making sure that a small-business owner, like my constituent \nJennifer Jones, has access to the credit she needs to expand her early \nchildhood academy, where she teaches children to read before they reach \nkindergarten. It is about families who are sitting around their kitchen \ntables and are imagining the possibilities of renovating or of \nimproving their homes. It is about that entrepreneur who is starting a \nrestaurant and being her own boss. It is about the thousands of new \njobs that will be created in those communities as a result.\n  The raising of the threshold received widespread bipartisan support \nin the last Congress, and I hope that the people will receive equal \nsupport this time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I thank very much the ranking \nmember for yielding and for her leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3791.\n  I would like to note the Statement of Administration Policy on this \nbill, which reads that the bill ``amounts to an unnecessary and risky \nchange.'' I am disappointed that we are even considering this bill, \nbecause I thought that we had reached a thoughtful compromise--a good \nfaith compromise--on this issue last year.\n  Last Congress, we came together in a bipartisan way to increase the \nthreshold for small banks that want to make acquisitions of other banks \nor financial companies and that want to finance these acquisitions \nbased--and dependent to some extent--on debt. The Fed used to prohibit \nbanks with more than $500 million from using debt to finance these \npurchases, but in recognizing that this threshold was out of date, we \nworked together to raise the threshold to $1 billion last Congress. I \nwas proud of that deal, and I thought it reflected a good faith \ncompromise in the Financial Services Committee.\n  Now, less than a year later, our colleagues in the majority, \napparently, want to change the deal. They want to raise the threshold \nfrom $1 billion to $5 billion--a 500 percent increase over the deal \nthat we just struck a year ago. A $5 billion bank is, needless to say, \nsignificantly larger than a $1 billion bank, and a $5 billion bank \nlikely engages in a much broader range of activities than does a simple \n$1 billion community bank.\n  Raising the threshold to this level would actually facilitate more \nconsolidation among community banks. Banks at the high end of the $5 \nbillion level would take on more debt, buy smaller banks, which would, \nthereby, lead to the deterioration of community bank branches in the \nneighborhoods that we represent, and it would also lead to fewer jobs \nas they then seek to slim down operations.\n  The current policy statement already covers 89 percent of the banks \nin the country. Eighty-nine percent of the banks are covered by the \ndeal we struck last year, so raising this level further is not \nwarranted. It is risky. It is unnecessary. The Statement of \nAdministration Policy says that it will be recommending a veto from the \nPresident of the United States. It is unnecessary; it is unwarranted; \nand it reverses a spirited compromise and good policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), the chairman of the Financial Services \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, today, the House will consider H.R.\n\n[[Page H1694]]\n\n3791, legislation to raise the consolidated asset threshold under the \nFederal Reserve's small bank holding company policy statement.\n  To say that the current regulatory environment presents challenges \nfor small financial institutions would be a drastic understatement. \nToday, regulators require more and more from community-based \ninstitutions in terms of both regulatory oversight and capital \nrequirements. Mrs. Love's bill seeks to alleviate some of the pressures \nthat are facing our community banks.\n  Small bank and thrift holding companies confront unique challenges \nwith regard to capital formation, which is of particular concern at a \ntime when regulators are demanding more capital. In understanding these \nchallenges, the Fed has recognized that small banks have limited access \nto equity financing.\n  The Federal Reserve's small bank holding company policy statement \ngives relief from certain capital guidelines and requirements, making \nit easier for a community bank to raise capital and issue debt and to \nmake acquisitions and form new banks and thrift holding companies.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Our Nation's smallest banks have faced significant recession, \nconsolidation, and an alarming number of bank failures. By increasing \nthe threshold in the Fed's policy statement from $1 billion to $5 \nbillion, we have the opportunity to help an additional 400 true \ncommunity banks.\n  I know that the last speaker was concerned about 89 percent of the \nbanks being already under this policy, but we are talking about 400 \nmore communities that we can help to be able to have access to a \nregular stream of credit, rather than have to have increased costs and \nalso bear restricted services from those banks.\n  H.R. 3791 will go a long way in ensuring that our Nation's smallest \ninstitutions are able to grow stronger and continue to serve their \ncommunities.\n  I want to thank Mrs. Love for her leadership on this issue. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the bill.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to \nhow much time we have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 18 \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 16\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, my friends on the opposite side of the \naisle, who have brought this bill to the floor, claim they care about \ncommunity banks, even when we know this bill will just result in more \nconsolidation among small financial institutions.\n  Just yesterday the Republicans repealed the mechanism by which we \nwould wind down systemically important firms. This puts us back to the \ndays of September 2008, when our largest financial institutions could \nnot only threaten the entire economy, but also the stability of our \ncommunity banks.\n  Remember that when Wall Street banks cratered our mortgage system, \nthey devastated the entire economy in ways that damaged not just \nworkers and borrowers, but also small financial institutions.\n  Republicans, likewise, later today will repeal the independent \nfunding for the Financial Stability Oversight Council, our regulator \nexpressly charged with examining the largest, most interconnected, most \ncomplex, Wall Street firms.\n  Again, the Republicans want the biggest players to escape scrutiny, \nthereby threatening our smaller community institutions.\n  Republicans also have failed to put forward credible housing finance \nreform. Recall that in 2013 the chairman brought up his PATH Act, which \nwould have all but excluded small banks and credit unions from the \nsecondary market, especially handing the keys to our mortgage markets \nover to the largest Wall Street banks.\n  By eliminating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, community financial \ninstitutions across the country would have had mortgage lending come to \na halt.\n  Finally, remember that Republicans are willing to hold our government \nhostage over favors that help the largest banks and only expose our \ncommunity financial institutions to more risk.\n  We need not go too far back to remember the 2014 fight over the \ngovernment spending bill, where Republicans were willing to risk a \ngovernment shutdown in order to repeal Dodd-Frank's swaps pushout rule, \nwhich would have required our largest banks to separate their riskier \nderivatives activity from the accounts holding depositors' money.\n  Let us be clear. My chairman has said over and over again, and never \nfails to remind us, that he hates Dodd-Frank. He wants to get rid of \nDodd-Frank reforms. He said he would do anything to get rid of Dodd-\nFrank and the reforms that were put in place by the Congress of the \nUnited States and signed by the President.\n  He forgets what happened in 2008. He forgets the meltdown. He forgets \nthe risk. He forgets about the almost depression that we found \nourselves in.\n  He does not want to strengthen the hand of regulators. He does not \nbelieve that our regulators should have on their agenda consumer \nprotection.\n  That is why, in all of this struggle, whether it is talking about the \nsmall banks or--you should hear him on the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau. He hates that Bureau, and he wants to dismantle that \nBureau because they do not want regulations, really, for the biggest \nbanks in this country.\n  Oftentimes, what they are doing is they are benefiting the big banks, \nbut they are making it look as if they are benefiting the smaller \nbanks. So we have to push back very hard on these attempts.\n  Moving from $1 billion to $5 billion is an absolute unraveling of our \nagreement. It is wrong to work so hard with the opposite side of the \naisle and come to an agreement, only to have them renege on it.\n  But, in the final analysis, it is because they would rather put their \ninfluence and their time in on what amounts to helping the big banks \nand not the small banks and forget about what this does to our \ncommunities.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Schweikert).\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and, also, my good \nfriend Congresswoman Love. She actually has become a very valuable \nmember of the Financial Services Committee.\n  I appreciate this bill. We have to talk through something because \nthere is something here that is just bordering on--you know, we are \npassing each other in the night here. That makes absolutely no sense.\n  Dodd-Frank: I accept some folks bathe in love for it, but it has made \nthe big, money-center banks bigger. So a bill comes along that says \nthere is this concentration--if you believe it is a concentration of \nrisk--because these banks are growing bigger and bigger and bigger. And \none of the big reasons they are growing bigger is because they can \namortize the regulatory risk over a much bigger book of business.\n  The money-center banks are $2 trillion institutions. We are talking \nabout a $5 billion step-up here. The small banks, which we are losing \none a day, cannot cover these costs. Their regulatory costs on a much \nsmaller book of business is putting them out of that business.\n  So if you want to make the big banks smaller, you can try to regulate \nthem more. But they have demonstrated that actually is their \ncompetitive edge in the world right now. What you need to do is compete \nthem out of their hugeness, if that is a word.\n  If you care about competition, if you want to stay with your rhetoric \nthat, hey, we need to deal with these big banks and we need to keep \nregulating them, then create a market where other banks can start to \ntake parts of their market share because the big banks have a different \ncost of money.\n  They have this ability to take this huge regulatory environment--\nsometimes five different agencies that have some level of prudential \ncoverage--and amortize it over a book that is $2 trillion.\n  How about giving smaller institutions a chance to start taking some \nof their market share? That is what Mrs. Love's bill does.\n\n[[Page H1695]]\n\n  It starts to say--and we are still talking something that is tiny in \nthe banking world--let these holding companies get up to $5 billion. \nLet them actually start having a fighting chance to take some of this \nregulatory burden that has been shoved down their throats and start to \namortize it over a little bit larger book. Because if you leave it at \nthe smaller institutions, they cannot compete.\n\n  If you want to make the big banks smaller, create an environment \nwhere they face competition. This is a classic argument around here. Do \nyou believe that you make the world safer by layer and layer and layer \nof regulation? Well, that worked great in 2008, didn't it?\n  We are going to file our paperwork and maybe next quarter some \nregulator will look at it and maybe the next 6 months someone will \nwrite a letter about it. Or do you want an environment where there is \nso much competition out there that there is lots of optionality in the \nfinancial markets? That is what we are looking for here.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, it is a fairly simple argument. If you \nwant a competitive, robust financial market in our banking world, where \ninstitutions have the ability to survive because of the crushing costs \nthat Dodd-Frank has created. This is a simple, simple bill. It is just \na chip off the iceberg that is Dodd-Frank.\n  Think about it in a way that this is the first step to try to create \nmore competition to those big banks that I hear the left rail on day \nafter day. This is a good piece of legislation.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining \non both sides, please.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 13 minutes \nremaining. The gentlewoman from California has 13\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire, also, whether the other \nside has any more speakers?\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, we have no more \nspeakers.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Neugebauer), the chairman of the Financial Institutions and \nConsumer Credit Subcommittee.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the time. I \nalso want to commend the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. Love) for an \noutstanding piece of legislation.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 3791. Sometimes we get up here and we \ntalk about things in a technical way. And let me just explain to you \nwhat this good piece of legislation does.\n  Unfortunately, over the last few years, we have lost over 1,000 \ncommunity banks in our country. In fact, we are losing them at the rate \nof about one a day right now.\n  That is important to my district because I am from the 19th \nCongressional District, which is a relatively rural district. I have a \nlot of small communities that have community banks in there. Some of \nthem have been in business 75 or 100 years.\n  Unfortunately, in this environment, because of all of the regulations \ncoming out of Dodd-Frank, many of these financial institutions are no \nlonger viable on a standalone basis.\n  What is the alternative? Well, the alternative for those small banks \nis to search for someone to purchase them so that that bank can remain \nin that community.\n  In Texas, for example, this bill would allow 44 small bank holding \ncompanies to be able to help absorb some of those smaller banks.\n  Why is that important? Because in many of those communities, that \nlittle community bank is really one of the last corporate citizens \nstanding there. They are the ones that sponsor the scoreboard for \nFriday night football, which is kind of big in Texas. They are the ones \nthat support the chamber of commerce.\n  So what the Federal Reserve recognized is that, normally, they don't \nallow debt to be used as the transaction for larger holding companies, \nbut they realized going out and getting capital for these small \npurchases is difficult.\n  So what the Federal Reserve has said is: Well, we are going to allow \nthem to use up to 75 percent of the purchase price that can be debt.\n  Now, this does nothing about the safety and soundness. In other \nwords, the holding companies that are purchasing these still have to \nmaintain the appropriate capital ratios and all of those other things.\n  So this in no way affects the health of the banking industry, but it \ndoes facilitate the ability to make sure that these small community \nbanks are able to stay in the communities they are in by being \npurchased by an entity that is a little bit larger that can amortize \nthat cost.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3791 and support community \nbanks.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Hill).\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Love stands with Main Street. \nMain-Street-based community banks are why we are on the floor today, \nbecause they are at the heart of helping our families start new \nrestaurants, get consumer financing, finance our farmers.\n  I come from a very rural state, Arkansas, and 70 percent of the \nagricultural production loans in this country are made by our locally \nowned community banks.\n  Making it easier for them to raise capital makes it easier for our \nconsumers and businesses to get the credit they need. For every dollar \nraised in capital at our banks, $10 can be put into lending into our \ncommunities. And small bank holding companies have less access to \nequity financing than their larger counterparts. It has always been \nthat way. So this effort makes complete common sense, to allow small \nbank and thrift holding companies to expand their capital base in an \neasier and more directed manner.\n  Dodd-Frank made it harder to raise capital because of the changes in \nthe law about trust preferred securities and other ways that many, many \nsmall banks raised capital. So this policy statement change that Mrs. \nLove proposes is well-timed.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  There is bipartisan support for raising this threshold to $5 billion, \nnotwithstanding the comments heard in today's floor conversation. \nSenator Brown, Democrat in the Senate, with Mr. Vitter in the Senate \nlast Congress, proposed $5 billion as the appropriate level for this \neffort.\n  Additionally, Mr. Speaker, concerning the ranking member's comments \nabout raising the threshold on carte blanche relief under the policy \nstatement that might lead to unsafe conditions, that is, in my view, \nnot correct, Mr. Speaker, as there are numerous other restrictions and \ncriteria that continue to apply, and the Federal Reserve retains the \nright to impose capital standards if it determines it necessary to \nprotect the safety and soundness of the institutions.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HILL. This bill is about Main Street and economic growth, and it \nsurprises me as just a Member of Congress that our President, President \nObama, would issue a veto message on this bill.\n  This bill is about economic growth, and I applaud my good friend from \nUtah's efforts at championing this bill. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport its commonsense design and measure.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to set the record straight. I have in my \nhand a statement from United States Senator Sherrod Brown. It is a \nstatement on House Bill to Alter Federal Reserve Small Bank Holding \nPolicy Statement. U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, ranking member of the \nU.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, issued \nthe following statement today on legislation--that is this legislation, \nH.R. 3791--that would increase\n\n[[Page H1696]]\n\nthe asset threshold for the Federal Reserve small bank holding company \npolicy statement: ``I understand that proponents of H.R. 3791 have \nmentioned a similar provision that I included in a larger bill in 2013 \nas somehow relevant to the current debate before the House of \nRepresentatives. It might be relevant if the House was also engaged in \na real effort to address too big to fail, and it might be relevant if \ntime had stood still. But since 2014, Congress and regulators have \nprovided significant regulatory relief to community banks and raised \nthe threshold of the small bank holding company policy statement to $1 \nbillion. Raising the threshold to $1 billion was where Congress, \nregulators, and stakeholders could find broad bipartisan consensus on \nthis issue, and I support that. I do not believe we should take further \naction to raise the threshold, and it is wrong to suggest otherwise.''\n  So, ladies and gentlemen on the opposite side of the aisle, don't use \nSherrod Brown's name one more time because this statement puts that to \nrest. He is not in support of raising this threshold to $5 billion.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. I rise in support of \nthe gentlewoman from Utah's bill that would allow more small bank \nholding companies to raise the necessary capital to better serve not \nonly their customers, but their communities.\n  H.R. 3791 would raise the consolidated asset threshold from the \nFederal Reserve small banking holding company policy statement from $1 \nbillion to $5 billion. By simply raising this asset threshold, more \ninstitutions would be able to qualify for coverage under the policy \nstatement and be exempt from the ongoing burdensome regulatory \nguidelines.\n  My home State of New Hampshire is chock-full of community banks and \ncommunity-based financial institutions, and having a higher threshold \nwould help more community banks in my State and others across the \ncountry meet their higher capital requirements under Basel III.\n  I appreciate this commonsense approach that the gentlewoman from Utah \nis taking, and I appreciate her leadership because just in my State, we \nhave had a 20 percent reduction of community banks. That means the \naverage individual who is looking for an additional loan, whether it is \npersonal or to start a new business, they can't get access to that \ncapital. That is hurting the very people that the other side tries to \nclaim to support.\n  Just last week I heard about a woman who recently was divorced, had \ntwo kids, and is a nurse. She was looking for a mortgage to start her \nnew life again. She was denied because of these burdensome regulations. \nThat should not be the intent in this country. We should be able to \nhelp those individuals who are trying to succeed, create a better life, \ngive their children opportunity. H.R. 3791 does just that.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill. I, again, thank the \ngentlewoman from Utah for her leadership.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Katko).\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, while the financial crisis certainly showed \nthat targeted regulations were needed to protect our financial system, \nit also showed that the real threats to the system did not come from \ncommunity banks and other small financial institutions. Yet, because of \nhigh compliance costs and a fiendish complexity of the Dodd-Frank law, \nwhich all too often fails to recognize the lower risks posed by these \ninstitutions, they have been put at a disadvantage.\n  This bill is part of the effort by the House to institute targeted \nreforms and ensure that we are not holding back small, stable \ninstitutions that millions of individuals and small businesses trust.\n  H.R. 3791 is a well-targeted bill that will make it easier for small \nbank holding companies to raise capital and provide needed regulatory \nrelief by raising the consolidated asset threshold for small bank \nholding companies. In doing so, this bill will benefit local economies \nand improve the health of the American economy as a whole.\n  At the same time, the bill contains important safeguards to ensure \nthat the financial system isn't put at greater risk. In short, this \nbill is exactly the kind of measured approach that Congress should take \nto protect homeowners and investors while also ensuring that we have a \nvibrant, well-functioning financial sector.\n  I would like to thank Representative Love for her work on this bill \nand Chairman Hensarling for his hard work and leadership. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the \nbalance of my time.\n  On Tuesday in the Committee on Rules, I reminded Members that I came \nto the Committee on Financial Services--it was known as the Banking \nCommittee back then--in the wake of the savings and loan crisis. One of \nthe biggest lessons I took away from that time was that we must be \nprecise when we mandate changes to bank safety and soundness rules, \neven when our intent is to help community financial institutions.\n  Congress' intent may have been to help savings and loans serve their \ncommunities, but by not being measured and considered in its actions, \nCongress transformed the savings and loan industry into one that serves \nspeculative investments and irresponsible CEOs.\n  That recklessness led to a banking crisis that brought down more than \na thousand institutions, cost taxpayers more than $120 billion, and \nrobbed many communities of access to affordable banking products.\n  As I have said, it is important that the small bank holding company \npolicy statement threshold is carefully calibrated so it cannot be \nabused by speculative investors. If the threshold is raised too high, \nit will have the opposite of the intended impact. It will lead to \nmergers and acquisitions, riskier banking activities, and a reduction \nin banking services and credit availability to rural, low-income, \nminority, and underserved communities.\n  That is why 2 years ago I worked diligently with my Republican \ncounterparts to pass a bill that raised the threshold to $1 billion in \nassets, providing additional funding resources to 89 percent of the \nbanks in the United States. That was smart, bipartisan legislating, a \ndecision that we came to after consulting the regulators, researching \nthe industry, and carefully considering the ramifications of the \nproposal.\n  In addition to that bill on the small bank holding company policy \nstatement, I and my fellow Democrats in both the House and the Senate \nalso introduced comprehensive legislation that would reduce compliance \ncosts at community banks. We introduced this legislation, which \nincluded carefully targeted reforms that would allow small banks to \nthrive rather than encouraging consolidation, as this bill would do.\n  Our support for small institutions is also why my fellow Democrats \nand I have been supportive of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \nwhich has used SMART data analysis to thoughtfully calibrate their \nrules for the needs of small banks.\n  We often forget that in the run-up to the crisis, many small banks \nwere pushed out of the lending business by unregulated, nonbank \nlenders. The CFPB has now created an even playing field, and small \nbanks and credit unions are a bigger share of the mortgage market now \nthan they have been in years.\n  Carefully considered reforms provide relief to community banks \nwithout creating unintended consequences in a complex financial system \nwith many players. Unfortunately, the legislation before us today \nwould, as my friends across the aisle say over and over again, hurt the \npeople it is trying to help.\n  After we worked in good faith with Republicans to come up with a \nsmart, targeted reform, we are now attempting to use this issue as a \npolitical wedge. It is exactly that kind of thinking that set the \ngroundwork for the savings and loan crisis and left thousands of \ncommunities without access to banking services.\n  I would urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.\n\n[[Page H1697]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield myself the balance of the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, ever since the Dodd-Frank law was passed, none of the \npromises that were made have been kept. It didn't end too big to fail. \nBig banks have gotten bigger. Small banks have gotten fewer. Working \nAmericans continue to fall behind. They have seen their paychecks \neither remain stagnant or shrink. They have certainly seen their bank \naccounts shrink.\n  After Dodd-Frank, we have seen free checking at banks cut in half. \nSince other financial laws of the Obama administration have been \npassed, we have seen 15 percent fewer credit card offerings, and on \naverage, many of them have increased by 2 percentage points in cost, \nhurting working Americans who need access to credit.\n  For purposes of the debate today, Mr. Speaker, what is undeniable is \nthat we are losing a community financial institution a day in America. \nAs we lose those financial institutions, we are also losing the hopes \nand dreams and financial security of millions of our fellow countrymen, \nparticularly those who live in rural areas, like huge portions of the \nFifth District of Texas that I have the honor of representing in \nCongress.\n  I keep on hearing the ranking member talk about a ``deal,'' something \nfrom the last Congress. The last time I read my Constitution, there is \nnothing to say that because one Congress acted on a matter, another \nCongress can't act on a matter. And, indeed, I am not sure we have any \nmore urgent matter in the House Committee on Financial Services than to \nsave community banking.\n  It is urgent, almost bordering on a crisis, Mr. Speaker, the loss of \nthese banks. Small business lines of credit have been hampered, small \nbusiness, the job engine of America, fueling our entrepreneurs, fueling \nnew businesses, fueling the American Dream.\n  So I was happy that we passed a number of bipartisan regulatory \nrelief provisions in this Congress. Now, regrettably, many of them were \nopposed by the ranking member. So I hear the rhetoric in helping \ncommunity banks, and yet she opposed H.R. 766, Financial Institution \nCustomer Protection Act supported by community banks; H.R. 1210, \nPortfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act supported by community banks; \nH.R. 1266, Financial Product Safety Commission Act of 2015 supported by \ncommunity banks; H.R. 1408, the Mortgage Servicing Asset Capital \nRequirements Act, supported by community banks; and the list goes on \nand on.\n  So I think the proof is kind of in the voting card, Mr. Speaker. It \nis Members of this side of the aisle, especially, that are consistent \nin trying to help our community banks, our rural communities.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  So right now they are all, again, Mr. Speaker, suffering from the \nsheer weight, volume, load, complexity, and cost of this massive \nWashington takeover of our banking system--the micromanagement, the \ncontrol by Washington.\n  Again, that is the primary reason we are losing a community financial \ninstitution a day. And let me tell you, they are not going to get \nbought up by JPMorgan. JPMorgan is not coming to Jacksonville, Texas. \nGoldman Sachs isn't coming to Forney, Texas.\n  If we don't allow these smaller banks to consolidate, we will lose \nthem. That is the choice, Mr. Speaker. Are we going to lose our \ncommunity banks in rural America?\n  And again, if the other side of the aisle would want to repeal their \nnumber one threat--Dodd-Frank--maybe this bill from the gentlewoman \nfrom Utah wouldn't be necessary. But it is necessary. It is an urgent \nsituation that we deal with today.\n  So I want to urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3791. It is \nmodest. It will help at least 400 community banks. Four hundred \ncommunity banks will be helped. It will help them, hopefully, not only \nsurvive, but to thrive, so that they can fuel and finance the American \nDream through better home mortgages, through better auto loans, through \nbetter small business lines of credit.\n  I want to thank the gentlewoman from Utah for her hard work, for her \nleadership. And, again, I urge all my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3791.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.\n\n\n            Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Kelly of Illinois\n\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 15, strike the period and insert the \n     following: ``for bank holding companies and savings and loan \n     holding companies which have submitted to the Board of \n     Governors of the Federal Reserve System a credible plan to \n     expand access to banking accounts and services, consumer and \n     small business credit products, and bank branches in rural, \n     low-income, minority, and otherwise underserved communities, \n     which has been made available to the public via the holding \n     company's website and submitted to the Committee on Financial \n     Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 671, the \ngentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues have put \nthis bill forward under a simple proposition: small- and mid-size banks \nneed the ability to provide more lending opportunities to best serve \ntheir depositors and their communities. I agree with that premise. \nAccess to credit is crucial to economic development, rebuilding our \neconomy, and creating jobs.\n  Banks and deposit institutions are vital to creating economic \nopportunity. From small business loans, farm loans, and mortgage loans, \nto a simple checking account, access to banking services is essential \nfor all Americans.\n  I firmly believe that allowing banks to access additional capital is \na good idea, and good policy, so long as those banks are using those \nfunds to lend in a fair and responsible manner to those people and \nentities that need it most.\n  My amendment is simple. It merely adds a clause at the end of the \nbill stating that the increase to a level of $5 billion in assets will \nonly apply to lenders who serve rural, minority, low-income, and \notherwise underserved communities. These lenders will be required to \nhave a clear and credible plan to expand access to banking services in \nthose communities, and submit their plan to the Federal Reserve and to \nCongress.\n  Let me put it this way, Mr. Speaker. Suppose a very common scenario: \na high school student has a part-time job after school and receives a \nlittle money each week from her parents to round out her spending cash. \nSuppose that student asked her parent to increase her allowance by 500 \npercent. She says she needs it because with school obligations, she \nwill be working less and won't have enough money to both fill her car \nwith gas, go to the movies, or out to dinner with friends.\n  Would a reasonable parent simply start handing over five times as \nmuch money as they used to? Or would they ask their daughter a few \nquestions, making sure that the money is truly being spent on a \nproductive thing?\n  The student may be completely right--a 500 percent increase may be \njustified--and they may have nothing but good intentions with the \nadditional money.\n  But what is the harm in asking? What is the harm in making sure? It \nis what a responsible authority would do.\n  My Republican colleagues say this bill is needed to allow banks to \nlend--to spur economic growth and ensure banks are able to serve their \ncustomers.\n  What is the harm in making sure that lending goes to those \ncreditworthy businesses and individuals who need it most?\n  If we want to encourage expansion of access to credit, let's make \nsure it goes to where it will do the most good: a mortgage loan for a \nsingle mom working hard to achieve her vision of the\n\n[[Page H1698]]\n\nAmerican Dream; a business loan for a small manufacturing company \nlooking to open a new facility in an urban community that hasn't seen \nnew jobs in years or decades; a farm loan for a small family farm so \nthey can continue operations and raise the grain and produce what will \nfeed the world.\n  My district is urban, suburban, and rural. So I have farmers, I have \npeople from the city, and I have suburbanites. And I see the need in \nall of those communities.\n  My amendment simply states: the threshold increase will apply to you \nif you promise to responsibly lend to those who qualify and need it \nmost and where it will do the most good, and to report to the Fed and \nCongress about how you plan on going about it. No regulations, just a \nsimple justification.\n  Mr. Speaker, all creditworthy borrowers deserve fair access to the \nfunds our banks have available to lend. Expanding lending opportunities \nand ensuring lenders can access capital to create more jobs and \neconomic growth is something we all should be able to support. I simply \nwant to ensure that when doing so, banks are responsible and provide \ncredit broadly and fairly, including to the communities where it will \ndo the most good.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, at best, this amendment is duplicative. Under section 3 \nof the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve already requires \nall companies seeking to acquire a bank to submit an application \ndescribing how that acquisition would ``meet the convenience and \nneeds'' of the target bank's community. Listing ``any significant \nchanges in services or products'' and discussing ``the programs, \nproducts, and activities that would meet the existing or anticipated \nneeds of its community under the applicable criteria of the Community \nReinvestment Act, including the needs of low- and moderate-income \ngeographies or individuals.''\n  But I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, as our community banks continue to \nclose, as they continue to suffer under the weight of the load, they \ndon't need duplicative law. And my fear is that it is not actually \nduplicative. This is one more report, one additional report they are \ngoing to have to file in addition to the hundreds of other reports and \npaperwork that they have to fill out, one more cost that, at best, is \nduplicative. But the amendment is vague.\n  What does it mean to have a plan deemed credible? What is credible?\n  So here we are as a United States Congress, under the gentlewoman's \namendment, yielding more of our article I authority to the Federal \nReserve. The amendment lacks procedural safeguard. It doesn't provide \nfor a public comment on the submitted plan. It doesn't allow the \ncompany to appeal an arbitrary determination. It does not permit a \ncompany posting a plan on its Web site to necessarily redact trade \nsecrets or personally identifiable information.\n  Mr. Speaker, we just need to reject this amendment. It absolutely \nundercuts what the gentlewoman from Utah is doing.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I am just wondering, if this is \nduplicative, why are banks closing in these communities? If there are \nsome concerns, why not work with me instead of rejecting this \namendment? If it is duplicative, then why can't we add it and see how \nwe can make things better? I still get a lot of concerns that people \nwho need loans in various communities that I serve still don't get \nthem.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I yield to the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I would just like to point out that \nhere is a Democrat on this side of the aisle who is offering to the \nRepublican side to support the idea that you would raise the asset \nlevel for these small banks if only you would support minority banks, \nif only you would have a plan for CRA, if only you would do the right \nthing, if you care about the constituents, and they are rejecting it.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on each side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 3 minutes \nremaining. The time of the gentlewoman from Illinois has expired.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Utah (Mrs. Love), the author of H.R. 3791.\n  Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say, while I have much \nrespect for my colleague on the other side of the aisle, I am opposed \nto the amendment.\n  Let me reiterate again what this does. I understand that the other \nside of the aisle believes that we have already helped our community \nbanks by raising the threshold from $500 million to $1 billion. \nHowever, we don't want to help our communities any longer or anymore?\n  This, again, would give access and the ability for 400 small banks to \nhelp their community. And I don't want you to think about this as 400 \nsmall banks. Please think of this as how many thousands of people these \nsmall banks are going to be able to help--people who are going to \nreceive access to credit that they need in order to achieve their \ndreams.\n  It is time for us in Washington to stop giving people exactly what \nthey need to stay exactly where they are and start giving them the \nopportunities to go beyond, to go to the middle class and beyond, if \nthey choose; to have the opportunities to be as ordinary or \nextraordinary as they choose to be.\n  This is going to help many people from all walks of life in all sorts \nof communities. And that is why I believe that we in Congress should do \nour job and give as many people access to this credit so that they can \nhelp their families.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Again, I just want to thank the gentlewoman from Utah for her \nleadership. She has made such a great impact on our Financial Services \nCommittee.\n  Again, I am not sure we have a more urgent matter on our committee--\nwe have many important matters--but when you are losing a financial \ninstitution a day in America, and thus losing the hopes and dreams of \nmillions who count on the community financial institutions to help buy \ntheir homes, fund their cars, capitalize their small businesses, it is \nan urgent matter. This is an important underlying bill that will grant \nrelief to an additional 400 community banks to survive and, hopefully, \ngo beyond surviving to actually thriving.\n  As ever well-intended as the amendment is from the gentlewoman on the \nother side of the aisle, it puts one more stumbling block in front of \nthese community banks who are just withering on the vine, who are \nstruggling.\n  Again, it is, at best, duplicative. Everything the ranking member \nbrought up theoretically is already addressed in section 3 of the Bank \nHolding Company Act.\n  Why would you have to turn in essentially two different versions of a \nsimilar report?\n  More paperwork burden. At some point, it is the straw that breaks the \ncamel's back, which absolutely breaks the back of community banking.\n  So it is time to reject the amendment. It is time for all Members to \nsupport H.R. 3791.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand submit extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3340, the Financial \nStability Oversight Council Reform Act, and I would like to thank our \ncolleague who authored this legislation, the gentleman from Minnesota \n(Mr. Emmer). He is certainly one of the hardest working and most \nthoughtful freshmen that we have on the House Financial Services \nCommittee.\n  As the American people know all too well, Mr. Speaker, over years--\nnot years, decades, in fact--Congress has ceded far too much power to \nunaccountable bureaucrats, Article I ceding power to Article II. At the \nsame time, it has provided many unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats \nwith access to money with no accountability for how that money is \nspent.\n  The Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, as it is known by \nits acronym, typifies this misguided yielding of power to the \nunaccountable and unelected.\n  Last month there was, however, a small victory for those who are \nalarmed by this ever-encroaching Federal Government and the shadow \nfinancial regulatory system that FSOC is a part of and that operates \nwith little transparency or accountability to the American people. I \nspeak of the recent judicial ruling that struck down FSOC's designation \nof MetLife as a too-big-to-fail financial institution. FSOC's decision \nwas found to be ``unreasonable'' and the result of a ``fatally flawed \nprocess.''\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, the American people can achieve yet another \nvictory today, another step in restoring the rule of law in checks and \nbalances, by reining in an administrative state run amok, by passing \nthe important bill that is in front of us now. FSOC is clearly one of \nthe most powerful Federal entities to ever exist and, unfortunately, \nalso one of the least transparent and least accountable.\n  First, the Council's power is concentrated in the hands of one \npolitical party, the one that happens to control the White House. All \nbut one of FSOC's members is the Presidentially appointed head of a \nFederal agency, but, interestingly enough, Mr. Speaker, the agencies \nthemselves are not members, thus denying bipartisan representation. The \nstructure clearly injects partisan politics into the regulatory \nprocess; it erodes agency independence; and it undermines \naccountability.\n  Furthermore, FSOC's budget is not subject to congressional approval, \nremoving yet another vital check and balance of its immense power over \nour economy and over our people.\n  FSOC has earned bipartisan condemnation for its lack of transparency. \nTwo-thirds of its proceedings are conducted in private. Minutes of \nthose meetings are devoid of any useful, substantive information on \nwhat was discussed.\n  Even Dennis Kelleher, the CEO of the left-leaning Better Markets, has \nsaid ``FSOC's proceedings make the Politburo look open by comparison. \nAt the few open meetings they have, they snap their fingers, and it's \nover, and it is all scripted. They treat their information as if it \nwere state secrets.''\n  FSOC typifies not only the shadow regulatory system but, also, the \nunfair Washington system that Americans have come to fear and loathe: \npowerful government administrators, secretive government meetings, \narbitrary rules, and unchecked power to punish and reward. Thus, \noversight and reform are paramount, and that is why the gentleman from \nMinnesota drafted H.R. 3340.\n  The legislation before us would bring much-needed accountability and \ntransparency to two very powerful agencies birthed by the Dodd-Frank \nAct: the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of \nFinancial Research.\n  Currently, these two agencies are funded by assessments on financial \ninstitutions, money that ultimately comes out of the pockets of their \ncustomers. These funds flow directly from financial institutions into \nthe Office of\n\n[[Page H1700]]\n\nFinancial Research coffers and are available immediately to be spent by \nboth the Office of Financial Research and the Financial Stability \nOversight Council.\n  H.R. 3340 is a very simple, commonsense bill. Instead of allowing \nunaccountable bureaucrats to set their own budgets, the bill places \nthese two agencies on the budget review viewed by the United States \nCongress, the elected representatives of we, the people. It says the \nCouncil and the Office should be funded through the normal, transparent \ncongressional appropriations process to ensure accountability and \ntransparency.\n  Is it too much to ask that these two powerful government agencies \nactually be subject to congressional oversight and budget approval? \nThis should be the rule for a growing number of Federal bureaucracies \nthat are tossed into the alphabet soup of Washington regulators who \nhave more power than ever over the financial decisions and the American \nDream of our hardworking fellow citizens.\n  Unfortunately, I have to pose this question often to my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle: How much more congressional authority do \nwe wish to outsource to regulatory agencies? Why did people run for \nCongress if they didn't want to legislate? Why did they run for \nCongress if they didn't want to engage in oversight?\n  Oversight is a fundamental congressional responsibility, and that \nincludes budget oversight--most importantly, it includes budget \noversight.\n  Mr. Speaker, sooner or later the shoe is going to be on the other \nfoot. Sooner or later the White House will be in different hands. \nSooner or later Congress will be in different hands, so this should not \nbe a partisan issue. This is about Article I of the Constitution. All \nMembers on both sides of the aisle should care passionately about this \nissue, to hold agencies accountable for their spending, because we are \nnot just writing legislation for one Congress or one administration.\n  The bare minimum level of accountability to the elected \nrepresentatives of we, the people, is to have Congress control the \npower of the purse. It is part of our quintessential and essential \noversight responsibilities, regardless of who sits in the Oval Office \nor who resides in the Speaker's chair. If we are going to do our job, \nthat means Congress must exercise its Article I responsibilities, and \nH.R. 3340 will help us do just that.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I rise in opposition to H.R. 3340, which would impede the important \nwork of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, commonly referred to \nas FSOC, and the Office of Financial Research, referred to as OFR, by \nsubjecting their funding to the congressional appropriations process.\n  This bill would also hamstring the OFR's ability to conduct impartial \nresearch by requiring the Office to solicit public comment before \nissuing any report, rule, or regulation.\n  Just in case people don't understand who FSOC is, it includes the \nFederal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office \nof the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union \nAssociation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \nthe Federal Housing Finance Agency, and independent members with \ninsurance expertise, chaired by the Treasury Secretary.\n  What you have is every representation from all of these oversight and \nregulatory agencies coming together, working together in the best \ninterests of this country, identifying risk and where that risk is and \nwhat to do about it. But the changes that are now being suggested or \nbeing made in this bill will have serious adverse effects on financial \nstability in the United States.\n  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act created FSOC to oversee and \nprevent threats to our financial markets, and the OFR was established \nto support FSOC's critical work with analytical research. Dodd-Frank \nspecifically empowered both agencies with independent budgets, the same \nway our other banking regulators, like the Federal Reserve, the Office \nof the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, operate. The FSOC and OFR are funded outside of \nappropriations, through fees on large financial institutions. They were \nmeant to be funded by the institutions they oversee and be shielded \nfrom congressional politics.\n  Republicans say they want accountability by overseeing regulators' \nbudgets, but what they really want is control, so they can eliminate \nfunding for these agencies altogether. This bill would prevent efforts \nto properly mitigate systemic risk, to the detriment of the entire \neconomy; and in this Congress, it would subject the agencies to the \nuncertainty caused by the dysfunctional, failed Republican budget \nprocess.\n  All we have to do is look at the struggles facing the Securities and \nExchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. They \ncontinue to be underfunded, despite dramatic changes in the markets. It \nis a struggle every year to secure adequate resources to supervise \ncomplex institutions to the benefit of industries, but at dramatic cost \nto our economy.\n  Understandably, the administration opposes this bill, and the \nPresident's senior advisers would recommend a veto. The administration \nspecifically says that subjecting these bodies to congressional \nappropriations would hinder their independence and would limit their \nability to monitor and address threats to financial stability.\n  In addition, this bill would interfere with OFR's work.\n  Republicans also say they want transparency and cost-benefit analysis \nwith regard to OFR's activities, but what they really want is to give \nindustry a leg up on our regulators. In addition, by requiring the OFR \nto tell the industry what it is studying, the bill would corrupt OFR's \nfindings and could have a chilling effect on its important work.\n  For similar reasons, I also will be urging my colleagues to oppose an \namendment by Mr. Royce that we will consider later on today that \nrequires detailed disclosure of the OFR's research agenda and \npractices. This is not the norm of any research organization and would \nseverely limit OFR's ability to conduct rigorous, impartial analyses.\n  Our regulators need to act with certainty, impartiality, and position \nresources to conduct robust oversight of our financial markets so that \nwe can properly detect and deter systemic risk. Unfortunately, this \nbill will be a step back in that effort, not forward, and it is further \nevidence that Republicans seek to dismantle Dodd-Frank and the \nimprovements we have made in our financial markets, one bill at a time.\n  I am going to urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Emmer), the sponsor of H.R. 3340.\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. I thank my colleague from Texas, Chairman \nHensarling.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am a believer in a transparent and accountable \ngovernment; and if a Federal institution is failing to meet these \nfundamental criteria, Congress needs to act.\n  Unfortunately, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, more \ncommonly known in Washingtonspeak as the FSOC, and the Office of \nFinancial Research, more commonly called the OFR, currently operate in \nthe shadows, outside of congressional oversight and the democratic \nprocess.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  This has led to nonsensical and heavy-handed abuse by the government \nof numerous financial companies that had absolutely nothing to do with \ncausing the 2008 financial crisis.\n  While I strongly believe that those who created the crisis must be \npunished, I can't stand by while businesses that had nothing to do with \nthe crisis are being unjustly burdened with new regulations that force \nAmerican consumers to pay higher prices for essential financial \nproducts like home mortgages and student, auto, and business loans.\n  That is why I have introduced the Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil Reform Act. Not only will the bill reduce mandatory spending by \n$1.3 billion over the next 10 years, it will\n\n[[Page H1701]]\n\nmake the FSOC and OFR accountable to the American people through their \nelected representatives.\n  Over the years, Congress has given much of its power to unelected \nbureaucrats. This legislation returns the constitutional power of the \npurse back to Congress by subjecting FSOC and the OFR to the \nappropriations process.\n  As you know, FSOC is authorized to identify risks to the financial \nstability of the United States. This authority allows the FSOC to \ndesignate nonbank institutions as systemically important financial \ninstitutions, or SIFIs, which, in turn, increases supervision and \nregulation of these firms by the Federal Government.\n  The Office of Financial Research was created to provide the research \nand analysis necessary for the FSOC to carry out this statutory \nmandate.\n  In a classic Washington fox-guarding-the-henhouse scenario, the FSOC \nand OFR are currently funded through taxes or assessments, as we prefer \nto call them, that they collect from the very SIFIs they designate.\n  These unelected bureaucrats then set their own budgets without any \noversight or approval by Congress. Is it any surprise that the FSOC \nbudget is already five times larger today than it was in 2010.\n  Senator Dodd and Representative Frank both have acknowledged that \nthey never intended that insurance companies be designated as nonbank \nSIFIs.\n  Despite the stated intent by the authors of the Wall Street Reform \nAct, FSOC has already designated three insurance companies as nonbank \nSIFIs.\n  Unfortunately, further complicating the problem, FSOC has failed to \ncreate a viable off-ramp for designated companies and has not shared \nwith Congress how they make these designations in the first place.\n  OFR has received its fair share of criticism, too. In 2013, their \nasset manager report wasn't only condemned by the industry, but the \nFederal Government Securities and Exchange Commission also expressed \nconcerns.\n  According to a Reuters report, the SEC was concerned that the people \nwho conducted the study at OFR ``lacked a fundamental understanding of \nthe fund industry itself'' and ``the Treasury's research arm failed to \ntake a number of the SEC's critical feedback into account.'' Thus, the \nSEC created its own comment period for the report.\n  Better Markets, a group that regularly advocates for increased \ngovernment regulation, actually criticized the OFR for the inexplicably \nand indefensibly poor quality of the work presented in the report.\n  Despite all of this and the fact that Congressman Frank has also \ncondemned the idea of designating asset managers, many fear the FSOC \nwill move next with an asset manager SIFI designation.\n  For these reasons, I believe it is absolutely critical that we pass \nthe Financial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act.\n  It is crucial for the FSOC and OFR to be more transparent and \naccountable to the American people. Subjecting these entities to the \ncongressional oversight process, enhancing OFR quarterly reporting \nrequirements and allowing Americans to weigh in on OFR rules and \nregulations gives Congress the tools it needs to provide the proper \noversight of FSOC and OFR.\n  Now, some may argue that Congress should just trust these \nbureaucracies. But our Constitution makes it abundantly clear that \nCongress and Congress alone has the power of the purse. And like one of \nour great leaders once reminded us: ``Trust, but verify.''\n  I want to thank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership on this issue. \nI urge all of my colleagues to support the Financial Stability \nOversight Council Reform Act.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS from California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck), a member of the Financial \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Waters.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a strange day. I almost feel like we are \nexisting in parallel universes. On the one hand, today--today--is the \ndeadline for the Rules Committee to meet to structure debate on a \nbudget resolution. But it is clear by now that there will be no floor \nconsideration of a resolution today or tomorrow or the day after or \nvery possibly ever.\n  Instead, the headlines in Capitol Hill news publication after \npublication are all about how the appropriations process has descended \ninto ``chaos.'' ``Chaos.'' So we have that on the one hand.\n  Then on the other hand we have a bill on the floor that subjects the \nFinancial Stability Oversight Council to that very same chaotic \nappropriations process.\n  On the one hand, the appropriations process is in chaos. On the other \nhand, this bill moves valuable, critical, and important economic \nregulators into that same chaotic appropriations process. Have you ever \nheard the expression: Does the left hand know what the right hand is \ndoing?\n  When the majority talks about putting agencies in the appropriations \nprocess, I hear a lot of high-minded talk and rhetoric--and \nappropriately so--about the Constitution and our Founding Fathers.\n  How would Alexander Hamilton have funded the FSOC? Frankly, I think \nit is great to ask those questions. I ask myself those questions every \nday.\n  Everyone who takes the oath of office and has the privilege to stand \nhere ought to keep grasping for the answers to those questions. And how \nappropriate this week.\n  Yesterday was Thomas Jefferson's birthday. So I was going back and \nrereading something about him, his philosophies and contributions. \nAbsolutely. We should all do that.\n  But we also have a responsibility to stay anchored in reality, to lay \ndown laws for the country and the Congress we have--the Congress we \nhave--not the country and Congress we all wish we had.\n  We live in an era of huge, complex financial markets, and we have \nlearned again and again and again that those markets fail, sometimes \nwiping out $13 trillion in net worth in this country in a month. That \nis devastating. Somebody has to be looking at the whole system and \nworking to shore up its weaknesses.\n  We live in an era of a broken appropriations process. It is chaotic. \nToday's Congress is not Madison's perfect vision.\n  Regardless of the ideals of article I of the Constitution, the \nreality today is that moving an agency into a chaotic appropriations \nprocess is to subject that agency to that very same chaos, to uncertain \nfunding, to the risk of shutdown and backroom deals.\n  So let's find a budget resolution, fix the appropriations process, \nand then maybe, just maybe, we can talk about moving agencies into the \nappropriations process.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of Georgia). The time of the \ngentleman has expired.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman \nan additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I will wrap up quickly. I thank \nthe ranking member for the time.\n  But, for now, my friends, ladies and gentlemen, FSOC is too \nimportant. The risk of financial crisis is too great. Have we not \nlearned that lesson, what happens?\n  To subject the only crisis prevention regulator to the dangers of a \nchaotic appropriations process--and that is what we have, it cannot be \ndenied--is the last thing we can do.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer) who is chairman of our Financial \nInstitutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3340, the \nFinancial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act introduced by my good \nfriend, Representative Tom Emmer, from Minnesota.\n  This is an important part. When I go back home and people hear about \na bill that has been passed or new regulations that come out and they \nhave a question about that--and particularly, I guess, under this \nadministration, we have heard a lot of people say: What are you all \ngoing to do about that new rule that the administration pulled up? You \nall have the power of the purse. Why don't you do something about that?\n  The Founders were very clear about having different branches of \ngovernment. One of the things that creates a\n\n[[Page H1702]]\n\nlot of consternation for a lot of people is that they see some of these \nagencies created in Dodd-Frank, like the Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil, FSOC, which has no accountability to anybody.\n  They operate in an unaccountable and not very transparent way, and \nthey have a huge amount of impact on markets. In fact, when they \ndetermined that MetLife was systemically important, a Federal judge the \nother day said that they reached that conclusion inappropriately, that \nthey weren't transparent, they weren't open, and that they didn't \nactually follow their own rules in determining this entity being \nsystemically important.\n  So why in the world would we not want them to be accountable to the \ntaxpayers? Because, ultimately, all of this money, Mr. Speaker, belongs \nto the American taxpayers and they are expecting this Congress to \nreview the actions of many of these agencies.\n  I am amused at my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. They \nkept talking about how important many of these entities are and what a \ngreat job they are doing, yet they are not willing to allow them to be \naccountable and to come forth and make a case why they should be \nspending the money they are spending or why they are taking the actions \nthat they are taking.\n  Talking about Mr. Jefferson, this is not the government that our \nFounders intended. In fact, they were really reluctant to form a \nFederal Government, to give a centralized government any power.\n  But they did ultimately determine that there would be some good about \nthat, primarily for the common defense. I don't think they intended to \ncreate agencies that had no accountability.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, how soon we forget. If the movie ``The Big Short'' made \nyou mad--and I hope you have seen that movie--then what the Republican \nHouse leadership is proposing today should make you furious.\n  After the financial crash in 2009, we acted. The Congress acted. We \nunderstood that we didn't have a wholistic picture of the risk across \nthe financial markets before the crash.\n  So we made a decision to create the Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil, FSOC, as they call it, to police these too-big-to-fail \ncompanies and to rein in the risks in our largest financial \ninstitutions.\n  Now some of the biggest banks want the oversight to stop so they can \nbring back their risky, anything-goes casino banking practices, the \nexact practices that tanked the housing market and destroyed retirement \nsavings for millions of Americans in the 2008 Wall Street collapse.\n  This bill, H.R. 3340, pushed by Republicans and their big bank \npatrons, will neuter this important oversight body, blindfolding our \ngovernment again and making another economic meltdown more likely.\n  I feel as though every couple of weeks the Republicans here in the \nHouse are giving us another memory test. They bring a bill up that \ntests whether we remember that just 7 years ago our financial markets \ncrashed because of risky behavior on Wall Street.\n  I remember that that happened. Democrats remember that that happened. \nThe American people remember that that happened. Apparently, the \nRepublicans in Congress do not remember that.\n  But we are going to keep passing this memory test and pushing back \nagainst these kinds of efforts to water down the Dodd-Frank reforms.\n  Let me ask this, Mr. Speaker: How many of your constituents--I know \nnone of mine--have asked to gut the Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil, to strip critical oversight of our Nation's largest financial \ninstitutions, and to make another financial crash likely? Nobody is \nasking for that.\n  Americans deserve better. They see day in and day out a Congress out \nof step with their priorities, and they want change. In fact, right now \nthousands of Americans are engaging in direct action on the Capitol \nGrounds asking for campaign finance reform and restoration of voting \nrights. Instead of voting once again to support the big banks and Wall \nStreet, we should be listening to them and taking action to restore \ntheir voice in politics.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to push back against congressional \namnesia and to oppose this bill.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett), the chairman of our Capital \nMarkets and Government Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the time. I want \nto thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer) for putting forth a \npiece of legislation that will shine the light of day on some of Dodd-\nFrank's most secretive creations.\n  We often hear our friends from the other side of the aisle and \nregulators talking about their concerns over the so-called shadow \nbanking system.\n  The FSOC and its members have used this sinister term on multiple \noccasions to strike fear in the hearts of the public in order to \nadvance, basically, their growth-strangling regulatory regime.\n  But the real threat is not from shadow banking. The real threat comes \nfrom the shadow regulatory system that basically operates outside of \nour system of checks and balances with absolutely no accountability to \nthe public and with little or no input from the Congress to conduct our \nproper oversight. You see, the FSOC and the OFR are the embodiment of \nthis shadow system.\n  For years now, the FSOC has continuously denied our committee's \nsimple request for some information about how it operates and about its \nproceedings. Really, all we know about these meetings are a few \nsentences that it drops into their press releases.\n  Meanwhile, even though the OFR embarrassed itself with its asset \nmanager report that was issued back in 2013, that office basically \nstill operates largely outside of the public eye.\n  So it is time to shine the light of day on both of these bodies, Mr. \nSpeaker, particularly in light of the recent invalidation of MetLife's \ntoo-big-to-fail designation by FSOC.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  The underlying legislation would restore Congress' Article I \nauthority by putting Congress back in charge of funding both FSOC and \nOFR, by requiring OFR to submit regular reports to Congress that the \nAmerican public can see.\n  It is time to stop letting bureaucrats in this town run wild, let's \nput Congress back in charge, and let's put back the checks and balances \nfor these troubling agencies.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings), the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and \nI thank her for her leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 3340, a bill that would cause \nsevere damage to the integrity of the Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil and the Office of Financial Research. It is through these \nentities that the Dodd-Frank Act identifies risks in our financial \nsystems and guards against another financial crisis.\n  FSOC and OFR have been intentionally placed outside political \npressure. They make our financial system safer and protect the American \npeople from a future financial crisis. However, the bill we are \ndebating today would cripple FSOC and OFR by subjecting them to \nunnecessary political influence, putting our financial system at risk.\n  My colleagues across the aisle would have us believe that FSOC and \nOFR have free rein to set and approve their own budgets, and are, \ntherefore, agencies that have run amok. FSOC's budget is approved by a \nmajority vote of its members. FSOC does not have unchecked budget \nauthority. FSOC's budget is similar to, and modeled after, the FDIC's \nbudget mode.\n  The FDIC also sets its own budget. It has time and time again acted \nto protect the American people from financial collapse while setting a \nreasonable and prudent budget.\n  No one is calling on Congress to rein in the FDIC. The bill is \nnothing more\n\n[[Page H1703]]\n\nthan an attempt by the majority to undo the progress made by Dodd-Frank \nand to eliminate the ability of FSOC to act on behalf of the American \npeople by cutting its funding.\n  As I listened to my colleague from Maryland a few minutes ago talk \nabout the folks who are right outside this Capitol, complaining about \nCitizens United, people want to know that they have power. These people \nare very upset. They want to know that their democracy is not being \ntaken away from them.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill and against all bills \nthat seek to roll back our progress in making the financial system \nsafer.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining \non each side, please?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 14\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentlewoman from California has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. King).\n  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3340, the \nFinancial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do not support the creation of FSOC and OFR and do not \nthink that 10 unelected agency heads should be able to have such \ninfluence over the U.S. financial system. But H.R. 3340 doesn't even \ncurtail any of FSOC's or OFR's powers. It simply provides greater \naccountability by making their budget subject to the annual \nCongressional appropriations process.\n  Strengthening congressional oversight would force FSOC and OFR to \naddress questions and concerns from both sides of the aisle. Requiring \nOFR to report quarterly to Congress and provide the standard public \nnotice and comment period before issuing any report or regulation is \njust common sense. In fact, it would ultimately serve the public \ninterest to provide transparency and diverse perspectives on issues \naffecting the financial services industry.\n  The FSOC has the authority to declare large companies as \n``systematically important financial institutions'' and then subject \nthem to a new, costly regulatory regime that is designed for banks. I \nhave serious concerns about their power, but this bill wouldn't even \nchange that. It would only provide desperately needed transparency and \naccountability to the SIFI designation process, which was recently \ndescribed by a Federal judge as ``fatally flawed'' and ``arbitrary and \ncapricious.''\n  2008 demonstrated that we need effective regulation of our financial \nsystem, but regulators need to be held accountable for their decisions, \nespecially given the impact they have on the competitiveness of U.S. \ncompanies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Emmer for his legislation.\n  I strongly urge the adoption and passage of this legislation.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  My friends on the opposite side of the aisle keep talking about \naccountability and what Congress' responsibility is and what the \nConstitution says we should do. But I find it very interesting, while \nthey are claiming that OFR and FSOC should be given more oversight, \nthey don't seem to really want to exercise the responsibility to do \nthat.\n  Republicans claim that only when OFR and FSOC are subject to the \nannual appropriations process, will these two entities be accountable \nto Congress.\n  However, how many times has the Financial Services Committee \nrequested the director of the Office of Financial Research to testify?\n  Only one time.\n  Section 153 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that the OFR director \ntestify before our committee annually, and yet, OFR Director Berner has \nonly been invited to testify once in the last 4 years--the only time \nbeing in March of 2013. That means for more than 3 years, our \ncommittee, under Republican leadership, has shirked its duties to \noversee the OFR. Any Member who has met Director Berner can attest that \nhe has always stated his eagerness to update Congress on what OFR is \ndoing.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is not some valiant attempt to hold FSOC and \nOFR accountable, no. This bill is yet another attack on a Dodd-Frank \nfinancial reform by Republicans, who never supported financial reform \nin the very first place.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. \nWasserman Schultz).\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to \nH.R. 3340, the so-called Financial Stability Oversight Council Reform \nAct.\n  This bill represents another example of death by a thousand cuts from \nour friends on the other side of the aisle. It is another Republican \nattack on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection \nAct.\n  After the catastrophe of the financial crisis and the near collapse \nof our banking system, Republicans are, once again, jeopardizing the \nstability of our financial system.\n  How many times will Republicans waste taxpayer dollars with these \npartisan and dangerous attacks on the independence of our financial \nregulators?\n  Dodd-Frank created the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the \nOffice of Financial Research to bring independent regulators together \nto monitor risk across our banking system and address threats to the \nAmerican economy. Prior to the creation of FSOC, no single entity was \naccountable for monitoring our Nation's financial stability--none. It \nwas a mish-mash, disparate mess. Dodd-Frank filled that void.\n  Similarly, OFR works to support consumers by conducting critical \nresearch on our financial system and whether our regulatory systems \nare, in fact, working.\n  Of course, if we don't invite the person who is the head of the \nOffice to actually testify in front of the Financial Services \nCommittee, how would we know?\n  Dodd-Frank ensured that important regulators like FSOC and OFR have \nthe independence they need to protect consumers outside of the \npolitical turmoil of Congress. My House Democratic colleagues are \nserious about reining in our Nation's largest financial institutions, \nwhile my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are playing \npolitical games at the expense of American consumers.\n  I refuse to stand idly by and allow Dodd-Frank to be gutted and \nweakened. If this terrible bill got to his desk, President Obama \nwouldn't sign it. He would never allow it to become law. Nevertheless, \ncongressional Republicans continue to waste taxpayers' time and money \nwith this legislation that would peel back Dodd-Frank and hurt American \nconsumers.\n  House Republicans need to instead focus on our Nation's most pressing \nproblems: public health crises like the Zika virus, which has ravaged \nmy home State of Florida; the ongoing debt situation in Puerto Rico; \nand keeping Speaker Ryan's promises to the American people that this \nbody would pass a budget.\n  Our Nation's working families are keeping their fiscal houses in \norder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman \nfrom Florida an additional 1 minute.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. We need to make sure that we hold Speaker \nRyan's feet to the fire and make sure that he keeps his promise to the \nAmerican people that this body will pass a budget, which we have yet to \ndo.\n  Our Nation's working families are working hard to keep their fiscal \nhouse in order. It is long past time for the House Republicans to do \nthe same, while also making sure that we protect American consumers.\n  That, ladies and gentlemen, is how we got into the worst economic \ncrisis and nearly crashed the banking system in the first place. If we \nleave policymaking to the Republicans who are in the majority here, \nthey would take us back to a time when we had a Wild West of regulation \nthat left consumers twisting in the wind and banks to be able to make \nany decision they wanted and run over consumers all across America. We \nsaw how well that worked out in 2008.\n  Now we have come through the worst economic crisis we have ever had \nsince the Great Depression--73 straight months of job growth in the \nprivate sector. We need to continue that progress, not go backward.\n\n[[Page H1704]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaine (Mr. Poliquin).\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing this \nvery important issue to the House floor.\n  I am pleased to stand up in support of H.R. 3340, the Financial \nStability Oversight Council Reform Act.\n  I want to congratulate Congressman Tom Emmer of Minnesota for his \ntireless work on this bill to come up with a commonsense piece of \nregulation that helps create jobs in this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to set the Record straight. There are some folks \nin this Chamber who continue to blame the economic problems we have had \nover these past years specifically on the financial services industry. \nWell, let's be honest here. There were D.C. regulators here in this \ntown who put tremendous pressure on the banks to lend money at zero \npercent down and zero percent interest to folks who they knew could not \nafford these loans. When they were unable to repay these loans, the \nreal estate market collapsed and brought the economy with it.\n  Mr. Speaker, every business in America, every industry, should be \nfairly and predictably regulated. However, when the regulations are so \nintense and so complicated and so smothering that it kills jobs, then \nit is our responsibility to make sure that we give our small businesses \nin this country relief.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have been here for a little over a year and I realize \nthere is a fourth branch of government. Now, we all know what the \nConstitution says. It is that Congress, the legislative branch, creates \nthe laws. The administrative branch, the White House, implements the \nlaws that we create. If there is a question, then we get the referee \ninvolved, the courts. However, there is a fourth branch of government \nthat is unconstitutional. It is called the professional regulator.\n  Now, what has happened over the course of these past years is that \nthe administrative branch wants to send directions to their regulators \nto put more and more pressure on our business community that creates \njobs and gives our families opportunities.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Maine an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. One of those agencies is the Financial Stability \nOversight Council. Mr. Speaker, this organization has tremendous power \non our economy to regulate financial institutions that pose no risk to \nthe economy, like credit unions in northern Maine and small community \nbanks in northern Maine that did not cause the problems that we have \nhad over these past years.\n  However, all I am asking and all this bill does is make sure that the \nFinancial Stability Oversight Council's operations are funded by the \npeople's representatives. Mr. Speaker, we in Congress have the \nopportunity to fund that operation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Maine an \nadditional 10 seconds.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. We only want to make sure that there is enough time for \npublic comment. I ask everybody to support this bill. It is a great \nbill, and it keeps money flowing through the economy for our small \nbusinesses and job creators.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Tipton).\n  Mr. TIPTON. I thank the chairman.\n  I thank my colleague from Minnesota, Representative Emmer, for \noffering this piece of legislation that is under consideration today.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act \nplaces the FSOC and the Office of Financial Research under the regular \nappropriations process and will require the Office of Financial \nResearch to submit activity reports to Congress. Bringing FSOC under \nthe appropriations process ensures greater accountability for a council \nthat has continuously failed to fully disclose its SIFI designation \nmethodology and that has yet to provide concrete guidelines for \ndesignated entities to lose their SIFI status.\n  Most importantly, this legislation will bring much-needed \ntransparency to the Council. FSOC is intended to be a forum for \ndiscussion and analysis of financial regulator issues, but, \nunfortunately, the Council has continually failed to address the \nconsolidation and failure of our Main Street banks. On its own, a \nsingle community bank failure will not pose a systemic risk to the \nfinancial system. However, losing these small banks at an accelerating \npace is a clear warning signal that the financial system is not \nhealthy, and losing community banks as a whole certainly qualifies as \nsystemically risky.\n  Instead of closed-door deliberations, the Council, which is made up \nof financial regulators who have been acknowledging this exact problem, \nshould be working to address this pressing issue in a transparent \nmanner before it is too late. This legislation is a logical next step \nin reforming the Financial Stability Oversight Council to ensure that \nit actually addresses threats to our financial system.\n  I am happy to lend my support to this bill, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this commonsense measure.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for his efforts on this \nlegislation.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is \nremaining on both sides, please.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 8\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining, and the gentlewoman from California has 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Messer).\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I begin my remarks with just a clarification \nof the argument of my friends on the other side of the aisle. Their \nargument is essentially this: that Federal regulators--banking \nregulators--cannot do their jobs if their funding is somehow held \naccountable to the American people. This argument ignores some \nimportant facts.\n  While Dodd-Frank may well have been intended to protect consumers and \nend Big Government bailouts, FSOC's authority to arbitrarily designate \nnonbank financial institutions as systemically important undermines the \noriginal intent of the law. In fact, just last month, a U.S. court \nrescinded MetLife's SIFI designation. The opinion called FSOC's \ndetermination process ``fatally flawed,'' and it called the insurer's \ndesignation ``capricious and arbitrary.'' Again, those are not my \nwords, those are a Federal judge's words. In effect, the judge \nconfirmed what House Republicans have been saying for years--that the \nFSOC is out of control and requires additional congressional oversight.\n  That is why I support this commonsense and, frankly, modest \nlegislation, which subjects FSOC and the Office of Financial Research \nto the annual appropriations process and common practice reporting \nrequirements.\n  We all want to hold financial providers accountable to their \ncustomers. It is also Congress' responsibility to hold our government \naccountable to the American people. This bill helps make that happen, \nand we should all be able to agree to that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I would like to take a moment and talk about why we created the FSOC \nand the OFR in the very first place since my Republican colleagues seem \nto think that more regulatory cooperation and the overseeing of our \nfinancial system is such a bad thing.\n  Simply put, we created FSOC to look across regulatory silos and \ndetect, prevent, and mitigate systemic risk in the U.S. financial \nsystem so that we would never again be caught off guard when major \nfinancial firms, like AIG, fail.\n  Recall that AIG created an entire business model that was designed to \navoid regulation, which sent its major operations and risky credit \ndefault swaps to the London-based unit, AIG Financial Products, which, \nin turn, was guaranteed by the U.S. parent company. What is more, AIG \nwas allowed to select as a regulator the Office of Thrift Supervision, \nOTS.\n  According to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which is the \nFCIC,\n\n[[Page H1705]]\n\nthe OTS failed to effectively exercise its authority over AIG and its \naffiliates. It lacked the capability to supervise an institution of the \nsize and complexity of AIG's. It did not recognize the risk inherent in \nAIG's sales of credit default swaps, and it did not understand its \nresponsibility to oversee the entire company, including AIG Financial \nProducts.\n  As we all know, this regulatory arbitrage ultimately spelled failure \nfor AIG because its enormous sales of credit default swaps were made \nwithout putting up initial collateral, setting aside capital reserves, \nor hedging its exposure--a profound failure in corporate governance, \nparticularly in its risk management practices.\n  In having just witnessed the takeover of Merrill Lynch by Bank of \nAmerica and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers a mere 24 hours before, \nthe U.S. Government stepped in and committed more than $180 billion to \nensure that AIG's collapse didn't bring down the rest of the financial \nsystem to which it was so interconnected. From there, the Bush \nadministration requested the authority to bail out the big banks.\n  When the dust began to settle, Democrats in Congress worked to come \nup with a solution to eliminate this regulatory arbitrage and encourage \nour financial regulators to communicate with one another. Of course, \nthe commonsense solution was to create a council on which each of our \nfinancial regulators had a voice and could meet to consider gaps \nbetween the agencies' interconnectedness within the financial sector. \nThis council would also hold each regulator accountable to how the \nregulators as a whole were mitigating systemic risk to our economy.\n  To help inform and support the council, we created the Office of \nFinancial Research to research and report on potential systemic risk to \nour economy. Dodd-Frank ensured that the council of the OFR and that \nCongress would all be focused on emerging threats to our economy and \nwould never be caught unawares by another AIG. H.R. 3340, however, \nundermines these reforms, and it should be opposed.\n\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, many of the Members on the opposite side of \nthe aisle are talking about our oversight responsibility, but they \ndon't even exercise oversight responsibility or get the regulators in \nand have a real discussion with them about how it all works. AIG was \ncomplicated. None of the Members of Congress really understood how it \noperated, how it was formed, how it was set up, and what it was doing. \nWe have learned our lesson from AIG, and I hope that the Members of \nthis Congress will not forget it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Trott).\n  Mr. TROTT. I thank the chairman for the opportunity to speak in \nsupport of the Financial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation is just one more step in our continued \neffort to rein in out-of-control regulatory bodies that are products of \nthe Dodd-Frank Act. FSOC and the Office of Financial Research, which \nare both products of Dodd-Frank, have the power to obtain sensitive \ninformation and are tasked with the mission of monitoring the financial \nstability of the United States.\n  With such a broad mandate and vast authority, it is appalling that \nthese bodies are not subject to the congressional appropriations \nprocess and must satisfy only minimal reporting requirements. OFR \nstates that its job is to shine light in the dark corners of the \nfinancial system, but it operates in the dark corners, itself, as it \nspends funds that have been obtained from fees on an ever-expanding \nworkforce and budget, all outside of the appropriations process and all \noutside of the eyes of our citizens.\n  The people of this great Nation deserve a transparent Federal \nGovernment that answers to them. Some here today have suggested that, \nin this bill, we want to put a blindfold on--stop oversight and ignore \na future financial crisis. We have a blindfold on now. We are all in \nthe dark. We don't want to stop oversight. We just want to exercise our \nresponsibilities under Article I of the Constitution.\n  Some here today have suggested that Congress is no longer capable of \nexercising its Article I powers and that, therefore, FSOC must be \nindependent of the appropriations process. To them, I ask: Why should \nWashington bureaucrats have more power over the financial decisions of \nthe American people than their elected Representatives?\n  This legislation is a commonsense solution, and I urge its passage.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Under Democratic leadership, our country has made tremendous strides \nin creating jobs, in growing the economy, and in stabilizing the \nhousing market since the depths of the 2008 recession. This was despite \nsignificant headwinds from both overseas crises and Republican \nintransigence. Instrumental to our achievements is the Dodd-Frank Wall \nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which has bolstered our \nNation's financial stability and has brought accountability to the \nentire system.\n  Among its many accomplishments, such as protecting consumers from \npredatory practices, Dodd-Frank sought to address the excessive risk \ntaking by the largest and most complex financial institutions by \ncreating the Financial Stability Oversight Council--that is FSOC--and \nthe Office of Financial Research, OFR. These two agencies were charged \nwith looking at the big picture and identifying cracks in the system \nthat could cause a breakdown in our economy. They oversee all aspects \nof the financial system and our largest institutions that can cause \nsystemic risk.\n  FSOC works to identify and to address systemic risk posed by large, \ncomplex companies and activities before they threaten the stability of \nthe economy. It provides for the cooperation and information sharing \nbetween agencies in order to research and correct threats before they \nbecome crises. OFR helps to provide the necessary tools to FSOC by \ncollecting and analyzing data on the health of our financial markets \nand by conducting research on potential sources of financial \ninstability. It flags emerging threats and shares that information with \nother regulators so that they can intervene before a crisis occurs.\n  Together, these two agencies have addressed the devastating, \nwidespread failures in supervision and regulation that brought our \neconomy to its knees in 2008. They fill the regulatory gaps to make \nsure that no institution, however powerful, can circumvent our rules \nand regulations.\n  This crucial work is supported by a majority of Americans--\nRepublicans and Democrats--who favor Dodd-Frank and the reforms it has \nimplemented. Yet, instead of recognizing the importance of these \ninstitutions and the interests of the American public, House \nRepublicans are undermining our regulators' efforts to the benefit of \nthe industries that are lining their own pockets. I am troubled by the \namnesia that plagues my colleagues about the causes of the 2008 \nfinancial crisis and why Wall Street reform was so critical.\n  We created FSOC and OFR because our fractured regulatory system \nallowed firms to skirt the rules of the road. This behavior left \nmillions homeless and unemployed, and it plunged us into the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression. What is worse is that hundreds of \ncommunities across the country are still struggling to recover.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  By cutting off FSOC and OFR's independent funding streams, H.R. 3340 \nwill subject the agencies to the volatility of the congressional \nappropriations process and the same funding uncertainty faced by the \nSEC and the FCFTC.\n  Make no mistake. The bill before us today is part of a concerted \neffort by House Republicans to impede the progress of financial reform.\n  Yesterday Republicans passed a bill in committee to repeal the only \nmechanism to unwind a megabank without destabilizing the economy as \nwell as a bill to eliminate funding for the bureau tasked with \nprotecting consumers from predatory loans.\n  Earlier today and for much of this month, committee Republicans will \ndepose public servants at the CFPB, Treasury, and FSOC, despite \nagencies providing thousands of pages of documents at the Republicans' \nrequest. Soon I expect my chairman to bring up bills repealing the rest \nof our reform.\n\n[[Page H1706]]\n\n  Democrats in the House are all too familiar with these attacks. Are \nwe not? Republicans have proposed $6 trillion in cuts to initiatives \nlike Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps. They have prevented us from \ndebating America's sacred right to vote. Most Republicans voted against \nupholding the full faith and credit of our Nation's debt. I could go on \nand on and on.\n  So, to my colleagues, we have pulled the cover off of them, and we \nare pointing out to you in no uncertain terms how they are singularly \nfocused on killing Dodd-Frank reforms.\n  They are not exercising their oversight responsibility. They are \ndetermined that they are going to have their way, and they have it \nunder the banner of overregulation.\n  Well, that old argument is tired, ladies and gentlemen. \nOverregulation every time they want to do something for the big banks, \net cetera.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this coordinated attack and vote \n``no'' on this harmful bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  It has been a fascinating debate on a very, very simple bill. H.R. \n3340 from the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer) does one very simple \nthing.\n  It says two Federal agencies--the Office of Financial Research and \nthe Financial Stability Oversight Council--have to go through the \nbudgeted appropriations process. It says nothing more. It says nothing \nless.\n  Right now these agencies write their own budget. They can write a \nbudget for $100 million. They can write a budget for $500 million. They \ncan write a budget for $10 billion.\n  Legally, they can write a budget for trillions of dollars. They can \ntake money away from we, the people, and there is absolutely nothing \nCongress can do.\n  Mr. Speaker, every Member of Congress who has come here has raised \ntheir hand and, in their oath of office, they solemnly swear to support \nand defend the Constitution of the United States. I wonder how many \nMembers reflect upon that solemn oath.\n  Because Article I, section 9, clause 7, of the Constitution says: \n``No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of \nAppropriations made by Law . . .''\n  Yet, theoretically, what has happened here is this power of the \npurse, a critical power of Article I of the Constitution, has been \noutsourced to Article II.\n  It is fascinating, Mr. Speaker. I am not sure there is a more solemn \nresponsibility of the Federal Government than to provide for the common \ndefense.\n  Yet, we don't allow the Pentagon to write their own budget. It has to \ngo through the elected representatives of we, the people.\n  The Justice Department: We don't allow them to write their own \nbudget. It has to go through the elected representatives of we, the \npeople.\n  Even the Office of the President: The President is not allowed to \nwrite his own budget. It has to go through the appropriations process \nof the elected representatives of we, the people.\n  So we have two incredibly important and powerful Federal agencies \nthat get to write their own budget. They get to take money away from \nhardworking Americans to essentially do what they please. This is not \nArticle I of the Constitution.\n  Madison, in Federalist 47--I may not have the quote down perfectly--\nessentially said that the common notion of legislative, executive, and \njudicial power in one hand is the absolute definition of tyranny.\n  So we have in a Federal agency the FSOC, part of this shadow \nregulatory system that the American people have come to loathe, that \nhas the ability to designate financial firms too big to fail and then \nallow them to be bailed out with taxpayer funds, to be functionally \nmicromanaged by Federal agencies, essentially, a Federal takeover of \nthe banking system so there can be a political allocation of credit, \nwhich is what led to the economic crisis in the first place: \npoliticizing credit, mandating, forcing, suggesting, cajoling financial \ninstitutions to loan money to people to buy homes they couldn't afford \nto keep. Think Fannie. Think Freddie.\n  So we believe on this side of the aisle, regardless of which party is \nin power in Congress, regardless of which party is in power in the \nWhite House, that Federal agencies ought to be funded through Article I \nof the Constitution and be accountable to we, the people. It is that \nsimple.\n  So the ranking member says: Well, we can't hold them to the \nvolatility and uncertainty of this congressional appropriations \nprocess. Funny, the Pentagon is. Funny, the President is. Funny, the \nFBI is.\n  You know, if you don't like democracy, maybe it is the worst form of \ngovernment, save every other form of government, but it is our form of \ngovernment. And our Constitution is the bedrock of our freedom and our \nprosperity, and these out-of-control agencies ought to be accountable \nand they ought to be transparent to we, the people.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill of the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Emmer), H.R. 3340, and bring accountability and \ntransparency and fidelity to the Constitution back to this institution.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Womack). All time for debate on the bill \nhas expired.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Royce\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add at the end the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. ADDITIONAL DUTIES OF THE OFFICE OF FINANCIAL \n                   RESEARCH.\n\n       Section 153 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \n     Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 5343), as amended by \n     section 3, is further amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(h) Additional Duties.--\n       ``(1) Annual work plan.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Director shall, after a period of 60 \n     days for public notice and comment, annually publish a \n     detailed work plan concerning the priorities of the Office \n     for the upcoming fiscal year.\n       ``(B) Requirements.--The work plan shall include the \n     following:\n       ``(i) A unique alphanumeric identifier and detailed \n     description of any report, study, working paper, grant, \n     guidance, data collection, or request for information that is \n     expected to be in progress during, or scheduled to begin in, \n     the upcoming fiscal year.\n       ``(ii) For each item listed under clause (i), a target date \n     for any significant actions related to such item, including \n     the target date--\n\n       ``(I) for the release of a report, study, or working paper;\n       ``(II) for, and topics of, a meeting of a working paper \n     group and each solicitation of applications for grants; and\n       ``(III) for the issuance of guidance, data collections, or \n     requests for information.\n\n       ``(iii) A list of all technical and professional advisory \n     committees that is expected to be convened in the upcoming \n     fiscal year pursuant to section 152(h).\n       ``(iv) The name and professional affiliations of each \n     individual who served during the previous fiscal year as an \n     academic or professional fellow pursuant to section 152(i).\n       ``(v) A detailed description of the progress made by \n     primary financial regulatory agencies in adopting a unique \n     alphanumeric system to identify legally distinct entities \n     that engage in financial transactions (commonly known as a \n     `Legal Entity Identifier'), including a list of regulations \n     requiring the use of such a system and actions taken to \n     ensure the adoption of such a system by primary financial \n     regulatory agencies.\n       ``(2) Public reports.--\n       ``(A) Consultation.--In preparing any public report with \n     respect to a specified entity, class of entities, or \n     financial product or service, the Director shall consult with \n     any Federal department or agency with expertise in regulating \n     the entity, class of entities, or financial product or \n     service.\n       ``(B) Report requirements.--A public report described in \n     subparagraph (A) shall include--\n       ``(i) an explanation of any changes made as a result of a \n     consultation under this subparagraph and, with respect to any \n     changes suggested in such consultation that were not made, \n     the reasons that the Director did not incorporate such \n     changes; and\n       ``(ii) information on the date, time, and nature of such \n     consultation.\n       ``(C) Notice and comment.--Before issuing any public report \n     described in subparagraph (A), the Director shall provide a \n     period of 90 days for public notice and comment on the \n     report.\n       ``(3) Cybersecurity plan.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Office shall develop and implement a \n     cybersecurity plan that uses appropriate safeguards that are \n     adequate to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the \n     data in the possession of the Office.\n\n[[Page H1707]]\n\n       ``(B) GAO review.--The Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall annually audit the cybersecurity plan and its \n     implementation described in subparagraph (A).''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 671, the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this amendment to \nthe Financial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act, which mirrors \nbipartisan legislation I have authored, the Office of Financial \nResearch Accountability Act.\n  A more open, collaborative, and cyber-secure Office of Financial \nResearch would be better positioned to achieve its stated mission of \npromoting financial stability. So, basically, this amendment gets the \nOffice of Financial Research on track with a few simple, reasonable \nreforms. There are three of them.\n  First, it requires the OFR to submit an annual work plan that details \nthe Office's upcoming work while making it available for public notice \nand comment.\n  Second, it requires the Office to coordinate with financial \nregulators and agencies that have subject matter experience as it \nprepares public reports.\n  Third, it also tasks the Office, which handles immense amounts of \nsensitive financial data, with formulating a cybersecurity plan.\n  So this amendment strengthens the Office of Financial Research's \nability to ensure a transparent, efficient, and stable financial system \nfor the American people, the core objective of the Office.\n  I thank Mr. Emmer of Minnesota for his work on this important issue. \nI urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to support both my \namendment and the underlying legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I claim time in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Royce amendment, which the \nFinancial Services Committee considered last November as H.R. 3738. The \namendment is yet further evidence of the Republican plan to kill Dodd-\nFrank with a thousand cuts.\n  If adopted, the Office of Financial Research would have to disclose \nits research agenda at the beginning of each year, potentially alarming \nmarkets, just as the underlying bill, the Royce amendment, would mean \nthat any study of the OFR would become corrupted.\n  Our market actors would see that the OFR, an office that makes \nrecommendations to the Financial Stability Oversight Council about \nsystemic risks, was concerned about a particular topic.\n  In response, those actors would begin to change their behavior even \nif the OFR might later conclude that there was never any risks to our \neconomy.\n  In addition, this amendment would require OFR to go into great detail \nwhen disclosing what it plans to study, something that is not done by \nany other research organization.\n  Finally, I am troubled by the amendment's provisions requiring the \nOFR to disclose its consultations. Internal consultations and \ndeliberations are explicitly excluded by the Freedom of Information Act \nand for good reason. Individuals would not likely participate in OFR \nstudies if their offline, candid remarks were made part of the public \nrecord.\n  Will this prevent industry lobbyists and trade associations from \ncommenting? Of course not. They will continue earning their keep, and \nthe amendment gives them even more opportunities.\n  Why would independent researchers, academics, and scientists want to \nweigh in on a public fight? This amendment, the underlying bill, and \nmany of the other Republican initiatives we have seen this year all \nshare the same goal. They are aimed at undoing all of the progress the \nObama administration and Democrats have made in the last 8 years.\n  How many times are we going to find ways to kill financial reform? \nHow many times are we going to vote to kill job-creating agencies, like \nthe Export-Import Bank? How many times are we going to vote to get rid \nof ObamaCare and the health insurance of millions of Americans?\n  There is important work to be done, passing a budget, for one, ending \nhomelessness in America, funding the administration's requests to help \ncombat the Zika virus, helping Puerto Rico to restructure their \ncrippling debt so that the island can grow and prosper and create jobs.\n  When are Republicans going to hear the cries of everyday Americans?\n  I encourage Members to support their constituents by continuing to \nfight for these issues and oppose Republican attempts like this to \nsimply roll back Democrat reform.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the Royce amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Hill).\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by my good friend from California.\n  The Office of Financial Research, the OFR, is an important entity, \nbut its work so far has been very, very disappointing.\n  It is so disappointing that a landmark study by OFR on asset \nmanagement has been publicly criticized by a member of FSOC, the SEC, \nwho took the unusual step of opening its own comment period on the \nreport.\n  We must make sure that OFR's research is done in the right way with a \nstrategic plan and that OFR consults with experts and gives proper \npublic notice and involvement.\n  We don't want the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the FSOC, \none of the most critical and sensitive creations in Dodd-Frank, relying \non offhand work criticized publicly by institutions across this city \nand country.\n  Further, their data collection requirements and responsibilities \nbring concern to all of our citizens. As we have seen with the IRS, the \nOPM, the CFPB, and now the OFR, rising concern over the importance of \ncybersecurity and data protection are noted in this act and are an \nimportant part of Mr. Royce's amendment.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Many of our Federal agencies are the root cause of cyber breach and \nloss of privacy, and we don't want to see that extended here.\n  I support the amendment and the bill, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Emmer).\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and \ncolleague from California, chairman of the Committee on Foreign \nAffairs, Congressman Ed Royce, for offering his amendment to the FSOC \nReform Act.\n  As we have seen time and time again, our government needs to improve \nsecurity procedures in order to protect the privacy of the American \npeople and integrity for business. The burden, Mr. Speaker, is on the \nFederal Government to provide a plan and to be transparent about what \nit does with the information it collects.\n  This amendment accomplishes both of these goals at the Office of \nFinancial Research. By mandating OFR to submit an annual work plan and \nallow for public notice and comment, the American people will have a \ngreater voice in shaping the objectives of OFR. Perhaps most \nimportantly, requiring Federal regulators to collaborate on data \nsecurity will make the personal and financial information of all \nAmericans more secure.\n  Again, I want to thank Chairman Royce for offering this amendment. I \nurge all my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, let's be clear about what this proposal does \nand does not do. Nothing in this amendment says that the Office of \nFinancial Research must amend their work product because of public \ncomments provided to them. The amendment here simply ensures that the \npublic gets a chance to comment.\n  I have asked eight--eight--FSOC members about their potential \nopposition to this idea. Not a single one has raised an objection to \nthis. As to any\n\n[[Page H1708]]\n\nrhetoric in opposition to this amendment, a lot of it has centered on \nthe potential of opening up the Office of Financial Research to \ninappropriate influence. Nothing could be further from reality.\n  Inappropriate influence is what happens when you labor long with \nlittle or no transparency, not when you provides more sunlight. What \nthis amendment does is provides that transparency. It provides that \nsunlight by opening that up.\n  There has been considerable, warranted criticism from those across \nthe ideological spectrum about the quality of the OFR's research. We \nare taking a step today to improve the Office of Financial Research's \nresearch practices, something integral to FSOC reform as the Council \nmakes designation decisions founded on the Office's work.\n  Regulators making decisions on financial stability should do so with \ntheir eyes wide open. A more transparent, collaborative, and cyber \nsecure Office of Financial Research accomplishes that end. For that \nreason, I urge Members from both sides of the aisle to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question \nis ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce).\n  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Royce).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Moore moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3340 to the \n     Committee on Financial Services with instructions to report \n     the same back to the House forthwith with the following \n     amendment:\n       Add at the end the following:\n       Sec. __  Upon enactment of this Act it shall be in order to \n     consider in the House of Representatives the concurrent \n     resolution (H. Con. Res. 125) establishing the congressional \n     budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2017 \n     and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal \n     years 2018 through 2026. All points of order against \n     consideration of the concurrent resolution are waived. The \n     concurrent resolution shall be considered as read. All points \n     of order against provisions in the concurrent resolution are \n     waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on the concurrent resolution and on any amendment thereto to \n     adoption without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of \n     debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and \n     ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget; and \n     (2) one motion to recommit.\n\n  Ms. MOORE (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Clerk dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Wisconsin?\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I object.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk continued to read.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nWisconsin (Ms. Moore) is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, today is April 14, and, by law, Congress must \nenact a budget resolution by tomorrow, April 15. I repeat, Mr. Speaker: \nby law, Congress must enact a budget resolution by April 15. That is \ntomorrow.\n  After months and months and months of the majority promising regular \norder, the Republican House leadership has failed to meet this most \nbasic measure of responsibility of bringing a budget to the floor. So \ntoday, Mr. Speaker, my motion to recommit will help out my Republican \ncolleagues with their responsibilities to this body.\n  In my motion to recommit, I am offering up the Republican budget that \nwas passed out of committee last month to allow my colleagues the \nability to vote on their own budget and also to allow us to offer our \nalternatives.\n  To refresh your memory, Mr. Speaker, the GOP budget resolution ends \nthe Medicare guarantee, makes $6.5 trillion in drastic cuts, increases \npoverty, and erodes the economic security of all Americans.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, as awful as Democrats think that this budget is, \nthe Tea Party faction of the House GOP is demanding that we make even \nmore draconian cuts and even deeper cuts, and they ought to have the \nright, as well, to offer their alternative on the floor.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. I don't support this Republican budget, \nbut I am offering this motion to recommit because, again, we cannot \noffer our alternative unless this budget is processed on this floor.\n  The Republicans are abandoning their promise to restore regular order \nbecause they can't agree on a worse product, but hardworking families \ndeserve a Congress that invests in their future, protects their safety, \nand creates a level playing field for them and their children to \nsucceed.\n  You know what they always say, Mr. Speaker: the majority gets its \nway, and the minority gets its say. Let's get to the ``have its say'' \npart.\n  We are going to continue as Democrats to press for a budget that \ncreates jobs, opportunities, and raises paychecks for the American \npeople while reducing the deficit in a balanced and responsible way, \nMr. Speaker.\n  But, again, since the Republicans can't seem to get their act \ntogether by bringing their budget to the floor, my motion to recommit \nwould bring that product to the floor. So that is why I am offering \nthis motion to recommit today, and I would urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I insist on my point of order because \nthe instruction contains matter in the jurisdiction of a committee to \nwhich the bill was not referred, thus violating clause 7 of rule XVI, \nwhich requires an amendment to be germane to the measure being amended. \nCommittee jurisdiction is a central test of germaneness, and I am \nafraid I must insist on my point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Are there other Members who wish to be heard \non the point of order?\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I would just mention that I think it is \ngermane because tomorrow is April 15.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. There being no other Member wishing to be \nheard on the point of order, the Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The gentleman from Texas makes a point of order that the instructions \nproposed in the motion to recommit offered by the gentlewoman from \nWisconsin are not germane.\n  Clause 7 of rule XVI--the germaneness rule--provides that no \nproposition on a subject different from that under consideration shall \nbe admitted under color of amendment.\n  One of the central tenets of the germaneness rule is that an \namendment may not introduce matter within the jurisdiction of a \ncommittee not represented in the pending measure.\n  The bill, H.R. 3340, as amended, addresses funding and other matters \nrelating to the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of \nFinancial Research, which are matters within the jurisdiction of the \nCommittee on Financial Services.\n  The instructions in the motion to recommit propose an amendment \nconsisting of a special order of business of the House, which is a \nmatter within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Rules.\n  As the Chair ruled in similar proceedings on October 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, \n9, 10, 11, and 14, 2013, the instructions in the motion to recommit are \nnot germane because they are not within the jurisdiction of the \nCommittee on Financial Services.\n  Accordingly, the motion to recommit is not germane. The point of \norder is sustained, and the motion is not in order.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Shall the decision of the \nChair stand as the judgment of the House?\n\n[[Page H1709]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                            Motion to Table\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I move to lay the appeal on the table.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to table.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, and the order of the House of today, this 15-minute vote on the \nmotion to table will be followed by 5-minute votes on passage of the \nbill, if arising without further proceedings in recommittal; adoption \nof amendment No. 1 to H.R. 3791; the motion to recommit H.R. 3791, if \nordered; and passage of H.R. 3791, if ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 239, \nnays 176, not voting 18, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 145]\n\n                               YEAS--239\n\n

There are 2 minutes \nremaining.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. CONYERS changed his vote from ``yea'' to ``nay.''\n  So the amendment was rejected.\n  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Ms. MOORE. I am opposed.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Moore moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3791 to the \n     Committee on Financial Services with instructions to report \n     the same back to the House forthwith with the following \n     amendment:\n       Add at the end the following:\n       Sec. __  Upon enactment of this Act it shall be in order to \n     consider in the House of Representatives the concurrent \n     resolution (H. Con. Res. 125) establishing the congressional \n     budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2017 \n     and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal \n     years 2018 through 2026. All points of order against \n     consideration of the concurrent resolution are waived. The \n     concurrent resolution shall be considered as read. All points \n     of order against provisions in the concurrent resolution are \n     waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on the concurrent resolution and on any amendment thereto to \n     adoption without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of \n     debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and \n     ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget; and \n     (2) one motion to recommit.\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous \nconsent to dispense with reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Wisconsin is recognized \nfor 5 minutes in support of her motion.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, today is April 14. Tomorrow, by law, our \nbudget resolution is due to be passed on the floor of the House.\n  Now, we have heard a great deal from the majority about the need to \nreturn to regular order, and regular order would require us to pass \nthis bill either today or by tomorrow. So since that bill is not before \nus, my motion to recommit would give us an opportunity to vote on the \nRepublican budget resolution that was passed out of our committee just \nlast month.\n  Now, I just want to refresh your memory, Mr. Speaker. The GOP budget \nresolution ends the Medicare guarantee, makes $6.5 trillion in drastic \ncuts, increases poverty, and erodes the economic security of all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. Speaker, believe it or not, as awful as this is, there is a \nfaction over there among the Tea Party Republicans who want the \nopportunity to make it even worse than it is. But they can't submit \ntheir awful, worse bill, just like Democrats can't offer their \nalternative bill, until we get the Republican budget on the floor.\n  So by Republicans abandoning their promise to return us to regular \norder and to pass a budget, it is ridiculous for us to be passing these \nbills. Mr. Speaker, how can we talk about subjecting FSOC, for example, \nto the appropriations process? We can't really do these appropriations \nbills without a budget.\n  Hardworking families deserve to see where we stand on these budgets, \nand Democrats want to have our say. I get it. The majority gets its \nway, but the minority gets its say. Let's get on to the ``gets its \nsay'' part.\n  Mr. Speaker, you guys can't get your act together. My motion to \nrecommit would put that budget on the floor right now, and Republicans \nwould have the opportunity to pass their bill, and then we have the \nopportunity to offer up our alternative.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I insist on my point of order because \nthe instruction contains matter in the jurisdiction of a committee to \nwhich the bill was not referred, thus violating clause 7 of rule XVI \nwhich requires an amendment to be germane to the measure being amended. \nCommittee jurisdiction is a central test of germaneness, and I must \ninsist on my point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Are there other Members who wish to be heard \non the point of order?\n  If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The gentleman from Texas makes a point of order that the instructions \nproposed in the motion to recommit offered by the gentlewoman from \nWisconsin are not germane.\n  The bill, H.R. 3791, addresses a Federal Reserve System policy \nstatement relating to small bank holding companies, which is a matter \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Committee on Financial Services.\n  The instructions in the motion to recommit propose an amendment \nconsisting of a special order of business of the House, which is a \nmatter within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Rules.\n  For the reasons stated by the Chair earlier today, the motion to \nrecommit is not germane. The point of order is sustained. The motion is \nnot in order.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Shall the decision of the \nChair stand as the judgment of the House?\n\n\n                            Motion to Table\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I move to lay the appeal on the table.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to table.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15-\nminute on the motion to table will be followed by a 5-minute vote on \npassage of the bill, if arising without further proceedings in \nrecommittal.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 241, \nnoes 177, not voting 15, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 148]\n\n                               AYES--241\n\n

Mr. Speaker, we stand to remember the nearly \n300 Chibok girls who were kidnapped by Boko Haram on April 14, 2014--2 \nyears ago--from their school in Nigeria.\n  Mr. Speaker, Boko Haram has no regard for human life, and it is \nwreaking havoc on the citizens of northern Nigeria. As Boko Haram \ncommits acts of genocide that will take generations to recover from, \nthe world stays silent. Their daily horrors include killing Christians, \nkilling Muslims who do not agree with them, beheading and slaughtering \nboys, kidnapping and raping women and girls, selling them as sex \nslaves, and using them as suicide bombers. Human trafficking is their \nspecialty. Boko Haram believes that Western education is sin.\n  We will never forget the schoolgirls. We will never forget the Chibok \ngirls. We will tweet, wear red, and we look for them no matter how long \nit takes. We will never give up until we find them.\n  Let us bow our heads in a moment of silence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1713-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               OLDER AMERICANS ACT A BIG WIN FOR SENIORS\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to applaud the bipartisan efforts to \nsupport our seniors through the passage of the Older Americans Act, \nlegislation that I have supported. Our seniors have spent their lives \nworking hard, raising their families, and giving back to their \ncommunities. The Older Americans Act shows what we can do when we work \ntogether.\n  The bill improves services for seniors, especially those with the \ngreatest social and economic needs. For example, it provides funding \nfor the popular Meals on Wheels program. The bill saves taxpayers money \nby preventing very costly hospital readmissions and by helping senior \ncitizens stay in their homes and communities. It also supports programs \nto prevent the abuse and neglect of senior citizens.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Older Americans Act is a big, bipartisan win for our \nNation's seniors. I encourage the President to sign the bill as soon as \nit hits his desk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1713-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FIND THE CHIBOK GIRLS\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, in the dark of night on this very day 2 \nyears ago, young girls at the early ages of 11 to 17 were in \nnightgowns, preparing for sleep, and were getting ready for the exams \nthat would open the doors of opportunity, as they were told by their \nNigerian parents. One daughter had rushed back to the school from a \nweekend trip because her father said: You shouldn't be home. You must \ngo and take your exam.\n  That night, terrorists came and rounded them up and threatened them \nand took them into the dark of the Nigerian bush in Borno State, \nupwards of Abuja. They have now been gone for 2 years, the Chibok \ngirls.\n  I stood alongside Frederica Wilson and Lois Frankel when we went to \nNigeria within weeks of their kidnapping. Boko Haram, which is now \nISIL, and ISIL, which is now Boko Haram--the most dangerous terrorist \ngroup in the world--will come to the shores of America if we are not \nvigilant to find them and quash them.\n  We must find the Chibok girls. They deserve our constant refrain and \nstudy to realize that it is terrorists who took them. We must bring the \nterrorists down and find the Chibok girls to take them to their \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1713-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL RETIREMENT PLANNING WEEK\n\n  (Mr. ROE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize April 11 \nthrough 15 as National Retirement Planning Week.\n  Saving for retirement is one of the most important steps that \nAmericans can take to build a better future for themselves and their \nchildren. Unfortunately, too often, saving for retirement remains a \ndistant goal that is put off in exchange for more immediate needs. A \nGAO report released last year found that, among households with those \naged 55 and older, roughly 29 percent have no retirement savings or a \ndefined benefit plan. With this in mind, it must be a national priority \nfor us to communicate the importance of retirement planning. By \nencouraging more Americans to adequately prepare for their retirement \nyears, we can significantly enhance retirement security in the United \nStates.\n  Recognizing this week as National Retirement Planning Week is an \nimportant step in helping to raise awareness of this need, and I \ncommend the members of the National Retirement Planning Coalition for \ntheir efforts in educating Americans about the importance of retirement \nplanning.\n  I wish you all the best as you continue this valued campaign.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1713-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRINIDAD GARZA HIGH SCHOOL RECEIVES ACT AWARD\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Trinidad Garza Early \nCollege High School, in Dallas, for receiving the 2016 ACT High School \nExemplar in College and Career Readiness Award.\n  Since 2013, the annual ACT College and Career Readiness Campaign has \nrecognized participating high schools and community colleges for their \noutstanding efforts in education. The prestigious award is presented to \nonly one school per State that demonstrates exceptional efforts in \npreparing students for college and career readiness. Given Trinidad \nGarza's commitment to preparing students for success in higher \neducation and the workforce, this accolade is well-deserved. The award \nalso celebrates individual students within participating schools for \ntheir outstanding progress on their ACT scores, such as Trinidad Garza \nseniors Paola Soto, Ivan Gonzales, Barry Levine, and Lizbeth Garcia.\n  I am extremely proud of Trinidad Garza Early College High School for \nrepresenting the State of Texas and the 33rd Congressional District.\n  You are an example of what a dedicated group of educators can \naccomplish when it is committed to empowering its students.\n  Once again, congratulations to everyone at Trinidad Garza Early \nCollege High School, and keep up the good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1713-6", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1713-H1714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATIONS TO OAKLAND COUNTY SHERIFF MIKE BOUCHARD\n\n  (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the outstanding \naccomplishments of Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard, who was \nrecently awarded the esteemed Ferris E.

He is the kind of leader all families want to keep \ntheir families safe. I have known Mike Bouchard for many years, and I \nknow that, every day, he looks forward to going to work to serve the \nmen and women of our local communities, and he does an outstanding job\n\n[[Page H1714]]\n\nof it in utilizing his professionalism and compassion for people.\n  In serving Oakland County for over 17 years, Mike Bouchard was \nselected among a field of more than 3,000 sheriffs for this prestigious \naward, and I can tell you he absolutely deserves it.

BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission \nto address the House for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week, we \nrecognize Equal Pay Day--a somber reminder of the intolerably wide wage \ngulf that still exists between men and women. This is not just a \n``woman's issue.'' It affects every working family throughout our \neconomy from top to bottom.\n  The average woman in America today makes 79 cents for every dollar a \nman makes--even less for women of color. That disparity, when spread \nacross the course of a woman's working life, can deprive her and her \nfamily of over $430,000, which is nearly $11,000 annually. Nobody can \nafford such dispossession, especially families who are already \nstruggling to survive.\n  The gender pay gap will not fix itself without there being immediate \ncongressional action. We already have a bill that is designed to right \nthis wrong--the Paycheck Fairness Act--which is cosponsored by every \nsingle House Democrat.\n  Mr. Speaker, I implore my colleagues to enact it so that all American \nwomen can at least know they are worth equal pay for equal work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1714-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1630\n                          BRING BACK OUR GIRLS\n\n  (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking \nCongresswoman Frederica Wilson and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for \ntheir leadership on continuing to ensure that we don't forget about the \n276 young women who were stolen from their families 2 years ago.\n  I traveled to Nigeria with Congresswoman Wilson and Congresswoman \nJackson Lee right after the kidnapping in order to see what kind of \nefforts were being made to get them back.\n  This kidnapping received international attention for a short time and \nthen, like the girls, it disappeared. We are standing here exactly 2 \nyears later while the Chibok girls, who we call ``our girls,'' remain \nhidden and subject to unimaginable crimes.\n  Boko Haram, the deadliest terrorist organization in the world, wants \nto silence these girls. I stand here with my colleagues to give ``our \ngirls'' a stronger voice than the terrorists and more power than fear.\n  I want the Chibok girls to know that they are our daughters and we \nwill not give up until they are returned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1714-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      KEEP THE PENSION PROMISES ACT AND PENSION ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  (Mr. RYAN of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) is recognized for \n60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to be recognized by \nyou to address you here on the floor of the United States House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I come to the floor here today with an issue that I think is \nimportant that America have a dialogue on the topic, and some of that \nis going on. It is going on in the Presidential races across the \ncountry and in the coffee shops and at work, at play, at church, and \naround the country in the things that we do.\n  But when a moment in history comes along that shocked a lot of us to \nthe core--and that was the abrupt and unexpected loss of Justice \nAntonin Scalia, a person whom I got to know. I would like to say that I \ncalled him a friend. He was a person whose personality I enjoyed a lot, \nhis robust sense of humor, his acerbic wit in the way that he conveyed \nhis messages, especially when he wrote the dissenting opinions for the \nSupreme Court. He found himself occasionally in the minority, but I \nthink he was almost always right in those constitutional decisions.\n  When Justice Scalia wrote those minority opinions, he realized that--\nand he just thought in advance--that the students in law school would \nhave to read the dissenting opinions as well as the majority opinions.\n  So he made sure when he wrote especially his dissenting opinions that \nthey were engaging, they were entertaining, they were provocative, and \nthey were challenging. It caused the law school students to read those \nand remember the points that Justice Scalia had made.\n  That is a legacy of the 30 years of Justice Scalia that will live \nwithin the annals of the history of the United States of America, \nespecially those who are studying constitutional law and those that are \nin law school.\n  The constitutional law students around America too seldom are taught \nconstitutional law out of the Constitution itself. We have a President \nof the United States who spent 10 years as an adjunct professor \nteaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago.\n  I have met with a good number of the students that he taught. The \nones that I met with, at least, said that, whenever they laid out a \nconservative principle and made a constitutional argument based upon \nthose conservative principles, that then-adjunct professor Barack Obama \nwould always turn that around to the activist side, to move the needle \nhard to the left.\n  It is my position--and I believe it is also the position of the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee in the House and especially the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate--that the \nConstitution must be read and interpreted to mean what it says. It \nwould mean precisely the text of the Constitution as it was understood \nto mean at the time of ratification.\n  The Constitution itself, Mr. Speaker, is the equivalent of--and I \nwould say literally is--an intergenerational contractual guarantee from \none generation of Americans to the next, to the next, to the next.\n  Our Founding Fathers understood that, and they so carefully crafted \nthis Constitution. The language in it reflects their convictions and \ntheir guarantee to each generation.\n  If it were to be anything else, if it were to be a living and \nbreathing document, as too many of our Justices on the Supreme Court \nand far too many on our Federal bench today, that 40 percent or so that \nwill have been appointed by Barack Obama by the end of his term--those \nJustices, by and large,\n\n[[Page H1715]]\n\ndon't believe what I've just said, Mr. Speaker.\n  They generally believe that the text of the Constitution is something \nthat they can massage, that they can manipulate, that they can \ninterpret and reinterpret to mean that which they would want it to mean \nif it were written by them today.\n  Of course, the words wouldn't be the same, but the ideology that \ngrows from many of these precedent decisions shows that and is proof of \nit.\n  If anyone wonders, Mr. Speaker, I would take them back to the Court \nlast June 24 and 25. On one day, the Supreme Court concluded that they \ncould rewrite law. On the next day, the Supreme Court concluded that \nthey could create not just new rights in the Constitution, but create a \ncommand in the Constitution.\n  Now, I hope to return to that topic in a little bit, Mr. Speaker.\n  What we have in front of us is this: The loss of Justice Scalia \nleaves an empty seat on the Supreme Court. It is an intellectual hole, \nnot just a voting hole. But it is an intellectual hole left by the \ntowering legal intellect of Justice Scalia.\n  In times throughout history--there are conflicting reports--one can \nmake the political argument and one can make the traditional argument \nas to whether a President should be able to make an appointment to the \nSupreme Court and have that appointment ratified and confirmed by the \nUnited States Senate.\n  Under these circumstances that we have today--this is an election \nyear, and the loss of Justice Scalia and the creation of that empty \nseat on the Supreme Court has brought about a nomination for the \nSupreme Court that has been produced by President Barack Obama, even \nthough the majority party in the Senate, concurring with Majority \nLeader Mitch McConnell from Kentucky, as well as the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Charles Grassley, have said: We are not \ngoing to take up a nominee and we are not going to have hearings in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  That means that we won't have a debate on the floor of the Senate for \nconfirmation because they believe--and it is their prerogative to do \nso--they believe that the next Justice on the Supreme Court should be a \nreflection of the voice of the people who will go to the polls this \ncoming November and an elected President of the United States who more \naccurately reflects the will of the people rather than a President who \nis a lameduck President.\n  I agree with Senator Grassley and I agree with Majority Leader \nSenator McConnell that this is a decision that is too big to be made by \npeople who are on the way out the door. The President is on the way out \nthe door. There are Members of the Senate that are on their way out the \ndoor.\n  We need the fresh faces that have the freshest support of the \nAmerican people making these decisions, particularly the next President \nof the United States.\n  Now, predictably, when an argument like this comes up, each side \nseeks to gain a political advantage. Yes, this is a political decision. \nIt is a political decision that needs to be based on the foundation, \nhowever, of the Constitution and the text of the Constitution and the \nunderstanding of the Constitution to mean what it says and mean what it \nwas interpreted to mean at the time that it was ratified.\n  Our Founding Fathers gave us a means to amend the Constitution. So \nthey didn't intend our Constitution to be a living, breathing document, \nas the people on the left say.\n  They intended it to be fixed in place, an intergenerational \ncontractual guarantee, so that my grandchildren and great-grandchildren \nand each succeeding generation can count on this Constitution meaning \nwhat it says.\n\n  I have watched it distorted. I have watched it usurped by decisions \nmade in our Federal courts and by our Supreme Court and a people and a \npublic that will honor those decisions because they are made by the \njudges, not because they are constitutionally grounded decisions.\n  So this appointment that comes before the Supreme Court--first, I \nwill go to this. In our Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Article II, section \n2--the authority of the executive branch of government must be here \nsomewhere.\n  Article II, section 2: This is the text we are working with, Mr. \nSpeaker. This is the language that governs the nomination, the advice, \nthe consent, and the appointment to the Supreme Court in this fashion.\n  I will read this verbatim from Article II, section 2:\n  ``He''--meaning the President of the United States--this is executive \nbranch authority--``He shall have power, by and with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate, to . . . nominate, and by and with the advice \nand consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . judges of the Supreme \nCourt . . .''\n  Now, he shall have power to nominate and, by and with the advice and \nconsent, appoint judges of the Supreme Court. That is power to nominate \nand appoint by and with the consent, Mr. Speaker.\n  So the language here is clear, ``by and with the advice and consent \nof the Senate.'' The advice and consent of the Senate is determined by \nthe Senate. The consent of the Senate is the confirmation vote.\n  The advice would be that the President is to go to the Senate and \nsay: I have got an appointment here to the Supreme Court. You all know \nthat. Do you have some names you would like to offer? What is your \ncounsel here? Look at the makeup of the Court. What is missing? Who do \nwe have on the bench today? How are they contributing? What kind of job \nare they doing in ruling upon the supreme law of the land, the \nConstitution itself, and the text of the statutes that Congress has \npassed that go before the Court for evaluation as to their \nconstitutionality?\n  I will go further than to suggest, Mr. Speaker. I will assert that we \nhave a Court today that too often reaches outside its bounds. And if I \nhad a criticism of Justice Scalia, it would be his deeper respect for \nstare decisis that I happen to see in a Justice such as Clarence \nThomas.\n  But when a decision is made by the Court, there has been essentially \na consent of the Court to accept that decision, to build on it, rather \nthan to go back and reevaluate afresh, anew from the text of the \nConstitution.\n  I think we need to go back and refresh anew and take a look at the \ntext of the Constitution with each decision of the Supreme Court with \nless deference to stare decisis.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  The activists on the Court, on the other hand, are the exact \nopposite. They want to build these leftward precedents along the way so \nthat, in the end, the Constitution would be obliterated.\n  That is the direction that President Obama has gone. It is the \ndirection he seeks to go. I would submit that I don't expect that he is \ngoing to be able to make an appointment to the Supreme Court that would \nreflect a Justice on the bench whose interpretation of the Constitution \nwould be to the text and the original understanding and meaning of it, \nbut, instead, activist judges. That is the history that he has \nproduced.\n  I have not evaluated Judge Garland. I don't have a comment on his \nwork except that this is not the time to confirm an appointment for \nBarack Obama and let him shape this Court for the next generation or \nso. If we get this wrong, Mr. Speaker, we lose our Constitution for the \nnext generation.\n  No matter how astute our Presidents have been, no matter how deeply \nthey have been committed to the Constitution itself, we have still seen \nthat, even under Ronald Reagan, he got about half of his appointments \nto the Court right.\n  We need a President coming around the pike that gets every one of \nthem right. I wouldn't be happy and satisfied until all nine of the \nJustices on the Court reflected that they are traditionalists, that \nthey are textualists, that they are originalists in the Constitution, \nand that the judges that are coming up on the Federal bench would also \nmeet that same standard.\n  I am not in the United States Senate. We don't have a vote on the \nconfirmation of appointments to our Federal courts over here in the \nHouse. I do serve on the Committee on the Judiciary, and this is the \nend of the 14th year that I have done that, Mr. Speaker.\n  And so the voice of time and observation and reading and \nconsideration and\n\n[[Page H1716]]\n\nexperience, especially as a member of the Subcommittee on the \nConstitution and Civil Justice of the House Committee on the Judiciary, \nyes, I have deep convictions on this issue and considerable experience \nand knowledge base on it.\n  I am suggesting, Mr. Speaker, that this House of Representatives \nevaluate the arguments that I am making here and the arguments that \nSenator Grassley is making on the other side of the rotunda, and these \narguments say we take an oath. This will be my argument.\n  Mr. Speaker, we all take an oath here to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States. So do the Justices of the Supreme \nCourt take that oath to support and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States. The President of the United States takes an oath to \npreserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. \nThese are serious oaths.\n  When you stand up before God and country and say ``so help me God,'' \nyou better mean it. That means that the Constitution isn't a malleable \ndocument. When you take an oath to support and defend it, that doesn't \nmean you can take an oath to support and defend the Constitution as, \nlet's say, amended by a Supreme Court.\n  I would support and defend a Constitution amended constitutionally \nonly. The Supreme Court Justices are the last people on the planet that \nought to be engaged in amending the Constitution of the United States.\n  But if I could take you back to those dates I mentioned--June 24, \nJune 25, 2015--June 24, if you want to look at the calendar, is going \nto be a Thursday. That was the date that the decision came out on \nObamaCare. That was King v. Burwell.\n  That decision, Mr. Speaker, a majority opinion written by the Chief \nJustice, boiled down to this: Congress passed a law in two different \ncomponents. I call it ObamaCare. They called it the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  I have said that George Washington could not utter those words in \nreferencing that legislation because it is not affordable and George \nWashington could not tell a lie. But it was actually the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act.\n  That long lingo threw people off. So they boiled it down to the \nAffordable Care Act. We boiled it down to ObamaCare. ObamaCare is far \nmore descriptive than the Affordable Care Act and far more honest.\n  But that legislation came in two packages. It was passed by hook, by \ncrook, by legislative shenanigan, and that wasn't just me saying that. \nThere was at least one Democrat here on the floor who used the term \n``legislative shenanigan'' in reference to the passage of ObamaCare.\n  It was passed in that fashion. Yet, when it began to be implemented, \nthey wrote thousands of pages of regulations that could not have been \nimagined at the time that that bill passed the floor here.\n  There was a massive amount of arm twisting and leverage like this \ncountry has never seen. We had tens of thousands of people that \nsurrounded this Capitol and pleaded: Keep your hands off of our health \ninsurance. Keep your hands off of our health care. They wanted their \nfreedom.\n  The people who came here understood this, that the most sovereign \nthing that we have is our own soul. And the Federal Government hasn't \nfigured out how to tax it, how to nationalize it, how to take it away \nfrom us.\n  We are in control of our eternal salvation--that is our soul--and we \nmanage that. Each one of us manages it. But the second most sovereign \nthing we have is our health, our skin, and everything inside it.\n  Yet, this Congress, House and Senate, together with the President of \nthe United States--on March 23, 2010, he signed into law the \ncombination of the two bills that became ObamaCare that I said were \npassed by hook, crook, and legislative shenanigan and have their own \nconstitutional problems.\n  I would argue the Supreme Court at least twice has ruled outside the \nConstitution in order to get ObamaCare implemented, and one of those \nwas the State exchanges.\n  The statutory authority for the States to establish insurance \nexchanges under the auspices of the State exists within ObamaCare, but \nthe language that empowers the States to do so does not include the \nFederal Government. The Federal Government did not have \nthe constitutional authority to establish exchanges, and it needed the \nlanguage.\n\n  If the Obama administration had been astute, they may well have \nwritten into ObamaCare legislation three words, ``or Federal \nGovernment,'' so that the States or Federal Government would have the \nlegal authority to establish the exchanges.\n  The Federal Government went ahead and established exchanges within \nthe multiple States that refused to do so, and the Supreme Court's job \nis to read the text of the language and rule on the text of the \nlanguage and the law.\n  But, yet, in a 5-4 decision of the Supreme Court written by the Chief \nJustice, they decided that, if the Congress really might have at that \ntime passed legislation with the language in it that would have said \n``or Federal Government,'' that they would just go ahead and interpret \nthat it really means: Well, okay. It was an oversight on the part of \nCongress.\n  They might have slipped that in there if they had just known that \nthey needed to write it in there. But it was maybe an oversight by \nstaff in the middle of the night because, after all, the then-Speaker \nof the House, Nancy Pelosi, said we have to pass this legislation in \norder to find out what is in it.\n  Well, she didn't say we had to pass it to find out what wasn't in it. \nBut what wasn't in it was the authority for the Federal Government to \ngo into the States and intervene and establish their own exchanges \nwithin the States. But this Obama administration did that with the \npeople's tax dollars, and I will say in violation of the law.\n  When it was appealed to the Supreme Court to assert just that, the \nSupreme Court ruled, well, it would have been better for the policy, in \ntheir judgment, if the language had been in there, ``or Federal \nGovernment.''\n  But it wasn't in there. So they deemed it in. That is a legislative \ndecision made by a 5-4 decision of the Supreme Court that came down on \nus June 24, 2015. That is appalling to me.\n  I am aghast at the idea that a Supreme Court could be ruling upon the \nsupreme law of the land and come down with a decision that they are now \nthe legislative body to completely alter legislation that was the due \ndecision of, I think, an erroneous decision, but a majority decision of \nthe United States Congress.\n  Now, in any other world, in any other time, in any other kind of a \ndecision that would come down, a Supreme Court could, should, has, and \nwould justly send it back to Congress with this directive: We can't \nfind in here the language you may have wanted to pass. If you want this \nlanguage in this bill, Article I says all legislative authority is \nvested in the Congress of the United States.\n  So the only right choice for a Supreme Court faced with this kind of \na decision was to not remand it back to a lower court for a decision, \nessentially and, I will say, virtually, remand it to Congress and say \nto Congress: If you want to have federally established exchanges within \nthe States, you have to pass a law that says so.\n  That is not what they did. They decided that they could change the \nlaw over at the Supreme Court building.\n  Now, if that can be done, if the Supreme Court of the United States \ncan take on the trappings of a legislature and become a super \nlegislature--and, by the way, they are appointed for life, for life.\n  So there is no consequence for people who can't be voted out of \noffice. You can't even replace them for the duration of their life.\n  But they made the decision that they were the super legislature, and \n5-4, under King v. Burwell, they put three words de facto, three words \ninto the ObamaCare legislation, ``or Federal Government.''\n  Now, I am barely up off the floor from reading this on that Thursday, \nJune 24, 2015, and, as the Sun comes up on me on the following morning, \nI am contemplating: What do we do about this? How does Congress react? \nWhat should the public messages be in one part?\n  At 9:00 in the morning in Iowa, 10:00 D.C. time, I am rolling into \nSt. Anne's Catholic Church in Logan, Iowa, to do an event there with a \nvisiting priest\n\n[[Page H1717]]\n\nand with the parish there at St. Anne's in Logan, Iowa.\n  And who merged together--at the same time we pulled in and parked \nessentially simultaneously--was the vehicle of former Senator Rick \nSantorum, one of the leading constitutionalists in this country, one of \nthe strongest people in defense of life and defense of marriage and \ndefense of the Constitution that we have seen--and I will say within a \ngeneration--with deep convictions, a clear understanding, and a very \narticulate voice.\n  As we got out of our vehicles, each of us had been listening to the \nnews report of the decision that came down from the Supreme Court that \nday. That was a decision on marriage. I pronounce it Obergefell \ndecision.\n  But that decision on marriage that came down on Friday, June 25, \n2015, where the Supreme Court--I mentioned in the earliest part of my \nconversation, Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court would legislate from the \nbench, and the Supreme Court not only created what would be a new right \nfrom the bench, but they created--they manufactured out of thin air a \ncommand, a command to every State in the Union.\n  That command that they created without any constitutional basis \nwhatsoever was to the States this: If you are to have civil marriage in \nyour State, it shall include same-sex marriage on equal standing with a \nman and a woman joined together in matrimony. No matter what your State \nlaws, no matter what your State constitutions say, we usurp it from the \nSupreme Court with an edict, a directive, a command, that you shall \nconduct same-sex marriages on equal standing and you shall recognize \nsame-sex marriages from other States with reciprocity as well.\n  Now, this is not a decision that could have been made by the United \nStates Congress and not had it challenged. And I would say the Congress \ndoes not have the authority to impose same-sex marriage on the rest of \nthe country.\n  If we had had the audacity to make such a decision in the House and \nthe Senate and signed by the President, somebody would take that to the \nSupreme Court and say: Show me the enumerated power that Congress has \nto regulate marriage in such a fashion.\n  I would argue that we don't have that constitutional authority, but I \nwould submit that the States do have. The States under the Ninth and \nTenth Amendment do have the authority.\n  If they decide to establish same-sex marriage in their State \nlegislatures and they can get their Governor to sign the legislation or \noverride a veto, any one or any combination of or all of the States \ncould pass a same-sex marriage law, I would respect that as a \nconstitutional decision made by we, the people, whether it is we, the \npeople of Iowa, or we, the people of another State, or all other \nStates, for that matter, but not the Supreme Court, Mr. Speaker.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States didn't just manufacture a \nright, they created a command to the States, and that is \nconstitutionally offensive to me to read a decision like that.\n  By the way, I had a preview of it because the State Supreme Court in \nIowa did just that in about 2009 and some of us dug down into that \ndecision. That was about a 63- or 64-page decision, and it was an \nappalling, sloppy piece of legal work that was written with, I believe, \na conclusion. And then they had to go through a lot of legalistic and \nmental and logical contortions to get to their conclusion.\n\n  I would invite anybody to read that decision. I believe that an \nobjective reading of that decision brings them down with the same \ncharacterization that I would have.\n  I want judges who read the Constitution and literally interpret the \nConstitution. And the judges who understand, as Justice Scalia did, \nthat when he makes a decision based on the Constitution and the letter \nof the law--if he is uncomfortable with the policy decision that \nemerges with that, that tells him that he can be very comfortable with \nthe constitutionality of the decision that he has made because, on \npolicy, he disagrees, but he knows that he is not there to determine \npolicy.\n  He is there, as Justice Roberts said in his confirmation accurately, \nI think, to call the balls and the strikes, not to be the one that is a \nplayer in that arena.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  So we have Senator Chuck Grassley, the man who is standing in the gap \nand a man who is the chairman of the United States Senate Judiciary \nCommittee who has the control over the agenda of that committee and \ndecides whether there will be hearings before the Judiciary Committee \non this appointment of the President or whether there will not be--and \nhe has said in conjunction with Majority Leader McConnell, that there \nwill not be hearings in the Judiciary Committee. And Chuck Grassley is \nright, Mitch McConnell is right.\n  This argument gets cast back and forth--and it will be cast back and \nforth--and the amperage of this will go up and up and up between now \nand the election. They will turn that into a political football.\n  For me, I say: Take Chuck Grassley's word to the bank and we are done \ntalking about it. But they want the political leverage. So they will be \npressuring Chuck Grassley.\n  Mr. Speaker, here is a little bit of what is going on. Here is my \npublic position on the issue. And it had to do with a press conference \nwhere I said, ``There is no reason to have that hearing. The simple \nanswer to it is this: It's inconceivable that he''--President Obama--\n``would nominate someone to the Supreme Court who believes in the \nConstitution. If we're going to save our Constitution, we can't have an \nObama nominee on the court.''\n  Mr. Speaker, that is maybe a blunt statement, but I have watched the \nhistory and the pattern of Barack Obama and appointments that he has \nmade to the court. There is no question that they are liberal, leftist \nactivists who want to come down with decisions that are more in the \ndirection of the leadership of the ideology on the left and with very \nlittle deference to the Founding Fathers and anchored to the text of \nthe Constitution.\n  And I have given what the Constitution says about nominations by \nadvice and consent. Again, the President ``shall nominate, and by and \nwith the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint.'' In other \nwords, the President can't make an appointment to the Supreme Court \nunless he has the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  Now, advice could be fairly loosely interpreted, but consent is a \ndifferent story. That takes a vote to do that--judges to the Supreme \nCourt. That means the President nominates, the Senate can provide the \nadvice before the nomination--that would be the best--and perhaps some \nadvice after. But the consent of the Senate is required or there won't \nbe a seat in the Supreme Court that is filled by Barack Obama.\n  Now, I point out also that there is nothing in this Constitution that \nsays that there has to be nine Justices on the Supreme Court. This is \nwhere the House could actually weigh in on this, if we decide to do \nthis. The Constitution of the United States requires that the Congress \nestablish a Supreme Court. And then it is up to our discretion as to \nwhat other Federal court we might want to establish.\n  Mr. Speaker, I actually had this debate with Justice Scalia. One of \nthe things I enjoyed about him was little banters along the way and how \nthese arguments came out. And I made the point to him that the \nConstitution only requires that the Congress establish a Supreme Court, \nnot all the other Federal courts. So we could--Congress--abolish all of \nthe Federal districts that are there. We could say there will be no \nFederal courts. It will all be handled through the Supreme Court \nitself. That is not a practical application, but it is from a \nconstitutional perspective.\n  Then I said to Justice Scalia that we could eliminate all the Federal \ncourts except the Supreme Court. And over time, we could reduce the \nSupreme Court. There is no requirement that the Supreme Court have nine \nJustices or seven or five or three. We could reduce the Supreme Court \nof the United States down to the Chief Justice. There is no requirement \nthat we build or fund a building or heat it or wire it for electronics \nor anything. There is no requirement that we have staff for any of the \nSupreme Court. The Congress could crank all the Federal courts down to \njust the Supreme Court, reduce the Supreme Court down to just the Chief \nJustice at his own card table, with candle, no staff, and no facility.\n\n[[Page H1718]]\n\n  That is the argument I made to Justice Scalia. Some of this I do for \nentertainment value because he always was an engaging fellow to have \nthese conversations with.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't know if you ever heard this point made to him \nbefore, but Justice Scalia's response to it was: I would argue that \nthere is a requirement that there be three Justices on the Supreme \nCourt; otherwise, there is no reason to have a Chief Justice.\n  I thought that was a pretty astute response, Mr. Speaker. But my \nresponse to that was: we have always had too many chiefs and not enough \nIndians.\n  So we had a little fun with that and moved on, but that is the \nleverage that the House and the Senate has together. There is not a \nrequirement that there be a ninth Justice on the Supreme Court. I am \ncomfortable with that and supportive of that, but I want to fill that \nseat with someone that reflects the values of Justice Scalia and \nperhaps one that will reflect even more closely the values of Justice \nThomas, in particular.\n  And there are a number of other Justices that I admire on the Supreme \nCourt, but another activist on the Supreme Court is not what this \ncountry needs. This country needs to have a constitutionalist, an \noriginalist, a textualist on the Supreme Court that will reflect the \nmeaning of this Constitution at its time of ratification.\n  And that is why our Founders gave us a means to amend the \nConstitution. They didn't intend for the Supreme Court to be taking on \nthe trappings of a super legislature and legislating on one day by \nadding words to ObamaCare, and then the very next day create the new \ncommand in the Constitution that the State shall conduct same-sex \nmarriages and honor same-sex marriages in other States. That is over \nthe top. That is beyond the pale.\n  If you can imagine what our Founding Fathers would say, how about the \nsigners of the Declaration of Independence?\n  If we could bring them to life today and walk them out here into \nStatuary Hall and say: take a look at this painting up here where you \nare all signing this Declaration of Independence. Or better yet, go \nover to the Archives, where they pledged their lives, fortunes, and \nsacred honor, and you can still see John Hancock's signature there \nalmost as clearly as the day that he may well have signed that.\n  What would those Founding Fathers say if they knew that within a 24-\nhour window or maybe a 25-hour window, the Supreme Court of the United \nStates said, We are going to confer national health insurance on \neverybody in America, and the Congress didn't write the law right, so \nwe wrote it for them; and then the next day, same-sex marriage?\n  You wouldn't find a single Founding Father that would agree with \neither one of those decisions, Mr. Speaker. We are on the cusp of \nmaking an appointment to the Supreme Court that would feed this back to \nus and do more and more and more.\n  How do you possibly teach the Constitution to young people? How do \nyou teach civics to young people if the Constitution itself is moving \nin such a way that no one can predict what would happen?\n  I am very pleased to see that I am joined by another \nconstitutionalist out of the State of Florida, who is a clear thinker \nand has a good understanding. I yield to the gentleman from Florida \n(Mr. Yoho), my friend and a doctor.\n\n  Mr. YOHO. I would like to thank my colleague for those kind words.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take just a quick moment to add to the \nimportant work that Mr. King is doing and to thank my colleague for \nyielding me the time and for his continued leadership in the fight to \nensure the dignity of the Supreme Court so that it is not undermined by \nthe nomination and subsequent appointment of a Justice whose judicial \nideologies run counter to the Founders' constitutional principles, as \nyou have spoken so eloquently about.\n  The United States of America, the great American experiment, is an \nexperiment that has surpassed centuries of speculation and persisted \nthrough the Civil War, an experiment that survived two World Wars and \ncontinues to stand as a beacon of hope to nations across the globe, an \nexperiment made possible because of the foresight of our Founding \nFathers--and it had to have some divine intervention because men just \naren't that smart, so there was wisdom--who recognized the necessity to \nestablish a government ruled by a series of laws they felt were so \nessential to ensure equal opportunity--not equal outcome, but equal \nopportunity--in the pursuit of prosperity and happiness to all \ncitizens.\n  These documents--the United States Constitution and the Bill of \nRights--I have right here. I want people to look at this. This is the \nentire Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. I think if you \nlook at it, we will all agree it is not an epic in volume. Even my \ncolleague across the aisle recognizes that.\n  It is not an epic in volume, but yet it is an epic in the ideology of \nwhat America stands for. And it stands for opportunity. And if you put \nwork behind that, it becomes the American Dream, your American Dream. \nThe very fabric of this country is our core value, our founding \nprinciples, and the Constitution that preserves this.\n  And that is the very document that gives people on the left the voice \nof dissension, as it does people on the right. And if we lose this--\nthese principles--we lose that very argument, the very thing that made \nAmerica great.\n  And I ask you: Are those ideologies Republican or Democrat, \nconservative, liberal, White, Black, or any other adjective you want to \nthrow in there?\n  And I would venture to say that you would all say no, they are \nAmerican ideologies. That is why this discussion is so important.\n  The United States is facing an unprecedented attack by activist \njustices in both the lower and upper courts. If leaders were to yield \nto the demands of President Obama or any other executive in the future, \nand nominate any individual who does not have a true, tried, and tested \nconservative record on constitutional issues, the ensuing Supreme Court \nopinions could be detrimental to constitutional law for years, if not \ndecades, to come. And I would surmise that if we cross that bridge and \ngo beyond the constitutional principles of this country, what America \nis, what it has been in the past, and what we hope it to be in the \nfuture may be lost in the history of time.\n  While I fully understand the importance of having a full Bench and \nall nine Justices available to hear some of the most critical cases of \nour time, it should not be done at the expense of our Constitution. \nThat is a document we all should revere. We all should stand up and \nprotect it. After all, don't we all give an oath to uphold that sacred \ndocument?\n  As American culture has ebbed and flowed--and it will continue to--\nmorphing into what it is today, it was these founding documents that \nfostered an environment where the voice of the few, not just the many, \ncould be heard.\n  And that is the beauty of our country: a constitutional Republic. So \nmany people want to refer to it as a democracy. A democracy is majority \nrule. A democracy is mob rule. And as Ben Franklin was often quoted:\n\n       Democracy is the same as two wolves and a sheep deciding \n     what to have for lunch.\n\n  As we know, in that story, the sheep always loses. So that is why it \nis so important, because a constitutional Republic protects the rights \nof the minority, of all people.\n  American culture, as I said, has ebbed and flowed over the period of \ntime and it is morphing and will continue to morph. They have allowed \nfor the people to dictate change, not a man who likes to remind the \nAmerican people that he believes he can rewrite our history and, \nthrough the use of his phone and a pen, direct executive agencies to \nact with disregard to the voice of the people. A pen and a phone are \nnot a replacement for the legislative body. And it is the Senate's \nchore to pick that person.\n  Take, for example, a vital case about to be argued before the Supreme \nCourt next week: United States v. Texas. To some, this may seem like a \nsimple anti-immigration or, in some cases, a pro-immigration case. But \nat its core, it is not about whether or not you are anti- or pro-\nimmigration. It is about whether or not the Supreme Court will allow \nthe executive branch to circumvent Congress and legislate from the Oval \nOffice rather than through Capitol Hill, the way it was intended by our \nFounders.\n\n[[Page H1719]]\n\n  I believe the Constitution is clear on this issue, but I also believe \nany Justice who does not have a deep appreciation for the Constitution, \nas the late Justice Scalia did, would disagree with me. Therein lies \nthe danger: any Justice who is willing to tip the scale in the balance \nof power in favor of a runaway Presidential office.\n  And it is not just this administration. It could be any in the \nfuture. And that is why this is so important. This crosses party lines. \nIt is a political ideology that I would argue threatens the very fabric \nof the foundation and the founding of our Nation.\n  Congress cannot allow itself to cave and settle for a Justice that \nwould be complacent in the destruction of the Constitution and \nultimately the destruction of the great American experiment.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  I challenge the President to get serious with this nomination and put \nforth the name of a Justice that will uphold the constitutional \nprinciples and not legislate from the bench.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to hold steadfast \nand not allow themselves to be persuaded by public opinion, public \npressure, and by those who will try to pressure them to vote for any \nnominee who will do the American legacy and the American people an \ninjustice by undermining the Constitution from the highest court in \nthis great Nation.\n  This discussion is so important. The very fabric of this discussion \nand the very basis of this discussion is about the preservation of this \ninstitution. That is what this is about.\n  If you look at a timeline of human history and you look at the \nAmerican experiment, it is but a dot on that period of time, but it has \ncreated the greatest country in the world. The reason that has been \nallowed is because of the Constitution.\n  Again, those ideologies aren't Republican; they are not Democrat. \nThey are American ideologies so that we will all benefit. And we all \nhave a hand to preserve those. We can have our differences, but this is \none thing we shouldn't differ on, and this is for the posterity of all \nAmericans: conservatives, liberals, White, Black, anybody else.\n  This is something we stand strong on, and I appreciate the gentleman \nfrom Iowa, my colleague and mentor, Mr. King, for bringing this up. I \nthank you for continuing the fight and bringing this out to the \nAmerican people. This is important.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Reclaiming my time and thanking very much the \ngentleman from Florida for the compliments and the input here, too.\n  I learned something in this discussion and listening to Mr. Yoho from \nFlorida, and that is, when he spoke of divine intervention in our \nConstitution, the answer required divine intervention because men just \naren't that smart.\n  I hadn't heard that expression in this town or anyplace. That \nexplains it in a lot of ways. I have long said that I believe that the \nDeclaration of Independence and the Constitution are written with \ndivine guidance.\n  I choose those terms because the Bible was written with divine \nintervention and divine inspiration. That is up here. Divine guidance \nis just a little click below that. I don't want to claim Biblical \nstandards, but it is really close. We would not have this country if it \nwere not for God's guidance of our Founding Fathers, and so I tuned my \near to that.\n  I would say also, whose advice should the Senators listen to on the \nother side?\n  Well, they should listen to Ted Yoho's advice. I hope they are \nlistening to my advice, Mr. Speaker. But those on the Republican side \nof the aisle, they are pretty solid.\n  I want to publicly and personally thank my friend, whom I appreciate \nand respect a lot, Jerry Moran, who has been in a difficult place in \nKansas. He is a terrific friend, and I served with him here in the \nHouse of Representatives. His position is shored up in opposition to \nhaving hearings in the Judiciary Committee and trying to move this. I \nthink the reconsideration that he has done is a good thing, and I hope \nthe people of Kansas understand and appreciate Jerry Moran in the \nfashion that I do as well.\n  I would suggest that maybe Jerry Moran and some of the Democrat \nSenators, in particular, may have been listening to this advice, Mr. \nSpeaker. This would be advice from the Vice President himself, Joe \nBiden, advice that he gave on June 25, 1992. So it has sustained the \ntest of time in this fashion. It is called the Biden Rule. Quote, from \nVice President Joe Biden:\n\n       It is my view that if a Supreme Court Justice resigns \n     tomorrow, or within the next several weeks, or resigns at the \n     end of the summer, President Bush should consider following \n     the practice of a majority of his predecessors and not--\n     repeats it--and not name a nominee until after the November \n     election is completed.\n\n  That is Joe Biden, and, at that time, he was the chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Speaker. Again, that was June 25, 1992. \nWe are only a couple of months away in proportion to that in this \nperiod of time.\n  So if our friends over on the Senate side are not listening to the \nVice President, I would suggest they might listen to the Senate \nminority leader, Harry Reid, the former majority leader in the Senate.\n  This is Harry Reid's statement made in 2005. You will note that this \nwas back when George W. Bush was President. Harry Reid, minority leader \ntoday in the Senate:\n\n       The duties of the United States Senate are set forth in the \n     Constitution of the United States. Nowhere in that document \n     does it say that the Senate has a duty to give Presidential \n     nominees a vote. It says appointments shall be made with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate. That is very different than \n     saying every nominee receives a vote . . . The Senate is not \n     a rubber stamp for the executive branch.\n\n  That is Harry Reid, 2005.\n  Both of those gentlemen, I would say today, would argue against their \nprevious arguments. I am reinforcing their arguments today on the floor \nof the House of Representatives.\n  We are not finished, Mr. Speaker. Who is another strong, influential \nvoice over there in the Senate Judiciary Committee?\n  Senator Schumer of New York. He wanted to block the Bush nominees, \nand here is what he had to say. He said:\n\n       We should not confirm any Bush nominee to the Supreme Court \n     except in extraordinary circumstances.\n\n  Senator Schumer cited ideological reasons for the delay, and I begin \nanother quote:\n\n       They must prove by actions, not words, that they are in the \n     mainstream, rather than we have to prove that they are not.\n\n  Well, there is a statement of ambiguity for you, Mr. Speaker, \nrequiring an appointment to the Supreme Court to prove that they are in \nthe mainstream.\n  What is the mainstream? That would be what Chuck Schumer would define \nas the mainstream, depending upon whether or not he supported the \ncandidate that was speaking to present themselves to be in the \nmainstream.\n  I would argue that mainstream is not a requirement for an appointment \nto the Supreme Court. The requirements for the appointment to the \nSupreme Court are determined by the discretion and the judgment of the \nconfirming Senators over on the other side of this Capitol Building, \nand they should be obligated to only confirm Justices who interpret the \nConstitution to mean what it says.\n  To mean what it says. Is that too much to ask? Why, then, do we have \na Constitution if it can't mean what it says?\n  Senator Schumer wasn't done, however. He argued again in 2007:\n\n       We should reverse the presumption of confirmation. The \n     Supreme Court is dangerously out of balance. We cannot afford \n     to see Justice Stevens replaced by another Roberts, or a \n     Justice Ginsburg by another Alito.\n\n  That was 2007.\n  Well, I think the Supreme Court is dangerously out of balance \nprecisely because of the Justices that Senator Schumer supports and \nbecause there are not enough Justices on the Supreme Court that he has \nopposed, because I believe that the Justices need to reflect and \nprotect the text and the original understanding of the Constitution.\n  Every Founding Father believed that as well when they went to their \ngrave; and they would be rolling over in it if they saw a Supreme Court \nthat was writing law on one day, manufacturing commands the next day, \nand now hearing an argument that the President of the United States has \na right to his appointment to the Supreme Court, no\n\n[[Page H1720]]\n\nmatter what kind of activist he might serve up, that is going to visit \nupon the American people, for at least the next generation, decisions \nthat usurp the authority of the United States House of Representatives \nand the United States Senate and commandeer the legislative authority \naway from Article I and commandeer some kind of authority to \nmanufacture commands, as they did last June.\n  Then, we are not done yet. In case this argument isn't strong enough \nat this point, Mr. Speaker, here is another.\n  The very individual that made the appointment to the Supreme Court, \nthat would be then-Senator Barack Obama, now President Obama, he \nfilibustered the Alito appointment--the Alito nomination. Excuse me.\n  Here is what then-Senator Obama argued in 2006. Well, they say this \nnow. This is his spokesman today: ``President Obama regrets \nfilibustering the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in \n2006''--this is from his top spokesman who said, just a week or so ago, \n``though he maintains that the Republican opposition to his effort to \nreplace Justice Antonin Scalia is unprecedented.''\n  No, the President of the United States' opposition to Justice Alito \nwas unprecedented, not the opposition created here by Chairman Grassley \nor Majority Leader McConnell and almost every Republican over there in \nthe United States Senate; and I don't know any Republicans in the House \nwho think they ought to move this appointment now.\n  So, here are some other positions along the way, Mr. Speaker, \nregarding Senator Grassley's comments. Senator Grassley made some \nstrong positions on the floor of the Senate a little over a week ago, \nand they were published in Politico, as I recall, where it would be \nthis. The Supreme Court has weighed in on this nomination, and that \nwould be Chief Justice Roberts has intervened and made comments in this \nway: that before Scalia had passed away, he argued that the \nconfirmation process is not functioning very well, that it has gotten \ntoo political.\n  I was very proud of Senator Grassley when he stepped up on the floor \nof the Senate and rebutted that argument and he made the case that, no, \nthe confirmation process in the United States Senate has gotten \npolitical precisely because the Court itself is making political \ndecisions rather than decisions based upon the law and the supreme law \nof the land, the Constitution.\n  So when you see political decisions come out of the Court--and those \ndecisions, I have described some of them; there are many others--that \nmeans that the confirmation process itself is political.\n  And when I sat before the Supreme Court and heard the oral arguments \nbefore the Court--and I hope to do that again next week--I was amazed. \nI expected that I would hear profound constitutional arguments before \nthe United States Supreme Court. I mean, I grew up, I guess, naively \nbelieving that those were the arguments made before that Court. I think \nthe Warren Court had already turned that thing in the other direction, \nand I didn't realize it.\n  But when I first sat before the United States Supreme Court and \nlistened for those arguments, thinking it was going to be an amazing \neducational experience for me, what I found was there weren't any \nprofound constitutional arguments made. Those arguments, instead, were \nbeing made to the swing Justice on the Court to try to get to that \nindividual's heart, because they understood the various proclivities in \nthe thinking and the rationale that might come. They went back and \nlooked at the lives, the lifestyle, the history of the Justices and \nwondered what moves their heart rather than what moves their rationale. \nWe should only have Justices whose rationale is moved by constitutional \narguments before the Court.\n  Let's see. Who else do I have?\n  President Obama, who made the argument that he wants appointments to \nthe Supreme Court who have--what is the word?--compassion, empathy. \nPresident Obama's word is ``empathy.''\n  We are not looking for empathy on the Supreme Court. We are looking \nfor Justices that can rule on the letter and the text and the original \nmeaning and understanding of the Constitution, and the letter and text \nof the law here in Congress that we passed.\n  And, yes, they can take into consideration congressional intent, but \nthey can't amend the language. If the language says one thing, they \ndon't get to add words to it. They should ship it back over here and \ntell us what they have interpreted that it said, and then the Congress \ncan decide whether or not we want to act.\n  We take an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That doesn't \nmean we are bound by a decision of the Supreme Court that turns the \nConstitution on its head.\n  So this fight that is going on in the Supreme Court with the \nnomination to the Court now is one that will turn the destiny of the \nUnited States of America.\n  Depending on who ends up as the next President of the United States, \nI have every confidence that Senator Grassley holds his ground, that \nthere will not be hearings before the United States Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, that the Senate prerogative will prevail, and that the \npeople will go to the polls in November and elect a President. Part of \nthat decision will be: Will that President make the right appointment \nto the Supreme Court?\n  In the meantime, Chuck Grassley, the man who is now the chairman of \nthe committee, stands in the gap in the same way that Leonidas stood \nagainst Xerxes at the Battle of Thermopylae when he led the 300 to \nstand in that gap and face 300,000 Persians. He is holding his ground. \nHe is holding his ground nobly. He is holding it with conviction. He is \nholding it with determination. And we need to stand with him, beside \nhim, and behind him in every way that we can and understand that this \nis a political assault that is going at him.\n  We should reward him for his convictions by electing a President who \nwill make that appointment to the Supreme Court who reflects the will \nof the people. And the will of the people, I trust, will still want to \nsee an appointment to the Supreme Court of a Justice who would stand up \nand say this Constitution means what it says.\n  The text of this Constitution has to mean what it says, and it has to \nbe interpreted to mean that which it was understood to mean at the time \nof its ratification. And if you don't like what it does for our policy, \nthen get to work and amend the Constitution. That is why that provision \nis there. That is why we have the amendments to the Constitution today.\n  So I thank Senator Grassley for his strong stand. I thank Mitch \nMcConnell for his leadership in the Senate. I thank everyone over there \nwho holds their ground, and everyone here in this Congress who takes an \noath to support and defend the Constitution and means it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1720-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1720-H1728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1730\n                           FORCED ARBITRATION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials related to the subject of this Special \nOrder, which is forced arbitration\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it has been very thought-\nprovoking to listen to the comments and observations of my good friend, \nSteve King from Iowa, and my other good friend, Representative Ted Yoho \nfrom Florida.\n  It is always good to hear the impressions of laypersons about the \nlaw. I say that not in a condescending way because I know that my good \nfriend, Steve King, is a successful businessman, construction, and he \nknows all about the business, and my friend, Ted Yoho, is an esteemed \ndoctor of veterinary medicine.\n  So being a lawyer myself by training, it is good for me to hear the \nimpressions and observations of laypersons. I\n\n[[Page H1721]]\n\nsay that in a noncondescending way. So I thank the gentleman from Iowa, \nRepresentative King, for holding it down for us for that last hour.\n  The preamble to the U.S. Constitution, which is the introductory \nstatement setting forth the general principles of our American \ngovernment, reads: ``We the people of the United States, in Order to \nform a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \nTranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general \nWelfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our \nPosterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United \nStates of America.''\n  I want to just put a bookmark right where it says ``establish \nJustice.'' It says that right after it says ``in Order to form a more \nperfect Union, establish Justice.''\n  So justice was something that was foremost in the minds of the \nFramers of our Constitution who, I believe, just as Steve King said, \nwere divinely inspired in their deliberations and their decisionmaking \nin terms of our Constitution.\n  They were focused on the delivery of justice. They realized that \njustice was key. With that ideal, they established in Article III a \ncourt system, the judicial power and the framework for the court \nsystem. The judiciary, of course, is a coequal branch of government.\n  The courts, since the inception of this country, have served as a \ncheck and a balance on the excesses of the other branches of government \nwhile at the same time dispensing justice to individuals who are found \nto have violated the law or who have been aggrieved by the misconduct \nof someone else and, so, they come to court seeking justice. So justice \nis the business of the court system, and the court system's business is \nto render justice.\n  Now what is that word, justice? What does it mean? It is the \nmaintenance or administration of what is just by law, as by judicial or \nother proceedings, in a court. Justice is the judgment of persons or \ncauses by a judicial process to administer justice in a community. That \nis what justice is all about, and that is what courts do.\n  People bring to the court of justice their causes of action so that \nthey can receive justice in the courts. The courts are set up with a \nset of procedures, rules, as to how you proceed in court. And then \nthere are substantive laws upon which the court looks to the precedent \nthat has been set and decides cases brought to it in accordance with \nthose precedents.\n  Sometimes it must make new precedent, it must make new law, and it is \ndone in accordance with the constitutional principles that have been \nlaid out by our Framers. So this legal system has worked well. This \nlegal system of trial by jury has worked very well.\n  In addition to maintaining order through the criminal laws, the civil \nlaws have enabled people to achieve justice when they have been \nwronged, including wronged by corporations.\n  Companies don't like being brought to the bar of justice to be held \naccountable for wrongdoing. We know that corporations are powerful \nentities. They have more money than the average person. They are more \npowerful.\n  So the way to equalize the power of just an individual against a \ncorporation that he or she has accused of wrongdoing--the equalizing \nfactor has always been the jury system, a jury of one's peers.\n  That is what people have relied upon to address grievances, \nparticularly with powers that are more powerful than they. They know \nthat a jury of their peers is a mechanism whereby the truth can be \nfound and that justice can be rendered.\n  So going to court and having a jury trial when a person is aggrieved \nis a part of the fundamental fabric of this Nation. That is how we have \ndone business for so long.\n  It used to be before we had TV and radio that people would go down to \nthe town square where the courthouse was always located and they would \ntake the afternoon and they would go into the courtroom. They would \nhave a calendar. They would know what cases were being heard.\n  It was a published calendar, and everybody knew that a certain lawyer \nwould be in town to try a case. They would make their schedule such \nthat they could go down and see that proceeding. It would be an open \ncourt. Nobody would be excluded. Everybody would know in advance what \nwas going to happen.\n  You could sit there and watch the adversary process take place. You \nwould see a judge seated, such as the Speaker is seated in this \nChamber. That would be the person who would decide what laws were \napplicable. The jury would be to his or her left or right, and the \njudge would instruct them on the law.\n  After they have heard all of the evidence from the attorneys in that \nadversary process, the judge would instruct the jury on the law and \ncharge the jury to find the facts in its own wisdom and apply justice.\n  The plaintiff would either win or lose, and the people would be in \nthe courtroom watching the proceedings. And then, whatever happened \neveryone would have to live with.\n  Sometimes the plaintiff won. Sometimes the defense won. That is the \nway that it has always been in this country up until pretty recently.\n  Over the last 30 years or so, we have had an erosion of that process. \nThe rich and powerful corporations have conspired to find ways that \nthey can avoid being held accountable for the misdoings that they would \nbe charged with committing by a regular person.\n  Let's face it, ladies and gentlemen. Corporations are just like \npeople. People do wrong and, when they do wrong, you have to have some \nway of making them do right, of making it right. That is what the \ncourts have always been for.\n  These corporations have gotten so powerful that they have come up \nwith a way of privatizing the justice system. They have come up with a \ndispute resolution mechanism, which is not inherently bad, but it is \nbeing forced on people. That is the dispute resolution process known as \narbitration.\n\n  Arbitration is a great alternative dispute resolution process when it \nis decided upon by the parties after a dispute has arisen.\n  But to bind a party to have to resolve a dispute in the arbitration \nsetting as opposed to being able to exercise your Seventh \nConstitutional Amendment right to a jury trial and binding yourself, to \nhave to go through an arbitration process, this is the scheme that has \nbeen hatched by the corporate interests who don't want to be held \naccountable in court.\n  So what they have done is inserted these forced arbitration clauses \ninto agreements that they have with consumers.\n  So any kind of consumer agreement, for the most part nowadays, has a \nforced arbitration clause in it which requires that, in the event a \ndispute arises, the parties will settle that dispute not in a court of \nlaw, but in an arbitration proceeding.\n  Now, arbitration proceedings, unlike the courthouse, are done in \nprivate. There is no calendar that is published, and the people are not \ninvited to come in. It is a secret proceeding.\n  It is a proceeding where, instead of having a judge trained in the \nlaw, you have got the possibility of having a layperson deciding the \ncase. And that layperson may not be impartial.\n  That person may be making their living from getting referrals from \nthe corporations to decide the arbitration cases that come before them. \nSo it is an unfair process. It is a secret process.\n  The rules of procedure that are followed and required in a court are \nnot required in an arbitration process nor are the substantive laws \nupon which cases are decided on precedent.\n  There is no requirement that the substantive law be used by the \narbitrator in making the decision. Of course, there is no jury trial. \nThere is no trial by a jury of one's peers.\n  So it is a very unfair setting, and it produces results that favor \nthe corporations. This is what we are here to talk about today, this \nunfair, privatized secret system of justice that deprives people of \nhaving their day in court.\n  It is unaccountable. It is unaccountable to anyone other than to the \ncorporate bosses that refer the cases to them. It is very unfair to the \nconsumer, to the little guy.\n  So having said all of that, I yield to the gentleman from the State \nof Pennsylvania, Matt Cartwright, my friend, a distinguished trial \nattorney himself and, also, a member of the Oversight and Government \nReform Committee in this Congress, the ranking member of the Health \nCare, Benefits, and Administrative Rules Subcommittee and,\n\n[[Page H1722]]\n\nalso, a member of the Committee on Natural Resources.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for \nyielding to me and for laying out the problem.\n  I rise proudly to remind my colleagues in this Chamber that what--as \nRepresentative Ted Yoho of Florida just mentioned--what is in the \nConstitution really, really matters. In fact, I credit Ted Yoho for \ncarrying the Constitution with him at all times. I know that he says \nwhat is particularly dear to him in the Constitution is the Bill of \nRights--those first 10 Amendments to the Constitution.\n  And Representative Johnson alluded to it earlier, it is the Seventh \nAmendment that we are talking about right now. If you are scoring at \nhome, the Seventh Amendment is the thing that gives you the right to a \njury trial in a civil case. And I'll quote it: ``In suits at common law \n. . . the right of trial by jury shall be preserved . . .''\n  It is a short sentence, it is unambiguous, it is easy to understand, \nand it is something that makes us Americans--that we can go to court \nand have our disputes settled by a jury trial. It is one of the things \nthat has made this Nation great. It is one of the things that we went \nto war over in the American War of Independence because the British \nking was trying to take that right away from us. In suits of common \nlaw, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.\n  But I am here to say, Mr. Speaker, that there have been attacks on \nthe Seventh Amendment. As Mr. Johnson pointed out so deftly, it is in \nthe last 25 or 30 years that these attacks have come to a crescendo. \nEven in the Supreme Court of the United States now, they are getting so \nsquishy on the Seventh Amendment that they think it is all right--it is \na case called Concepcion from about 5 years ago--it is all right for \ncorporations to have you enter into contracts that do away with your \nSeventh Amendment right to a jury trial in the event of a dispute. This \nis called a pre-dispute forced arbitration clause. It rears its ugly \nhead in all sorts of ways to hurt workers and consumers and homeowners \nand Americans of every stripe.\n  Now, what is wrong with this?\n  What is wrong--and, again, Mr. Johnson of Georgia alluded to this. \nThe main problem is that it is a secret system of justice. It is not \nout in the open. He is right. America has a tradition of open court \nsystems, trials that you can go watch, proceedings of justice that are \nopen and transparent and open to the sunlight so that sneaky things \ndon't happen, things that they would be embarrassed to tell you about \ndon't happen. That is the purifying aspect of sunlight overall, and \nthat is why we treasure our justice system here in the United States.\n  It is the opposite when you talk about forced arbitrations. You are \ntalking about arbitrators who have been selected by who knows who. \nCertainly not elected, certainly not appointed by elected officials. \nAccountable to no one. No one.\n  Is that really who you want deciding your case when you have a \ndispute?\n  Absolutely not.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is something even more insidious about these \nforced arbitration clauses, and that is this. It does away with any \npossibility of a class action.\n  Now, why do we care about that?\n  The ordinary American consumer may never get into a class action or \nknow about one or care about one. But here is what happens.\n  If, for example, your credit card company--when you signed up for \nyour credit card, you signed a boilerplate agreement. There is no way \nyou read through that whole thing, but there was a forced arbitration \nclause in there. It says, in any dispute between us and the consumer, \nthe dispute shall be decided by an arbitration.\n  What that means is that they can do anything they want to you. They \ncan say, this month, in honor of it being April, we are going to charge \neverybody $45 for no reason. Forty-five dollars goes on your bill. If \nyou don't pay it, they start dunning you and hurting your credit \nrecord. They can do that just for fun.\n  What are you going to do? Are you going to go to court over it?\n  No. You are going to join a class action because nobody can afford to \nhire a lawyer where $45 is the amount in controversy. That is why we \nhave class actions, so the corporations don't get away with that monkey \nbusiness.\n  In forced arbitration clauses, that precludes any possibility of \ngoing to court and, thereby, it precludes any possibility of a class \naction. That means a lot of wrong can happen in this country at the \nhands of unaccountable corporations. They can get away with it because \nthere is no chance of a class action.\n  Well, I am here to raise my voice in support of something Mr. Johnson \nfrom Georgia has done. He has written something called the Arbitration \nFairness Act, which remedies much of what I am talking about.\n  I am also here to stand up and add my voice in support of things that \nthe administration has done: executive orders, either already done or \nin the works, in the Department of Education to combat forced \narbitrations against for-profit universities; in the Department of \nDefense to combat actions of predatory lenders against our armed \nservice men and women and our veterans; executive orders in the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau to combat arbitration clauses such \nas the one I discussed about a credit card company; executive orders by \nthe CMS, Center for Medicare Services, to combat abuses in arbitration \nclauses in nursing homes so that you wouldn't be able to bring a court \ncase against a nursing home because you signed on the dotted line when \nyou put mom or dad in the home so no matter what they do to mom or dad, \nyou can't go to court, you have to go to arbitration. CMS is working on \nan executive order to curb that abuse.\n  An executive order in the Department of Labor to enforce rules and \nlaws about safe work places and fair pay to prevent these forced \narbitration clauses from taking these cases out of the sunlight and \ninto the dark back rooms of the arbitrations where goodness knows what \nis going to happen, and it is probably not justice.\n  We have a statue of Thomas Jefferson right outside these chambers, \nMr. Speaker. Thomas Jefferson said: ``I consider trial by jury as the \nonly anchor yet imagined by man, by which a government can be held to \nthe principles of its Constitution.''\n  We need to honor those words of Thomas Jefferson, we need to honor \nthe Seventh Amendment, we need to support Mr. Johnson in his \nArbitration Fairness Act, and we need to support the administration \nwith executive orders fighting these unfair and nontransparent \nmandatory forced arbitration clauses.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative \nCartwright.\n  It is amazing that when you are standing across the yard with the \nfence in between you and your neighbor and you are telling your \nneighbor about that great day of fishing that you had and you are \ntelling him about this fish that was that long, you can do as much \nlying about the length of that fish--sometimes you didn't even catch a \nfish--and it is okay to lie to your neighbor.\n  But it is different when you go downtown and go to the courthouse \nbecause at the courthouse you are going to testify, you are testifying \nunder oath, subject to being held accountable for perjury if you lie.\n\n  But it is amazing that in a forced arbitration proceeding, there is \nabsolutely no requirement that you be administered, or that a witness \nbe administered an oath before they are allowed to testify. So, \ntherefore, in an arbitration proceeding, the lever of perjury to force \nsomeone to tell the truth is not there and it hurts the pursuit of \njustice.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Cartwright for his testimony and his \nstatements today.\n  I would point out that last year, the New York Times published an \nexhaustive and in-depth investigative series that pulled back the \ncurtain and catalogued the immense harms of forced arbitration. In part \n1 of the series, which was entitled ``Arbitration Everywhere, Stacking \nthe Deck of Justice,'' the Times explored the rise and dramatic spread \nof forced arbitration clauses, their impact on American workers, \nconsumers, and on patients. This investigation found that corporations \ncrippled the consumer challenges\n\n[[Page H1723]]\n\nacross a wide swath of harmful practices simply by banning class action \nlitigation.\n  Furthermore, once corporations have blocked individuals from going to \ncourt as a class, the investigation found that most people simply \ndropped their claims entirely.\n  Why?\n  Because the amount in controversy was so small that it was not cost \neffective to hire a lawyer to go to court to recover such a small \namount. The net result is that the corporate wrongdoers have escaped \nbeing held accountable because of these forced arbitration clauses, \nwhich equates to a ban on participating in class action litigation and, \nin some of those clauses, they had the words in there about class \nactions being bought.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Linda T. \nSanchez), my friend, who serves on the Ways and Means Committee. She is \na former labor lawyer. She has had an interest in this issue of \narbitration, forced arbitration, for a couple of sessions of Congress. \nShe has introduced legislation that would outlaw forced arbitration \nagreements in nursing home contracts--you know, where we go to take our \nloved ones who have to be committed to a nursing home and we have no \nchoice but to sign the contract which has the arbitration clause in it \nbecause all of the other nursing homes have the arbitration clause in \nthem as well. Representative Sanchez has filed legislation that would \nget at that very unfair process.\n  Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Johnson.\n  I rise today to join Mr. Johnson and Mr. Cartwright in bringing \nattention to the very unfair and deplorable practice of forcing people \ninto arbitration.\n  In practice, what this consists of is generally those with more \npower, meaning very wealthy corporations, including confusing but \nlegally binding language buried in the fine print of contracts, \ncontracts that pretty much purveyed every aspect of our lives. This \ncreates this insidious process in which people, in order to get a \ncredit card or a cell phone or to put a loved one into a nursing home, \nhave to accept the terms of this contract without really knowing what \nthey are buying into.\n  I want to start by saying that the concept of arbitration is a great \none. I strongly support the principles of arbitration and the \narbitration process because arbitration can do many good things. It can \nclear court dockets, it can help provide a more swift resolution to a \nproblem, and it can also reduce legal fees. Those are the benefits of a \nfair arbitration process. In many ways arbitration can be a great \nthing.\n  But--and this is the thing--people think that arbitration is this \nwonderful process. But what they don't realize is that buried in that \nfine print in forced arbitration, there can also be terms that limit \nthe evidence that you can introduce. If you are forced into \narbitration, there can be limits on the damages that you can claim. It \ncan exclude your ability to request a jury trial. And mandatory binding \narbitration has to be entered willingly by both parties, not just the \nparty with the greater economic power. But, in fact, they know that \nthey hold that leverage over the average consumer so they put this kind \nof limiting language into these arbitration clauses all the time.\n  Many retailers, banks, and online services have forced arbitration \nclauses written into their contracts. These arbitration agreements can \nbe forced on vulnerable parties who have little knowledge about what \nthey are signing or what it means to sign away those rights. Frankly, \nmost consumers have little or no choice in the matter because the \ncontracts are ``take it or leave it.''\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Why does this hit so close to home?\n  My father has Alzheimer's, and at a certain point, he could not care \nfor himself anymore, so we had to investigate nursing homes that could \nprovide the kind of around-the-clock care that was required for him \nthat my brothers and sisters and I simply could not.\n  Sadly, in the nursing home arena, this is where, oftentimes, \nmandatory--forced--arbitration clauses are buried in these contracts \nfor the admission of your loved one. Loved ones who cannot care for \nsomebody who is physically ill or frail, again, have no real choice in \nthe matter. They need to find facilities to care for their loved ones \nbecause they, simply, cannot do it on their own.\n  That is why, in Congresses past, I introduced the Fairness in Nursing \nHome Arbitration Act. That legislation would make predispute mandatory \narbitration clauses in long-term care contracts unenforceable, and it \nwould restore residents and their families their full legal rights. \nWhat the legislation would do is say that you cannot force arbitration \nonto families who, in an emotional time and in a medical crisis, are \nlooking for care for their loved ones. You cannot force them to sign \nsomething that they don't agree with or even understand. My bill would \nhave allowed families and residents to have maintained their peace of \nmind as they looked for the best long-term care facilities for their \nloved ones.\n  For desperate families who are unable to provide the adequate care at \nhome, the need for an immediate placement for their loved ones makes \nthese contracts, basically, take it or leave it, which gives them no \nchoice at all in the matter. Families who are in the midst of these \npainful decisions to place a parent or a loved one in a nursing home \nrarely have the time or the wherewithal to fully and thoughtfully \nconsider what it is they are signing when they sign a contract that \ncontains a mandatory arbitration clause. They are not in a position to \nadequately determine what agreeing to such a clause will mean for their \nloved ones should the unthinkable happen.\n  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, CMS, is slowly working \nto include some of my bill's provisions through the regulatory process, \nbut much work still remains in this area. In September of last year, \nDemocrats sent a letter to CMS and called for a final rule that will \nensure that nursing home residents will only enter into arbitration \nagreements on a voluntary and enforced basis after a dispute arises, \nnot before.\n  We need commonsense solutions to forced arbitration agreements, \nsolutions that would protect the average consumer, who is unfamiliar \nwith the concept of arbitration and is not trained in the law. Many \npeople may not even be aware of the rights they are signing away at a \ntime when they are least prepared to make important decisions. As \nMembers of Congress, we are called on to serve our constituents and to \nprotect them from flagrant violations of their rights. We should be \ndoing more to protect vulnerable families from these forced arbitration \npolicies.\n  I thank my colleague, Mr. Johnson, for being such a strong voice on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I thank the gentlewoman from California.\n  Next, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas, my good friend Sheila \nJackson Lee, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and the ranking \nmember on the Crime Subcommittee. She is also a member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee. She is a lawyer and a former judge.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his \nleadership, along with Mr. Conyers, and for the introduction of a very \nimportant initiative, H.R. 4899.\n  Mr. Speaker, many would think, particularly as we have watched the \nmediation and arbitration process grow as a newly developed practice \namongst lawyers and one that businesses and others have seemed to \nadopt, that that was, in fact, helping consumers by allowing the \nconcept of arbitration to be able to be utilized, thereby, allegedly, \nlowering the costs of litigation.\n  In a 2010 survey, 27 percent of employers, covering over 36 million \nemployees--or one-third of the nonunion workforce--reported that they \nrequired the forced arbitration of employment disputes. The practice of \nforced arbitration is widespread and damaging. For example, the ability \nto obtain key evidence that is necessary to prove one's case is often \nrestricted or eliminated in arbitration proceedings, and it can be \nnearly impossible to appeal adverse decisions by arbitrators.\n  We know that, in the Bill of Rights in the Constitution, there is a \nright to a trial by jury, a jury of one's peers. Therefore, it is a \nsacred right. This new practice had been projected as helping\n\n[[Page H1724]]\n\nthe victim: oh, it will be a low-cost procedure; you will get an \nimmediate decision; you won't have the stress of litigation; you might \nnot even have to hire a lawyer. But, as indicated, the ability to \nobtain key evidence that is necessary to prove one's case is often \nrestricted or eliminated in arbitration proceedings, and it can be \nnearly impossible to appeal adverse decisions by arbitrators.\n  I was one of the first Members to bring attention to this issue when \nI prevailed upon the late Chairman Hyde to authorize the Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Administrative and Commercial Law, when I was the \nranking member, to hold a hearing on that matter involving Carl Poston \nand the NFL Players Association, with Gene Upshaw, then executive \ndirector, in the LaVar Arrington case. You may recall the LaVar \nArrington case as being of the former Washington Redskins football \nplayer who was forced into arbitration in order to resolve a contract \ndispute.\n  Forced arbitration of State and Federal employment discrimination \nlaws is also harmful to women workers. In 2015, nearly 64,000 \ndiscrimination claims were filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission under title VII, and more than 41 percent of those charges \nwere for sex-based discrimination. Sex-based discrimination, including \nsexual harassment, remains a persistent problem for women in the \nworkplace. Nearly 83 percent of sexual harassment charges that are \nfiled with the EEOC are filed by women. Just imagine that mandatory \narbitration of claims under State or Federal family and medical leave \nlaws could have a disproportionate impact on women as well.\n  I am pleased that this legislation was introduced, because it is a \nlegislative initiative to restore rights. The bill is rightly named the \nRestoring Statutory Rights Act. It is also, I believe, the restoration \nof constitutional rights. Let me quickly tell you of the case of \nStephanie Sutherland, which illustrates the difficulties of this forced \narbitration.\n  Stephanie was hired by her company to work as a staff assistant. Her \nwork involved relatively routine, low-level clerical work for which she \nwas paid a fixed salary of $55,000. She routinely worked 45 to 50 hours \nper week, but because she was classified by her employer as exempt from \novertime, she did not receive any additional compensation. By the time \nMs. Sutherland was terminated in 2009, she had worked 151 hours of \novertime for which she should have been paid $1,867 had the Fair Labor \nStandards Act and the New York State labor laws been observed. She \nfiled a class action lawsuit and sought to recover overtime for her \nwork in excess of 40 hours a week and for other current and \nformer nonlicensed staff--one or two staff employees of the firm--who \nworked overtime.\n\n  When Ms. Sutherland was hired, she was given an offer letter that \nalso provided, if an employment-related dispute arises between you and \nthe firm, it will be subject to mandatory mediation. That was what the \ncompany attempted to do--enforce mandatory mediation. In her lawsuit, \nshe attempted to enforce her rights because the Federal Fair Labor \nStandards Act had a provision to expressly permit lawsuits for minimum \nwage. To this end, the lower court was sympathetic to Ms. Sutherland's \narguments. However, the United States Court of Appeals reversed, \nrelying on the 2013 Supreme Court case.\n  Therefore, we do have a conflict in the issue of dealing with \narbitration that is forced. This is the core of why this legislation is \nso very important. I believe that, if parties agree to engage in \nmediation and arbitration, Mr. Speaker, so be it; but if you choose to \nuse the court system that is designed by the Constitution as one of the \nthree branches of government that all Americans should have access to, \nI will make the argument that you should not be forced into arbitration \nor mediation.\n  I believe Mr. Johnson--and I look forward to joining him on his \nlegislation--along with Mr. Conyers, is really lifting up the \nConstitution to ensure that every citizen has access to the courts of \nthis land to help decide their issues of conflict and to choose the \nforum which they desire to use. I thank the gentleman for yielding to \nme, and I look forward to working with him on this very crucial \nconstitutional issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues of the Congressional \nProgressive Caucus to discuss the critical importance of an impartial \nand fair justice system, corporate accountability, consumer and \nemployee protection, as well as the importance of enforcing laws on the \nbooks.\n  I would like to thank Congressman Hank Johnson (D-GA) for his \nleadership in putting forth this Special Order.\n  The practice of forced arbitration is widespread and damaging.\n  In a 2010 survey, 27 percent of employers--covering over 36 million \nemployees, or one-third of the non-union workforce--reported that they \nrequired forced arbitration of employment disputes.\n  Although arbitration can be a valid and effective method of dispute \nresolution when both parties voluntarily agree to arbitrate, forced \narbitration clauses that limit an employee's legal rights in a non-\nnegotiable contract are abusive and erode employees' traditional legal \nsafeguards.\n  For example, the ability to obtain key evidence necessary to prove \none's case is often restricted or eliminated in arbitration \nproceedings, and it can be nearly impossible to appeal adverse \ndecisions by arbitrators.\n  I was one of the first Members to bring attention to this issue when \nI prevailed upon Chairman Hyde to authorize the Judiciary Subcommittee \non Administrative and Commercial Law to hold a hearing on that matter \ninvolving Carl Poston and the NFL Players Association (Gene Uphsaw, \nExecutive Director) in the LeVar Arrington case.\n  You may recall LeVar Arrington as the former Washington Redskins \nfootball player who was forced into arbitration in order to resolve a \ncontract dispute.\n  Forced arbitration of state and federal employment discrimination \nlaws is especially harmful to women workers.\n  In 2015, nearly 64,000 discrimination claims were filed with the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under Title VII, and \nmore than 41 percent of those charges were for sex-based \ndiscrimination.\n  Sex-based discrimination, including sexual harassment, remains a \npersistent problem for women in the workplace.\n  Nearly 83 percent of sexual harassment charges filed with the EEOC \nare filed by women.\n  In a national survey by ABC News and the Washington Post, one in four \nwomen reported experiencing sexual harassment, compared to one in ten \nmen.\n  Mandatory arbitration of claims under state or federal family and \nmedical leave laws could have a disproportionate impact on women as \nwell.\n  Nearly 56 percent of employees who took time away from work to deal \nwith a serious personal or family illness, or to care for a new child \nunder the FMLA in 2012 were women.\n  If my colleagues fail to take necessary action, mandatory arbitration \nwill continue to be a barrier to justice for workers.\n  I am pleased by the action of Mr. Conyers and Mr. Johnson for their \nleadership on Tuesday, Equal Pay Day, for introducing a very important \npiece of legislation that will address these inequities, (H.R. 4899) \nthe Restoring Statutory Rights Act, which I am pleased to be an \noriginal cosponsor of.\n  The Restoring Statutory Rights Act would ensure that when Congress or \nthe states have established rights and protections for individuals, \nincluding protection against wage discrimination, that they are able to \nenforce these rights in court.\n  This bill amends the Federal Arbitration Act to prohibit mandatory \npre-dispute, commonly known as ``forced,'' arbitration agreements for \nclaims rising under federal or state statute, the U.S. Constitution, or \na state constitution.\n  The bill would further require that a court determines whether an \nagreement is unconscionable, legally invalid, or otherwise \nunenforceable as a matter of contract law or public policy.\n  Under current law, parties may resolve statutory claims, including \nclaims rising under anti-discrimination statutes, through forced \narbitration instead of the justice system.\n  This important legislation is a critical step in eliminating \nlongstanding and unacceptable discrimination and barriers imposed on \nwomen and minority.\n  It should be noted that forced arbitration is a private system \ncontrolled by corporations to prevent corporate accountability.\n  Buried in the fine print of countless employment, cell phone, credit \ncard, retirement, and nursing home contracts, forced arbitration \neliminates Americans' access to the courts, tipping the scales of \njustice in favor of corporate wrongdoers.\n  When corporations force arbitration on individuals using \nnonnegotiable and many times unnoticed contract terms, it becomes an \nabusive weapon.\n  Forced arbitration means giving up the most fundamental legal \nprotection: the right to equal justice under the law.\n\n[[Page H1725]]\n\n  For decades, we have fought hard for dozens of laws that protect \nagainst discrimination based on age, sex, religion, race, disability, \nand unequal pay for equal work, such as the Civil Rights Act and the \nEqual Pay Act But these laws are meaningless if unenforceable in court.\n  It's time to close the arbitration loophole that gives employers and \nbusinesses the right to ignore civil rights and consumer protection \nlaws.\n  Although states have tried to address this problem through their \nconsumer protection laws, the courts have interpreted the Federal \nArbitration Act (FAA) to trump state laws leaving consumers very little \nrecourse.\n  Arbitration can be a fair and effective method of dispute resolution \nwhen parties voluntarily agree to arbitrate.\n  When the choice of arbitration is post-dispute--and therefore \nunderstandable and voluntary--it is a fair process that parties choose \nwillingly.\n  I call upon my colleagues to come together and pass legislation that \nwould reinstate workers' ability to enforce their rights in a court of \nlaw and protect the rights of women and minorities.\n  More than 20% of employees are covered by mandatory arbitration \nclauses.\n  Tens of millions of consumers use consumer financial products or \nservices that are subject to pre-dispute arbitration clauses.\n  Federal court statistics show that 17,977 labor claims and 35,965 \ncivil rights claims were filed in 2012.\n  National Arbitration Forum (NAF) arbitrators ruled in favor of \nconsumers in less than 0.2% of all cases (30 out of 18,075) heard.\n  These 30 victories only occurred in hearings where a consumer brought \nclaims against a business; when companies brought claims against \nconsumers, they were successful in hearings 100% of the time. The \nemployee win rate after arbitration was 21.4%, which is lower than \nemployee win rates reported in employment litigation trials (36.4% in \nfederal court and 43.8% in state court).\n  In cases won by employees, the median award amount was $36,500 and \nthe mean was $109,858, both of which are substantially lower than award \namounts reported in employment litigation ($384,223 for federal court \nlitigation and $595,594 in state court litigation.)\n  A 2015 study of federal court employment discrimination litigation by \nTheodore Eisenberg found that the employee win rate has dipped in \nrecent years to an average of only 29.7 percent.\n  At the same time, another 2015 study found that the employee win rate \nin employment arbitration had also dipped in recent years, to an \naverage of only 19.1%; similar dip in employee win rates has occurred \nin state courts.\n  58% settlement rate in federal court employment-discrimination \nlitigation.\n  While recent research on mandatory arbitration found a 63% settlement \nrate across all employment cases in that forum.\n  In court, summary judgment motions were filed in 77% of the court \ncases, while summary judgment motions were raised in 48% of \narbitrations.\n  The win rate was 32% lower in mandatory arbitration than in \nlitigation.\n  Plaintiffs' overall economic outcomes are on average 6.1 times better \nin federal court than in mandatory arbitration ($143,497 versus \n$23,548) and 13.9 times better in state court than in mandatory \narbitration ($328,008 versus $23,548).\n  21.1% of employment cases in mandatory arbitration are brought by \nemployees without legal counsel.\n  Damages from arbitration are 16% of the average damages from federal \ncourt litigation and a mere 7% of the average damages in state court--\nthus lawyers are reluctant to take cases that are subject to mandatory \narbitration.\n  Whereas on average plaintiffs' attorneys accepted 15.8% of potential \ncases involving employees who could go to litigation, they accepted \nabout half as many, 8.1% of the potential cases of employees covered by \nmandatory arbitration.\n  The first time an employer appeared before an arbitrator, the \nemployee had a 17.9% chance of winning, but after the employer had four \ncases before the same arbitrator the employee's chance of winning \ndropped to 15.3%, and after 25 cases before the same arbitrator the \nemployee's chance of winning dropped to only 4.5%.\n  The study results provide strong evidence of a repeat employer effect \nin which employee win rates and award amounts are significantly lower \nwhere the employer is involved in multiple arbitration cases where the \nsame arbitrator is involved in more than one case with the same \nemployer, a finding supporting some of the fairness criticisms directed \nat mandatory employment arbitration.\n  In the credit card market, larger bank issuers are more likely to \ninclude arbitration clauses than smaller bank issuers and credit \nunions. As a result, while less than 16% of issuers include such \nclauses in their consumer credit card contracts, just over 50% of \ncredit card loans outstanding are subject to forced arbitration \nclauses.\n  In the checking account market, which is less concentrated than the \ncredit card market, around 8% of banks, covering 44% of insured \ndeposits, include arbitration clauses in their checking account \ncontracts.\n  40% of the arbitration filings involved a dispute over the amount of \ndebt a consumer allegedly owed to a company, with no additional \naffirmative claim by either party. In another 29% of the filings, \nconsumers disputed alleged debts, but also brought affirmative claims \nagainst companies.\n  The average disputed debt amount was nearly $16,000. The median was \nroughly $11,000. Across all six product markets, about eight cases a \nyear involved disputed debts of $1,000 or less.\n  Overall, consumers were represented by counsel in roughly 60% of the \ncases, though there were some variations by product. Companies almost \nalways had counsel.\n  Of the 1,060 arbitration cases filed in 2010 and 2011, so far as we \ncould determine, arbitrators issued decisions in just under 33%.\n  In approximately 25%, the record reflects that the parties reached a \nsettlement. The remaining cases ended in an unknown manner or were \ntechnically pending but dormant as of early 2013.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for her \ntremendous, informative presentation, which is all based \nconstitutionally as the great lawyer that she is.\n  Next, Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from \nMassachusetts, Joe Kennedy, who is an esteemed member of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank Congressman Johnson. I am honored to be here \nwith the gentleman, and I thank him for his leadership on this \nimportant issue.\n  I thank, of course, Ranking Member Conyers, who has for so long been \na guiding light in our party on issues of justice.\n  Congressman, you and Mr. Conyers together have been this Chamber's \nchampions on civil rights and equality in our justice system. You are, \nonce again, leading the fight as we call for reforms to an unjust and \nunequal arbitration system. I am grateful, and I thank you for your \nleadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, at the foundation of our democracy is one simple \npromise: no matter who you are or where you come from or what you have \ndone, you will be seen as equal before the law.\n  Thomas Jefferson, himself, wrote centuries ago:\n\n       The most sacred duties of government is to do equal and \n     impartial justice to all citizens.\n\n  Forced arbitration, Mr. Speaker, is an affront to that duty--a \nmanipulation of the justice system that tips our scales in the \ndirection of influence, money, and power. It removes even the slightest \nveneer of fair treatment in cases ranging from sexual harassment and \ndiscrimination to loss of housing and shelter, to neglect and abuse \ninside substance abuse treatment centers and retirement homes.\n  When a plaintiff sits at an arbitration table across from a powerful \ncorporation to challenge a fraudulent charge or to question its \npractices, the protections that we have spent centuries instilling in \nour justice system get washed away. There is no judge, no jury, no \navenue for appeal. There is no justice at that table.\n  At the very moment you need to access our courtrooms most, you find \nyourself locked out, diverted to a room outside the scope of our \njudicial system and beyond the bounds of our laws. Without your choice \nor sometimes even knowledge, forced arbitration transforms a level \nplaying field into an uphill climb. At that point, most Americans turn \naround; but for the few who muster the will or the resources to \ncontinue their cases, there is no guarantee to counsel, forcing them to \nface off against some of the most experienced legal minds in our \ncountry completely on their own.\n  The Arbitration Fairness Act would help remedy this profound \nshortcoming in our justice system and ensure that equal access to legal \nprotection doesn't come along with a price tag. Mr. Speaker, that is \none of the most fundamental promises we make in our country. I am \ngrateful to Mr. Johnson for his leadership on the issue.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for \nhis wise words.\n  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I congratulate the writers of The New York\n\n[[Page H1726]]\n\nTimes' expose, a three-part series on forced arbitration. The second \npart of the series examined the secretive nature of forced arbitration, \nand the third part of that series talked about the forced arbitration \nin the context of binding persons to arbitrate secular claims in \nreligious tribunals, applying religious law.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  I would strongly encourage those who are interested in this subject \nto look to The New York Times article because it gives you a good \nunderstanding of where we are as far as forced arbitration is \nconcerned. I applaud the reporters for their groundbreaking work in \nwriting that series and producing it.\n  Jessica Silver-Greenberg, Michael Corkery, and Robert Gebeloff have \ndone yeoman's work. They have exposed a threat to the justice system \nthat shakes the tenets of our very democracy to its core. They deserve \nthe highest commendation that I can give them, and that is just simply \na shout-out from the well of the House.\n  I understand that the Pulitzer Prizes for journalism will be \nannounced this coming Monday. If I could nominate this series, I would \ncertainly do so. I certainly support their nomination for that award.\n  Next, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. \nCicilline), my good friend, the former mayor of Providence, Rhode \nIsland, a lawyer in his own right, a member of the Judiciary Committee \nupon which I also serve and, also, a member of the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I \nwant to particularly thank the gentleman for his extraordinary \nleadership on this very important issue of forced arbitration, which is \ndenying many, many Americans the right to have their grievances heard.\n  I want to thank both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Conyers for not only the \nlegislation, but for continuing to raise this issue.\n  As many of my colleagues have said, forced arbitration denies \nindividuals the most basic right to have their grievances heard fairly. \nNo court, no lawyer, no judicial proceedings, all the things that we \nhave over many centuries recognized as essential to the fair and \nimpartial resolution of disputes.\n  But there is an area that I want to speak about in particular where \nforced arbitration, I think, is particularly damaging and particularly \nunfair.\n  In the coming weeks, I will introduce legislation that will protect \nthe rights of our troops to pursue justice in our courts. My \nlegislation will simply clarify the original intent of the Uniformed \nServices Employment Rights Act of 1994, also known as USERRA, and allow \nveterans and servicemembers to have their claims heard in court.\n  This legislation was intended to protect the men and women of the \nArmed Forces from losing their jobs as a result of their service to our \ncountry. It specifically prohibits employment discrimination due to \nmilitary service and guarantees benefits and reemployment rights to \nthose who leave their civilian jobs to serve.\n  However, these rights have rapidly eroded in recent years. Employers \nare requiring their employees to sign forced arbitration agreements \nbarring access to justice for servicemembers. As my colleagues have \ndiscussed this evening, these agreements are often heavily tilted \ntoward the parties who insist upon them.\n  In mandatory arbitration, the employers can select the arbitrator and \nthe location of the forum, and the avenues for appeal are entirely \nclosed off. In many instances, these clauses are imposed by employers \nwithout the knowledge or consent of their employees.\n  While USERRA explicitly prohibits any agreement that limits any right \nor benefit provided under the statute, some Federal courts have \nmisinterpreted the law to exclude procedural rights.\n  As a result, many of the 1.3 million brave men and women who serve in \nour military may return to civilian life without their jobs and without \nthe ability to fully assert their rights in the courts.\n  This includes servicemembers like Javier Rivera, an Army Reservist \nwho was deployed for 6 months only to learn that his job had been \nfilled in his absence. Despite 900 job openings, his former employer \nclaimed that he could not find a single open position for him upon his \nreturn.\n  Under these circumstances, USERRA should have provided some relief. \nAt the bare minimum, it should have guaranteed him the opportunity to \nhave his claim heard in a fair, objective forum. However, because of a \nforced arbitration clause in his contract, he had no access to the \ncourts at all.\n  Denying our servicemembers and veterans this essential right directly \nconflicts with the intent of USERRA. By limiting their access to legal \nrecourse, it represents a direct affront to all who serve in our \nmilitary.\n  Our troops face many potential threats in service to our country. The \nlast thing they should be concerned about is whether they will be able \nto keep their job.\n  A Nation that asks young men and women to defend this country with \ntheir lives should protect them from losing their livelihoods when they \ncome home.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to help preserve \naccess to justice for our servicemembers and veterans and to recognize \nthis is just one very powerful example of what the real damage and the \ngross unfairness of forced arbitration clauses do to millions of \nAmericans.\n  I thank Mr. Johnson again for yielding, for his extraordinary \nleadership on this issue, and for his fight to ensure that all \nAmericans have access to the courts and fair resolutions of their \ngrievances.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, as this Special Order has \npowerfully documented, forced arbitration isn't open, isn't just, and \nisn't fair. Simply put, forced arbitration clauses have become an \nexculpatory mechanism to rig the justice system.\n  Arbitrators don't have to be lawyers. Their decisions are practically \nirreversible. There is no record kept of the proceedings upon which you \ncould appeal. There isn't even a requirement that witness testimony be \ngiven under oath.\n  As The New York Times investigative series illustrated, arbitration \ncan even take place in the offices of the party representing the \ndefendant.\n  There is also overwhelming evidence that forced arbitration creates \nan unaccountable system of winners and losers through what is called a \nrepeat player advantage process that favors corporations over one-time \nparticipants, such as individual workers and consumers.\n  An analysis of employment arbitrations found that workers' odds of \nwinning were significantly diminished in forced arbitration.\n  In 2012, the Center for Responsible Lending likewise reported that \ncompanies with more cases before arbitrators get consistently better \nresults from these same arbitrators. Why? Because they are the ones who \nrefer cases to the arbitrators.\n  The arbitrators want to eat. They know that, if they rule against \nwhoever is referring the cases to them, then that is going to cut short \ntheir ability to feed themselves.\n  And so they rule in favor of the hand that is feeding them, and that \nis arbitrators, who are not even required to be lawyers and who have a \nperverse incentive to favor the repeat business over the consumers or \nthe worker that they will never see again.\n  I am particularly alarmed by the growing number of companies that \nhide forced arbitration clauses outside of the four corners of the \ndocument.\n  For example, General Mills included a forced arbitration clause in \nits privacy policy that bound any consumer who downloaded the company's \ncoupons or participated in its promotions.\n\n  Under its new terms, consumers also waived the right to a trial \nsimply by liking the company's page on Facebook or mentioning the \ncompany on Twitter. Can you imagine giving up your Seventh Amendment \njury trial right on Facebook?\n  It has become an increasingly common practice to use gotcha tactics \nto deceive consumers and employees by providing so-called notice of \nbinding arbitration in brochures, email and memoranda, job application \nforms, signs outside of restaurants binding you--if you set foot in \nthere and consume, binding you to forced arbitration, in-store \napplication kiosks, employee training programs, contests and\n\n[[Page H1727]]\n\ngames associated with company promotions. People have to watch out. \nEven on the side of a cereal box you can waive your right to a jury \ntrial.\n  Just imagine a child finding glass in their cereal, but because the \ncompany prohibited class action litigation through forced arbitration, \nthe child's parents would have to individually not go to court, but go \nto an arbitrator to have their claim adjudicated.\n  What if it affected several thousand children? That same forced \narbitration clause would prevent class litigation to ensure that our \nchildren's food is safe to eat.\n  These are actual cases where someone potentially lost their right to \nhold a company accountable for unlawful conduct in a public courtroom. \nIn all of these cases, we are not even talking about an agreement with \na dotted line.\n  I am reminded of Justice Kagan's dissent in American Express v. \nItalian Colors where she observed that the Federal Arbitration Act was \nnever meant to be a mechanism easily made to block the vindication of \nmeritorious Federal claims and insulate wrongdoers from liability.\n  The tides are turning. Americans are beginning to fight to restore \ntheir right to a jury trial. Policymakers are using every tool \navailable to fix our laws so that corporations can no longer escape \npublic accountability.\n  I thank my colleagues for their participation in this Special Order. \nBefore I close, I want to also thank the Congressional Progressive \nCaucus for their tireless work to advance a progressive agenda of \nequality and opportunity for all.\n  I will close with this observation. The American people would fight \nback if someone came into their home and said: We are going to take \naway your Second Amendment right to bear firearms. They would fight.\n  But when corporations take away their Seventh Amendment right to a \njury trial, they remain mum, but not for much longer.\n  People are standing up. People are tired. They are desiring change. \nThey are angry and realize that they have been taken advantage of.\n  They want to level the playing field, and that is exactly what the \nlegislation that we have introduced in this Congress will accomplish.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, during the congressional debates on \narbitration more than 90 years ago, witnesses testified about the \nbenefit of resolving disputes without judicial intervention. They \nnoted, for example, that when arbitration is properly used, it can help \nparties avoid the uncertainty, delay, and costs of protracted \nlitigation. Their testimony ultimately led Congress to pass the Federal \nArbitration Act of 1925, which empowered courts to enforce arbitration \nagreements.\n  As the use of pre-dispute forced arbitration agreements--especially \nwith respect to consumer transactions and employment agreements--has \nproliferated in recent years, however, it is clear that arbitration is \nnot always beneficial to all parties and it may, in fact, eviscerate \nthe protection of critical federal consumer and civil rights statutes. \nIt is also apparent that the secrecy of arbitration awards can be used \nto hide awareness of wrongdoing by businesses. And, there are serious \nconcerns about whether some arbitrators are indeed neutral.\n  The New York Times, in an excellent three-part series of \ninvestigative articles on the use of forced arbitration agreements \npublished last year, reported that ``clauses buried in tens of millions \nof contracts have deprived Americans of one of their most fundamental \nconstitutional rights: their day in court.'' Based on its exhaustive \ninvestigation of court records and hundreds of interviews with lawyers, \njudges, arbitrators, corporate executives, and plaintiffs, the Times \nfound that arbitration practices are often closed, fail to adhere to \nrules of evidence or even substantive law, and are nearly impossible to \nappeal. The arbitration provisions that prohibit class actions, as the \nTimes reports, are viewd by state judges as virtual `get out of jail \nfree' cards ``because it is nearly impossible for one individual to \ntake on a corporation with vast resources.'' By privatizing the justice \nsystem, arbitration ``bears little resemblance to court'' and has \nbecome an ``alternate system of justice'' for businesses precisely \nbecause it tends to favor them, according to the Times.\n  Nothwithstanding these concerns, the use of pre-dispute forced \narbitration clauses has become virtually ubiquitous. They appear in \ncredit card agreements, car rental agreements, and employee handbooks. \nThey even appear in nursing home agreements when they are signed ``at \nthe time of admission only because the resident or family member does \nnot even notice or understand the arbitration clause, or sign[ed] . . . \nout of fear that otherwise the admission will be jeopardized,'' \naccording to the National Senior Citizens Law Center.\n  Pre-dispute mandatory arbitration agreements do not offer any option \nto reject. Once signed, these agreements force consumers and employees \nto irretrievably waive their right to judicial redress for harms they \nhave suffered, prevent them from availing themselves of any class \naction remedy, and deny them the right to otherwise obtain justice \nunder applicable state and federal law.\n  As a result, millions of consumers and employees across our Nation \nare legally bound by forced arbitration clauses in contracts with \nlittle or no ability to negotiate them.\n  Accordingly, it is time for Congress to reconsider the value of pre-\ndispute mandatory arbitration agreements. We must restore integrity to \nthe arbitration process and limit the enforceability of mandatory \narbitration clauses that provide no opportunity for consumers and \nemployees to opt-out.\n  Congress should not restrict the rights and options of consumers and \nemployees to resolve disputes Rather, arbitration should be one option \namong many to resolve disputes. Legislation that protects consumers and \nemployees is a common-sense solution for all Americans.\n  For example, H.R. 2087, the ``Arbitration Fairness Act,'' is an \nexcellent measure that was introduced by my colleague, Representative \nHenry C. ``Hank'' Johnson, Jr. This bill would make pre-dispute \narbitration agreements unenforceable in employee, consumer, civil \nrights, and antitrust disputes. Importantly, H.R. 2087 would leave \narbitration in effect when it is truly voluntary: after a dispute \narises.\n  Similarly, H.R. 4899, the ``Restore Statutory Rights Act,'' which was \nalso introduced by Mr. Johnson earlier this week, would ensure that the \nrights and protections established by Congress or the states are \nenforceable in court.\n  These bills would help restore balance and fairness to contractual \nagreements by allowing consumers, employees, franchisees, residents of \nlong-term care facilities, and others to opt for arbitration, rather \nthan have arbitration imposed on them as a pre-condition. Such measures \nwould help ensure a fairer arbitration process because the terms of \narbitration.\n  Congress must do more to protect the right of consumers and employees \nto have access to the courts. Americans should not be forced to lose \nthis precious right as a result of one-sided, pre-dispute mandatory \narbitration agreements.\n  Mr. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of \nAmerican consumers who are too often denied access to justice and \nforced into arbitration by contracts they were unable to negotiate \nfairly.\n  The Federal Arbitration Act was enacted to resolve disputes among \nbusinesses of equal standing; not to restrict consumer access to our \ncourts. The horrific distortion of this law has allowed certain actors \nto tip the scale in their favor and create an uneven playing field in \nthe pursuit of justice.\n  It is our responsibility to guarantee every American equal access to \njustice and protect the public from unfair and pernicious business \npractices. For this reason, I strongly support my colleague, \nRepresentative Hank Johnson's bill, the Arbitration Fairness Act. This \nbill would require that agreements to arbitrate employment, consumer, \ncivil rights or anti-trust disputes be made only after the dispute has \narisen. Consumers can only properly evaluate their options, and make a \ntruly voluntary choice, after a dispute has arisen. Arbitration \nundeniably serves an important role in our legal system, but its use \nmust be a choice, and not a mandate resulting from a one-sided \ncontract.\n  Americans deserve to choose whether court, arbitration, mediation, or \nany other method of dispute resolution works best for them. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in guaranteeing all Americans this meaningful \nchoice by cosponsoring the Arbitration Fairness Act.\n\n[[Page H1728]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1728-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1728-H1731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                      HOLDING THE IRS ACCOUNTABLE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Palmer). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. DeSantis) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, tax day is fast approaching. If you, as a \ntaxpayer, get audited and the IRS subpoenas documents from you, do you \nthink you could destroy them and say: The heck with it? Could you lie \nto the IRS when they are asking you about your taxes and investigating \nyou?\n  If somehow you unintentionally provided false information to the IRS, \ncould you decline to correct the record once you found out that what \nyou told them was not true? If you had a duty to comply with a lawfully \nissued subpoena, could you just fail to take basic efforts to comply?\n  I think every taxpayer in America instinctively knows that they would \nnever be able to get away with the conduct I just outlined.\n  So I think the question that we here in this body have to answer is: \nShould the IRS be able to get away with conduct that a taxpayer would \nnever be able to get away with? Can we really accept that the IRS gets \nto live under a lower standard of conduct than the taxpayers that the \nagency wields so much power over?\n  We know how this began. The IRS abused its authority. They targeted \nAmericans based on their First Amendment beliefs. They got caught red-\nhanded; so, Congress investigated.\n  Now, the Department of Justice was supposedly investigating, but that \nwas baked in the cake from the beginning. They were not interested in \nthis case. And, of course, they did not pursue prosecutions. \nUltimately, even though Lois Lerner was held in contempt, they didn't \npursue that even to the grand jury.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  So Congress has tried to get to the truth of this, and Congress is \neven taking some action, like cutting funding for the IRS. Of course, \nwhen we cut funding, all they did was stop answering the phone calls. \nThey didn't take it out of the bureaucracy. They just basically harmed \nthe taxpayers.\n  So we are trying to get to the truth. We subpoena documents from the \nIRS, we bring in the Commissioner, John Koskinen, to testify, and we \nare trying to get the truth on behalf of the American people.\n  And yet, what has happened?\n  The IRS destroyed 400 backup tapes containing as many as 24,000 of \nLois Lerner's emails that were under not one, but two congressional \nsubpoenas.\n  Commissioner Koskinen came to the Congress and made multiple \nstatements that are demonstrably false. He breached his duty to correct \nthe record once it was clear that some of his statements were false, \nsuch as the fact that he said we will produce every one of her emails. \nKoskinen even claimed that the IRS went to great lengths to ensure that \nCongress was given all documents, yet the IRS failed to conduct even \nbasic investigation, such that the inspector general found a thousand \nemails that were in the IRS' possession all along. It took them 2 weeks \nto find it.\n  The IRS didn't look at Lerner's BlackBerry. They didn't look in other \nareas which were obvious that you would want to look at.\n  Great lengths?\n  Give me a break. As Judge David Sentelle noted today in the D.C. \nCircuit, it is hard to find the IRS to be an agency that we can trust.\n  So I think the question is: What is the remedy for them frustrating \nthe American people's inquiry into their targeting of Americans?\n  I have argued, along with my colleagues here, that the appropriate \nremedy is found in the Constitution, which provides for impeachment of \ncivil officers.\n  You have an IRS Commissioner who breached multiple duties that he \nowed to the public, and he violated the public trust, which is what \nAlexander Hamilton said was kind of the touchstone for what an \nimpeachment should be in the Federalist Papers. Impeachment is not a \nprosecution or a punishment. It is really a constitutional check.\n  I think as you listen to some of the conduct that the IRS engaged \nin--my colleagues will go into more of it--obviously there is a need to \nget the truth, but there is also a need for this institution here to \nstand up for itself. It is really a question of the House's self-\nrespect.\n  How much longer can we, as elected officials, allow the bureaucracy \nto simply walk all over the Congress?\n  We are supposed to be the people's representatives. We are supposed \nto be able to do justice for them when the government is not acting \nappropriately.\n  Fear of a media backlash or that people in the beltway will say you \nshouldn't be doing it, that is no excuse for our failure to discharge \nour basic constitutional duties.\n  As James Madison said: ``Ambition must be made to counteract \nambition.'' No government agency is above oversight and accountability \nby the people's representatives.\n  And so as it stands now, we have filed articles of impeachment that \nhave basically been collecting dust for several months. We think they \nshould be brought up on the Committee on the Judiciary and we should \nhave a debate about whether this Commissioner's conduct satisfied the \nstandards of conduct that the Founding Fathers envisioned for civil \nofficers of the United States.\n  I think any taxpayer who looks at what the IRS did will instinctively \nsay, you know, it just ain't right that they are able to get away with \nthat when they are dealing with the Congress, but I would never be able \nto get away with that when I am dealing with the IRS.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), my friend and \ncolleague, a guy who has been really, really fearless on holding the \nIRS to account.\n  Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for organizing this \nSpecial Order, but more importantly, for the fight that he has waged in \nholding the IRS accountable and for saying to the American taxpayer, \nthe American people, when you have individuals running an agency with \nthe power of the Internal Revenue Service, doing what was done under \nCommissioner Koskinen's watch, he, in fact, should be impeached.\n  Let's just walk back through the story. Remember how this started. We \nhad conservative groups around the country saying, hey, we are being \nharassed by the IRS for filing to get tax-exempt status, something that \nused to be kind of a matter-of-fact thing; we are being harassed for \ndoing so.\n  So the Congress of the United States called for the inspector general \nto do an investigation. The inspector general does his investigation. \nIt takes a long time. It takes about a year. They do an investigation \nand they find, you know what, our very own tax collection agency is, in \nfact, targeting citizens for their political beliefs. They find it. \nThey find targeting took place. The inspector general of Treasury tells \nthe Treasury officials and tells the IRS what they have discovered, and \nthey are going to file their report the following week.\n  In an unprecedented move, Lois Lerner, the Friday before the report \nis supposed to be made public the following week, Friday, May 10, 2013, \nLois Lerner does what all kinds of people do when they get caught with \ntheir hand in the cookie jar. She wants to get ahead of this story, so \nat a staged event, bar association event, staged question, planted \nquestion from a friend, she gets asked about the targeting and the \ninspector general's investigation, and she does what all kinds of \npeople do when they get caught. She lies. She flat out lies. She tries \nto blame good public servants in Cincinnati. She said this was all \nabout Cincinnati.\n  We all know what the evidence pointed to. It was about Washington. It \nwas about the folks right here in the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n  The report comes out the following week. On the following Monday, 2 \ndays later, the President of the United States and the Attorney General \nsay this is inexcusable, and they call for a criminal investigation.\n  In fact, it is so bad, the President fires the then-Commissioner of \nthe Internal Revenue Service. They bring in an interim Commissioner. \nFor a long time, we have hearings and a bunch of things happen. And, of \ncourse, one of the most noteworthy things is the very lady who was at \nthe center of the storm, who lied when she first made\n\n[[Page H1729]]\n\nthis public, gets brought in front of the Congress.\n  And what did she do?\n  She takes the Fifth. So when you have the central figure exercising \ntheir Fifth Amendment right, not willing to testify in public and \nanswer the people's representatives' questions, it sort of puts a \npremium on getting the documents and the communications that the IRS \nhad relative to this issue.\n  And so a long investigation ensues. Both a criminal investigation and \na congressional investigation. Mr. Koskinen is then brought in as the \nCommissioner who is going to clean it all up, clean up this agency with \nso much power over American people's lives. He is brought in.\n  And guess what happens?\n  Everything Congressman DeSantis just described. There are 422 backup \ntapes destroyed containing potentially 24,000 emails. Many of those \nemails most likely were Lois Lerner's emails that the American people \nand the Congress will never get a chance to see. They were destroyed, \nas Congressman DeSantis pointed out, with three preservation orders in \nplace. One from the IRS and the Treasury themselves. Another \npreservation order by the Justice Department saying preserve all \ndocuments, preserve everything. So three preservation orders, two \nsubpoenas in place, and the Commissioner, under his watch, 422 backup \ntapes are destroyed containing 24,000 emails.\n  What does Mr. Koskinen do when he learns about problems with these \ntapes and problems with Ms. Lerner's hard drive?\n  He waits 4 months--4 months--before he tells Congress. Again, raising \nthe obvious question--if you are a taxpayer being audited and you \nrealize, oops, I lost some documents or I destroyed something, and you \nwait 4 months to tell the IRS what you did, oh, my goodness, you are in \nhuge trouble.\n  But Mr. Koskinen, he is the cleanup guy, he is the President's hand-\npicked person, he is brought in. He thinks it is just fine that there \nare all these problems that he knows about.\n  Now, he didn't just wait 4 months and then tell us. In that time, \nwhen he first learned there were problems, he testified in front of \nCongress several times and didn't tell us. And then the worst thing is \nhe provided false testimony, which, again, my colleague from Florida \nhas pointed out. He said: Look, everything is fine.\n  And then finally, think about all the duties this guy, the guy \nbrought in to clean up the mess, think about all the duties he had. A \nduty to preserve all the documents, particularly in light of the fact \nthe central figure has taken the Fifth. A duty to produce them when \nthey are asked for by the Congress. A duty to disclose to us if he \ncouldn't preserve and produce them. A duty to testify accurately. And \nthen, finally, a duty to correct the record if, in fact, he testified \nand said something that wasn't accurate. Every single duty he had, he \nbreached. Every single one.\n  Here is the final point I will make. And this is why--what \nCongressman DeSantis, what Congressman Hice, and what Congressman \nLamborn are going to talk about is why this is so important, why this \nis so critical that this individual be brought in front of Congress. \nAnd, actually, we go through the articles of impeachment, and we \nexercise the right that the Constitution requires us to do of a \nsituation of this magnitude.\n  Why it is so important is, remember the underlying offense. This is \nan agency with the power and influence that the IRS has systematically \nand for a sustained period of time targeting Americans' most cherished \nrights. You think about your First Amendment liberties: freedom of the \npress, freedom to petition your government, freedom to assemble, \nfreedom to practice your faith, freedom of religion, practice your \nfaith the way you think the good Lord wants you to. But under the First \nAmendment, your most fundamental liberty is your right to speak.\n  When the Founders put together the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, \nand that First Amendment, when they were talking about your free speech \nrights, what they were mostly focused on was not just any old speech, \nany old talk, they were mostly focused on doing what we are doing right \nnow, political speech, talking about politics, talking about \ngovernment.\n  You have the right as an American citizen to speak out against your \ngovernment and not be harassed for doing so. And yet, the IRS did just \nthat. And that is why, Mr. Koskinen, that is why we filed these \narticles of impeachment and that is why we are asking that they move \nforward in the Committee on the Judiciary and we do what the American \npeople sent us here to do.\n  I thank the gentleman from Florida who has done so much good work on \nthis issue and a host of others.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. I thank the gentleman from Ohio. I now yield to the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the leadership of \nRepresentative DeSantis and Representative Jordan in holding the Obama \nadministration accountable.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to call for the impeachment of John \nKoskinen, Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, for high crimes \nand misdemeanors. This effort is needed to hold the IRS Commissioner \naccountable for allowing documents to be destroyed and for providing \nmisleading statements to Congress after IRS targeted conservative \norganizations. I am a cosponsor--and proud to be one--of the \nresolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n  As it has become abundantly clear, Commissioner Koskinen has failed \nthe American people by stonewalling congressional investigations into \nthe IRS targeting scandal. Conservative organizations were \nintentionally targeted by our Federal Government simply because they \nbelieved and expressed a message that was in opposition to the \nadministration.\n  Now, while I may disagree with many on the left, I would never seek \nto threaten them by use of government force and coercion and take away \ntheir freedom of speech.\n  Moreover, what is truly disturbing about the IRS scandal is that \nCommissioner Koskinen has violated the public trust. As a Commissioner, \nhe failed to comply with a congressional subpoena, failed to ensure \nthat evidence was preserved, failed to testify truthfully, and failed \nto notify Congress when he learned that thousands of emails were \nmissing.\n  Our constituents expect Congress to exercise oversight of this \nadministration and to demand accountability. We know the IRS \nCommissioner cannot be trusted. Impeachment would help rectify this \nsorry situation and would go a long way toward showing the American \npeople that we are serious about our constitutional duties.\n  Impeachment is the appropriate means to restore balance between the \nbranches of government. The Framers included impeachment in the \nConstitution for precisely this scenario, where an executive branch \nofficial who violated the public trust will not resign and they refuse \nto fire him. That is exactly what should happen here. IRS Commissioner \nKoskinen must go.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado. I now \nyield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice).\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, we all know this time of \nyear is when the American people are held accountable to pay their \ntaxes. Unfortunately, the IRS--and especially its head Commissioner \nJohn Koskinen--have proven over and over and over that they cannot be \ntrusted to hold themselves to the same standard that they hold the rest \nof us. It is critical that we, as Congress, as we are trying to do here \nthis evening, that we ensure that the IRS is held accountable for its \nactions the same way the American people and other Federal agencies are \nheld accountable for their actions.\n  House Republicans, my colleagues and I, many of us on the House \nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform in particular are very \nfamiliar with Commissioner Koskinen. Under his leadership, the IRS has \nfailed to respond to multiple subpoenas for evidence. There has been \ndestruction of thousands of key documents, thereby really hindering the \nwork of Oversight investigations, possibly obstructing justice.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  John Koskinen, as has already been mentioned here just moments ago, \nsat before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and \nlied\n\n[[Page H1730]]\n\nunder oath multiple times, providing false and misleading testimony, \nwhich, of course, as we all know, is outright perjury.\n  John Koskinen's continued role as Commissioner of the Internal \nRevenue Service--which we all know is one of those powerful Federal \nagencies--despite his continued attempts to deceive Congress and the \nAmerican people, is nothing but the living embodiment that the IRS \nindeed does not play by the same rules that they demand of other \nAmericans.\n  The American people are well aware that the IRS has placed itself \nabove the law, above the rest of us. In fact, according to a recent \nRasmussen poll, only about 30 percent of Americans actually trust the \nIRS to fairly enforce the law, which means that we have got nearly 70 \npercent of Americans who don't trust the IRS to abide by the law here \nin America. One of the most powerful agencies that we have cannot be \ntrusted. And the American people don't trust them. This is a Federal \nagency that desperately needs to be set on the right track. Of course, \nthe first step to that is eliminating the failed leadership.\n  So I join my colleagues on the House Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform, many of whom are here this evening. I am proud to be \na cosponsor of H. Res. 494 to impeach Commissioner John Koskinen. This \nis absolutely one of our most important roles in Congress: to hold our \nFederal agencies and heads of these agencies accountable.\n  So with that mission, I appreciate the gentleman for the opportunity \nto speak a few moments, and I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 494 \nto impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.\n  Again, I want to thank my good friend, Congressman DeSantis, for \nleading this Special Order.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. It is my pleasure to yield to one of my friends and \ncolleagues from the great State of Florida (Mr. Yoho), who is really a \nstalwart in terms of bringing accountability to government.\n  Mr. YOHO. I would like to thank my colleague from my neighboring \ndistrict, Mr. DeSantis.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a great moment in time and I appreciate the \ngentleman bringing this up. This is such an important issue that we all \ndeal with and something that every American has a vested interest in. I \nthank the gentleman for holding this Special Order this evening. The \ntopic of tonight's discussion is an important one and one that demands \nattention by all Americans.\n  My district and I have never been a fan of the IRS. It is an agency \nthat wreaks terror amongst the American people. And in a perfect world, \nwe would eliminate it altogether, but that is not what we are here to \ntalk about tonight. When you consider their actions over the past \ncouple of years of targeting conservative groups and individuals \nseeking nonprofit status or political ideology that doesn't agree with \nan administration, my desire to see this agency dismantled increases \ntenfold.\n  Although the focus tonight is the conduct of IRS Commissioner John \nKoskinen and his failure to perform his duty to respond to lawfully \nissued congressional subpoenas, let us not forget that the IRS scandal \nbegan back in 2010. 2010--over 6 years ago--this started.\n  And do you want to know why the frustration of the American people is \nso high, why they say, You guys don't ever change in Washington, you \nnever hold anybody accountable?\n  We see the law being blatantly broken every day. Yet we stand here \nneutered, afraid to do something.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time that we stand up and hold those people that \nare breaking the law accountable. I know Mr. DeSantis' goal is to do \nthat, his committee's goal is to do that, and my goal is to help them \naccomplish that.\n  Many have accused Commissioner Koskinen of obscuring multiple \ncongressional investigations into the IRS targeting of conservative \ngroups seeking nonprofit status. Some argue that in the process of \nstalling and misrepresenting the facts to Congress, he has committed \nculpable misdemeanors.\n  If Commissioner Koskinen has deliberately misled the American people, \nCongress has the constitutional responsibility to hold him accountable \nto the American people.\n  Who else can do that?\n  Only this body has that power: the House of Representatives, the \npeople's House. That is why our Founders instilled that power, that \nauthority, that oversight with this body. The American people can't \nhold anybody accountable. It is us, the legislature.\n  And I support his impeachment. I feel that his agency completely went \noff the rails. And by doing so, I am proud to support Jason Chaffetz' \nHouse Resolution 494 asking for the impeachment of John Koskinen for \nhigh crimes and misdemeanors.\n  This is something that has only been used 19 times in our Nation's \nhistory: impeachment of a Federal official. Nineteen times in over 200 \nyears. It is not something that is flagrantly used to throw people out \nof office because we don't agree with their political ideology. This is \nsomething that has been used very sparingly, and it is a tool that must \nbe used when the time is right to use it. Mr. Speaker, I say the time \nis right. The American people want to see this done.\n  The resolution was introduced in October of last year, and we have \nyet to see it come out of the Judiciary Committee and onto the House \nfloor. What is the holdup, is my question and that of a lot of other \npeople.\n  We know the White House will not lift a finger. This White House and \nadministration will not lift a finger to hold anyone accountable, but \nwhy hasn't our own House leadership done more to bring this resolution \nto the House floor? That is my question. It is the question when I go \nhome: Why are you guys not holding people accountable? Because if we \ndon't hold ourselves accountable and we blatantly break the law, why \nshould not the American people do that? This is to send an example that \nwe cannot break the law. Because if we don't follow the rule of law, \nwhy should the American people?\n  The American people want answers and accountability in their \ngovernment. As Members of the House, we have heard their cries and \nworked together to hold the Obama administration accountable. It is \ntime we bring H. Res. 494 up for a straight up-or-down vote and do the \nwork our constituents ask of us.\n  Just this month I held four town hall and teletown hall meetings, and \none of the topics I heard over and over again was about government \naccountability. We hear it a lot: government accountability and \ntransparency. We talk about it and hear about it, but don't see it.\n  Again, that leads to the frustration of the American people: Why \naren't elected officials ever held accountable?\n  We have government agencies targeting American citizens for nothing \nmore than a political ideology, their beliefs, ignoring our demand for \ninformation and flagrantly ignoring the law. This needs to end. We \ncannot change our Nation for the better if we do not change how \nbusiness is done in Washington. Nothing in Washington will ever change \nif we don't start holding officials accountable.\n\n  We need to start here. We need to start now. And I urge my colleagues \nto support the impeachment of John Koskinen. This is something not \ntaken lightly. Again, I want to reiterate it has been used 19 times in \nover 200 years. I urge my colleagues to support the impeachment of John \nKoskinen and to continue to hold strong against this and future \nadministrations that disregard the law, the Constitution, and the \npeople of this great Nation.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. I appreciate my friend from Florida. Those were very \nwell-received comments.\n  I would also like to just mention that Mr. Palmer from Alabama--who \nis serving up there--and I were discussing before he had to go up and \nserve in that duty--and I think it was a good point: if this were a \nprivate business and the private business had behaved this way--in the \nface of the IRS--the CEO would have been fired because it just would \nhave been absolute hell for the company.\n  And that is one reason why the American people are so frustrated with \ngovernment. There are different standards that apply for people in \nWashington versus the rest of the American people and the taxpayers. \nAnd that is just totally intolerable in a Republican form of \ngovernment.\n\n[[Page H1731]]\n\n  And I make one other point that I think sometimes gets lost. When you \nstart talking about what are impeachable offenses, people tend to think \nof it in terms of criminal offenses. And while there are criminal \noffenses that would qualify as impeachable offenses, the two are not \nmutually exclusive. And, in fact, the Founders believed that the real \nreason you needed impeachment was for things that may not necessarily \nbe criminal, but that were breaches of the public trust.\n  Joseph Story, the preeminent Supreme Court Justice, noted that:\n\n       Impeachable offenses are aptly termed political offenses \n     growing out of personal misconduct or gross neglect or \n     usurpation or habitual disregard for the public interest. \n     They must be examined upon very broad and comprehensive \n     principles of public policy and duty.\n\n  I think that is tailor-made for this instance. Some of the false \nstatements maybe do violate statues, but we don't have to get into \nthat. We can simply say: Has he violated, has he shown a disregard for \nthe public interest, has he been--even grossly negligent would be \nactionable--and I think that is clearly the case here.\n  I echo my friend from Florida that said we need to get the dust of \nthe impeachment resolutions, we need to get it up to Judiciary and pass \nit out, and then let's let the House make a decision about whether that \nis valid or not.\n  Some people say: Well, the Senate may not want to do it. They will \nhave to defend their votes then. And that is fine with me. I think most \nAmericans want the IRS to live at least under the same standard they \ndo. I think it should be a higher standard, given all the power they \nhave.\n  I appreciate my colleagues for coming and discussing this issue. The \narticles have not been brought up, but we are not forgetting, many of \nour constituents are not forgetting, and really the time to act is now. \nIf we don't--this is absolutely true--the IRS will have gotten away \nwith everything. That is unacceptable.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1731-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1731-H1733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. \nKaptur) for 30 minutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge that Congressman Tim \nRyan of Ohio and Congressman Rick Nolan of Minnesota had scheduling \nconflicts. They were here earlier, and we thought this Special Order \nwould start earlier. And I want to say thank you to both of them so \nvery much for their strong support of the pension benefit rights of \nAmerica's workers and retirees.\n  Tonight I rise to bring a very serious situation to the attention of \nthe American people, a situation that demands justice. It relates to \nsomething called ERISA, or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, \npassed decades ago that says when workers work and accrue benefits for \nretirement, those are sacrosanct. They are earned benefits and no one \ncan cut them. ERISA promises that those retirees will receive the \nearned benefits that they worked so hard for.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want the American people to know that today I stood \nwith thousands of America's workers out here on the lawn facing the \nCapitol. American retirees, their families, and supporters are here in \nour Nation's capital to save their hard-earned pensions that should be \nguaranteed under the laws of this country. They are here in Washington \nbecause Congress abandoned them. They were abandoned by the executive \nbranch, too.\n  What has happened is that hundreds of thousands of American workers \nare getting notices in the mail. These are current beneficiaries, \npeople who are already retired, who are getting notices that their \npensions are being cut by half, by 30 percent, some as much as by 70 \npercent under something that passed here in the Congress called the \nMultiemployer Pension Reform Act.\n  But it didn't pass on its own, as a freestanding piece of \nlegislation. It was stuck in a gigantic bill--we call it a must-pass \nbill--that, in December of 2014, if it had not been passed, the \ngovernment would have shut down. The problem is most Members of \nCongress had no idea that was even in that bill. That section was \nairlifted into what was called the CR/Omnibus, the continuing \nresolution appropriations bill of that year. But on the section that \ndealt with pension rights, which had nothing to do with the \nappropriations process or the continuing resolution, these pension cuts \nwere dropped in. There was no floor debate, there was no separate \ndebate on that issue.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  There were no amendments allowed. People, Members didn't even know \nwhat was in that section of the bill.\n  So that Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, they call it MPRA, was \nsupposed to solve one crisis, and that is a shortage in the funds \ncurrently in that particular pension fund; but it placed the solution \non the backs of the workers, the people who had earned those benefits \nthemselves. Retirees who never caused the financial shortfall are going \nto bear the entire burden of the shortfall in that fund.\n  In reality, people in Ohio--just who were Ohio Teamster retirees, \nnearly 48,000 retirees in Ohio, the State most impacted in the union--\nare now getting notices that their pensions are going to be cut. \nOverall, there are over 270,000--a quarter million--Teamster retirees, \nalone, across our country who are being affected; and, of course, some \nof them were with us today.\n  Over the last year, I have heard extensively from retirees who will \nsee their pensions dramatically reduced--dramatically reduced--if, in \nfact, these cuts are approved by the U.S. Treasury Department.\n  These Americans did everything our country asked them to do as \nproductive citizens. They went to work. They worked for decades. They \nworked for companies that matched that money, and they thought they \nwould have a secure retirement--guaranteed. The law says, under ERISA, \ntheir retirement income will be guaranteed. But now it is a promise not \nbeing kept, and they are facing a stark reality. These workers earned \ntheir benefits. No one has the right to take them away.\n  Imagine working for 30 years as a truck driver, where your work takes \nyou away on long trips for weeks at a time--time away from your family, \ntime away from your community, countless missed family gatherings and \nlife moments you will never get back, but you are a good worker so you \ndo it. It is a good job with good pay, a solid middle-class living, a \nchance to make life better for your family and children, and, with it, \nall the promise of a reasonable and secure retirement in later years, \nif you can make it, doing that hard work.\n  Imagine that you retire with your earned, predictable pension you \nhave worked for your whole life. You are in your seventies, and a \nhastily passed government law reduces your pension from $3,500 a month \nto $1,400 a month--poof, just like that, through no fault of yours. You \ndid everything you were supposed to.\n  This example is not the exception of what is happening to the \nAmerican people; it is the rule.\n  Now, let me tell you, truck driving is hard work. It is debilitating \non bodies, the bouncing, hopping out of that truck, many workers having \nto load the truck, as well as drive the truck, and then unload the \ntruck, leaving many of these retirees disabled from work they did for \n20 and 30 years.\n  I hear countless stories of how retirees are caring for their \nchildren, some of whom who have disabilities, supporting their own ill \nand aged parents, or supporting children and grandchildren with life \nexpenses which, the last time I looked, aren't going down.\n  Electric bills are up. Food is up. It is not so easy to make it in \nretirement years. These pension cuts impact more than just the \nindividual who earned the pension. Literally, these cuts impact \nmillions of Americans and the communities in which they reside.\n  The House has continued to let these retirees down in its failure to \nhold even a single hearing to fully understand their financial plight. \nCan you imagine that? A federally guaranteed income secured, been in \nthe law for years, now you have got hundreds of thousands of Americans \nimpacted and Congress is dead as a doornail. They are not doing their \njob, even as these workers face these tremendous cuts.\n  Now, one of the major funds that is affected was called Central \nStates, and\n\n[[Page H1732]]\n\nit was the first fund being affected--where its workers, pension \nretirees, were being affected--that filed an application with the \nTreasury Department to restructure benefits. But that application is \nonly the first of many funds, pension funds, that will seek cuts in the \nyears ahead.\n  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation reports that 150 \nmultiemployer plans--covering a million and a half participants--are in \ngrave risk of insolvency. With those cuts, entire communities will feel \nthe economic impact.\n  What is more shameful is this was caused, in large part, by the role \nplayed--get ready--by the large, multinational banks. Let me list three \nof them for you: Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Northern Trust. You \nsee, the Central States Pension Fund is the only major private pension \nfund where all the discretionary investment decisions are made by \nfinancial firms, not our government. There was a court order from 1982 \nthat has made the decisions for the retirees' billion-dollar fund. So \nthe government basically turned this money over to the big banks.\n  Does this sound familiar?\n  This was the result of the Department of Labor wrestling control of \nthe fund, back in the eighties, away from organized crime, who used \nfunds as their own piggy bank to build parts of Las Vegas. But the real \nirony here is that the Teamsters' pension fund disappeared more quickly \nunder Wall Street than it did under the mob. How about that?\n  Ask the retirees how they feel, and they will tell you they got their \nmoney under the mob control. And I am not arguing for mob control. I am \narguing for fair treatment of pensioners in our country and getting the \nmoney they earned.\n  Time has not been friendly to the trucking industry, with \nderegulation decimating good-paying jobs in trucking companies across \nthe country and bankruptcy laws allowing hundreds of companies to exit \nthe fund without paying their full withdrawal liabilities.\n  Lots went wrong by the big shots making the decisions, but the people \npaying the price over this 30-year period are the workers, and that is \nwrong. That is wrong.\n  The fund was hit particularly hard by the turmoil in the markets \nduring the dot-com bubble and then followed by the Great Recession and \nfinancial crash during 2007 and 2008. Guess what. The fund, the pension \nfund, lost nearly 40 percent of its assets as it appears to have been \noverly invested in risky assets by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and \nNorthern Trust.\n\n  We are calling for a forensic audit of what happened every year with \nthe investments of this fund and who did it, who benefited, and now, \nwho is being asked to pay the price.\n  How tragic that Congress will bail out the big banks, but then they \nwill throw millions of truck drivers and middle-class retirees who \nworked hard for a living under the bus--or under the truck.\n  Central States will tell you that these dynamics have caused the \nshortages, but the handwriting has been on the wall for a rather long \ntime. While other funds diversified and recruited additional employers, \nsomething happened in this fund that is atypical. But why should the \nworkers be blamed for what the managers and the bankers did?\n  Immediately after that law was passed, called MPRA, I set to work to \ncorrect the unfairness to America's workers and introduced H.R. 2844, \nthe Keep Our Pension Promises Act. It now has nearly 50 cosponsors--50.\n  The idea here is--we call it KOPPA--the Keep Our Pension Promises Act \nwould prevent these draconian cuts to the earned pensions of our \nworkers by filling the financial gap in the fund and reinstate the \n``anti-cutback'' provisions in ERISA, the bedrock of that law.\n  We have to keep our promises. ERISA promised that pension benefits in \nmultiemployer plans would be cut only when a plan runs out of money; \nand even then, the benefit of the retirees should be the last to be \ncut, not the first to be cut.\n  No wonder that the middle class is mad at Washington. No wonder we \nsee this Presidential race that is occurring, where there is a lot of \nhubbub around the country. The public is sick and tired of Washington \ndoing this kind of thing to the American people. The public sees that \nthis is just another broken promise by Washington and another rigged \nbill that went through here by the top leaders in Congress that most \nMembers didn't even know was in there.\n  The system is rigged. A Senator from the other body said that. Well, \nby golly, on this one, in terms of benefits of pension retirees, it \nsure is rigged.\n  There are more than a million honest Americans who, for decades and \ndecades, worked hard. They followed the rules, and they are now getting \nthrown to the wind by their own government.\n  Imagine if Congress were to cut Social Security benefits in the same \nway, by two-thirds, in a retiree's monthly pension payments. There \nwould be riots in the streets.\n  My colleagues, if you ever wonder why tens and tens of millions of \nAmericans are angry, deeply disappointed, and feel betrayed by their \ngovernment, look no further than this issue.\n  I want to say to all the Americans who drove across the country today \nto be with us here in Washington, to spend the money for that gasoline, \nto take time away from their families--frankly, some of the men and \nwomen who were there couldn't even stand up on the lawn. They had to \nsit along the concrete fences along the side because their bodies \nsimply can't hold them up as they did when they were younger. We can do \nbetter than this as a country.\n  The bill that we are offering, H.R. 2844, basically would tax some of \nthe assets of the most wealthy in our country and fill the gaps between \nnow and 10 years from now so these workers wouldn't have to take these \ncuts. It is truly unfair to them.\n  It is time we operate, in this Congress, with the oversight that this \ninstitution was built upon. It is time for the committees of \njurisdiction to do their job. Give these Americans, who are patriotic \npeople--many of them are veterans. Many of them have served our country \nso ably in so many ways. They have been good family people. They don't \nneed to have their benefits cut in their retirement years.\n  It has caused such havoc in these families, the worry alone, the \nblood pressures that have gone up and the heartache and the lost sleep \nof losing what they worked for their entire life. What is happening to \nthem is wrong. It is not just.\n  It is time for the Treasury Department to deny the Central States \napplication to cut benefits, and it is time that this Congress keep our \npension promises to the American people who worked so hard, paid their \ntaxes, helped build their families, helped build their communities, had \na great work ethic, went to work every day, many of them getting up \nreal early before the sun even rose. And now to treat them like this, \nin their golden years, how wrong is this?\n  I am so proud to rise on this floor this evening to speak on their \nbehalf. They deserve a better day. I expect the people in this Congress \nand I expect the executive branch to dole out justice fairly to them \nand not make them the victim of the bad decisions that were made by the \nbiggest banks in this country and by the managers of those funds that \nthese workers dutifully paid their dues into over the years, coming out \nof their check every pay period. It is not right to cut their benefits. \nThey do not deserve this.\n  Those funds need additional time to recover following that 2008 \ncrash. You don't recover in 7 or 8 years, not from that kind of \ndownfall in the economy. Why make the workers pay for the mistakes of \nothers? It is just so wrong.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to come down here this evening urging my \ncolleagues to support the Keep Our Pension Promises Act, to urge them \nto sign onto our bill, H.R. 2844.\n  I say to those workers and retirees across our country who are likely \nlistening: Keep up the faith. Keep writing your Representatives. Keep \nwriting the U.S. Treasury Department, Mr. Ken Feinberg, who is in \ncharge of this solution.\n  We want to make sure that justice prevails; and if we speak out, if \nwe don't give up, if we make sure we stand up and talk to our Senators, \ntalk to our Representatives, talk to all the Presidential candidates \ncoming\n\n[[Page H1733]]\n\nthrough our States, across our country, during this year, this \nPresidential year, we can impact this policy.\n  Both political parties should have in their platforms this year that \nthey will be writing come this summer that the Keep Our Pension \nPromises Act should be passed, that we should take care of these \nretirees and not permit them to lose the earned benefits that they \nspent their lives devoted to and now, in their later years, are facing \nthese draconian cuts.\n  It is so wrong. I ask for justice for these American workers. Let's \ndo what is right for them. And I know the people listening tonight \nagree, and they would do the same thing if they were standing down here \non this floor with me.\n  Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for allowing me to speak out this \nevening and to stand alongside the hardworking men and women of our \ncountry. They deserve better treatment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1733-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1733-H1735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOLDING THE IRS ACCOUNTABLE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up on the comments \nof my dear friends' Special Order earlier by Congressman Ron DeSantis.\n  I know there were a number of people who spoke, but the ones I \nactually saw and heard--Congressman DeSantis, a dear friend, dear \nfriend Ted Yoho, and my dear friend Jim Jordan--did an extraordinary \njob of laying out why we simply have to show that this House has \nstandards, that Congress has rules, and you can only thumb your nose so \nfar. You can only lie and defraud and, in some ways, be incompetent \nbefore there has to be an impeachment.\n  And with regard to the head of the Internal Revenue Service, the case \nhas been made very effectively in the prior Special Order. So I want to \nadd on to that by reference to this article from the Washington \nExaminer entitled, ``IRS Chief:''--basically, the IRS chief is saying \nthis; this is the headline--``Agency Encourages Illegal Immigrant Theft \nof Social Security Numbers to File Tax Returns.''\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  It is by Rudy Takala, dated April 12.\n  It says, ``The IRS is struggling to ensure that illegal immigrants \nare able to illegally use Social Security numbers for legitimate \npurposes, the agency's head told senators on Tuesday, without allowing \nthe numbers to be used for `bad' reasons.''\n  Now, that is the IRS director's reasoning. It is okay for someone \nillegally in the United States to be engaged in identity theft.\n  This is the IRS director that has presided over the massive \nmanipulation of the Internal Revenue Service as a tool of this \nadministration and the Democratic political party back in 2012 to \nprevent conservative groups, groups whose one foundational basis was \nthe Constitution as written, groups who believed that people should \nfollow the law.\n  This director's IRS targeted such people and, in some cases, kept \nthem from getting a tax ID number and a verification that they could \nraise money. They kept them from participating in the 2012 election \nbecause President Obama was up for reelection, of course.\n  And now he has the gall to go before a Senate committee and testify \nthat it is okay for someone illegally in this country that is involved \nin identity theft to use fraudulently someone else's Social Security \nnumber as long as it is not for a bad purpose.\n  If there has ever been a good reason to remove a department head, it \ncertainly exists with the IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.\n  The article goes on and says that he made the statement in response \nto a question from Senator Dan Coats, a Republican from Indiana, during \na session of the Senate Finance Committee about why the IRS appears to \nbe collaborating with taxpayers who file tax returns using fraudulent \ninformation. Senator Coats said that his staff had discovered the \npractice after looking into agency procedures.\n  This is Senator Coats being quoted: ``What we learned is that . . . \nthe IRS continues to process tax returns with false W-2 information and \nissue refunds as if they were routine tax returns, and say that's not \nreally our job. We also learned the IRS ignores notifications from the \nSocial Security Administration that a name does not match a Social \nSecurity number, and you use your own system to determine whether a \nnumber is valid.''\n  He is talking about the IRS.\n  So if we are just talking about strictly the issue of competence and \nnot even getting into lies, fraud, deception, violating court orders, \nviolating congressional orders, violating his own department \ndirectives--if we are just talking about an issue of competence and the \nInternal Revenue Service utilizes Social Security numbers in order to \ndetermine whose tax return is being filed and processed and he has the \nunmitigated gall to say: Now, when the Social Security Administration \nthat issues these numbers tells us that person is filing a tax return \nand the information that they have given the IRS is false, it is \nfraudulent, it is not their number, it is not their tax return, it is \nnot their tax information, the head of the IRS, Mr. Koskinen, says: We \ndon't trust the Social Security number--that is basically what he is \nsaying--we don't trust the Social Security Administration on whether or \nnot it is a valid Social Security number when they tell us it is \nclearly not a number that belongs to the person that is filing that \nreturn. We go by our own information.\n  Now, how in the world could the Internal Revenue Service have more \nvalid information about a taxpayer's Social Security number than the \nSocial Security Administration that issued the number, maintains the \nnumber, and updates their records regarding who is using that number?\n  Giving the benefit of the doubt, maybe it is not incompetence. Maybe \nit is just so much unbridled arrogance that he honestly believes that \nnobody can be right except his department because he is the head of it.\n  The article goes on: ``Asked to explain those practices, Koskinen \nreplied, `What happens in these situations is someone is using a Social \nSecurity number to get a job, but they're filing their tax return with \ntheir [taxpayer identification number].' `What that means,' he said, \n`is that they are undocumented aliens . . . They're paying taxes. It is \nin everybody's interest to have them pay the taxes they owe.'\n  `` `As long as the information is being used only to fraudulently \nobtain jobs,' Koskinen said, `rather than to claim false tax returns, \nthe agency has an interest in helping them. The question is whether the \nSocial Security number they're using to get the job has been stolen. \nIt's not the normal identity theft situation,' he said.\n  ``The comments came in the broader context of a hearing on \ncybersecurity in the agency. About 464,000 illegally obtained Social \nSecurity numbers were targeted by hackers in a February cyber breach of \nthe agency, while information on 330,000 taxpayers was stolen in an \nunrelated breach last year.''\n  Koskinen ``added that the agency wanted to differentiate that `bad' \nmisuse of personal data from other uses. `There are questions about \nwhether there's a way we could simply advise people . . . A lot of the \ntime those Social Security numbers are borrowed from friends and \nacquaintances and they know they've been used, other times they don't.' \n''\n  So, apparently, people at the IRS, like Lois Lerner, don't mind \nviolating the law, don't mind violating their oath, don't mind \nviolating the very instructions for doing their jobs, and don't mind \npeople--apparently, Koskinen doesn't--mind people that have violated \nthe law to come into this country and have violated the law by \npossessing and using a stolen Social Security number without regard to \nwhether they actually stole it themselves. No problem there as long as \nthey are using it, apparently, to pay taxes.\n  What he doesn't say is that what these returns normally do--from what \nI can glean, they are not using fraudulent Social Security numbers to \nsay: IRS, we want to pay more taxes into the U.S. Treasury. So just \nlook the other way while we use a fraudulent or a stolen identity, a \nstolen Social Security number. Just look the other way because we are \ngoing to send you some more money.\n\n[[Page H1734]]\n\n  Isn't that wonderful? What gratuity. What a wonderful spirit that \nsomeone would break our laws to come into this country, then steal \nsomebody's Social Security number, and then be so gracious as to say: \nNow, I am filing my tax return because I want you to know I want to pay \nmore taxes fraudulently in somebody else's name.\n  That is normally not why somebody would file a tax return at the end \nof the year using a stolen Social Security number.\n  No. Normally, you would file that to get money back from the \ngovernment. You violated all kinds of laws. So why not violate one more \nto get a nice check back from the government?\n  Is it too much of a stretch to think that perhaps, if somebody will \nviolate the laws of the United States to come into the United States, \nthey will refuse to comply--like millions of American immigrants have \nthat, thank God, have wanted to come into America, have made America \nbetter, have come in and followed the law--no. These want to come in \nillegally and use stolen Social Security numbers.\n  Again, is it too much to think, perhaps, if they are willing to \nperjure themselves using a stolen Social Security number, willing to \nfile a fraudulent tax return that is not really theirs or the name or \nnumber on it is not theirs so that they are guilty of perjury, they are \nguilty of Internal Revenue fraud--is it too much to think they might \njust be willing to claim some exemptions and to claim some tax credits \nthat they are not really owed so that they get a big old check back \nfrom the Federal Government?\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  I mean, why not ask for a big tax return, tax refund from your return \nafter you have already violated so many laws of the United States? Yet \nthe man whose oath of office should have had him rooting out stolen \nSocial Security numbers and making sure taxpayers are not defrauding \nthe U.S. Government, that they are not getting refunds back they are \nnot owed, couldn't he go ahead and do that and protect Americans from \nidentity theft? No, apparently not.\n  So Americans aren't protected. Their information clearly has not been \nadequately protected with the Internal Revenue Service under Koskinen's \ncontrol. So Americans are at risk, especially if they are law-abiding \nand want to keep their information protected, because we have a head of \nthe IRS that thinks it is okay if you are illegally in the country and \nfiling fraudulent tax returns and using stolen identities, it is okay \nif you are simply trying to file your tax return. But, of course, how \nmany of them really are getting refunds? That is why they are filing \nthe fraudulent return using a stolen Social Security number.\n  Well, I know, having handled thousands of felony cases in Texas that \ncame through my court and having noticed over the years that juries \nfeel the same way, if you will lie repeatedly or break laws of moral \nturpitude repeatedly, isn't it just kind of fundamental that you might \nbe willing to lie in order to get some money back? Juries thought so, \nrepeatedly. I thought so in numerous cases.\n  As we know from the rules of evidence--it should also apply to life, \nand it should apply to government investigations--that rule is \ncredibility is always an issue. If somebody would use a stolen Social \nSecurity number or commit perjury in filing a tax return, provide \nfraudulent information, they might just be willing to put in a number, \ntoo, that is also fraudulent in order to get that big check from the \nUnited States taxpayers that actually worked and didn't steal anybody's \nSocial Security number.\n  Is it any wonder why the American people are so stirred up against \nwhat is perceived as an establishment involving both parties in \nWashington, D.C., when we have this kind of contempt for honesty and \nhonor and following the law and for tax returns and tax refunds from a \nman that is head of the IRS that needs to be impeached and removed from \noffice?\n  I applaud my friends for making the case they did. They didn't touch \non this particular area, but it really brings the gavel down. As \nlitigants often said in front of me as a judge, ``I rest my case.'' Mr. \nKoskinen needs to go.\n  Now, in talking about immigrants who have come in illegally, we have \nan article from CNS News, Terence Jeffrey, this month: ``Obama Claims \nPower to Make Illegal Immigrants Eligible for Social Security, \nDisability.'' The article asked the question: ``Does the President of \nthe United States have the power to unilaterally tell millions of \nindividuals who are violating Federal law that he will not enforce that \nlaw against them now, that they may continue to violate that law in the \nfuture, and that he will take action that makes them eligible for \nFederal benefit programs for which they are not currently eligible due \nto their unlawful status?''\n  I recall sitting right back there on the aisle, my friend Joe Wilson \nwas sitting right over in the middle of this section over here, and the \nPresident was standing at this second level here, because that is where \nnon-Members of the House have to stand to address this body if they are \ninvited, as he was. He made statements about how his bill would not \nprovide health insurance or healthcare provisions for people that were \nillegally here for abortion. My friend Joe Wilson just erupted--such a \nrighteous man, he couldn't contain himself--and yelled out, ``You \nlie.''\n\n  Now, we have House rules--and I know every time I bring this up or \ntalk about this House rule against my friends in the Parliamentarian's \noffice, paying real close attention to make sure I don't violate the \nrule myself, well, they start listening very carefully. Well, they \nalways listen carefully, but even more carefully.\n  But in talking hypotheticals, if a President or someone speaking \nofficially in this House to either the House or a joint session makes a \nstatement--and I am talking hypothetically. I am not saying the \nPresident did because I know that would violate the rule. But \nhypothetically, if he made a statement that is a bald-faced lie and \nsomebody points out that it is a lie and it turns out the person that \nsaid it is a lie is 100 percent right, it makes you wonder about the \npropriety of the rule if the rule says somebody is lying and somebody \nelse points it out, and the one that points it out is at fault.\n  We do get into some tricky issues when it comes to areas of \nimpeachment because it is real hard to make a case for impeachment if \nyou can't talk about somebody that is in a position of authority in the \nFederal Government having violated the law in order to justify the term \nof high crimes and misdemeanors. So it gets kind of delicate in here at \ntimes trying to figure these things out.\n  But regardless of whether anybody thinks the President lied or told \nthe truth, I am not getting into that because I don't want to violate \nthe House rule while I am trying to make my point. But here in this \nroom, the President said basically people who are illegally here, they \nare not going to get the health insurance and not going to pay for \nabortion.\n  Well, we know not only is it paying for abortion, but this \nadministration will actually go to court and come after the Little \nSisters of the Poor, these precious nuns who committed their lives to \nhelping people less fortunate, basically a vow of poverty. They don't \nlive lavishly. Their lives, like Mother Teresa's, are intended to \nbetter other people's lives.\n  And this administration decides it is not the people that are \nviolating our laws of immigration that they are going to come after, it \nis not people that steal Social Security numbers to use them to get \nrefunds fraudulently from the American taxpayers, they want to litigate \nwith the Little Sisters of the Poor. They want to litigate with \nChristians devoted to helping others but who believe with deeply held \nreligious beliefs like so many of our Founders had, like the Founders \nof Harvard and Yale had when they required students basically to take a \npledge of allegiance that the most important aspect of life is living \nfor Jesus Christ, our Savior and Lord. And you go back and look at \nthose oaths.\n  But not this administration. To them, it is more important to go \nafter some precious, sacred, caring nuns who say: We will do anything, \nwe will lay down our lives for others, but you can't ask us to take \nactions that will provide for abortions because we deeply religiously \nbelieve that violates our Biblically-based beliefs, so please.\n\n[[Page H1735]]\n\n  No. This administration will meet them at the Supreme Court and \ndemand these nuns give up their religious convictions, give up what \nthey have dedicated their lives to stand for. Why? Because to them an \nabortion is more important.\n  As I am running out of time, I want to also call attention today to \nsomething that became very important to me, having visited Nigeria to \nvisit with a couple of dozen or so moms of daughters who were kidnapped \nby Boko Haram, basically shedding my State Department protection so I \ncould go 2 or 3 hours to meet with them because they wouldn't initially \ncome into the city to do that, having prayed with them and their \npastor, wept with them and a few girls that were able to escape.\n  It was 2 years ago tonight that 276 schoolgirls were kidnapped by \nradical Islamists not because they were girls on this occasion. They do \nbelieve girls are inferior. They can't bring themselves to accept what \nwe here know: we are equal in God's eyes. In some ways, ladies are \nsuperior, but not to Boko Haram, not to radical Islamists. They are \nbasically property. The school was not attacked because they were \ngirls. I asked that. No, they can't stand girls. They see them as \nproperty, something to be raped and traded into sex slavery. But the \nreason they attacked the school is because it is a Christian school.\n  Having talked to leaders there, religious leaders, and learning that \nour administration not only has done nothing significant to help them \nget their girls back other than launch a campaign based on \n#bringbackourgirls, but we haven't given them the information they need \nto get the girls released. We don't have to send troops, put boots on \nthe ground.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  There are things we could do to help them; but according to the \ninformation we have gotten, this administration says: Well, if you want \nour help in getting these precious girls released, you are going to \nhave to start to change your law and allow for gay marriage. Also, you \nare going to have to start paying for abortions.\n  As a Catholic bishop in Nigeria said: Our religious beliefs are not \nfor sale to President Obama or to anybody else.\n  God bless him. God strengthen him.\n  Our tribute goes to those families. We need to do more to help them. \nTwo years ago today, that horrible thing occurred.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1735-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Payne (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today and April 15 on \naccount of official business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/house-section/article/H1735-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATE ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  The Speaker announced his signature to enrolled bills of the Senate \nof the following titles:\n\n       S. 483.
