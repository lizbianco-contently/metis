Too often we use religion to divide and justify one group's \ntriumph over another. Save us from the tyranny of hate, greed, and the \nfear of our enemies.\n  Renew our political engagement and cultivate generosity, patience, \ncivility, and collegiality. Guide us to discern and honestly articulate \nour own deeply held values. Open our hearts to listen to and equally \nvalue our partners.\n  Restore our commitment to democratic values and strengthen us to \npractice them skillfully. Help us contend and wrestle with the issues \nand not each other.\n  Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/16/house-section/article/H6979-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE JOURNAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
