The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, it was interesting to listen to some of \nthe congressional reactions after the United Nations Security Council \non Monday unanimously approved a resolution that creates a basis for \ninternational economic sanctions against Iran to be lifted.\n  This was a 15-0 vote for the 104-page resolution that lays out the \nsteps required for lifting the United Nations sanctions. Importantly, \nit sets up a way to renew sanctions if Iran does not abide by its \ncommitments.\n  If we get into a dispute over Iran's enrichment activities, these \nsanctions automatically snap back after 30 days; and the United States, \nas a member of the Security Council, could veto any effort to change \nthat. The United States controls the snap back.\n  Congress should not be annoyed but, instead, should understand and \nappreciate the unanimous support from the major countries that helped \nsecure the agreement and enforce sanctions in the first place.\n  The United States did not bring Iran to the negotiating table by \nitself. We have been sanctioning Iran for years with far more stringent \nand stronger economic body blows, but they didn't bite until we were \njoined by other powerful countries.\n  It required Japan and India not to buy Iranian oil and the unanimous \nsupport of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany, the so-called P5+1, \nto hammer this out.\n  This is vital information for Congress to evaluate. Were we to walk \naway from this historic international agreement that has the \nparticipation of all the other major powers and the consumers of \nIranian oil, we would be on our own.\n  If we repudiate this hard-fought, carefully crafted diplomatic \nsolution, we will be in an infinitely weaker position, Iran free to go \nabout its business, and the support of those other countries that was \nso vital will melt away.\n  There is a reason why 100 distinguished former administration \nofficials, diplomats, and military officials from all across the \npolitical spectrum with backgrounds in Democratic and Republican \nadministrations alike endorsed the proposal this week.\n  This is the best solution in a difficult part of the world with a \ncountry that has been difficult to work with, to say the least, that \nhas been involved with bad behavior and which has been bent on \ndeveloping the capacity to create a nuclear weapon. We all want to \nprevent that or at least delay it as long as possible.\n  This agreement achieves that additional time, 10 years or more. It \nhas strong, enforceable sanctions in the event of failure; and the \ninspections regime, the controls over the Iranian nuclear power program \ncontinue for 10 years or more. Some are permanent.\n  This is a watershed moment in American diplomacy, an opportunity to \nget past the troubled history for decades on a more positive footing. \nIran, to this point, has lived up to its agreements; and we have \nwatched their nuclear activity being dialed back and openness expanded, \nwhich would have been unthinkable 3 years ago.\n  Last and most important to consider, the opponents of this agreement \nhave no good alternative. They may huff and puff about all options \nbeing on the table; but realistically, the American public has little \nappetite for a war with Iran, a country bigger than Afghanistan and \nIraq combined, with a population more than twice as large, well-\neducated and sophisticated.\n  An attack would bring about unthinkable circumstances, even if the \nAmerican public were likely to accept it, which is highly unlikely; \nand, of course, the United States will have squandered the alliance \nwith the world's most powerful countries. They are aligned with us \ntoday, but it would be difficult, if not impossible, to get them back \non our side again if we can't take yes for an answer.\n  Congress should stop hyperventilating, look at the evidence, and we \nshould move forward to support diplomacy as our best chance to prevent \na nuclear-armed Iran and chaos in the Middle East.\n\n[[Page H5336]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5336-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                ARREST STATISTICS REPORTING ACT OF 2015\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Graves of Louisiana). The Chair \nrecognizes the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Brooks) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, America's policymakers face an \ninformation gap that undermines our ability to make the immigration \npolicy decisions needed to protect American lives from the threat posed \nby illegal aliens.\n  What information gap? It is crime statistics that reflect criminal \nconduct by illegal aliens.\n  The horrifying murder of 32-year-old Kate Steinle in San Francisco \nhas, once again, put crime by illegal aliens in the national spotlight; \nbut this issue should always be in the spotlight because it daily \naffects American citizens across the country, despite pro-amnesty \nforces' best efforts to suppress politically inconvenient truths about \nillegal alien crime in America.\n  The fact is America's crime data for illegal aliens is inadequate. \nWhile we have access to Federal sentencing data for illegal aliens, \nillegal aliens crime data for cities, counties, and States is just not \nthere. For example, while illegal aliens are roughly 3.5 percent of \nAmerica's population, the United States Sentencing Commission data \nreflects that, out of 74,911 Federal sentencing cases, illegal aliens \ncommitted 17 percent of drug trafficking, 20 percent of kidnapping/\nhostage taking, 12 percent of money laundering, 12 percent of murders, \nand a whopping 74 percent of drug possession felonies.\n  If this Federal data is any indicator, illegal aliens are far more \nlikely to commit violent and dangerous crimes than the average American \nor lawful immigrant. The absence of State and local law enforcement \ndata is critical because most heinous crimes--such as murder, rape, \nviolent assaults, and the like--are prosecuted at the State level.\n  As of today, the Federal Government does not publicly report State \nand local illegal alien crime data, thus undermining our understanding \nof how bad the illegal alien crime problem is and what we must do to \naddress it.\n  A report released this past Monday, July 20, by the Center for \nImmigration Studies found that, according to Census Bureau data, 2.5 \nmillion illegal aliens, at the rate of 400,000 per year, have been \nadded to America's illegal alien problem since President Obama took \noffice. America's policymakers need empirical data showing how many \nAmericans are horribly victimized by the millions of illegal aliens \nthis and other administrations have allowed into our country.\n  While we have daily access to the endless stream of anecdotal, \ngruesome news reports of yet another illegal alien taking yet another \nAmerican citizen's life, we need ``big picture'' data to rebut the \nliberal left's mantra that illegal aliens are as clean, innocent, and \npure as freshly fallen snow.\n  For example, in my district, which has Redstone Arsenal, one of \nAmerica's premier military facilities, more Americans have been killed \nby illegal aliens than my district has lost in Afghanistan, in Iraq, to \nthe Islamic State, to al Qaeda, and to the Taliban combined.\n  Is Alabama's Fifth Congressional District's experience with illegal \naliens an anomaly? Or is illegal alien crime as bad in the rest of \nAmerica?\n  Mr. Speaker, in order to make good policy decisions, America's \npolicymakers need better data. I have introduced a bill to help. My \nbill, the Arrest Statistics Reporting Act, does two things.\n  First, it requires that arrest reports already sent to the FBI by \nState and local governments include the best known immigration status \nof the arrestee. Second, it requires the Federal Government to publish \nillegal alien crime data in the FBI's annual crime statistics reports.\n  This data will better inform the public and lawmakers about illegal \nalien crime and empower us to make the decisions needed to protect \nAmerican lives.\n  Mr. Speaker, honest immigration debate requires the best crime data. \nMy bill, the Arrest Statistics Reporting Act, will help us obtain it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5336-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5336-H5337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VIOLENCE IN MEXICO\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Schiff) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, Americans were riveted \nby news that infamous drug lord Joaquin Guzman, better known as El \nChapo, had escaped from a maximum security prison in Mexico.\n  It took this spectacular movie-style breakout to return Mexico and \nits drug cartels to our national attention, and that is a problem.\n  When ruthless, barbaric criminals terrorize an innocent population \nhalfway around the world, America notices. We rightly rise up as one to \ndecry the horrific violence perpetrated by ISIL in Syria and Iraq, \nrecoiling in horror at the news of rapes, beheadings, and savagery run \namok; yet, when similar violence is visited upon an innocent population \nin our own backyard, why are we not similarly outraged?\n  Earlier this year, Aide Nava was beheaded by ruthless thugs not \nhalfway around the world, but in the Mexican state of Guerrero, less \nthan 1,000 miles from the U.S. border. Ms. Nava's death was not an \nisolated incident, nor was it random. She was a candidate for mayor of \nher town. Her husband had been mayor until last year, when he was \nassassinated.\n  A note found near her body warned of similar treatment for other \npoliticians who did not fall in line and was signed ``Los Rojos,'' the \nname of one of Guerrero's largest criminal organizations.\n  If violence in the state of Guerrero sounds familiar, it should. In \nthe town of Iguala in Guerrero, just last year, 43 students engaged in \na peaceful protest were kidnapped, murdered, and cremated in a mass \ngrave.\n  Those 43 are but a tiny fraction of the tens of thousands of Mexicans \nwho have been murdered by Mexican drug cartels over the last decade, \nincluding at least four candidates and more than a dozen campaign \nworkers during this year's midterm elections. Disturbingly, violence \nagainst women in particular has skyrocketed, and the rate at which \nwomen are murdered in Mexico is now double the global average.\n  Meanwhile, a cowed and corrupt leadership seems powerless to stop any \nof this and may even be actively abetting the violence.\n  We know that drug use in the United States has regrettably \ncontributed to the conditions that have allowed this violence to \nspread. The money that fuels the drug cartels comes in large part from \nnarcotics sales north of the Rio Grande.\n  Just as the drugs flow north, the guns flow south. I have addressed \nthis Chamber in support of legislation countering the sale of guns \nthrough ``straw purchasers,'' which are then sent across the border.\n  This mutually destructive trade of guns and drugs cannot be allowed \nto continue unabated. More sensible treatment of drug addiction at home \nand more commonsense gun laws would not only help our own country, but \nalso reduce chaos in the neighborhood.\n  The U.S. has done much to assist Mexico in countering cartel \nviolence, primarily through the Merida Initiative, a counterdrug and \nanticrime assistance package.\n  Since 2008, we have provided Mexico with over $2.5 billion for the \nMerida Initiative, whose strategy focuses on disrupting criminal \ngroups, institutionalizing the rule of law, creating a 21st century \nborder, and building strong and resilient communities.\n  The reforms or money supports have been painfully slow in coming. It \nis still the case that only 25 percent of the crimes in Mexico are \nreported, fewer than 5 percent are investigated, and fewer than 2 \npercent ultimately move to trial and sentencing.\n  The problem in Mexico is not simply a lack of resources; it appears \nto be a lack of will. The active presence of corruption and official \ncollusion squelches free speech, causing citizens to fear their elected \nofficials, allowing the rule of law to fail.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Those 43 murdered students appear to have been killed with the \nknowledge and participation of the local police force on orders from \nIguala's mayor and his wife. It is a dramatic story, but not unusual \none, a story of corruption and impunity in officialdom.\n  Sadly, those who tell the story, including journalists, human rights \nactivists, and even brave victims willing to speak out, too often meet \nfates similar to the students of Iguala.\n\n[[Page H5337]]\n\n  Indeed, within the last months, three journalists have been murdered \nin three different Mexican states, joining the tragic toll of more than \n50 Mexican journalists killed or disappeared since 2007.\n  I wish, Mr. Speaker, I stood before you today with a simple solution \nto these problems. I do not. But I do know that the struggle of the \nMexican people for a peaceful, safe, and well-governed nation is our \nstruggle as well. They must know that we are paying attention and that \nwe recognize that Mexico's problems are also our own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5337-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNevada (Mr. Hardy) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the unfortunate Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Act.\n  This week marks the fifth anniversary of the signing of the law that \nwas the Democratic answer to the recession that impacted our Nation.\n  My State, the State of Nevada, was devastated by the meltdown which \nstarted with the weakening of the credit standards, and it erupted into \nforeclosures that brought our fiscal system to the edge of the cliff.\n  At the peak of the recession, Nevada had an unemployment rate of 13.7 \npercent. Nevadans all over the State were losing their jobs, their \nhomes, and their businesses.\n  The Democratically controlled Congress and the Democratically \ncontrolled White House responded with regulation after regulation on \nthe false pretense that the crash was caused by the lack of rules.\n  Five years in and what do we have today? We have for the first time \nin over three decades more small businesses failing than being started. \nThink about that. We have more small business deaths than we have small \nbusiness births.\n  The life blood of our Nation lies with small businesses. According to \nthe 2012 data from the Small Business Administration, 64 percent of all \nprivate-sector jobs were created by small businesses. Half of all \npeople employed in this country work for small businesses.\n  I am going to repeat we now have more small business deaths than we \nhave small businesses being started. They are being suffocated by 400 \nnew Federal regulations.\n  One-size-fits-all rules have impacted small bankers, so much that we \nhave less community banks now than we had before Dodd-Frank.\n  These small community banks serve my constituents. They serve the \nneighbors of my district. They serve the neighborhoods of our country.\n  These community banks were not the banks making the risky loans. They \nwere building strong relationships with their customers, but now, \nbecause of Dodd-Frank, there are fewer of them.\n  How did Dodd-Frank address Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? It didn't. It \ndidn't reform Fannie or Freddie. Dodd-Frank, in essence, is top-down \ngovernance from Washington bureaucrats.\n  Instead of ending too-big-to-fail, regulators inserted it into law. \nWe now have SIFIs, systemically important financial institutions.\n  If a bank is defined as a SIFI, it will surely be the first to be \nbailed out because they are systemically too important.\n  This presents a problem of moral hazard. Dodd-Frank put it in law \nthat they will be bailed out by Americans and their hard-earned money. \nDodd-Frank was supposed to end this practice and it was supposed to \nprotect the consumer.\n  After 5 years, we now have SIFIs. We now have fewer community banks. \nSimply put, our businesses are facing higher borrowing costs and the \ninability to create jobs.\n  Nevada today has an unemployment rate of 6.9 percent. Nevadans don't \nwant more regulations, they want more jobs. Like all Americans, they \nwant more opportunities. They want access to capital to start their new \ncompanies and businesses.\n  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the burdensome Dodd-Frank law is still \nchurning out final rules. Americans will continue to face the red tape \nduring this slog of a recovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5337-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5337-H5338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Loretta Sanchez) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, last week, thanks to \nthe leadership of the Senate HELP Committee, Chairman Lamar Alexander \nand Ranking Member Patty Murray, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill \nknown as the Every Child Achieves Act that would reauthorize the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. This is the law the Federal \nGovernment has with respect to kindergarten through twelfth grade \neducation.\n  I applaud my Senate colleagues for reaching across the aisle and \nworking collectively in good faith to expand access to early childhood \neducation to improve programs for English language learners and to \nensure accountability in serving our neediest students.\n  It is far from perfect. But in 2002, the reauthorization of the same \nact, known as No Child Left Behind, was implemented.\n  It gave this principle that we would look at the students who are \nfalling through the cracks. It meant to serve our poor and minority \nstudents, students with disabilities, and English learners.\n  After all, let's not forget that the original ESEA, the original one \nin 1965, had an exact declaration of policy that said ``in recognition \nof the special education needs of children of low-income families.'' \nThis landmark legislation in 1965 is a civil rights law.\n  It reaffirmed Brown v. Board of Education. It reaffirmed the 1947 \nMendez v. Westminster decision, which happened in my own district, \nwhich was the precursor to Brown v. Board. It said every child has the \nright to an equal opportunity for a quality education.\n  Let's be honest. We are in the wake of a civil rights movement in \nthis country. When we see tragedies in Ferguson, to Charleston, to \npresidential candidates issuing condemnations to immigrant families who \ncome and who contribute to this country, to milestone victories where \nwe see all individuals throughout the States may choose to marry the \nones that they love, we can no longer ignore the social and the \neconomic issues our great Nation is currently facing.\n  It all starts in our classrooms, in the quality of the education and \nthe fundamental values that we impart to our children.\n  That is why I am also extremely disappointed in the House version of \nthe ESEA where it limits the opportunity for our neediest students.\n  The Student Success Act--this is the one that the Republicans are \nputting forward--would take away $3 billion over the next 6 years from \nthe 32 largest school districts and most diverse school districts in \nour Nation, by the way, many of those students being Black and Latino. \nWhile the Senate's Every Child Achieves Act accomplishes tremendous \nfeats in expanding access, the House bill actually does not.\n  So what do we do? We must make sure that the bills that we pass have \nactions intended in them. The Senate bill, for example, makes actions \noptional when schools are not meeting goals while eliminating \nrequirements for States to identify schools that are in need of \nintervention where it is detrimental to the progress of the children.\n  So laws must require timely State action to address the inequities \nwhere they persist so that we can provide the Federal resources and the \nsupport to the lowest performing schools.\n  Everyone hates talking about accountability. But, without it, we \ncannot help our low-performing students get back on track. Without \nclear expectations for reporting inaction, we are doing a disservice to \nstudents. These students will fall through the cracks.\n  I look around this room and I am proud to say that I am a public \nschool kid and many of us in this Chamber are. We are products of our \nNation's public school systems.\n  Look at us. Our communities have chosen us to be their voice. Our \ncommunities have chosen us to be their advocates and to fight for them \nin the classroom.\n  And I am sure that each of us has had an administrator, a teacher, a \nprincipal, who believed in us and put us on\n\n[[Page H5338]]\n\nthe right track so that we might be where we are today.\n  As I continuously reflect on my own experience, the daughter of poor \nimmigrants from Mexico, first generation and low income and a child \nthat the original ESEA was meant to serve, I ask my colleagues, let's \nwork together and pass a bill that really helps our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5338-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as a subcommittee chair of \nthe Committee on Agriculture, I am committed to safe and affordable \nfood.\n  In recent years, there has been increased interest in where our food \ncomes from and how it is grown. In my view, this movement is long \noverdue, as far too many Americans are removed from the family farm for \nseveral generations.\n  Agriculture is the backbone of rural America, and its success is \ncritical for local economies and to deliver a product every American \nneeds on a daily basis.\n  With a growing world demand for food and less Americans engaged in \nfarming, science and innovation have become essential components of \nagriculture and remain paramount to meet increased demands.\n  Aside from tractors, combines, and physical technology, innovation \nalso extends to biotechnology. Biotech ensures that America will always \nhave the safest, most abundant, and affordable food supply.\n  As world populations continue to increase, producing more food on \nless land will be an ongoing challenge, but one that can be addressed \nthrough advances in biotechnology.\n  With this in mind, there has been an ongoing debate and much \nattention to what have been dubbed GMOs, or genetically modified \norganisms, seeds or crops.\n  Despite the alarmist claims of some, GM products, GM seeds, have \nprovided great benefits to farmers, ranchers, food producers, and \nconsumers.\n  For instance, some varieties of GM seeds have been engineered to host \ngenetic traits that resist certain types of insects, molds or diseases \nthat destroy crops or, in other cases, GM seeds allow for longer \ngrowing seasons or greater crop yields.\n  GM crops have had an enormously positive impact on farmers, ranchers, \nand food producers. GM seeds have also had a positive environmental \nimpact because they have reduced the need for large-scale sprays or \nopen-range distribution of pesticides or insecticides.\n  While some continue to question the safety of consuming GM seeds, the \noverwhelming consensus among the various credible scientific \norganizations, such as the National Academy of Sciences, the World \nHealth Organization, and the American Medical Association, remains.\n  Quite simply, there is no sound scientific evidence that such crops \nor foods are harmful to human health or the environment.\n  In fact, a January 2015 study from the Pew Research Center found that \n88 percent of surveyed scientists believe that GM seeds or crops are \nperfectly safe for human consumption.\n  However, one of the real challenges that has developed regarding GM \nfoods is the lack of a fair and consistent regulatory structure.\n  Recently several States have made attempts to mandate all GM foods \nare labeled as genetically modified organisms. As a result, a patchwork \nof different State laws have begun to emerge over the labeling \nrequirements of GM foods.\n  Now, this is already causing confusion as to how such labeling \nstandards would directly apply to farmers, ranchers, food processors \nand, yes, also regulators.\n  This patchwork of State laws could also create some constitutional \nquestions, should such laws affect interstate commerce and trade.\n  Nearly 80 percent of the food produced in the United States contains \nsome kind of GM product, and the implications of a State-by-State \nlabeling requirement would be vast.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  This week, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 1599, the Safe \nand Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015, in an effort to address this \nconfusion. Because there are so many myths surrounding this debate, \nlet's start with what the bill does.\n  This legislation is squarely centered on State labeling efforts. \nWhile the bill does preclude States from enacting their own GM labeling \nlaws, it also creates a Federal framework for premarket review and \nlabeling of GM foods; or, in other words, the legislation requires the \nFDA to conduct a review of any and all new plant or seed varieties \nbefore such products are commercially available.\n  The bill would also require standards for defining whether a product \nis of the ``GM'' or ``natural.'' The legislation does not prohibit \nStates from outright banning GM crops or writing new relevant laws, but \nwhat the bill will do is give farmers, ranchers, and food producers \nmuch-needed certainty by establishing a unified and clear regulatory \nprocess.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of H.R. 1599, I rise in support of the \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5338-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5338-H5339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CALLING FOR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO INVESTIGATE THE DEATH OF SANDRA \n                                 BLAND\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Al Green) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I stand in the well of the United \nStates House of Representatives today to call to the attention of the \nNation the death of Ms. Sandra Bland, something that has been widely \npublished. Videos have been shown. People can draw their own \nconclusions. But I stand here today because I want to announce that I \njoin the many requesting that the Justice Department impose a thorough \ninvestigation--a thorough investigation.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are some who contend that the Justice Department \nshould not look into this death. I differ. The district attorney, \nhimself, in Waller County--this is where she died--the district \nattorney, himself, is looking into this and has said the death will be \ntreated as a murder investigation.\n  A person who is stopped for a minor traffic violation should not end \nup dead. I think we should all agree that the basic premise is that, if \nyou are stopped for a minor traffic violation, even if you are taken \ninto custody, you should not be found dead in your jail cell.\n  It is said that she died from self-inflicted asphyxiation, a very \npolite way to say that she committed suicide. Under these questionable \ncircumstances, the district attorney investigated. It is said that the \nFBI is looking into it. It is said that local constabulary will look \ninto it in the State of Texas.\n  Why not have the Justice Department look into it? This is what the \nJustice Department is for, to look into these questionable \ncircumstances of which too many have occurred as of late and, quite \nfrankly, over a substantial period of time in our country. So this is a \nquestionable case, and I believe this is a case ripe for the Justice \nDepartment to investigate.\n  I want to let the family know--and by the way, I don't know them. I \ndidn't know Ms. Bland. I have no association with them. This is not \nabout her ethnicity, and it is not about her gender. But I want the \nfamily to know that I am in sympathy with them, and I feel a certain \namount of pain. I cannot feel their pain, but I feel a certain amount \nof pain because I believe that, if I had a daughter and if my daughter \nwere arrested for a minor traffic violation or as a result of an \ninitial stop for a minor traffic violation and my daughter was found \ndead in a jail cell some time thereafter with an allegation of suicide, \nI would want that case investigated, and I believe most people of \ngoodwill would want to see an investigation.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I am addressing those who contend that there should \nbe no Justice Department investigation. I have great sympathy for this \nfamily--I want you to know that--and I believe there ought to be such \nan investigation. If this case isn't ripe for a Justice Department \ninvestigation, I am not sure that we can conjure up in our\n\n[[Page H5339]]\n\nminds a case that is more ripe under these circumstances.\n  Finally this, Mr. Speaker, I think we have to ponder the question: \nHave we accorded the constabulary the right to do wrong such that \nwrongdoing can be justified because it has been codified in the law \nthat you have the right to do certain things?\n  I think we have to ponder this question because what happened in this \ncase is highly questionable and highly suspect. I say this as a student \nof jurisprudence, a member of the bar, and a former judge of a court \nthat held probable cause hearings. I have seen my share. But I know \nthat in this case, the Justice Department should investigate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will continue to pray for this family and pray for \njustice to be done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5339-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5339-H5340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN AND OUR NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this morning to talk \nfor a few minutes about the primary issue that my constituents are \ntalking about right now, and that is the issue of national security, \nhomeland security, and how what is happening in the world is affecting \nour communities right where we live and work and where our children go \nto school. Isn't that what everyone wants to know: that we are going to \nbe safe, that our children are going to be safe, and that future \ngenerations are going to be safe here in the United States?\n  Mr. Speaker, as we look at these issues of illegal immigration, as we \nlook at ISIS and the threats that are carried out, such as what \nhappened in Chattanooga, and as we look at the Iran deal, we know this \naffects where we live and where we work.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, I want to spend just a few minutes talking about \nthe Iran nuclear deal.\n  One of the members, retired, of a military organization, MOAA, came \nup to me Saturday as I was talking to them. He said: Marsha, this is a \nbad, bad deal. It is a bad, bad deal.\n  I have got to agree with him. It is. Of course, he speaks from the \nperspective of having worn the uniform and served, having had a full \nmilitary career. It is interesting. They know a bad deal when they see \none, and in this Iran nuclear deal that is proposed, they see the \ntenets of a very bad deal.\n  Let's look at a few of these components that will not serve us and \nfuture generations, our national security, or our homeland security \nwell.\n  As you review this deal, you see that Iran retains the ability to \nenrich uranium. That does not stop. It is going to continue on. We can \nalready see how a nuclear Iran would create an arms race in an area \nwhich is already volatile. Any capability to enrich uranium may cause a \nnuclear arms race to happen and further destabilize the Middle East.\n  You see, Mr. Speaker, we are not prohibiting them from doing \nanything. All we are doing is basically setting a date certain 10, 15, \nor 20 years down the road. Now, think about your children and \ngrandchildren 10, 15 or 20 years down the road. If Iran has a nuclear \nweapon, what are they going to say at that point in time? How is it \ngoing to affect them?\n  Think about the region. A Saudi official has said: ``Politically, it \nwould be completely unacceptable to have Iran with a nuclear capability \nand not the kingdom.'' I am quoting a Saudi official's remarks.\n  Any deal must have full transparency, and we need to know that there \ncan be and will be because there must be anytime, anywhere inspections. \nIt is my fear that a deal with Iran is not going to accomplish this.\n  The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday--and, Mr. Speaker, I will \nsubmit this for the Record--``Iran Inspections in 24 Days? Not Even \nClose.'' It was a Wall Street Journal article, and I commend it to my \ncolleagues to read as they review this and think about how they are \ngoing to vote on this deal.\n  The Wall Street Journal stated: ``The Obama administration assures \nAmericans that the Iran deal grants access within 24 days to undeclared \nbut suspected Iranian nuclear sites.''\n  When you look at the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, it reveals \nthat actually it is going to be closer to months. They can end up \nholding inspectors at bay for months.\n  Again, from the Journal I am reading and quoting: ``So from the \nmoment the IAEA first tips its hand about what it wants to inspect, \nlikely three or more months may pass.''\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, I ask you, does this sound like the type of deal \nthat you would want to make with a country whose people recently were \nout chanting ``death to America'' and burning our flag to celebrate the \nMuslim holy day with the Supreme Leader in attendance at that rally? \nDoes this sound like the type of deal that should be approved by our \nSecretary of State and supported by our President? Why? Why would they \nwant to do this? Why would there be a deal that sets a date certain and \nkind of lays out that path? Simply put, there is no way--no way--that \nwe can trust Iran to allow inspectors unfettered access to both \ncivilian and military sites to verify that they are not pushing a \nnuclear weapon. So we would be left wondering if--if--they are going to \nhold up their end of this so-called nuclear deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, a senior commander in the Revolutionary Guard has \nrecently said that inspectors will not be allowed on military sites. \nGeneral Hossein Salami said: ``We will respond with hot lead . . . We \nwill not roll out the red carpet for the enemy.''\n  In addition, Mr. Speaker, it is extremely concerning that Iran is \nasking for sanctions on weapons sales and ballistic missile technology \ntransfers to be lifted. It is a bad, bad deal, as my constituent said. \nI commend further study to my colleagues.\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 21, 2015]\n\n              Iran Inspections in 24 Days? Not Even Close\n\n                  (By Hillel Fradkin and Lewis Libby)\n\n       The Obama administration assures Americans that the Iran \n     deal grants access within 24 days to undeclared but suspected \n     Iranian nuclear sites. But that's hardly how a recalcitrant \n     Iran is likely to interpret the deal. A close examination of \n     the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action released by the Obama \n     administration reveals that its terms permit Iran to hold \n     inspectors at bay for months, likely three or more.\n       Paragraphs 74 to 78 govern the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency's access to suspect sites. First, the IAEA tells Iran \n     ``the basis'' of its concerns about a particular location, \n     requesting clarification. At this point Iran will know where \n     the IAEA is headed. Iran then provides the IAEA with \n     ``explanations'' to resolve IAEA concerns. This stage has no \n     time limit.\n       Opportunities for delay abound. Iran will presumably want \n     to know what prompted the IAEA's concern. The suspect site \n     identified by the IAEA is likely to be remote, and Iran will \n     no doubt say that it must gather skilled people and equipment \n     to responsibly allay IAEA concerns. Iran may offer \n     explanations in stages, seeking IAEA clarifications before \n     ``completing'' its response. That could take a while.\n       Only if Iran's ``explanations do not resolve the IAEA's \n     concerns'' may the IAEA then ``request access'' to the \n     suspect site. Oddly, the agreement doesn't specify who judges \n     whether the explanations resolve concerns. If Iran claims \n     that it has a say in the matter, the process may stall here. \n     Assuming Iran grants that the IAEA can be the judge, might \n     Iran claim that the ``great Satan'' improperly influenced \n     IAEA conclusions? Let's assume that Tehran won't do that.\n       Now the IAEA must provide written reasons for the request \n     and ``make available relevant information.'' Let's assume \n     that even though the IAEA may resist revealing the secret \n     sources or technical means that prompted its suspicions, Iran \n     acknowledges that a proper request has been supplied.\n       Only then do the supposed 24 days begin to run. First, Iran \n     may propose, and the IAEA must consider, alternative means of \n     resolving concerns. This may take 14 days. Absent \n     satisfactory ``arrangements,'' a new period begins.\n       During this period Iran, ``in consultation with'' the Joint \n     Commission, will ``resolve'' the IAEA concerns ``through \n     necessary means agreed between Iran and the IAEA.'' The Joint \n     Commission includes China, France, Germany, Russia, the U.K, \n     the U.S., the European Union and, of course, Iran. Not \n     exactly a wieldy bunch.\n       The Iranians will likely claim that ``consultation'' with \n     the Joint Commission doesn't bind Tehran, just as the U.S. \n     president isn't bound by consultations with Congress. The \n     agreement says the consultation process will not exceed seven \n     days, but Iran can point out that the nuclear deal doesn't \n     specify when Iran and the IAEA must reach agreement and \n     ``resolve'' IAEA concerns.\n       In the absence of Iran-IAEA agreement, a majority of the \n     Joint Commission has seven days to ``advise'' on the \n     ``necessary means'' to resolve the matter. Iran may fairly \n     argue that the commission's right to ``advise'' is\n\n[[Page H5340]]\n\n     not the same as a right to ``determine'' the ``necessary \n     means.'' Lastly, the agreement provides that ``Iran would \n     implement the necessary means within 3 additional days.'' But \n     what ``necessary means'' are these? As noted, the agreement \n     refers to ``necessary means agreed between Iran and the \n     IAEA.'' So these additional three days don't even begin until \n     an agreement is reached.\n       Now what? Well, the U.S. may take a ``Dispute'' to the \n     Joint Commission, on which Iran sits, which has 15 days to \n     resolve the issue. Parties may or may not invoke a similar 15 \n     days for foreign ministers to act. Parties may also request a \n     nonbinding opinion within 15 days from an advisory board \n     consisting of three members, one appointed by Iran, one by \n     the complaining country and ``a third independent member.''\n       But Iran may argue that nothing in the nuclear deal \n     specifies how quickly a country must appoint its advisory-\n     board member or even how the ``independent member'' is \n     selected. In short, this stage may take at least 30 days and \n     possibly 45 of consideration at the different levels, but \n     Iran may argue that the last 15 days don't start until an \n     advisory board has been duly formed. Then we get another five \n     days of Joint Commission deliberation, before a disappointed \n     U.S. or other commission member seeking IAEA inspections can \n     hobble off to the United Nations seeking resolutions \n     reimposing sanctions.\n       In short, as Iran is free to interpret the agreement, 63 or \n     even 78 days may pass, plus three potentially lengthy periods \n     that Iran can stretch out: One of ``explanations'' before the \n     clock starts, one to agree on necessary means and ``resolve \n     concerns,'' and one for advisory-board selection near the \n     end.\n       So from the moment the IAEA first tips its hand about what \n     it wants to inspect, likely three or more months may pass. \n     All along, the Joint Commission is required to act in ``good \n     faith,'' and to make only ``minimum necessary'' requests \n     limited to verification, not ``interference.'' Tehran could \n     also cite these terms to challenge particular requests.\n       The description of this process is based on the English-\n     language text of the nuclear agreement. The text lacks a \n     provision that it is the entire agreement, so Iran may claim \n     support in supposed side agreements or statements during \n     negotiations.\n       Announcing this ``comprehensive, long-term'' deal, \n     President Obama quoted President Kennedy's 1961 call for \n     negotiations with the Soviets. Kennedy reached two notable \n     nuclear agreements. Mr. Obama didn't mention that within a \n     decade of Kennedy's 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty, Soviet \n     nuclear forces--once a fraction of America's--were at parity \n     or had surpassed ours.\n       During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy reached \n     secret agreements--undisclosed to Americans for decades--not \n     to invade Cuba and to withdraw U.S. weapons from Turkey. By \n     invoking Kennedy was President Obama signaling there is more \n     to this ``long-term'' deal than we know?\n       He is a subtle man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5340-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nOhio (Mrs. Beatty) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join many of my Democratic \ncolleagues to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act \nof 1965 and to ask this House to pass legislation for voting rights \nnow.\n  Mr. Speaker, this was the first nation in our history to be founded \nwith a purpose. Great phrases of that purpose are still being said and \nquoted around the world from the souls and hearts of Americans: ``All \nmen are created equal,'' and, ``Give me liberty or give me death.'' \nThose words were not to be revered as meaningless, to ring hollow over \nthe years. Today I join my colleagues as guardians of that liberty and \nadvocates for voting rights legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago before Congress, President LBJ said: ``I \nwant to be the President who helped the poor to find their way and who \nprotected the right of every citizen to vote in every election.''\n  ``Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote. There is \nno reason which can excuse the denial of that right. There is no duty \nwhich weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that \nright.''\n  Mr. Speaker, from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Martin Luther \nKing delivered his ``Give Us the Ballot'' speech, urging the President \nand Members of Congress to ensure voting rights for African Americans. \nHe indicted both political parties for betraying the cause of justice. \nHe said--let us be reminded of these words--``The Democrats have \nbetrayed it by capitulating to the prejudices and undemocratic \npractices of the Southern Dixiecrats. The Republicans have betrayed it \nby capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of the right wing, reactionary \nNortherners. These men so often have a high blood pressure of words and \nan anemia of deeds.''\n  Mr. Speaker, today I ask Democrats and Republicans to come together \nfor voting rights legislation now.\n  Over the past 50 years, our country has come a long way: the end of \nJim Crow, integration of our public schools, and the election of our \nfirst Black President. While we have made great progress over the past \n50 years, we must continue to fight for justice and equality at the \npolls.\n  In the past few Presidential elections, we have seen long lines, \nintimidation, and voter suppression. We must remain diligent in our \nefforts to root out voting discrimination because of the Supreme \nCourt's misguided decision in 2013 in the Shelby County v. Holder \nmatter and the failure of Congress to remedy this dismantling of our \nNation's fundamental rights. We must be more vigilant than ever.\n  Two years ago, in Shelby, the Supreme Court struck down a critical \npart of the Voting Rights Act. Some would say it cut the heart of the \nVoting Rights Act by finding section 4 unconstitutional.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  This was a setback to our country and to our democracy by removing \nmuch-needed voting protections in disenfranchised communities. Our \ndemocracy was founded on the audacious idea that every eligible citizen \nshould have access to the ballot box.\n  This is why I am proud to stand with over 70 bipartisan congressional \ncolleagues as an original cosponsor of the Voting Rights Advancement \nAct of 2015, H.R. 2867, which would restore and advance the critical \nvoter protections taken away by the Shelby decision.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to bring voting rights legislation to \nthe floor. Now, more than ever, with just 7 legislative days left, we \nhead back to our districts for our August work period. Congress should \nhonor the progress of being able to allow us to say to our \nconstituents, to this Nation, that our country has made sure that there \nis equal rights and equal treatment.\n  Let us work together on advancing important legislative priorities, \nsuch as the Voting Rights Amendment Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5340-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5340-H5341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APOLLO 11 MISSION, 46 YEARS LATER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Hultgren) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and celebrate a \nmonumental achievement our Nation's space program reached 46 years ago \nthis week. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Michael \nCollins, and the entire NASA team transformed the world's belief in \nwhat was possible.\n  Following President Kennedy's charge to land a man on the Moon and \nreturn him safely to the Earth before the decade was over, NASA put \ntheir talent and treasure into making that dream a reality. No longer \nwas human discovery and exploration limited to our own planet. The \nMoon, which had always been beyond our human ability to reach, was now \nwithin our grasp.\n  This ``giant leap for mankind'' propelled American space exploration \nand inspired generations to pursue science and research as a way of \nlife. Today, human space exploration and discovery sciences are \nengrained in American society and are prime demonstrations of our \nNation's exceptional nature. As Americans, it is in our DNA to push the \nboundaries and frontiers of knowledge.\n  Developing new technologies and expertise is vital as we consider a \nmission to Mars, take closeup photos of Pluto, and send robots \nthroughout our solar system. The new generation must now work to \nfulfill the dreams and ambitions of that first group of space \nexplorers.\n  Let us encourage our children to think seriously about careers in \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics--careers that could \nlead them to become actual rocket scientists or astronauts. Bold, long-\nterm commitments to the projects that made NASA and our space program \ngreat will help inspire our kids.\n  The Apollo 11 mission changed America and the world, and we remain \nforever grateful to those who were a part\n\n[[Page H5341]]\n\nof that mission. Forty-six years ago, if the unthinkable occurred and \nthe astronauts never made it back to Earth, President Nixon had a \nspeech prepared to deliver to the Nation.\n  If the worst happened, the President would have said:\n\n       In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes \n     in the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, \n     but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.\n\n  I was honored to meet the members of the Apollo 11 crew, including \nNeil Armstrong before he died. Indeed, these men were epic heroes of \nmine. Many of us grew up in an era where we were proud to be the Nation \nthat sent men to the Moon, and we still are. Nothing can change that \nfateful decade of discovery coupled with frustration, trial coupled \nwith error, all resulting in that historic world-changing mission.\n  I want our kids and grandkids to look back and be proud citizens of \nthe Nation that made our Moon hospitable, sent astronauts to Mars, and \nkeeps sending spacecraft past the outer reaches of our solar system. \nRenewed vigor in our country's space program will ensure we continue to \nmake mankind-sized leaps for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5341-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CLOSURE OF COLOWYO COAL MINE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Tipton) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, mines in Colorado's Third Congressional \nDistrict provide not only critical jobs, they also provide the \nreliable, affordable electricity on which countless Americans rely.\n  The future of one such mine, operated by Colowyo in Moffat County, is \nnow in jeopardy after a Federal judge sided with a radical \nenvironmental group notorious for filing lawsuits, at the expense of \ntaxpayers who often end up footing their litigation bill.\n  I am urging the Department of the Interior to take swift action to \nprevent the impending closure of the Colowyo mine, and I want to thank \nSenator Cory Gardner for his partnership in this effort.\n  On May 8, 2015, the Federal district court for the district of \nColorado issued an order determining that the Office of Surface Mining \nfailed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act in 2007, \nwhen it issued a mine plan for approval of the Colowyo coal mine.\n  The court gave OSM 120 days to be able to prepare a new analysis and \nissue a new decision. If OSM does not complete the process in 120 days, \nthe court stated that it would vacate the mine plan, effectively \nshutting down the mine on September 6.\n  Unfortunately, despite repeated insistence from myself, Senator \nGardner, county officials, and the surrounding local communities, this \nadministration decided against appealing the court's ruling.\n  We have to ask the question: Does not the executive branch have a \nduty to defend its permitting actions? Of course, it does. The Federal \nGovernment must vigorously defend the legality of its permitting \nactions and leave policy debates over the role of coal in the \nlegislative and rulemaking proceedings where those debates belong.\n  Here is where we stand as the September 6 deadline approaches. The \nlivelihoods of thousands of northwest Coloradans are in peril, as they \nrely on an administration with a track record of attacks on the mining \nindustry and affordable electricity to do the right thing. \nUnfortunately, this administration hasn't done much to allay our \nconcerns.\n  A mine closure would jeopardize 220 direct jobs and millions in \neconomic activity. While 220 jobs may not sound like much, to the town \nof Craig, population 9,400, that has a significant economic impact on \nthis community.\n  To properly be able to understand the scale of this potential \ncatastrophe, this is equivalent to the President's hometown of Chicago \nshedding 63,000 well-paying jobs.\n  The adverse effects of shutting down this mine go beyond the jobs at \nthe mine that would be lost. Coal produced by this mine, located in \nMoffat and Rio Blanco Counties, is used to generate power at Craig \nStation. The mine is a critical supplier of western Colorado's energy. \nIt provides reliable, affordable electricity in much of the western \nhalf of the State.\n  Last week, I attended a meeting to discuss the future of the Colowyo \nmine in Glenwood Springs with Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell; \nBureau of Land Management Director Neil Kornze; and a number of western \nColorado community leaders, including Moffat County Commissioner John \nKinkaid and Craig Mayor Ray Beck.\n  While it would have been preferable for the Secretary to make time to \nbe able to meet with the miners in Moffat County who are facing the \nloss of their livelihood, look them in the eye, and hear their stories, \nshe did meet with this group; and I hope that she received a better \nunderstanding of the important impact of the Colowyo mine on the impact \nof the economy in northwest Colorado.\n  I was pleased to be able to hear Secretary Jewell assure us before \nthe meeting that the Department of the Interior is on schedule to be \nable to complete a new environmental assessment by the court's deadline \nof September 6; and, if for some reason they fail to meet that \nschedule, they will request an extension.\n  I hope the Secretary realizes that the decisions made in Washington \nhave lasting impacts on everyday working Americans. Unfortunately, we \nhave seen repeated attempts by this administration to impose drastic \nand, in some cases, outright unattainable mandates on the existing \nelectricity sources.\n  Communities such as Craig have expressed concerns that these proposed \nregulations will work to the detriment of the local economies by \nshutting down local power plants, negatively affecting Colorado's \nmining industry, and needlessly burdening Coloradan families and \nbusinesses with higher energy costs; yet here we are on the cusp of \nleaving over 220 honest, hard-working people without a paycheck.\n  This battle offers a vivid and all too familiar lesson in how \nenvironmental special interests, if not balanced against the practical \nneed for a healthy and growing economy, can wreak havoc in the everyday \nlives of Coloradans. The careful balance between environmental \nprotection and economic prosperity is regrettably missing from this \nadministration's policies.\n  The most troubling part of all of this is that the effects of these \nmisguided regulations won't actually result in cleaner air overall, but \nwill jeopardize the reliability of the electrical grid and have a \nsevere economic impact.\n  The people of Moffat County are the people who are feeling these \nimpacts. The people of Moffat County need to know that they are not \nalone in this effort. I am committed to doing everything within my \npower to be able to fight for affordable, reliable, and responsible \nenergy production.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5341-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COAL ASH WASTE DISPOSAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, this week, the House will consider \ndangerous legislation on coal ash that will put communities and \nfamilies in New Jersey in danger. We need strong Federal regulation on \ncoal ash waste. Poor management practices in States like Pennsylvania \nand New York that border New Jersey affect my constituents' lives.\n  The Delaware River provides drinking water to one-third of New \nJersey's municipalities. In 2005, Martins Creek Power Plant in \nPennsylvania spilled 100 million gallons of coal ash across 10 acres \ninto the Delaware, contaminating that drinking water with arsenic. \nTowns surrounding the Delaware, towns that depend on the river for the \nfishing and recreational activity that drives their economies were \ndevastated.\n  In New York, the EPA found that coal ash from a power station had \ncontaminated groundwater with iron, selenium, manganese, aluminum, and \nat least 10 other dangerous chemicals.\n  H.R. 1734 not only fails to protect communities from toxic pollution, \nit undermines legitimate efforts to protect our communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against it. All of our constituents \ndeserve better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5341-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5341-H5342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             AUDIT THE FED\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from\n\n[[Page H5342]]\n\nWest Virginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, few institutions are as \npowerful and as secretive as the Federal Reserve.\n  The Federal Reserve's monetary policy impacts the prices every \nAmerican pays at the grocery store; the ability of businesses to obtain \nthe capital necessary to create new jobs; and the value of investments \nthe average American relies on to provide for their families, educate \ntheir children, and enjoy a secure retirement.\n  Despite the Fed's enormous power, Congress continues to allow the Fed \nto conduct monetary policy in secret. While the Government \nAccountability Office is allowed to perform limited audits of the Fed, \nit is forbidden by law from auditing. In other words, the Congress has \nforbidden the Government Accountability Office from examining how the \nFed conducts monetary policy, its most important function.\n  Allowing the Fed to conduct monetary policy in secret is a failure of \nCongress' duty to carry out meaningful oversight of the Federal \nReserve. Congress and the people we represent deserve to know the full \ntruth about the Federal Reserve.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  This is why one of my first acts upon coming to this House was to \ncosponsor the Federal Reserve Transparency Act, H.R. 24, introduced by \nmy friend Thomas Massie of Kentucky.\n  This simple two-page bill authorizes a full audit of the Fed's \nmonetary functions and is popularly known as ``Audit the Fed.''\n  The passage of this bill will allow the American people to finally \nget a better picture of the Fed's operations, including its dealings \nwith large financial institutions and foreign central banks.\n  Contrary to the claims of the Fed and its supporters, nothing in this \nbill gives Congress any new authority over the Federal Reserve.\n  It simply allows Congress to get a retrospective look at how the Fed \ncarries out monetary policy so that Congress and the people can fully \nunderstand, evaluate, and oversee the Fed's actions.\n  Audit the Fed has twice passed the House by overwhelming majorities \nand is supported by almost 80 percent of the American people. Yet, \nformer Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blocked the bill from coming \nto the floor for a vote in the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Reid's replacement as majority leader, Senator Mitch \nMcConnell, is a cosponsor of S. 264, the Senate version of Audit the \nFed, which has been introduced by Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.\n  It is finally time for a vote in the U.S. Senate as well. The passage \nof Audit the Fed is more important than ever, given the Federal \nReserve's actions since the 2008 financial crisis.\n  Following the financial meltdown, the Fed commenced an unprecedented \nprogram of trillion-dollar bailouts for Wall Street. The Fed's poor \ntrack record over the past decade is not an irregularity.\n  Since the Fed's creation, the dollar has lost 97 percent of its \npurchasing power. Allowing the Federal Reserve to continue operating in \nsecrecy may benefit certain well-placed individuals, but it has not \nbenefited my constituents in West Virginia.\n  It is time to bring transparency to monetary policy. It is time to \ntear down the Fed's wall of secrecy. It is time to audit the Fed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5342-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

We will be faced with this deal and war.\n  Why do I say this? Other countries in the region are going to want \nwhat we have conceded to Iran, especially because we inexplicably \nagreed to a lifting of the arms embargo and a lifting of the sanctions \nagainst the regime's ballistic missile program.\n  So what have we guaranteed with this unverifiable deal?

Let them do \ntheir job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5344-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FAKE OBAMACARE PAYMENTS\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN.

Premiums continue to rise. \nMedical innovation has been stifled. And patients have less choice when \nit comes to their own healthcare decisions.\n  Mr. Speaker, www.healthcare.gov was supposed to include a working \nverification system to ensure that nobody could cheat the system. \nHowever, it is clear from this investigation that there is very little \nfraud protection in place.\n  Mr. Speaker, whether it is through incompetence or apathy, it is \nunacceptable that hard-earned taxpayer dollars are being wasted because \nadministrators aren't implementing fraud protection measures.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nstaunch opposition to H.R. 3009, the Enforce the Law for Sanctuary \nCities Act, or perhaps better titled, the ``Donald Trump Act.'' This \nbill is nothing more than an underhanded ploy to criminalize the \nimmigrant community who, research shows, is less likely to commit \nserious crimes than native-born persons. To demonize an entire \ncommunity based on the actions of a few does not inform wise policy.\n  Local police are best equipped to make decisions of how best to serve \ntheir communities. Let them make those decisions. Withholding Federal \nfunds from jurisdictions who have adopted local trust policies will not \nmake our communities safer or fix our broken immigration system. It \nwill only make it more difficult for local police to provide public \nsafety to their communities.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, this doesn't come as a surprise. This is \nthe same Republican-led Congress that nearly shut down the Department \nof Homeland Security, compromising the safety of our communities.\n  I have consistently said that we need to focus on passing \ncomprehensive immigration reform, yet time and time again, Republicans \nhave shown the only aspect of immigration reform they are interested in \nis deportation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5344-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REMEMBERING BROOKSVILLE'S VICE MAYOR, JOE JOHNSTON\n\n  (Mr. NUGENT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of the \ncity of Brooksville's vice mayor and a good friend of mine, Joe \nJohnston III. Joe was as straightforward and as good as they come. The \nloss of his life has impacted the entire Hernando County community, and \nfor obvious reasons.\n  Joe was a family man. He dedicated his life to his wife, Diana, their \nthree daughters, his two brothers, and seven grandchildren in the same \nplace where his parents raised him. He attended our local schools, \ngraduated from the University of Florida, and moved back to be a \nparalegal in the firm which his father established and helped to build.\n  More often than not, Joe's devotion was indicative of his love for \nthe greater community. Twenty years ago, Joe ran successfully for a \nseat on the Brooksville City Council and proudly served in that seat \nuntil his untimely death just this month.\n  He was compassionate and caring about those around him, whether he \nknew you or not. Joe was known for being a steady hand on the council \nand was never backing down, even when the odds were against him. And \npeople respected that. He became well known in our small town not \nsolely because of his politics or his career; in fact, it was mostly \nwhat he did outside of it. He was an outdoorsman, a traveler, a sailor, \nan adventurer, and a great member of the community.\n  Mr. Speaker, he understood that true appreciation in life comes from \nthe experiences you have and the memories you make, and he embraced it \nwith his all.\n  It pains me that, after 10 years, Joe lost his battle with cancer. So \nI stand here today to remember a leader I valued and to celebrate his \ngreat life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5344-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  (Mrs. CAROLYN B.

Mr. Speaker, only one of the top \nten exporting countries in the world does not have an export-import \nagency that helps them finance new export deals, just one, and that \ncountry is the United States of America. That is because this Congress \nhas failed to do what every Congress since FDR has done, and that is \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, an American exporter is forced to compete against \nChina, South Korea, Germany, France, Italy, and Japan with one hand \ntied behind its back. Their businesses get the support, their citizens \nget the jobs, and Americans are hung out to dry by their own \ngovernment.\n  In my congressional district alone, 66 small businesses in the past 8 \nyears have benefited from Export-Import financing of their exports. \nThey have exported everything from peanut butter to industrial \nequipment.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's give Congress a chance to save American jobs. \nLet's have an up-or-down vote on the Export-Import Bank.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate Piute County's \n150th birthday. Piute County was formed in January 1865, after a year \nof hard work by entrepreneurial Mormon pioneers.\n  Press reported that in only 1 year the settlers had built more than 4 \nmiles of canals and more than 10 miles of roads, all to access the good \nfarmland and timber and other things they would need as they built this \ncommunity. One reporter noted:\n\n       The spirit of industry and perseverance in the people is \n     manifest. Their actions are kind and benevolent towards one \n     another, and they will make this a great place for future \n     generations.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the past 150 years have proven these words to be true. \nToday, the county is home to many hardworking residents, people who \nwork in a uniquely beautiful rural setting. The county enjoys the \nworld-famous Paiute ATV Trail, boating, fishing, hunting, and horseback \nriding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent Piute County. They represent \nsome of the best people our Nation has to offer, and I wish them much \nsuccess as they celebrate their 150th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5344-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5344-H5345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the approaching 50th \nanniversary of the Voting Rights Act and talk about the importance of \nrestoring the Voting Rights Act as well.\n\n[[Page H5345]]\n\n  For decades, the Voting Rights Act has stood as the guardian for all \nAmericans to exercise their right to vote. But 2 years ago, the Supreme \nCourt reversed course on expanding voting rights when it ruled that \nsection 4 of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional. Just hours \nafter that ruling, my home State of Texas immediately began enforcing \ndiscriminatory laws against minority citizens from voting.\n  I sued the State to fight these unconstitutional efforts in Veasey v. \nPerry, which the United States district court agreed that Rick Perry, \nthen the Governor of Texas, signed an intentionally discriminatory \nTexas voter photo ID law. It was under Perry's watch as Governor of \nTexas that the State legislature passed the most egregious voter ID law \nin the entire country.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we await the decision of the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals on Veasey v. Perry, House Democrats will continue to fight \nagainst obstacles to voter participation and talk about the importance \nof restoring the Voting Rights Act. As you can tell by what is going on \nin Texas, it needs to be done now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5345-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FIGHTING FOR THE UNBORN\n\n  (Mr. GUINTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today with a heavy heart.\n  Recently, videos have been released showing senior employees at \nPlanned Parenthood discussing a horrific topic: the proper way to \npreserve the heart, liver, and lungs of a child during an abortion in \norder to harvest those organs for sale.\n  Consider the illogical nature of the conclusion that an infant is not \na life, that an infant is not worthy of preservation, but the organs, \nwhich give it life, are worthy enough to be kept and sold.\n  Pro-life or not, this should strike at the conscience of every human \nbeing, and, in a larger sense, it should strike at the conscience of a \nnation that this practice is permitted and allowed.\n  Following the release of these videos, House leadership called for an \ninvestigation into Planned Parenthood, which I commend and fully \nsupport.\n  I am often asked back home if I consider myself pro-life and, if so, \nwhy. My answer to them is simple: I will never forget hearing my \ndaughter's heartbeat for the first time.

These regulations cover everything from energy to \nhealth care to tax policy. Too many of my constituents are drowning in \nred tape, and they are forced to spend too much money and time \ncomplying with burdensome regulations.\n  Now, I get it; a lot of people in Washington think that they know \nbest. These bureaucrats get in a room, and they start scheming on how \nthey can solve all these problems, and our answer is almost always that \nwe need more rules and regulations.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is entirely the wrong approach. This kind of top-\ndown, Washington knows best strategy is not working, and it is putting \na real burden on my constituents in Alabama and people all over the \ncountry. That is why this rule allows for the consideration of two \nbills that are focused on simplifying the regulatory process in two \nvery important areas, energy and agriculture.\n  Being from Alabama, I know a thing or two about these topics. Anyone \nwho has ever spent time in lower Alabama during July or August knows \njust how hot it can get, so that means families down there have to \nspend a pretty penny on their power bills during these summer months.\n  Well, under the Obama administration's EPA, regulations on the energy \nsector have skyrocketed. The costs from these regulations are most \ncertainly passed on to the consumer in the form of higher power bills, \nand the compliance burdens associated with these regulations are making \nit harder and harder for utilities to deliver reliable power to their \ncustomers.\n  That is why the current enforcement structure of EPA's rule on coal \ncombustion residuals, or CCRs, is so concerning. While most of us were \npleased that the EPA decided to regulate CCR as a nonhazardous solid \nwaste, we are left with civil suits in place of commonsense enforcement \nmeasures to make sure the industry is complying with EPA standards. \nThis creates uncertainty among industry and a patchwork of \ninterpretations by various courts around the country.\n  The EPA rule also creates some unintended consequences when it comes \nto Federal and State jurisdiction. That is why the Improving Coal \nCombustion Residuals Regulation Act empowers States and allows them to \nestablish permit programs to meet or exceed regulatory requirements set \nforth in the EPA's final rule.\n  It only makes sense that each State, with their unique topography and \ngeographic conditions, should be able to set the permitting \nrequirements most appropriate for their conditions in order to meet \nthese EPA standards. In fact, States already govern the disposal of \nsolid and hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery \nAct, or RCRA, and have done so since 1976.\n  It is important to point out that these regulatory reforms do not \nchange the minimum requirements under the EPA rule, which are designed \nto protect human health and the environment. This legislation actually \ncodifies these standards and sets them as the baseline for State \npermitting programs nationwide.\n  Mr. Speaker, I expect that some of my friends on the other side are \ngoing to argue that this legislation, in some way, weakens standards. \nLet me tell you what will result in weakened standards, allowing \ndifferent Federal judges from all across the country to decide how the \nlaw should be interpreted and how standards should be set, despite the \nfact that these judges have no real background in regulatory matters \nregarding these sorts of hazardous wastes, these sorts of wastes at \nall.\n  Instead of that flawed system, let's allow States to create their own \npermitting system, which must comply with the EPA standard. By getting \nfrivolous civil lawsuits out of the way, estimates project that this \nlegislation will protect around 316,000 jobs. If my colleagues on the \nother side think that\n\n[[Page H5347]]\n\nthis is a waste of time, then I want them to tell that to these 316,000 \nfamilies.\n  H.R. 1734 is a good bill that makes some very sensible reforms that \nsimplify the process for the safe management and disposal of coal ash \nwhile providing a realistic enforcement mechanism for existing \nenvironmental standards.\n  The second bill covered by this rule, the Safe and Accurate Food \nLabeling Act, deals with agriculture. Now, agriculture is the top \nindustry in my home State of Alabama, with over 500,000 jobs. I have \nheard from a number of farmers who support this bipartisan legislation.\n  H.R. 1599 will provide much needed clarity and uniformity in the \nlabeling of food products containing genetically engineered plants or \ningredients. This commonsense legislation is supported by almost 500 \nassociations and farmers from Hawaii to Maine.\n  The current regulatory system is a patchwork of State and local \nregulations, which create unnecessary costs among consumers and food \nmanufacturers without really helping to increase consumer awareness. In \nfact, a study by Cornell University found that food prices could rise \nfor American families by as much as $500 a year if something isn't \nchanged.\n  This legislation would streamline the labeling process and create a \nnational, voluntary food labeling standard for products derived from \nGMOs. By doing so, America's farmers and food manufacturers won't be \nburdened with inconsistent and costly regulations.\n  This legislation isn't just good for producers and farmers; it \ncreates a uniform system driven by consumer demand. Under this bill, \nconsumers will be able to easily identify products and make their own \ndecisions about what products are best for them and their families.\n  Mr. Speaker, these bills are both about reducing the regulatory \nburden and simplifying the regulatory process. From consumers to small-\nbusiness owners to rural electric cooperatives to family farmers, \npeople shouldn't have to spend precious time and money figuring out how \nto comply with regulations.\n  Instead, here in Congress, we should be focused on getting government \nout of the way and allowing the American people to actually do their \njob, and that is what both of these bills do.\n\n  This is a fair rule, and I urge its support. The coal ash rule allows \nfor six amendments, all but one of them Democrat amendments. The food \nlabeling rule allows for four amendments, all of them Democrat \namendments, including one amendment that is a complete substitute for \nthe bill.\n  The Rules Committee has worked very hard to make a very fair \namendment process, and I believe that is exactly what this bill has \ndone.\n  I do urge support for this rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama \n(Mr. Byrne) for the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I rise in very strong opposition to this rule, which \nprovides for consideration of H.R. 1599, the so-called Safe and \nAccurate Food Labeling Act, and H.R. 1734, the Improving Coal \nCombustion Residuals Regulation Act.\n  This week, we are back on the floor with our twenty-fourth grab bag \nrule, one rule that governs debate for two completely unrelated \nmeasures. Today, the Republican majority has chosen to group together a \nbill that undermines an EPA rulemaking designed to protect public \nhealth and our environment with a bill designed to make it harder for \nconsumers to know whether or not their food has been produced with \ngenetically engineered ingredients.\n  Utilizing this kind of rule for two completely separate bills leads \nto disjointed debate. It limits the time that people have to be able to \ntalk about these issues, but it is a deliberate attempt by the \nRepublican majority to suppress debate. They don't want to bring \nserious issues to the floor, and they certainly don't want serious \ndebate, and I regret very much that this has become a pattern.\n  I also oppose this rule because neither bill is an open rule. A lot \nof Members, I am sure, have a lot of issues they want to raise on both \nthese bills, but they are not going to have that opportunity. The Rules \nCommittee denied a whole bunch of amendments on the GMO labeling bill \nlast night in committee.\n  I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for \nopen debate and an open process and reject this. Send a message to the \nRepublican leadership that enough is enough.\n  Mr. Speaker, with regard to H.R. 1734, the so-called Improving Coal \nCombustion Residuals Regulation Act, this bill continues the \nRepublicans' antiscience, antienvironment, antipublic health fight. \nThere is not a week that goes by that we don't have a bill that seeks \nto try to undermine regulation or rulemaking that is designed to help \nprotect the people of this country.\n  This bill undercuts EPA's new coal ash rule, putting many communities \nat risk of exposure. Coal ash is highly toxic and needs to be properly \ndisposed of, and the devastating health effects from exposure to \nneurotoxins in coal ash--like lead, mercury, and arsenic--are well \nknown.\n  This bill is just another Republican bill attempting to undermine \ncommon sense, health, and safety protection from toxic chemicals. The \nAmerican people deserve much better. I am glad the White House has \nissued a veto threat against the bill.\n  I include the Statement of Administration Policy in the Record.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n H.R. 1734--Improving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation Act of 2015\n\n        (Rep. McKinley, R-WV, and 44 cosponsors; July 21, 2015)\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1734, because it \n     would undermine the protection of public health and the \n     environment provided by the Environmental Protection Agency's \n     (EPA's) December 2014 final rule addressing the risks posed \n     by mismanaged impoundments of coal ash and other coal \n     combustion residuals (CCR). The 2008 failure of a coal ash \n     impoundment in Kingston, Tennessee, and the 2014 coal ash \n     spill into the Dan River in Eden, North Carolina, serve as \n     stark reminders of the need for safe disposal and management \n     of coal ash.\n       EPA's rule articulates clear and consistent national \n     standards to protect public health and the environment, \n     prevent contamination of drinking water, and minimize the \n     risk of catastrophic failure at coal ash surface \n     impoundments. H.R. 1734 would, however, substantially weaken \n     these protections. For example, the bill would eliminate \n     restrictions on how close coal ash impoundments can be \n     located to drinking water sources. It also would undermine \n     EPA's requirement that unlined impoundments must close or be \n     retrofitted with protective liners if they are leaking and \n     contaminating drinking water. Further, the bill would delay \n     requirements in EPA's final CCR rule, including structural \n     integrity and closure requirements, for which tailored \n     extensions are already available through EPA's rule and \n     through approved Solid Waste Management Plans.\n       While the Administration supports appropriate State program \n     flexibility, H.R. 1734 would allow States to modify or waive \n     critical protective requirements found in EPA's final CCR \n     rule. Specifically, H.R. 1734 authorizes States to implement \n     permit programs that would not meet a national minimum \n     standard of protection and fails to provide EPA with an \n     opportunity to review and approve State permit programs prior \n     to implementation, departing from the long-standing precedent \n     of previously enacted Federal environmental statutes.\n       Because it would undercut important national protections \n     provided by EPA's 2014 CCR management and disposal rule, the \n     Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1734. If the President \n     were presented with H.R. 1734 as drafted, his senior advisors \n     would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am going to spend most of my time \ntalking about the other bill, which I also strongly oppose, H.R. 1599, \nwhich they have titled the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015, \none of the most misnamed pieces of legislation that I think we have \nconsidered this year.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe at the center of the debate about this bill is \nAmericans' fundamental right to know what is in the food they eat and \nhow it is grown. I believe people ought to have the right, plain and \nsimple.\n  This isn't a debate about the science behind GMOs. That is a separate \ndebate. Yet, whether you love GMOs or hate them, you ought to know if \nthe food that you are feeding your family is made from them.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Food and Drug Administration requires the labeling \nof\n\n[[Page H5348]]\n\nthousands of ingredients, additives, and processes, many of which have \nnothing to do with safety or nutrition.\n  For example, the FDA requires the mandatory labeling of juice when it \nis from concentrate. Food labels are a simple and a reliable way to \ntell people what is in their food and how it is made.\n  Americans have told us loud and clear that they want to know what is \nin their food. Poll after poll indicates the widespread support for \nlabeling GMOs. A recent poll by the Mellman Group found that 91 percent \nare in favor of labeling with 81 percent saying they strongly prefer \nGMO labeling.\n  The support for labeling cuts across party identification, gender, \nage--you name it. As well, three States--Vermont, Maine, and \nConnecticut--have listened to their citizens and have passed laws \nrequiring that GMO foods be labeled, and dozens more are considering \nsimilar initiatives, including my home State of Massachusetts.\n  I understand the concern with 50 different States passing 50 \ndifferent State labeling laws. I get it. That is why I support \nmandatory GMO labeling. We need a national standard that eliminates \nconfusion and puts the American people in charge.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us only adds to the confusion. It \ncodifies the existing voluntary labeling system for GMO foods that \nhasn't worked and that hasn't provided consumers the information that \nthey want.\n  It preempts States from responding to consumer demand and requiring \nGMO labeling, and it invalidates State laws already in place. It \ncontinues to allow foods that contain GMOs to be labeled as ``natural'' \ndespite the fact that 60 percent of Americans believe that ``natural'' \nmeans GMO-free.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have a stack of letters here from a variety of \norganizations that are opposed to H.R. 1599--the National Farmers \nUnion--representing family farmers and ranchers across the country.\n  They oppose this bill as well as the Consumers Union, the National \nBlack Farmers, and 125 CEOs and business leaders from Massachusetts and \nacross the country, including Whole Foods Market co-CEO Walter Robb; \nChipotle CEO and chairman Steve Ells; Clif Bar, Inc., CEO Kevin Cleary; \nNewman's Own Organics cofounder Nell Newman; Panera Bread, Inc., CEO \nRon Shaich; Patagonia, Inc., CEO Rose Marcario; American Sustainable \nBusiness Council CEO and cofounder David Levine; Sweetgreen, Inc., \ncofounder Nicolas Jammet; chef and founder of the Think Food Group, \nJose Andres; Craft Hospitality CEO and well-known chef, Tom Colicchio; \nand many, many, many others.\n  The supporters of H.R. 1599 oppose mandatory GMO labeling, claiming \nthat GMO labeling would increase food prices for consumers. This is \njust simply untrue. I want to read a section of a letter from the CEO \nof Ben & Jerry's that proves the point:\n  ``As an ice cream company that operates in more than 30 countries, \nmany of which require mandatory GMO labeling, we are not swayed by \narguments that mandatory labeling will be expensive. The truth is, we \nregularly make changes, sometimes big, sometimes small, to our \npackaging.''\n  He continues:\n  ``Every year, we make changes to between 25% and 50% of our \npackaging. Over the last 7 years, we've gone through three full line \nredesigns. In other words, we have changed the packaging on every \nsingle pint in our product line as a matter of normal business. I can \ntell you unequivocally that changing labels does not require us to \nraise the price of our products. Lots of things impact the cost a \nconsumer pays for a pint of Ben & Jerry's. Label changes are not one.''\n  Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that adding a label to indicate that a \nproduct contains GMOs ought to be pretty straightforward.\n  So, to the supporters of H.R. 1599, I would simply ask: What are you \nafraid of? Why is giving the American people more information about \ntheir food such a bad idea?\n  Perhaps supporters of keeping the American people in the dark believe \nthat, if consumers know that GMOs are in their food, they won't buy it. \nI don't believe that to be the case. I myself consume GMO foods, as \ndoes my family, and we will continue to do so even if there is a label, \nbut that is my choice.\n  H.R. 1599 really is a Washington-knows-best approach. I mean, this is \nthe epitome of a Washington-knows-best approach. It says, We don't care \nwhat people want. We don't care what people think. We politicians in \nWashington know best.\n  I am going to tell you something. That is why people hate Congress. \nThat is why people are frustrated with Congress. They don't think we \nlisten.\n  Let me suggest to my colleagues a radical idea--and brace yourselves \nbecause this is a really, really radical idea--give the American people \nwhat they want.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I was listening to the gentleman's remarks. If he believes that, by \ncodifying the EPA regulation that this bill is undermining the EPA, I \njust don't follow that reasoning. That is what this bill does.\n  It takes the EPA regulation and it codifies it. It puts it into \nstatutory law. It sets it as a minimum, and it allows the State \nregulators who are already regulating solid and hazardous waste to use \nthat as a minimum and to go above it.\n  Far from undermining the EPA's authority here, far from undermining \nthe effort to get a clean environment for the people of America, this \nenhances it by putting it into law and allowing the States to go above \nit if that is what they want to do.\n  What this bill really does that is new and is different from what the \nEPA is trying to do is that it takes the enforcement of this away from \ndifferent Federal courts around the country, and it gives it to the \nState regulators, who are already providing this regulation in other \ncommon areas and who have been since 1976.\n  I am a lawyer and have practiced in Federal courts. We have many fine \nFederal district judges around the country, but they are not experts in \nthis area. If you bring a lawsuit in their courts, they and their law \nclerks will work very hard to make sure that they get it as close to \nright as they can.\n  But in not having their experience and their expertise, we are going \nto get a lot of differences. We are going to get a patchwork. Whereas, \nif we go to the State regulators, who are doing it now, we are going to \nget something that makes sense within each of these individual States, \ngiven their different geographies and topographies and other things \nthat we should consider. This coal ash bill does not undermine the law. \nIt enhances the law.\n\n  Now, on the food labeling law, we had discussion about this in the \nRules Committee yesterday. I am a consumer. I go to the store. My wife \nsends me to the store, and she says to get this, this, this, and this. \nShe does a lot of studying before I do that, but sometimes I have to \nread the labels.\n  Now, imagine that I go to a store where I live in Alabama and that I \nam an hour away from Mississippi and an hour away from Florida. \nSomebody has got to put a product on store shelves up and down the gulf \ncoast, and they have got to comply with all three States' regulations \non what has got to be on the label.\n  I am going to pick up a can, and there are going to be all of these \ndifferent disclosure requirements, but they have been put on the same \ncan because they have got to make sure they can market it in all of \nthese States.\n  I have got to figure out what does all of that mean as opposed to \nhaving one common, uniform disclosure. If somebody chooses not to \ndisclose--if a producer of a given food product chooses not to disclose \nwhether or not it contains GMOs--I am going to assume that there are. \nIf I have a problem with GMOs, I am not going to buy it.\n  Five percent of the consumers in America today won't buy GMOs, and \nthey are pretty educated consumers. What they are going to do is they \nare going to go into the store and say, ``All right. Who has got GMO \nlabeling and who doesn't? If they don't, I am not buying it.''\n  If the producers of those foods want to sell something to those \ncustomers, they had better start taking advantage of what is happening \nthrough this common rule, this uniform rule, across the country to \nmarket themselves.\n  Far from hurting the consumers, this helps the consumers. That is \nwhat this\n\n[[Page H5349]]\n\nbill has tried so very hard to do, and I think they have done a good \njob with it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nNewhouse), a member of the Rules Committee and a farmer himself.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I would like to thank my colleague from Alabama, a \nmember of the Rules Committee, as well as joining Mr. McGovern with \nwhom we share a Rules Committee assignment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule that we are considering as \nwell as the underlying legislation, both bills, but I would like to \nspecifically speak to H.R. 1599, which is, I believe, accurately \nlabeled the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act. I think, also, I would \nlike to talk to the positive impacts that it will have on our Nation's \nfood supply.\n  Many of you may know that, prior to coming to Congress, I was the \ndirector of the Washington State Department of Agriculture. Shortly \nafter my time at the WSDA, several groups in my home State of \nWashington proposed a ballot initiative, I-522, which would have \nrequired mandatory labeling of biotech food products or of those using \ningredients that had biotech ingredients, also referred to as GMOs.\n  Now, I opposed I-522 for a couple of reasons but mainly because of \nthe impact that we could see it would have on our farmers and on our \nranchers and on our grocers but, more importantly, on our consumers, \nthe families who are making food decisions in the grocery stores, who, \nin the end, would pay higher food prices as a result of this mandatory \nlabeling law that was being considered.\n  In our State, we have the Washington Research Council, and it \nconducted an independent study, showing that the mandatory food \nlabeling of biotech ingredients would cost the average family at \nleast--at a minimum--$450 a year in increased food costs. That is \nassuming that Washington was the only jurisdiction to create such a \nlaw.\n  Now, if other States and other cities--other localities--decided to \nfollow suit and pass their own laws, such as Seattle or New York or \nBoston or San Francisco or Oregon, food producers would face an \nincredible, unworkable patchwork of legal definitions of what a ``GMO'' \nis and how to label it.\n  I can only imagine a food producer having to print, say, 100 \ndifferent labels for its products depending on where they were \ndestined, where they were to be sold, and the liability they would face \nif, for instance, a box of food labeled for Phoenix ended up in Las \nVegas or in Los Angeles or in Salt Lake City.\n  Many producers are considering stopping or have stopped selling \nproducts in the State of Vermont, which is the most recent State to \nadopt mandatory labeling standards, because of this increased cost, \nbecause of the uncertainty and the liability that separate \njurisdictions would create.\n  In my estimation and what the people of my State have said is that \nwhat we need is a national voluntary label, much like organic, a label \nwhich gives consumers who want to purchase non-GMO foods the freedom to \ndo so, but that will not impose higher costs on producers or consumers.\n  Mr. Speaker, critics of this bill, H.R. 1599, unfairly claim it will \nlimit the ability of consumers to know what they are purchasing; but \nlet me say that that just simply is not the case, that it is not true.\n  If you go into a grocery store and want to purchase an organic \nproduct, that is something that you are easily able to do, and that is \nexactly what this bill will do for GMO foods. It will create a similar \nlabel.\n  So make no mistake. If buying non-GMO is important to any of you as a \nconsumer, then you will have every ability to do so when you walk into \na grocery store and make your purchase.\n  You will have the confidence of the United States Department of \nAgriculture's system of making sure that those labels are consistent \nfrom one State to the other; so you will know what you are buying by \nwhat that label says.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Founders of our Nation gave Congress a tool in our \nConstitution to regulate interstate commerce to prevent the types of \nlegal patchworks and market distortions that we are beginning to see on \nthis issue.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the rule, to support H.R. \n1599, and protect the Nation's access to safe, affordable food.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate the comments from my colleagues from Washington and \nAlabama. Both serve on the Rules Committee with me, and I respect them; \nbut I do not think they were paying attention to my speech.\n  I am not arguing here for a patchwork of 50 different rules and \nregulations with regard to labeling. What I am saying is that what my \nfriends are proposing here, which is voluntary labeling on non-GMO \nproducts, should be replaced with mandatory GMO labeling across the \ncountry.\n  That is what people want, and that is what this bill would deny. You \nare not only preempting States and telling States that they have no \nrole in this debate and you are not only preempting the will of the \nAmerican people here, but you are setting a standard here so that \npeople will be kept in the dark.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  I want uniformity, but I want more information, and this idea that \nsomehow labeling will increase food prices is just baseless; it is \nbaseless. There are plenty of things that increase the prices that we \npay at the grocery store--transportation costs and ingredients costs, \nthose all add to the cost--but GMO labeling is not one of them. In \nstudy after study, we have seen that a simple GMO disclaimer on food \npackaging will not increase food prices.\n  I just read to you the letter from the CEO of Ben & Jerry's. Food \ncompanies change their labels all the time to make new claims. All food \ncompanies will soon have to change their labels to make important \nchanges to the nutrition fact panel.\n  Adding a few words on the back of the food package about genetic \nengineering will not impact the cost of making food. That is just not a \nreal argument; that is just baseless. Let's focus on what this bill \nreally does. It basically keeps the American people in the dark about \nwhat is in their food.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have listened with interest to the \nspeakers who preceded me, and the gentleman from Massachusetts is \nabsolutely right. The simple solution is to adopt a uniform national \nmandatory standard that would give that information on the label. \nEighty-eight percent of the American people who regularly are polled \nsay: We would like that information on the label.\n  It will not add cost any more than printing ``red dye no. 2'' on the \nlabel adds cost to the label. It will add no cost. It would have a \nuniform national standard. You wouldn't have to worry about a \nproliferation of the States, and then you wouldn't have to contradict \nyourselves as Republicans when, every day, you are down here screaming \nabout states' rights, and now, when States do something you don't like: \nOh, my God, states' rights, out of here.\n  It is not just the labeling. Yeah, there are three blue States that \nhave labeled, and you don't care if you preempt their laws--got that; \nbut there are a lot of red States and purple States and blue States \nwhere the departments of agriculture have recognized the reality of GMO \nand the potential pollution of conventional non-GMO and organic crops.\n  We had a little incident in Oregon where all our wheat export was \nstopped because GMO-modified wheat was found in the middle of a very \nlarge conventional farm. Until they could figure out how it got there \nand how much pollution there might be or cross-contamination of \nOregon's huge wheat exports, they were all stopped because 64 countries \naround the world require this labeling, and somehow, the U.S. \nconglomerates who make food and export processed food are able to label \nover there.\n  I have a Hershey's label from the EU. I will show it tomorrow. It's \nbeautiful. It's got an American flag on it, made in the USA, contains \nGMOs. They can do it over there, but they can't do it here because it \nwould just drive the price up stratospherically. That seems odd.\n\n[[Page H5350]]\n\n  In fact, this would help them. If we adopted a national standard \nhere--and the way my bill is written, it would be essentially the same \nas that required in the European Union and 64 other countries--then \nthey could ship their food to all 50 States, the territories, and 64 \ncountries around the world without having to make any changes. They \nmight save some money then if labels are so expensive.\n  But, no, we are going to have a meaningless, voluntary label. Even \nworse, we are going to create a new label. We are going to say that \n``natural'' means GMO. When you mate a flounder with a tomato plant--\nwhich is what they do, just like hybridizing, flounders, tomato plants, \nthey get together all the time--then that is natural.\n  Or when you take a salmon and you introduce an eel gene--they mate, \ncross-breed all the time--well, no, actually, they don't--and the \nsalmon grows twice as fast as normal salmon, then that is natural.\n  You won't be able to say ``contains GMOs'' if you can say ``natural'' \nand ``natural'' means contains GMOs, unless they want to voluntarily go \non and say: Well, under the new ``natural'' label, I can have GMOs, but \nI am going to put it is natural, but it contains GMOs.\n  This has the prospect of causing tremendous chaos with a new, very \nconfusing label for the American consumers.\n  Back to the cross-contamination--again, this is not just a blue State \nissue; it is a red State issue. We have huge export markets, and those \n64 countries will not accept products that contain GMOs. If you strip \nout State regulations, how they claim they have fixed the bill, and \nthey don't strip out all the State department of agriculture \nregulations in some 35 States around the country, many of them very red \nStates.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, they claim to have fixed it, but the \nlanguage is still a little bit ambiguous. Many people who have read \nit--experts say no, actually, it looks like we are preempting State \ndepartment of agriculture on separation and buffer zones and other \nthings to protect conventional farmers, organic farmers from the GMOs.\n  I had a very simple amendment that would just say this does not \npreempt any State department of agriculture which has adopted for the \npurposes of redacting conventional crops, non-GMO, and organic crops \nfor reasonable buffer zones and other sorts of provisions to prevent \nthat cross-contamination. That is wiped out by this bill, in my opinion \nand the opinion of many other experts. My amendment was not allowed.\n  I am thankful that I had one amendment allowed which will say, if you \nare already labeling it in countries all around the world, you have got \nto label it here. That is good, but preferably, we would have uniform \nlabeling of everything in the 50 States and internationally by just \nrequiring that you disclose that it contains GMOs.\n  There is another amendment that will be offered tomorrow which will \ndo away with this new ``natural'' standard, ``natural'' meaning \nmandatorily under Federal law contains GMOs. ``Natural'' can contain \nGMOs. I think that is pretty disingenuous, and I am not sure who \nslipped that little beauty in there.\n  If you want to talk about confusing consumers, ``organic,'' \n``natural.'' Whoa, what is the difference between ``natural'' and \n``organic''? Well, I like ``natural.'' ``Organic,'' that sounds kind of \ncomplicated; I will go with ``natural.'' Oh, that contains GMOs. Well, \nit doesn't say that. No, it doesn't. It says ``natural.'' ``Natural'' \ncontains GMOs.\n  If the gentleman is really concerned about consumer confusion, you \nshould support that amendment tomorrow to do away with this new \ndisingenuous label.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I wanted to assure my friend from Massachusetts that the \ngentleman from Washington and I are indeed paying attention to him, as \nwe do in the Committee on Rules. He is a very knowledgeable gentleman \nand certainly makes very interesting points.\n\n  The problem is that, as I listened to you talk, what you were saying, \nthe gentleman says, I think quite eloquently, that we need a national \nstandard, and right now, we don't have a national standard. This bill \nwill provide a national standard.\n  If you want a national standard, the status quo doesn't get you \nthere. If you want a national standard, this bill gets you there. That \nis why the bill has been offered. That is why we have this rule today, \nand that is why it is so important that we have this debate and the \ndebate on the underlying rule, so we can make sure we are all straight \nabout what this bill does and does not do.\n  This bill does something that is not being done right now. It \nprovides a national standard for GMO. The gentleman, I think, would \nlike for it to be mandatory; the bill calls for it to be voluntary. We \ncan disagree about whether or not that is advisable, but we can't \ndisagree about the fact that there is no national standard now, and \nthis bill provides one.\n  I want to make sure the gentleman knows, we listened to him. He makes \nvery interesting points that are always educational to us, but we don't \nagree with his line of thought here. This bill, in our judgment, gets \nus where I think he is trying to take us to go.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would just simply say to the gentleman, I agree with \nhim that this bill that will be considered tomorrow that this rule will \nmake in order does create a national standard.\n  The problem is that it is a national standard that keeps consumers in \nthe dark about what is in their food. Many of us would prefer a \nnational standard that kind of shines some light on what is in people's \nfood so that consumers know what they are buying. That is what \nconsumers want.\n  I will go back to what I said in my opening statement. I know this is \na radical idea in this particular Congress, but we ought to try \nsomething different. We ought to try giving the American people what \nthey want. On this issue, they want to know what is in their food. They \nwant to know whether their foods contain GMOs.\n  Again, this is not a debate about whether GMOs are good or bad. As I \nsaid before, I eat GMOs; I consume GMOs; my family consumes GMOs. That \nis not what this debate is about. This is about information, \ntransparency, and giving consumers what they want.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues to defeat the previous \nquestion, and if we do, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring \nup H.R. 3064, a comprehensive 6-year surface transportation bill that \nis partially paid for by restricting U.S. companies from using so-\ncalled inversion to shirk their tax obligations.\n  I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the \nRecord along with extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on \nthe previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Van Hollen), the distinguished ranking member of the \nCommittee on Budget, to discuss this proposal.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I do just want to take a break from the \nGMO debate to talk about a huge problem confronting our country, and \nthat is the infrastructure that is in disrepair, from roads to bridges \nto transit ways around this country.\n  The American people know it, and they are backed up in what they can \nsee in front of them by a report from the American Society of Civil \nEngineers. They are the nonpartisan pros; they are the experts.\n  They have looked at the state of American infrastructure and given us \na grade of a D-plus--D-plus. Nobody should be happy with a D-plus. The \nsad thing is that this Congress should get an F grade for failing to \nrespond to the bad grade with respect to our failing infrastructure.\n  In the face of this big problem, what did the House do? Well, we are \nabout to run out of money in 8 days. We are about to see the end of the \nauthorization in 8 days; so the House of Representatives, instead of \ncoming up with\n\n[[Page H5351]]\n\na long-term plan to address this issue, which is what we should do, \ncame up with another kick-the-can-down-the-road Band-Aid approach. They \nsaid, we are going to provide an extension of the inadequate funding \nfor just 5 more months, just to December of this year.\n  Now, we are a great country, and I think everybody knows that if you \nare planning to make major investments in infrastructure, whether it is \nour roads or our bridges or transit ways, you need a little more \ncertainty and stability than that.\n  Certainly, the private sector couldn't plan on 5-month intervals, and \nwe are asking these companies and these workers and these States to \ncome up with long-term plans for our States and for our country on \ninfrastructure, but we are only going to give them 5 months of \ncertainty going forward. We think that is a bad idea. Guess what. \nSenate Republicans also think that is a bad idea. They came up with a \n6-year plan.\n  Now, what we are providing this House today is the opportunity on the \nvery next vote to vote for the opportunity to vote on a robust 6-year \ntransportation infrastructure plan that is fully funded for the first 2 \nyears.\n  How do we pay for that 2-year installment? We pay for it, Mr. \nSpeaker, by getting rid of this egregious tax loophole that many \nmultinational corporations are using to escape their responsibilities \nto the American taxpayer.\n  Here is how it works. You have an American company. Their \nheadquarters are here; their people are here; everything they do is \nhere. Then they go and they purchase a small company, a small foreign \ncompany, and they move their mailing address overseas to that small \ncompany, and then that American company benefits from the educational \nsystem we have here in the United States.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, they purchase a small foreign company, \nand then they move their mailing address overseas to that small \ncompany. They then say to the American taxpayer: Guess what. We don't \nhave to pay any more taxes in the United States. We don't have to pay \ntaxes for the infrastructure that we have that does support us. We \ndon't have to pay for the education system that supports us. We want a \nfree ride.\n  Now, we need to close down this tax break. More and more companies \nevery day are taking advantage of it.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  If you close that loophole, you generate $40 billion. And you use \nthat money that otherwise would go to the bottom line of these \ncorporations that are trying to escape their responsibility to the \nAmerican people and you invest it in infrastructure right here at home. \nYou help modernize your infrastructure, and you put more people to \nwork.\n  We have introduced a piece of legislation, Mr. Speaker, to do that. \nThe bill is H.R. 3064. And if we defeat the previous question, we as a \nHouse will have an opportunity to vote on a 6-year, robust \ntransportation plan that is funded for 2 years by closing this \negregious tax loophole that is being exploited by corporations.\n  Let's defeat the previous question. Let's do the right thing for \nAmerican workers and American infrastructure.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the points of the gentleman from Maryland. \nI, too, would like to see a 6-year highway bill. If you come to my \ndistrict and see Interstate 10 going through Mobile at rush hour, on a \nholiday weekend, or on a summer weekend, you will see cars backed up \njust about every direction. We need another I-10 bridge across the \nMobile River. We can't do that with a short-term highway bill.\n  So I strongly support what you are trying to accomplish--maybe not \nexactly how you are trying to get there, but I certainly support the \nconcept there.\n  Here is the problem, though. Your idea, whatever it is, hasn't been \nvetted through committee. You are just going to put it up here in place \nof whatever we have got, and there really won't be an adequate \nopportunity for the Members of this House to understand all the \ndetails, and the details are going to matter.\n  Also, I was listening to the gentleman from Massachusetts in his \ninitial statement talk about how inappropriate it is that we put two \ndifferent bills on two different topics under one rule, and now we are \ngoing to interject transportation. Well, if agriculture and energy are \nconfusing, if we add transportation, it is going to be further \nconfusing.\n  So as much as I appreciate the idea that the gentleman from Maryland \nhas--perhaps not the specifics, but the idea--this is not the \nappropriate place, and this is certainly not the appropriate rule for \nus to be discussing it.\n  When the time comes to be appropriate, I will actually move the \nprevious question, but I will also ask all of my colleagues to support \nthe previous question when I do so. I believe that is the appropriate \nway for this House to handle a matter of this magnitude, and it is a \nmatter of great magnitude.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Before I close, I will insert in the Record a letter from the \nNational Farmers Union supporting mandatory GMO labeling and opposed to \nH.R. 1599; a letter from Dr. John W. Boyd, Jr., the Founder and \nPresident of the National Black Farmers Association; a letter from Ben \nBurkett, the Executive Director of the National Family Farm Coalition, \nopposed to H.R. 1599; a letter from the Consumers Union opposed to H.R. \n1599; a letter from Jostein Solheim, the CEO of Ben & Jerry's, opposed \nto the underlying bill; a letter from Tom Colicchio on behalf of the \nFood Policy Action group, opposed to H.R. 1599; a letter from Scott \nFaber, Senior Vice President for Governmental Affairs at EWG, opposed \nto H.R. 1599; a letter from the Consumer Federation of America opposed \nto H.R. 1599 and in support of mandatory GMO labeling; a letter from \nthe CEO of National Co+op Grocers, opposed to the bill; and a letter \nfrom a group called Just Label It, signed by a whole bunch of people \nopposed to the bill and for mandatory GMO labeling.\n\n            [From the National Farmers Union, July 21, 2015]\n\nNFU Reiterates Support for Mandatory GMO Labeling, Opposes Pompeo Bill \n                           but Notes Progress\n\n       Washington.--In light of the U.S. House of Representatives' \n     consideration of the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act \n     (H.R. 1599), National Farmers Union (NFU) President Roger \n     Johnson again highlighted NFU policy on Genetically Modified \n     Organism (GMO) labeling. The policy supports conspicuous, \n     mandatory, uniform and federal labeling for food products \n     throughout the processing chain to include all ingredients, \n     additives and processes, including genetically altered or \n     engineered food products.\n       ``NFU appreciates efforts by Representatives Pompeo, R-\n     Kansas, and Davis, R-Illinois, to reduce consumer confusion \n     and standardize a GMO label;'' said Johnson. ``The bill \n     passed out of committee makes significant improvements over \n     previous versions of this bill. Absent a mandatory labeling \n     framework, however, NFU cannot support this bill.''\n       Johnson noted that the bill has changed several times from \n     the one introduced during the last Congress. Improvements \n     include additional authority for the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture (USDA), a labeling framework that if utilized \n     could reduce consumer confusion, greater emphasis on the Food \n     and Drug Administration's role in safety reviews, and a GMO \n     label that works in conjunction with USDA's organic seal \n     instead of counter to it.\n       ``Consumers increasingly want to know more information \n     about their food, and producers want to share that \n     information with them,'' said Johnson. ``It is time to find \n     common ground that includes some form of mandatory disclosure \n     for the benefit of all aspects of the value chain, but this \n     bill is not that common ground.''\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 15, 2015.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Office of the Speaker of the House.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Office of the Democratic Leader.\n     Re ``Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act,'' H.R. 1599\n\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi: The National Black \n     Farmers Association (NBFA), a non-profit organization \n     representing African American farmers and their families with \n     tens of thousands of members nationwide, urge you to oppose \n     the ``Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act'' (also known as \n     the ``Deny Americans the Right to Know (DARK) Act'').\n       NBFA strongly supports mandatory labeling of genetically \n     engineered foods (commonly called ``GMOs''). But in spite of \n     its name, the ``Safe and Accurate Food Labeling\n\n[[Page H5352]]\n\n     Act'' undermines farmworker safety and labeling by:\n       Preempting states from regulating GMO crops to protect \n     farmworker health, public health, and the environment;\n       Codifying the current, broken voluntary labeling system;\n       Allowing ``natural'' foods to contain GMO ingredients and \n     preempt state efforts to end misleading ``natural'' claims; \n     and\n       Virtually eliminating FDA's ability to craft a national GMO \n     labeling system.\n       While NBFA does not object to farmers growing GMO crops per \n     se, we are aware of the increased use of toxic weed killers \n     associated with herbicide-tolerant GMO crops. As farmers, \n     NBFA members know firsthand that consumers are demanding more \n     information about the food they feed their families--not \n     less.\n       NBFA stands with the vast majority of Americans who are in \n     favor of labeling GMOs. Because the ``Safe and Accurate Food \n     Labeling Act'' does not require GMO labels, we urge you to \n     oppose the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        Dr. John W. Boyd, Jr.,\n\n                                            Founder and President,\n     National Black Farmers Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Family Farm Coalition,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2015.\n       Dear Representative, On behalf of the family farmers, \n     ranchers and fishermen we represent, the National Family Farm \n     Coalition (NFFC) urges you to oppose H.R. 1599, the Safe and \n     Accurate Food Labeling Act. H.R. 1599 proponents claim it \n     would establish a national standard for labeling products \n     containing GMOs. In reality, this bill fails to provide more \n     accurate labeling and significantly curtails the ability of \n     state, local and municipal governments to protect their \n     constituents.\n       H.R. 1599 would establish a voluntary national standard \n     that companies could use to label their products as GMO-free, \n     but FDA guidelines have provided this option for companies \n     since 2001. An overwhelming 88 percent of consumers favor \n     required labeling of food products containing GMOs in a \n     Mellman Group study, but H.R. 1599's voluntary program would \n     also allow companies to label products containing GMOs as \n     `natural', which is vague and misleading to consumers.\n       H.R. 1599 would invalidate dozens of state and local laws \n     across the nation. The GMO labeling laws that citizens and \n     legislators worked for diligently in Vermont, Maine and \n     Connecticut would be preempted. Furthermore, H.R. 1599 would \n     block laws creating buffer zones around schools and hospitals \n     to protect children and patients from pesticide exposure, as \n     in Hawaii.\n       For non-GMO farmers, H.R. 1599 would be disastrous as it \n     would preempt laws designed to protect them from GMO \n     contamination of their fields. Farmers have already suffered \n     through the contamination of wheat, rice and other crops, \n     having lost export dollars to Asian markets that demand non-\n     GMO varieties. Without strong regulations and oversight, \n     farmers' crops and livelihoods are at risk in ways that they, \n     their families and their communities cannot afford.\n       Striking down the laws around food and food production that \n     a broad array of citizens and officials have worked to enact \n     undermines the democratic processes guaranteed by our \n     constitution. The NFFC asks you to oppose H.R. 1599, thereby \n     preserving the rights of people to know what they are growing \n     and consuming.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ben Burkett,\n     NFFC Executive Board President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   ConsumersUnion',\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2015.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative: Consumers Union, the policy and \n     advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, strongly urges you to vote \n     no on H.R. 1599, introduced by Representative Pompeo, which \n     we understand the House will consider this week. The bill \n     would very broadly preempt state laws relating to genetically \n     engineered (GE) food and crops, and ban any level of \n     government from requiring GE food to be labeled as such.\n       Consumers Union supports mandatory labeling of GE food, and \n     opposes H.R. 1599, for several reasons. First, consumers want \n     labeling. Polls, including our own, show that more than 90% \n     of consumers want GE food to be labeled accordingly. Yet H.R. \n     1599 would codify current prevailing federal policy, in which \n     any labeling of GE food must be the voluntary choice of the \n     food producer--a policy which has only generated confusion. \n     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adopted this policy 15 \n     years ago, and today there is not a single food product on \n     the market that carries a label indicating it contains GE \n     ingredients.\n       Second, there are numerous precedents for mandatory \n     labeling. FDA already requires labeling of food if it is \n     homogenized, frozen, or made from concentrate. Some 64 \n     countries, including most of our major trading partners, \n     require labeling of GE food.\n       Third, states have begun to act on the clear requests of \n     their citizens for information on whether the food they buy \n     contains GE ingredients. Vermont, Maine, and Connecticut have \n     passed legislation requiring labeling of food from GE plants. \n     Other states, including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, \n     Massachusetts, and Illinois, have considered bills. Whether \n     enacted by state legislatures or approved by voters, the \n     ability of states to act democratically to carry out the \n     wishes of their citizens on GE food labeling should not be \n     impeded by Congress.\n       Fourth, H.R. 1599 would permit the use of ``natural'' \n     claims on the labels of GE food until FDA finalizes a rule \n     defining ``natural'' and decides whether it will continue to \n     allow this practice. The bill would also prohibit states from \n     taking their own steps to regulate the use of these claims. \n     Polling by Consumer Reports has found that more than 60% of \n     consumers are misled, in that they already believe a \n     ``natural'' label on a product means it does not contain \n     genetically modified ingredients. Fully 85% of consumers \n     think that a ``natural'' label on packaged or processed foods \n     should mean no genetically modified ingredients were used. \n     Yet Consumer Reports testing last year identified five food \n     products labeled ``natural'' that actually did contain such \n     ingredients. By allowing foods labeled as ``natural'' to \n     contain GE ingredients, H.R 1599 would authorize a deceptive \n     practice that is highly inconsistent with consumer \n     expectations.\n       Fifth, mandatory GE food labeling would not be expensive. \n     An analysis commissioned by Consumers Union and conducted by \n     an independent economic research firm found from a review of \n     published research that the median cost of requiring GE food \n     labeling is $2.30 per person annually--less than a penny a \n     day for each consumer. This figure takes into account one-\n     time implementation expenses, so the actual cost per person \n     could be even lower.\n       Finally, H.R. 1599 goes beyond the question of labeling to \n     explicitly prohibit state or local requirements related to \n     the use of GE plants for food in interstate commerce. \n     Restrictions on growing such crops in California, Oregon, \n     Washington, and Hawaii would likely be severely restricted or \n     invalidated. These measures were adopted for a variety of \n     reasons, including to prevent the contamination of specialty \n     crops destined for export, protect against invasive species, \n     and limit the use of toxic pesticides, such as glyphosate, \n     which many GE crops have been engineered to tolerate and \n     which was recently classified by the World Health \n     Organization's cancer research arm as probably carcinogenic \n     to humans.\n       We therefore strongly urge you to vote no on H.R. 1599, \n     which is contrary to what consumers want, and which would \n     profoundly interfere with the ability of state and local \n     governments to respond to the needs of their citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jean Halloran,\n       Director, Food Policy Initiatives, Consumers Union.\n     Urvashi Rangan,\n       Director, Consumer Safety and Sustainability, Consumer \n     Reports.\n                                  ____\n\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative: I write on behalf of Ben & Jerry's to \n     urge you to oppose H.R. 1599, the Safe and Accurate Food \n     Labeling Act of 2015, otherwise known as the DARK Act.\n       As you know, national public opinion polling shows that \n     more than 90% of Americans want to know whether the products \n     they purchase contain genetically engineered ingredients \n     (GMOs). Just like labels that require disclosure of farm-\n     raised salmon or orange juice from concentrate, mandatory \n     labeling of GMO food will provide consumers the information \n     they need to make choices for themselves and their families. \n     Only mandatory GMO labeling will ensure that American \n     consumers have the same right to know what's in the food as \n     citizens in 64 other countries around the world, including \n     many where Ben & Jerry's operates. H.R. 1599, with its \n     voluntary framework for labeling products without GMOs, will \n     only enhance confusion in the marketplace.\n       As a Vermont-based company, we are particularly troubled \n     that H.R. 1599 would preempt Vermont's Act 120, which \n     beginning in July of 2016, will require labeling of food \n     products with GMO ingredients sold in Vermont. As a food \n     company doing business in all 50 states, we'd prefer a \n     national standard for mandatory GMO labeling, but absent \n     that, we support states like Vermont passing legislation that \n     ensures transparency and consumers' right to know.\n       As an ice cream company that operates in more than 30 \n     countries, many of which require mandatory GMO labeling, we \n     are not swayed by arguments that mandatory labeling will be \n     expensive. The truth is, we regularly make changes, sometimes \n     big, sometimes small to our packaging. Every year, we make \n     changes to between 25% and 50% of our packaging. Over the \n     last 7 years, we've gone through three full line redesigns. \n     In other words, we have changed the packaging on every single \n     pint in our product line as a matter of normal business. I \n     can tell you unequivocally that changing labels does not \n     require us raise the price of our products. Lots of things \n     impact the cost a consumer pays for a pint of Ben & Jerry's. \n     Label changes are not one.\n       I'd be more than happy to discuss this issue and how it \n     would impact a large international food company like ours in \n     more detail with you or your staff. I urge you to stand with \n     the more than 90% of Americans\n\n[[Page H5353]]\n\n     that support transparency in our food system by opposing H.R. \n     1599.\n           All the best,\n                                                  Jostein Solheim,\n     CEO, Ben & Jerry's.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Food Policy Action,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: I urge you to oppose H.R. 1599, \n     legislation designed to block state and federal GMO labeling \n     laws and to weaken regulation of GMO crops.\n       As a chef, I want to know what I am feeding my customers. \n     And, my customers want to know what's in their food and how \n     it's grown.\n       So, I am shocked that some legislators in Washington are \n     trying to deny consumers this basic right.\n       Next week, legislators in the U.S. House of Representatives \n     will consider H.R. 1599, legislation that would block states \n     from requiring GMO labels and that would make it virtually \n     impossible for FDA to craft a national GMO labeling system.\n       But that's not all. H.R. 1599 would also block states from \n     regulating GMO crops to protect farmers and public health.\n       Nine out of ten consumers tell us they want the right to \n     know whether their food contains GMOs--just like consumers in \n     64 other nations. But, H.R. 1599 would deny them this right.\n       Congress should be leading efforts to give consumers more \n     information about what's in their food and how it's grown, \n     not less.\n       I urge you to oppose H.R. 1599.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Colicchio.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                          EWG,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: EWG strongly opposes H.R. 1599, the \n     so-called ``Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015.'' We \n     urge you to vote NO.\n       Consumers have the right to know what is in their food and \n     how it is grown. H.R. 1599 would deny consumers this basic \n     right by preempting state GMO labeling laws, virtually \n     eliminating the ability of the Food and Drug Administration \n     to craft a national mandatory GMO labeling system, by \n     enshrining a voluntary GMO labeling system that has failed \n     consumers, and by allowing ``natural'' claims on GMO foods.\n       Nine out of ten consumers want the right to know whether \n     their food has been produced with genetically modified food \n     ingredients--just like consumers in 64 other nations. GMO \n     labeling has not increased food prices in other nations, and \n     studies show that a modest GMO disclosure on the back of food \n     packages will have no impact on food prices or food security \n     needs.\n       In addition, H.R. 1599 would preempt state and local GMO \n     crop regulations designed to protect farmers from economic \n     harms caused by GMO crops. More than 40 states and counties \n     have adopted rules designed to protect farmers and rural \n     residents from the impacts of GMO crops.\n       Consumers should have the right to know what it's their \n     food and how it's grown. We urge you to vote NO on H.R. 1599.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Scott Faber,\n\n                                         Senior Vice President for\n     Government Affairs, EWG.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Consumer Federation of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2015.\n       Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of Consumer Federation \n     of America (CFA), I urge you to vote in opposition to the \n     Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015 (H.R. 1599) when \n     it comes up for a full floor vote. CFA is an association of \n     250 nonprofit consumer organizations across the country that \n     was established in 1968 to advance the consumer interest \n     through research, advocacy and education.\n       Contrary to its name, the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling \n     Act is not an appropriate solution to labeling genetically \n     modified organisms (GMOs). Instead, the Act would codify the \n     current voluntary system which has not provided consumers the \n     information they want to know. It would pre-empt state GMO \n     labeling laws passed to provide their constituents with \n     accurate information about their food. The Act would also \n     create consumer confusion in the marketplace by allowing food \n     companies to continue making ``natural'' claims on products \n     containing GMO foods.\n       More and more, American consumers want information about \n     the food they feed to their families. American consumers have \n     a right to know what is in their food, just like consumers in \n     64 countries who already have the right to know whether their \n     food contains GMOs. Voluntary labeling, as proposed in the \n     Act, is not effective because it does not provide consistent \n     information to consumers. Instead, consumers get information \n     only from some companies who choose to provide it and not \n     from other companies. A better solution is the GE Food Right \n     to Know Act introduced by Senator Boxer and Representative \n     DeFazio, which would require GMO foods to be labeled, \n     providing consumers with the consistent information they \n     deserve.\n       I urge you to oppose the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling \n     Act of 2015 (H.R. 1599) when it comes up for a full floor \n     vote.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Chris Waldrop.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       National Co+op Grocers,\n\n                                     Iowa City, IA, July 17, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: National Co+op Grocers (NCG) supports \n     consumers' right to information, including sufficient product \n     labeling, so that people can make their own informed \n     purchasing decisions. We strongly oppose The Safe and \n     Accurate Food Labeling Act (H.R. 1599) because it:\n       1. Lacks transparency. H.R. 1599 merely codifies the status \n     quo of voluntary labeling. In the 14 years since the FDA has \n     allowed companies to voluntarily label foods that have been \n     produced using genetic engineering, no single company has \n     labeled them as such. Only mandatory labeling fulfills \n     consumer demand for transparency regarding GMOs.\n       2. Undermines public will. Multiple surveys have shown that \n     the majority of Americans, regardless of age, income, \n     education, or party affiliation, want GMO foods to be \n     labeled. H.R. 1599 nullifies GMO labeling laws that are \n     already on the books in Vermont, Connecticut and Maine. \n     Furthermore, the bill preempts states by blocking any future \n     state legislation or ballot initiatives that would require \n     GMO labeling. While NCG favors a national solution, we \n     support states' efforts in the absence of federally regulated \n     mandatory labeling.\n       3. Heightens consumer confusion. Newly inserted language \n     would allow food companies to continue to make ``natural'' \n     claims on foods produced using genetic engineering and would \n     also block state efforts to protect consumers from misleading \n     ``natural'' claims. Because many consumers believe that \n     ``natural'' foods are produced without genetically engineered \n     ingredients, H.R. 1599 would only perpetuate consumer \n     confusion in the marketplace.\n       NCG is a business services cooperative for retail food co-\n     ops located throughout the United States. We represent 143 \n     food co-ops operating over 195 stores in 38 states with \n     combined annual sales of over $1.7 billion and over 1.3 \n     million consumer-owners. We urge Congress to reject H.R. \n     1599.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration of this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Robynn Shrader,\n     National Co+op Grocers CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Just Label It!,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: We urge you to oppose H.R. 1599, which \n     would deny Americans the right to know whether their food \n     contains genetically modified food ingredients.\n       National polls show that nine out of ten Americans want the \n     right know if their food contains GMOs. Regardless of age, \n     income, education level or even party affiliation, Americans \n     want the right to know what is in their food and how it was \n     produced--the same right held by citizens in 64 other \n     nations.\n       As business leaders, we hope that you will reject H.R. 1599 \n     and instead require food companies to label products that \n     contain GMOs.\n       If enacted, H.R. 1599 would limit the FDA's ability to \n     create a national GMO labeling system, weaken our broken \n     voluntary labeling system, and block state initiatives to \n     give citizens this basic information about their food.\n       Congress has long recognized that Americans should be given \n     basic information about their food and trusted to make the \n     right choices for their families.\n       We urge you to honor this longstanding tradition and to \n     reject H.R. 1599.\n           Sincerely,\n       Andrew Abraham, Founder and CEO, Orgain Inc., CA;

Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  First of all, I oppose the rule because it is not an open rule. A \nnumber of amendments were not made in order. Again, it is kind of a \nhodgepodge, grab-bag rule where we are dealing with multiple issues \nthat are not related. We have to end this practice. Voting against this \nrule is one way to demonstrate your dissatisfaction.\n  But let me close talking about H.R. 1599 and basically urge my \ncolleagues to be opposed to this bill. The fact of the matter is, as a \nparent--and I think I speak for all parents--I think we want to know \nwhat is in the food that we are feeding our family. That is why I \nsupport mandatory GMO labeling. Not 50 different labels of 50 different \nStates, but mandatory, standardized GMO labeling.\n  Americans want to know what is in their food. American consumers want \nthe same right as consumers in 64 other countries who already have the \nright to know whether their food contains GMOs. Why we should not have \nthat same right is beyond me, but I guess Washington knows best.\n  Support for GMO labeling crosses demographic boundaries. Polls show \nmore than 90 percent of Americans want the right to know, regardless of \nage, income, education, or party affiliation. Millions of Americans \nhave taken action. More than 1.4 million Americans have joined a \npetition to FDA demanding the right to know what is in their food.\n  H.R. 1599, which has been dubbed the ``Dark Act,'' will basically \nblock State GMO labeling laws. This will preempt GMO labeling laws that \nhave already been passed in Vermont, Maine, and Connecticut, and \npending in 17 other State legislatures.\n  This bill also will allow the bogus natural claims to continue. It \nallows food companies to continue to make natural claims on GMO foods \nand block the State efforts to protect consumers from this misleading \nnatural claim. As I pointed out, when consumers see a product that says \n``natural,'' they think it means no GMOs.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have heard my colleagues say that GMOs are safe and \nwhy is this labeling necessary. This debate is not about the safety of \nGMOs. As I mentioned before and I will mention again, I consume GMOs, \nmy family does. This is about consumers' right to know what is in the \nfood they put on their tables. We ought to give them that right.\n  This debate isn't about what the label should say. We can work on the \nlabel. We aren't proposing a skull and crossbones on the packaging. It \nis not a warning to consumers. It is a label simply disclosing the \npresence of GMOs. Consumers are free to use this information as they \nwish, but those who want to know should be able to know.\n  We had a fight about mandatory uniform nutrition labels in the 1980s, \nand I think there is no doubt consumers are better off for it. People \nare better served by knowing the nutrition information in their foods.\n  Why do my friends want to keep Americans in the dark? I would just \nsay people who are listening to this debate ought to call their \nRepresentatives and tell them that they want more information, not \nless. They want to be more informed about what they are purchasing for \ntheir families.\n  This shouldn't be a controversial idea. This shouldn't be a radical \nidea. Let's give the people what they want. Let's do that for a change. \nMaybe our approval ratings will go up.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous \nquestion and ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate the gentleman from Massachusetts' interest in this very \nimportant topic.\n  We said it several times. I am going to say it again. What this bill \ndoes is provides a national label where there is no label now at the \nnational level; and we believe so strongly in that, that we put forward \nthis bill. Our side put forward this bill to give us a national label \nbecause there is none now. There is zero, and you would be, as a \nconsumer, totally depending upon your local government, your State \ngovernment, coming up with it. You may find that your government at the \nlocal level has one thing, your State government\n\n[[Page H5355]]\n\nat the State level has another, a community down the road has a \ndifferent one. The idea behind the uniformity is to give consumers a \nuniform way of understanding what this information is.\n  I do wonder, by the way, what some people at home may be thinking \nwhen they hear all this talk about GMOs. They may be running to the \nrefrigerator and saying, What is this GMO stuff?\n  The truth of the matter is we all are probably consuming GMOs, \nbecause they have actually been a tremendous benefit not just to the \nagricultural industry, but to us consumers. It gives us so many \ndifferent varieties of good quality food that we didn't have before.\n  So this is not about whether GMOs are a good thing or a bad thing. \nThey are about our side providing a vehicle to give a national labeling \nsystem today, where there is none today. I think the consumers of \nAmerica will appreciate the fact that we did that.\n  I do want to go back and say one last thing about the coal ash bill. \nThere has been a lot of talk about somehow this bill weakening the EPA \nregulation. Totally to the contrary, this bill codifies the regulation \nin statutory law. Whereas under the present regime at the EPA they are \nnot going to do any oversight over how it is going to be implemented, \nthey are going to rely upon people to file lawsuits in various Federal \ncourts around the Nation, this bill provides that State regulators who \nare already doing this for the most part will be the ones to provide \nthat regulation with their substantial expertise and experience, which, \nI can tell you from my years of practicing law in Federal courts, the \nvast majority of our Federal judges don't have that. They will do their \njobs. They will do their homework. Their law clerks will work with \nthem, but they won't bring to it what these State regulators have.\n  So we have substantially enhanced the regulation here. We have \nsubstantially enhanced its implementation by having this bill before \nthe House and the House adopting it.\n  As they consider these two bills, I would urge everyone to understand \nthat what we have offered in these bills is good for consumers and it \nis good for the economy of the United States because it lessens that \nregulatory burden I have talked about at the beginning.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:\n\n  An Amendment to H. Res. 369 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     3064) to authorize highway infrastructure and safety, \n     transit, motor carrier, rail, and other surface \n     transportation programs, and for other purposes. The first \n     reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of \n     order against consideration of the bill are waived. General \n     debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one \n     hour equally divided among and controlled by the chair and \n     ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation \n     and Infrastructure and the chair and ranking minority member \n     of the Committee on Ways and Means. After general debate the \n     bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute \n     rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 3064.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be \nfollowed by 5-minute votes on adopting House Resolution 369, if \nordered; and agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal, if \nordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 239, \nnays 167, not voting 27, as follows:\n\n

Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) and the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, in December of last year, EPA put out its final rule \nfor coal ash. We applaud EPA's decision to regulate coal ash under \nsubtitle D, confirming what we have been saying all along, that coal \nash is not hazardous.\n  All you have to do is talk to any of the thousands of coal ash \nrecyclers across the country, and they will tell you that not only is \ncoal ash not hazardous, it is an essential component in their product. \nHowever, the rule remains seriously flawed; and implementation will \nresult in confusion, conflict, and a lot of needless litigation.\n  A fundamental flaw with the rule is that it is self-implementing, \nwhich means that, now that EPA has finalized the rule, going forward, \nthere will be zero regulatory oversight of coal ash by the EPA. What \nthis means is that all of the requirements in the final rule, no matter \nhow protective you believe they are, will be interpreted and \nimplemented by the utilities with no oversight or enforcement by the \nEPA or the States.\n  This leads us to one of the other key flaws with the final rule, \nwhich is that it is enforceable only through citizen suits. Think about \nthat; the final rule sets out a complex set of technical requirements \nfor coal ash, but interpreting what they mean and how to implement them \nis left entirely to the regulated community with citizen lawsuits in \nFederal Court as the only mechanism for enforcement.\n  This will result in an unpredictable array of regulatory \ninterpretations as judges throughout the country are forced to make \ntechnical compliance decisions that are better left to a regulatory \nagency.\n  Under current law, State permit programs will not operate in lieu of \nthe final coal ash rule. Even if States adopt the final rule, regulated \nentities must comply with the requirements in the Federal rule and \ntheir State. This means, even if a utility was in full compliance with \ntheir State coal ash permit, they could and would be sued for \nnoncompliance with the Federal rule.\n  The Western Governors' Association said it best in a letter to the \nHouse and Senate leadership on May 15 of this year:\n\n       Unfortunately, EPA's final rule produces an unintended \n     regulatory consequence in that it creates a dual Federal and \n     State regulatory system. This is because EPA is not allowed \n     under RCRA subtitle D to delegate the CCR program to States \n     in lieu of the Federal program.\n       Also, the rule does not require facilities to obtain \n     permits, does not require States to adopt and implement new \n     rules, and cannot be enforced by EPA. The rule's only \n     compliance mechanism is for a State or citizen group to bring \n     a citizen suit in Federal District Court under RCRA section \n     7002. This approach marginalizes the role of State \n     regulation, oversight, and enforcement.\n\n  This brings us to where we are today, in need of legislative solution \nto address the fundamental flaws with the final rule. H.R. 1734 is the \nsolution. The bill addresses the self-implementing aspect of the final \nrule, as well as the problem with citizen suit enforcement, by \nestablishing enforceable permit programs that directly incorporate the \ntechnical requirements of the final rule.\n\n  The bill will ensure that every State has a coal ash permit program, \nthat every permit program will contain all of the minimal Federal \nstandards or something more stringent, and that the technical \nrequirements of EPA's final rule are implemented with direct regulatory \noversight and enforcement.\n  The bill requires owners and operators to take actions such as \npreparing a fugitive dust control plan and conducting structural \nstability inspections within 8 months from the date of enactment, which \nmakes compliance with these and other requirements directly in line \nwith the timeframe for compliance under the final rule.\n  Notably, H.R. 1734 also requires owners and operators to begin \ngroundwater monitoring within 36 months from the date of enactment with \nState environmental agencies immediately ensuring compliance, rather \nthan having to wait for the courts.\n  It treats inactive surface impoundments in exactly the same manner as \nthe final rule; applies all of the location restrictions from the final \nrule to the new surface impoundments and expansions of existing \nimpoundments; and will ensure all relevant information--including all \ninformation associated with the issuance of permits, all groundwater \nmonitoring data, structural stability assessments, emergency action \nplans, fugitive dust control plans, information regarding corrective \naction remedies, and certifications regarding closure--be made \navailable on the Internet.\n  H.R. 1734 expressly protects the ability to file citizen suits under \nRCRA while ensuring parties to a lawsuit demonstrate actual harm from \nthe coal ash and not just that a utility allegedly violated the \nrequirements of the rule.\n  Some say that the bill ``goes too far'' because it allows States to \nexercise flexibility and make site-specific, risk-based decisions. \nOthers say that the bill is a ``giveaway'' to the utilities or that \nallowing the States to exercise the same flexibility available under \nother RCRA permit programs ``weakens'' the requirement of the final \nrule.\n  To that, we say H.R. 1734 simply gives the States the same authority \nto implement coal ash permit programs that they have for other RCRA \nsubtitle D and even subtitle C permit programs.\n  We trust the States are in the best position to analyze the local \nconditions and make risk-based permit decisions. We also know EPA \ntrusts the States because EPA relies on the States for the \nimplementation and enforcement of RCRA.\n  As we have heard before from the Environmental Council of the States \nand the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management \nOfficials and from the States themselves, they welcome the new minimum \nFederal requirements, are up to the task of regulating coal ash, and \nstrongly support H.R. 1734.\n  In addition to ECOS and ASTSWMO, H.R. 1734 enjoys support from a wide \narray of stakeholders, including Utility\n\n[[Page H5359]]\n\nSolid Waste Activities Group, Edison Electric Institute, the National \nRural Electric Cooperative, American Public Power Association, the \nWestern Governors Association I mentioned earlier, American Coal Ash \nAssociation, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I oppose this legislation.\n  H.R. 1734, the Improving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation Act of \n2015 is both unnecessary and dangerous legislation. The administration \nopposes the bill; and, if it somehow passes Congress, it will be \nvetoed.\n  The bill is also opposed by over 180 environmental, public health, \nand civil rights groups, including the Sierra Club, the League of \nConservation Voters, NAACP, NRDC, and Earthjustice.\n  They oppose this legislation because it would block EPA's final coal \nash rule and roll back important protections for human health and the \nenvironment. EPA's rule has put these protections in place after years \nof hard work and public process.\n  Transparency requirements, groundwater protection standards, cleanup \nrequirements, location restrictions, and liner requirements all will \nprotect human health and the environment. These requirements are long \noverdue.\n  Mr. Chairman, we have known for years that unsafe coal ash disposal \nthreatens groundwater, drinking water, and air quality. Contaminants \ncan leach into groundwater and drinking water supplies or become \nairborne as toxic dust. Aging or deficient impoundments can fail \nstructurally, resulting in catastrophic floods of toxic sludge entering \nneighboring communities.\n  Contamination can pose serious and widespread health risks. Just last \nyear, a coal ash spill in North Carolina affected drinking water \nsystems in Virginia. In 2005, a smaller spill in Pennsylvania affected \ndrinking water systems in my home State of New Jersey.\n  Unfortunately, these incidents are not uncommon. EPA has now \nidentified 157 damage cases from coal ash contamination. If EPA's rule \nis delayed or undermined, that number will likely continue to grow.\n  At the same time, Mr. Chairman, that EPA's rule includes many \nimportant protections, it is also balanced and responsive to industry \nconcerns. When EPA solicited comments on their proposed rule, they \nheard from coal ash recyclers that they wanted a subtitle D, \nnonhazardous rule. That is what EPA finalized.\n  Those in the electric utility industry wanted a subtitle D rule that \nwould not require them to retrofit their existing impoundments with \nliners. Again, that is what EPA finalized. States wanted a mechanism to \nset up their own programs to implement Federal standards and to have \nEPA approve them. EPA provided that in the final rule as well.\n  EPA's balanced rule has eliminated past justifications for coal ash \nlegislation. Past concerns that EPA would not be able to finalize a \ncoal ash rule no longer have merit because EPA has done so, and past \nconcerns that EPA might regulate coal ash as hazardous no longer have \nmerit because EPA finalized a nonhazardous rule and has no plans to \nreverse direction.\n  Past contentions that EPA needed legislation to effectively protect \npublic health no longer have merit because EPA has confidence that the \nrule will be effective and protective. Past concerns over enforcement \nof a subtitle D rule have been addressed because EPA has established \nmechanisms to review and approve State programs enforcing the rule.\n  The bottom line, Mr. Chairman, is that legislation is not warranted. \nEven if it were, this bill would not be the vehicle because it \ndangerously eliminates or undermines necessary protections.\n  A number of amendments were to be filed to preserve some of the \nimportant requirements in EPA's final rule, and I understand that some \nof these may be accepted, but I want to stress that these amendments \nhighlight only a subset of the problems with this bill. Even if all the \namendments were adopted, the bill would still be unnecessary and a \ndangerous precedent for public health.\n  I urge everyone to oppose the bill, Mr. Chairman, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nWest Virginia (Mr. McKinley), a real fighter for coal in the country.\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, for 35 years, Congress has wrestled with \nhow to deal with coal ash, an unavoidable byproduct of burning coal.\n  Every day, coal ash is produced in more than 500 coal-fired plants \nlocated in 49 States, spread across 207 congressional districts. Each \none of those dots represents where every day in America coal ash is \nbeing produced. This issue is not a State issue; this is a national \nissue that needs to be addressed. Over 140 million tons of coal ash are \nproduced annually in each one of those red dots.\n  I recently received a letter of support from the pulp and paper \nindustry which recycles fly ash and employs nearly 900,000 people in 47 \nStates. Their comment, they want to see this bill pass because, ``The \nEPA's proposed regulation provides a complicated approach to enforcing \nthe regulation,'' and this bill ``provides clarity and certainty.''\n  Now, last year, in December, the EPA issued its regulation--indeed, \nthey did--on fly ash. To its credit, the EPA addressed one of the more \nimmediate concerns and opted, however, just for now, to regulate coal \nash as a nonhazardous waste.\n  The question legitimately needs to be raised, and it has been: Why is \nthis legislation needed?\n  It is two issues. First, the nonhazardous designation is not \npermanent; and, secondly, the only oversight mechanism in the rule is \nlawsuits.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Let's be more specific. The nonhazardous designation is merely \napplicable as long as this rule is not modified. Even in the preamble, \nthe EPA indicates they may reverse their decision and ultimately \nregulate fly ash as a hazardous material.\n  More specifically from the rule, it says: The EPA is deferring its \nfinal decision because of regulatory uncertainties that cannot be \nresolved at this time.\n  This uncertainty could be devastating to recyclers. The science is \nsettled on fly ash, and it should trump political and ideological \ninterference. Are we living in a nation of rules and regulation or are \nwe living in a nation of laws?\n  This bill ensures that the EPA will not be able to retroactively \nreverse its original decision. But secondly and equally and maybe more \nso important is the rule of this omission of specificity and the lack \nof State or Federal oversight of coal ash disposal. And remember what I \njust said, the lack of State or Federal oversight that is provided in \nthe rule.\n  The way the rule is currently written, oversight will occur only \nthrough lawsuits, not through regulators.\n  The bill, however, addresses regulatory uncertainty by guaranteeing \nthat every State will have a coal ash permit program in concert with \nthe EPA, but with State oversight and that every program will meet the \nstandards set forth under the proposed EPA rule. Nothing in the rule \nwas omitted in the legislation.\n  Rather, the bill modifies the rule to allow States the flexibility to \nimplement an adequate, sufficient, and successful coal ash permit \nprogram. It simply ensures that the lawsuits are not the only \nregulatory component.\n  Let me give you an example on how the language within the rule could \nbe a problem. The rule states: The owner or operator of a CCR unit must \ninstall a sufficient number of wells to yield groundwater samples.\n  Mr. Chairman, who defines what ``sufficient'' is? One utility in one \nState may say it is 10 wells. In another State, it may be 20 or 30.\n  Under this rule, the decision will be handled by a Federal judge \nrather than a State environmental agency. That is what we corrected \nwith this bill. This is not the fly ash bill from 30 years ago.\n  We have worked with the EPA in developing this legislation. Perhaps, \nMr. Chairman, the administration hasn't read the bill because the bill, \none, codifies the rule. It doesn't eliminate anything. It codifies the \nrule.\n  Secondly, it removes the uncertainty with the regulatory designation. \nThree, it enhances oversight. Fourthly, it requires every State to have \na coal ash program.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n\n[[Page H5360]]\n\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley).\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chair, in so doing, in providing for the coal ash \nprogram, we finally have a national system for oversight of dams.\n  Think about that. We haven't had that up to this point. That is what \ncaused the problem in the first place, was lack of dam safety.\n  Secondly, we are going to have enhanced water quality. We are going \nto have improved environmental considerations.\n  This rule will go into effect October 19 of this year. Without this \nlegislative action, regulatory uncertainty surrounding the disposal of \ncoal ash will continue as it has for 35 years.\n  It is imperative we pass this bill today and continue to move \nforward. The clock is ticking, and the time is now to finally put this \nissue behind us.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put \nthis issue to rest. We have come to a compromise with the EPA. The \nadministration needs to come on board finally.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The gentleman from West Virginia seems to suggest that this \nlegislation will improve enforcement of EPA's important coal ash \nstandards.\n  If that were true, the public interest groups that have fought for \nstrong standards for years would support it.\n  Democratic Members that have conducted strong oversight of coal ash \ndisasters in the rulemaking process would also support it.\n  And the EPA, which has worked for decades to establish effective \nprotective requirements, would support it.\n  Those environmental groups and public health groups strongly oppose \nthis bill, I strongly oppose this bill, and the administration strongly \nopposes the bill.\n  That is because this bill is not needed to ensure effective \nenforcement of the EPA's coal ash rule, and it won't have that effect.\n  You may hear that EPA's rule will only be enforced through citizen \nsuits, and that is simply not true. While citizen suits have been and \nwill continue to be an important component of all environmental \nenforcement, States will play an important part in enforcing EPA's \nfinal coal ash rule.\n  They will do so either by bringing citizen suits themselves or by \nincorporating the requirements of EPA's rule into their State programs.\n  States want to take on this role. They told the EPA as much in \ncomments on the coal ash proposed rule.\n  In response to those requests, EPA established in the rule a \nmechanism to review and approve State programs implementing these \nrequirements.\n  EPA expects the States to make use of this mechanism and implement \nthe rules requirements through approved programs. So the claim that \nenforcement will depend exclusively on citizen suits should not be \nbelieved.\n  You have heard also from the chairman of the subcommittee that EPA's \nrule will be plagued by dual enforcement.\n  This is the opposite of the claim that enforcement will happen only \nthrough citizen suits, but is often made by the same parties. This \nclaim is also untrue.\n  The mechanism EPA set up in the rule will allow for States to get \napproval for their programs, meaning EPA will make clear that they have \nreviewed the State program and found that it is at least as stringent \nas the Federal requirements.\n  In other words, EPA will make clear that a facility complying with \nthe State program is, without question, also complying with the Federal \nrequirements.\n  Citizens groups are unlikely to bring suit against facilities in \ncompliance. If they were to do so, such suits would not go very far.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, contrary to the claim that judges would be \ninterpreting the requirements differently left and right, Federal \njudges would defer to EPA's expert evaluations of the sufficiency of \nState programs.\n  These enforcement concerns are not the real motivation for this bill. \nAs I said, if this is about improving compliance and enforcement, it \nwould have widespread support.\n  Instead, this bill is about undermining important health and \nenvironmental protections, and that is why it faces widespread \nopposition.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nsouthwestern Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), my colleague and next-door \nneighbor.\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1734, the \nImproving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation Act of 2015.\n  This legislation will have a direct impact on the constituents in the \nEighth District because Indiana has more coal ash ponds than any other \nState.\n  I was concerned that the EPA's final rule on coal combustion \nresiduals lacked clarity and did not adequately address enforcement of \nthe Federal minimum standards for public health and safety.\n  H.R. 1734 fixes this by giving States like Indiana the authority to \nimplement coal ash rules in a way that protects the environment, public \nhealth, and good-paying jobs rather than totally deferring to \nbureaucrats in Washington, D.C.\n  This legislation also reconfirms that recycling this nonhazardous \nmaterial helps keep utility costs low, provides for low-cost, durable \nconstruction materials and reduces waste.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Under the proven model of environmental regulation, Congress sets the \nstandard of protection the State programs must meet. EPA interprets \nthat standard through rules or guidance so States know what they must \ndo to achieve that level of protection.\n  States can demonstrate to EPA that they have in place programs \nadequate to provide the minimum level of protection required, and EPA \nretains backstop enforcement authority to ensure that State programs \nare enforced. This bill, Mr. Chairman, fails on each of these points.\n  Unlike EPA's rule, it does not contain any minimum Federal \nrequirement to protect health and the environment. It undermines the \nminimum national safeguards in EPA's rule by introducing significant \ndiscretion. It fails to establish Federal backstop authority. Finally, \nit fails to define what facilities the bill covers instead giving \nStates discretion to define the scope of their programs.\n  So this proposal will not ensure the safe disposal of coal ash, \nprotect groundwater, or prevent dangerous air pollution, and it \ncertainly isn't going to prevent another catastrophic failure like the \none we saw in Kingston, Tennessee.\n  I continue to oppose the legislation, just as the administration does \nand just as environmental groups and public health groups do. I urge \nall of my colleagues to do the same.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, before I yield to my colleague from West \nVirginia, I would just like to mention that, when I mentioned the word \n``RCRA,'' that is a municipal solid waste law.\n  What we are doing is the same thing that we did to RCRA: Federal \nstandards, State implementation by the State EPA. It is the same thing, \nand all we are doing is codifying that, which means putting these rules \nand regulations in statute, in law, so it can't be changed.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins).\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Shimkus \nand Congressman McKinley for all of their hard work on this very \nimportant issue.\n  I rise to offer my strong support for this legislation. This \nbipartisan bill will provide certainty for more than 300,000 workers \naround our country, including thousands of coal miners in my State of \nWest Virginia and southern West Virginia, in particular.\n  The recycling of coal ash material helps keep America's energy costs \nlow. It helps to produce construction supplies that industries across \nour Nation rely on, such as materials for concrete and roofing.\n  The EPA's final rule did not address a number of issues, including \nState permitting requirements and oversight.\n  This bill puts the States in charge. It gives our States the \nenforcement authority to implement standards for the safe disposal of \ncoal ash.\n  Our State and local officials know better than Washington bureaucrats\n\n[[Page H5361]]\n\nhow to address the regulatory requirements of the rule.\n  I urge passage of this bill.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As someone who cares about beneficial reuse and wants to see the \nbeneficial reuse flourish, I am listening to this debate.\n  And one might think that we are facing a stark choice, either vote \nfor this bill or coal ash recycling will stop, but that is not the \nchoice that we face.\n  When EPA issued its final coal ash rule, they finalized a \nnonhazardous regulation, exactly what the coal ash recycling industry \nsought, and the rule explicitly protects beneficial reuse.\n  Many Members of Congress sent letters and submitted comments to EPA \nduring the comment period on the proposed rule in support of the \nsubtitle, the option they ultimately chose.\n  In this bill, on the other hand, the decision between hazardous and \nnonhazardous would be moved to the State level, meaning that these \nmaterials could be regulated as hazardous in some States, but not \nothers.\n  Now, how will that avoid the stigma so many in the industry have \nspoken of and how will it create the certainty they crave?\n  Even worse, this bill would eliminate important protections in EPA's \nfinal rule, meaning the number of damage cases is likely to continue to \ngrow, and that will really create a stigma around these materials.\n  So, if we leave these ash ponds in place and another one fails, what \nwill happen to the beneficial reuse industry?\n  The way to ensure a strong beneficial reuse industry is to ensure \nconsistent regulation and safe disposal of CCR by allowing the EPA rule \nto be implemented.\n  Again, that is why I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule if they \nreally want to see the beneficial reuse industry flourish.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, before I yield to my colleague from North \nDakota, let me just respond in that, in the final rule, they didn't \nclose the door to regulating coal ash as toxic.\n  They can re-regulate. They can promulgate a new regulation and then \ncall it toxic. So then you have the fly ash and the concrete in the \nschool and the school has to get torn down because it has got fly ash \nin it? It makes no sense.\n  So that is why we need to codify the science, which the EPA has \ntwice, now three times, said coal ash is not toxic.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer).\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the chairman's clarifying the \nstatements just made from the other side. I think we all have the same \ngoal, but the lack of certainty, when you put in rule that for today we \nare not going to determine it hazardous but we leave the thing open-\nended just in case we change our mind, that is uncertainty. That is \nwhat we are talking about.\n  I come from a State, North Dakota, where, for nearly 10 years, I was \na coal regulator. I regulated coal mining, among other things, \nincluding utilities, thank you very much. I appreciate the fact that we \nwere able to mine our coal, burn it at the mine mouth, and generate \nsome of the lowest cost electricity in the country largely because we \nare able to use the coal ash as a beneficial use for lots of things \nincluding, by the way, putting in the foundations of wind turbines.\n  We didn't need the Federal Government. We have been doing this since \nthe 1970s. We didn't need the EPA's overreach to teach us how to do it. \nThe regulation of coal ash disposal has been debated for decades--for \ndecades. Fortunately, for those of us in North Dakota, we have done \npretty well with it. We have had modern facilities and modern \nstandards.\n  Our State regulators at the health department, along with the Public \nService Commission, working with industry--and I stress ``working with \nindustry''--to develop these standards and practices that have worked \nfor all these decades really don't need further imposition of the \nFederal Government, and certainly not the EPA.\n  All of our regulations are tailored specifically to our coal types, \nspecifically to the coal ash, specifically to our geology; and, \nfrankly, this legislative approach may not be perfect, but it is better \nthan the EPA's proposal, Mr. Chairman, which leaves way too many \nopportunities for extreme environmentalists to meddle, to use the \ncourts to come in place throughout the years and impose much more \nextreme regulations.\n  I again thank the chairman for his leadership, and I thank the \ngentleman for introducing the bill.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chairman, once again, the House is considering a bill \nto set standards for coal ash disposal. Unfortunately, H.R. 1734 does \nnot contain standards that will prevent the problems from poor disposal \npractices that have plagued communities across the country for far too \nlong. H.R. 1734, the Improving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation \nAct, largely maintains the status quo, a system that is operated by the \nStates with no uniform Federal standards, and the status quo isn't good \nenough.\n  In the 35 years since Congress passed the Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act, or RCRA, the Environmental Protection Agency has been \nstudying the issue of coal ash disposal. During this same time, the \nregulation of these facilities has been done by the States, and \ncommunities in many States have experienced serious problems related to \nimproper disposal of coal ash.\n  Spills resulting from coal ash impoundment failures have polluted \nwater supplies, destroyed private and public property, and resulted in \nlengthy and expensive cleanup efforts. Action on this issue is long \noverdue.\n  Last December, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized a rule \nto strengthen the regulations on the disposal of coal ash. The final \nrule was published in the Federal Register in April. The rule was in \ndevelopment for many years. It is the result of an extensive public \nprocess. The Agency sorted through over 450,000 public-submitted \nstatements during the comment period on this rule and held eight public \nhearings in communities across the country.\n  EPA's rule is responsive to industry concerns that officially \nclarifying coal ash as hazardous waste would harm coal ash recycling \nefforts that utilize coal ash in new materials and products, and the \nrule is responsive to the concerns of public health and environmental \nadvocates. For the first time, the rule establishes minimum Federal \nstandards that all coal ash disposal facilities must meet. H.R. 1734 \ndoes not do that.\n  H.R. 1734 enables States to do what some are doing now, that is, to \nallow continued operation of these facilities without sufficient \nsafeguards. H.R. 1734 isn't about providing flexibility in achieving \nbetter standards. H.R. 1734 allows States to weaken a standard if \nfacilities can't meet them.\n  The standards set by the rule provide a guaranteed floor of \nprotection for all communities. What are these? Well, location \nrestrictions. New or expanded areas of existing coal ash facilities \nmust now be sited with consideration and defined buffers with respect \nto aquifers, wetlands, seismic impact zones, fault areas, and, indeed, \nunstable areas.\n  Liner design criteria are included to prevent leaching. The basic \nrequirements in the rule to include both a geomembrane and a 2-foot \nlayer of compacted soil can be met with an alternative design if the \nalternative would provide equivalent or better performance.\n  Structural integrity requirements are defined in the rule to prevent \nstructural failures, such as the one that occurred in Tennessee in the \nyear 2008, a failure that caused tremendous damage when an impoundment \nfailed.\n  Operating criteria are included in the rule to prevent runoff and \nwind-blown dust, require periodic inspection and capacity limits, among \nother things.\n  The advocates for H.R. 1734 have expressed concerns about the \nenforcement of EPA's coal ash rule. H.R. 1734 is offered as a remedy to \nthis problem. Well, there is no problem. The rule will be enforced by \nthe States through their own authorities to operate their solid waste \nmanagement programs. I think that is what H.R. 1734 envisions. The rule \nwill also be enforced through citizen suits; and, by the way, States\n\n[[Page H5362]]\n\nsometimes bring these suits against private parties on behalf of their \ncitizens.\n  Listening to the majority criticize an EPA regulation because of its \nweak EPA enforcement provisions is, indeed, unusual. It is certainly \nnot a complaint the Agency hears very often. The coal ash rule \nrepresents a compromise amongst the stakeholders in this issue. H.R. \n1734 simply does not.\n  It is not surprising there are those who are unhappy with certain \nprovisions of this rule. H.R. 1734 is on the floor today at the urging \nof some of those stakeholders. Of course, the rule from either vantage \npoint is not perfect.\n  Given the differing opinions on the role of Federal regulation of \ncoal ash disposal and the nature of the standards that should apply to \nthese facilities, that is not too surprising. But I do believe this \nlegislation--in fact, any legislation--is premature.\n  Changes in regulation or in law take a long time, and hitting the \nrestart button now will only lead to continued uncertainty and \ncontinued risk. We have had far too much of those already. I believe \nthe rule should move forward. H.R. 1734 would prevent that from \nhappening.\n  We have had 35 years of weak protection. It has cost us a great deal. \nIt is time for a more rigorous and stringent approach that prevents \nspills, water pollution, air pollution, and exposures to toxic \nsubstances. It is time to put people's health and safety first.\n  EPA's coal ash disposal rule was years in the making. We should not \ndiscard the approach taken in EPA's rule before it has even been \nimplemented or evaluated. EPA's rule emerged through an extensive \npublic engagement and negotiation process and as a result of years of \nwork invested by the interested parties and the Agency. The coal ash \ndisposal rule should be implemented and given a fair chance to work. If \nit does not, we certainly retain the option of moving legislation \nforward.\n\n  H.R. 1734 is unnecessary, and H.R. 1734 offers far weaker protections \nthan those of EPA's final rule. I oppose this bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time remains for each \nside?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois has 12\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. \nThe gentleman from New Jersey has 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWest Virginia (Mr. Mooney).\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, our coal industry is \nsuffering in West Virginia because President Obama's regulations are \nartificially driving down demand for reliable and affordable coal.\n  With power plants closing and home energy prices rising, our miners \nare suffering and jobs are being cut due to this administration's \ncontinuous overreach and interference. That is why Representative David \nMcKinley's bill, the Improving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation Act \nof 2015 is so important to our communities in West Virginia. I am a \nproud original cosponsor.\n  I strongly support this legislation because it allows States to adopt \nand implement their own coal ash permitting systems as long as they \nmeet basic Federal standards. The States, along with their local \ncommunities and hard-working coal miners, know best how to implement \ncoal ash regulations and will ensure that water quality and the \nenvironment are protected.\n  Being able to recycle coal ash means we can turn our spent coal into \nuseful products, like drywall and concrete. This means more mining jobs \nand a healthier economy for West Virginia and all of America.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in voting for H.R. 1734, the \nImproving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation Act of 2015.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, again, a major reason why so many Members on my side of \nthe aisle oppose this bill is because of our concern that coal ash is, \nin fact, toxic. I just want to focus for a few moments on the reasons \nthis issue is so important to many Members, i.e., the significant \nhealth risks posed by the toxic constituents in coal ash.\n  Coal ash contains arsenic, antimony, barium, beryllium, cadmium, \nlead, mercury, hexavalent chromium, nickel, selenium, and thallium. \nThose metals are toxic and pose both acute and chronic threats to human \nhealth and the environment. We have heard several claims today that \ncoal ash is not toxic, but the risks posed by these materials, if not \nproperly handled, are real and significant.\n  EPA finalized the rule for coal ash under subtitle via RCRA, the \nnonhazardous title, but even in that rule the Agency recognized the \nserious threats to public health, saying repeatedly that ash can leach \ntoxic metals at levels of concern.\n  We now know of more than 150 documented damage cases from coal ash \npollution. We saw what happened in Kingston, Tennessee. We saw what \nhappened in the Dan River. We saw what happened in Martins Creek, \nPennsylvania. The list goes on.\n  Some may try to dispute the empirical evidence, citing an old \nlaboratory test for leaching that EPA used in 2000, but that test is \nnot the state of the art and has not been for some time. In fact, in \n1999, the Science Advisory Board criticized EPA's use of that test for \ncoal ash, suggesting that a new test was necessary. In 2006, the \nNational Academies criticized the leaching test as well, saying that it \nwas not representative of real-world conditions and may greatly \nunderestimate the leaching that occurs. EPA recognized this in their \nfinal rule.\n  I would caution my colleagues against relying too heavily on that \noutdated test or even on EPA's decision to regulate as nonhazardous. \nCoal ash is dangerous, and if it ends up in drinking water, \ngroundwater, or air, it is toxic. That is why EPA's rule is so \nimportant and why this bill is so dangerous.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, before I yield to my colleague from \nFlorida, let me respond.\n  I am just trying to figure out whether the other side believes it is \ntoxic or not toxic and if they trust the EPA or don't trust the EPA, \nbecause the EPA has ruled twice--in 1993 and 2000--that it was toxic. \nThen they roll out the final rule, which the other side is defending, \nand they say it is not toxic. The other side's debating point is really \nwhy we need the bill, because uncertainty is being created with the \nrecyclable and reuse people.\n  What was just talked about should cause everyone who is in the \nrecyclable and reuse industry to say, ``We were right; we need this \nbill'' because the EPA, in 1993 and 2000, and the final rule. That is \none part of the reason why we need the bill is to close that loophole \nbecause, yes, it is kind of ironic for me to be supporting the EPA, but \nthe EPA has said it is not toxic.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support H.R. 1734, the \nImproving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation Act. This commonsense \nlegislation will ensure that coal combustion products are safely \nregulated by empowering the States to regulate it at fixed standards \nwithout overwhelming consumers' wallets. It also gives the EPA the \nauthority to act to protect the public should a State fail to implement \nits own regulations.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Coal combustion products have become a significant sector of the \neconomy, providing jobs and environmental and safety benefits. The \nrecycling of coal combustion products reduces greenhouse gas emissions, \nextends the life and durability of the Nation's roads and bridges, and \nreduces the amount that must be disposed of in landfills or surface \nimpoundments.\n  If EPA reverses its decision not to regulate coal ash as a hazardous \nmaterial, as they are considering, the cost to Floridians could be \nastronomical because Florida law does not permit hazardous waste \nlandfills. Utilities would then be forced to export the ash to \nneighboring States, the result of which would be higher out-of-pocket \nenergy costs for my constituents. We can't have that.\n  Overregulating the recycling of coal combustible products will only \nserve to hurt the environment and increase the costs to consumers. \nThese are things we should be avoiding, not promoting.\n\n[[Page H5363]]\n\n  This legislation will protect jobs and provide certainty to States, \nutilities, and businesses that recycle coal combustible products.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In response to the chairman of the subcommittee, I just want to \nstress again that I don't think that you should rely on EPA's decision \nto regulate as nonhazardous, meaning that coal ash is considered \nnontoxic.\n  The fact of the matter is that the EPA has never said that it is not \na toxic material, and they continue to say that it is dangerous. If it \nends up in drinking water, groundwater, or air, it is toxic.\n  That is why I will take the time now, Mr. Chairman, to read from the \nSAP, or the Statement of Administration Policy, from the Executive \nOffice of the President. Their main concern in issuing this Statement \nof Administration Policy is the impact on public health and the \nenvironment.\n  I just would like to read it. It says: ``The Administration strongly \nopposes H.R. 1734, because it would undermine the protection of public \nhealth and the environment provided by the Environmental Protection \nAgency's (EPA's) December 2014 final rule addressing the risks posed by \nmismanaged impoundments of coal ash and other coal combustion residuals \n(CCR). The 2008 failure of a coal ash impoundment in Kingston, \nTennessee, and the 2014 coal ash spill into the Dan River in Eden, \nNorth Carolina, serve as stark reminders of the need for safe disposal \nand management of coal ash.\n  ``EPA's rule articulates clear and consistent national standards to \nprotect public health and the environment, prevent contamination of \ndrinking water, and minimize the risk of catastrophic failure at coal \nash surface impoundments. H.R. 1734 would, however, substantially \nweaken these protections. For example, the bill would eliminate \nrestrictions on how close coal ash impoundments can be to drinking \nwater sources. It would also undermine EPA's requirement that unlined \nimpoundments must close or be retrofitted with protective liners if \nthey are leaking and contaminating drinking water. Further, the bill \nwould delay requirements in EPA's final CCR rule, including structural \nintegrity and closure requirements, for which tailored extensions are \nalready available through EPA's rule and through approved Solid Waste \nManagement Plans.\n  ``While the Administration supports appropriate State program \nflexibility, H.R. 1734 would allow States to modify or waive critical \nprotective requirements found in EPA's final CCR rule. Specifically, \nH.R. 1734 authorizes States to implement permit programs that would not \nmeet a national minimum standard of protection and fails to provide EPA \nwith an opportunity to review and approve State permit programs prior \nto implementation, departing from the long-standing precedent of \npreviously enacted Federal environmental statutes.\n  ``Because it would undercut important national programs provided by \nEPA's 2014 CCR management and disposal rule, the Administration \nstrongly opposes H.R. 1734. If the President were presented with H.R. \n1734''--as before the House today--``his senior advisers would \nrecommend that he veto the bill.''\n  That is the end of the SAP. The administration's opposition is \nprimarily based on the concerns over public health and the environment \nthat would undermine their rules.\n  Again, I think it is quite clear that the President, the White House, \nand the EPA are very concerned that this legislation would make it very \npossible for coal ash and toxic residue to get into the environment, \nwhether it is through drinking water, air, groundwater, whatever. That \nis our primary concern, Mr. Chairman.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 7\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, what is coal ash and what risk does it pose? Basically, \nit is the waste from burning coal and power plants or industrial \nfacilities; and it contains high concentrations of toxic chemicals, as \nI said, including arsenic, lead, and mercury.\n  The unsafe disposal of coal ash presents serious risks to human \nhealth and the environment. Contaminants can leach into groundwater and \ndrinking water supplies or become airborne as toxic dust. Aging or \ndeficient coal ash impoundments can fail structurally, resulting in \ncatastrophic floods of toxic sludge entering neighboring communities. \nExamples of these harms are numerous and well documented.\n  The EPA addressed these risks and published a final rule governing \ncoal ash disposal in the Federal Register in April after decades of \nwork, a robust public process, and consideration of over 450,000 public \ncomments.\n  The rule sets out minimum national criteria for the disposal of coal \nash carefully designed to ensure that no reasonable probability of \nadverse effects occur on the health or the environment, and the rule \nexplicitly protects beneficial reuse or recycling of coal ash.\n  The GOP is saying that their bill, H.R. 1734, would merely codify \nEPA's rule; but that is simply not true. This bill would endanger human \nhealth and the environment by eliminating or changing crucial \nrequirements in EPA's rule.\n  Some examples of protective requirements in the rule that would be \neliminated by the bill are liner requirements for existing surface \nimpoundments, closure requirements for deficient structures, location \nrestrictions, groundwater protection standards, cleanup requirements, \nand transparency.\n  The bill undermines transparency requirements in EPA's rule, \nincluding specific requirements to make information publicly available \nonline; and it introduces new exceptions to publication requirements.\n  Clearly, this bill would delay important health protections. The EPA \nrule requires coal ash disposal sites to quickly come into compliance \nwith the rules requirements, with many requirements effective \nthis October.\n\n  This bill establishes much longer timeframes for some requirements, \nwith full compliance not required until 6 or 7 years after enactment. \nEven where the timeframes in the bill are close to those in the rule, \nthey would be counted from the bill's date of enactment, leading to \nsignificant delays, compared to the rule.\n  There is no need for this legislation, Mr. Chairman. In the past, \nsome argued that legislation was needed to prevent EPA from regulating \ncoal ash as hazardous waste and to protect beneficial reuse, but EPA's \nfinal rule regulates coal ash as nonhazardous and specifically protects \nthe beneficial reuse.\n  Some have also suggested that legislation is needed to prevent dual \nenforcement of State and Federal requirements, but the final rule \nincludes a mechanism for EPA approval of State requirements \nspecifically to address this concern.\n  Who opposes H.R. 1734? Well, again, the administration--I read the \nSAP--environment, public health and civil rights groups, Sierra Club, \nand NAACP; the list goes on. In North Carolina, where a recent spill \ndevastated the Dan River, 25 State legislators have signed a letter of \nopposition to this legislation.\n  Again, Mr. Chairman, if you care about human health, if you care \nabout the environment, if you want to make sure that coal ash disposal \nis not going to contaminate your groundwater, your air, or your \ndrinking water, you should vehemently oppose this legislation.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to do so, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, a couple of things--first of all, drinking battery acid \nis toxic. Batteries are thrown into municipal solid waste landfills. \nStates comply with Federal standards and enforce the protection of \ntheir citizens. That is all we are asking here.\n  I am glad you read the Statement of Administration Policy. I have a \nletter from ECOS and ASTSWMO. ECOS is the Environmental Council of the \nStates. It represents all 50 States. ASTSWMO represents the Association\n\n[[Page H5364]]\n\nof State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials.\n  Every local government official that manages waste in this country \nand our territories supports this bill. They must think that there is a \nreason. I have got to believe that these local States are concerned \nabout protecting their citizens. Otherwise, they wouldn't be elected.\n  California is an ECOS. Washington State is an ECOS. In fact, the next \nletter we have is from the Western Governors' Association, and it was \nunanimous to support this bill. Our friend, the Governor of Washington \nState, used to be on the committee. No one would say he is going to \nthreaten and endanger his citizens.\n  The States can do this. They have State EPAs. Let's have a \ncertificate program using Federal statutory guidelines so that we know \nthe rules of the road. That is really all we are doing.\n  H.R. 1734 is the best solution for everyone. It is a solution for the \nEPA because their protective technical requirements for coal ash will \nbe implemented through enforceable permits, and they will have a far \nmore significant oversight role for coal ash than they would have under \nthe rule.\n  It is a solution for the States because they will be able to \nimmediately develop permit programs and know exactly what the permit \nprograms must contain.\n  It is a solution for the regulated community because they will have \nthe benefit of enforceable permits and regulatory oversight to help \nthem interpret and implement the requirements.\n  It is a solution for the beneficial users because they will have the \ncertainty that coal ash will continue to be regulated as a nonhazardous \nwaste.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Mr. McKinley for his longstanding \nleadership on this issue as we continue the process of trying to figure \nout how to effectively regulate coal ash.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this bipartisan solution to \neffectively and affirmatively regulate coal ash, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Chair, today, I rise to discuss my \nopposition to H.R 1734, Improving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation \nAct of 2015. H.R. 1734 is an attack on the EPA's recently finalized \nminimum disposal standards for toxic coal ash and a threat to safety, \nhealth, and the environment.\n  Low-income communities bear an unbalanced share of the health risks \nfrom disposal of coal combustion waste, as with so many environmental \nissues. Almost 70 percent of coal ash impoundments are located in \ncommunities of color or low income communities.\n  Coal ash disposal sites directly impact the health, livelihood, and \nhome values for the already poor and vulnerable communities living \naround these dump sites. More than 200 coal ash sites have already \ncontaminated water in 37 states.\n  Supporting this act gives a cold shoulder to American families \nsuffering from toxic coal ash-related health issues. It tells those \nfamilies that Congress does not care about their health and \nenvironmental issues.\n  This bill will delay many of the EPA's coal ash rule's new health and \nsafety protections, weaken the rule's mandate to close inactive ponds \nby extending the deadline for closure, eliminate the rule's guarantee \nof public access to information and public participation, and eliminate \nthe rule's ban on storing and dumping coal ash in drinking water. The \nbill will also remove the national minimum standard for protection and \ncleanup of coal ash-contaminated sites, remove the rule's national \nstandard for drinking water protection and cleanup of ash-contaminated \nsites, prohibit effective federal oversight of state programs, and \nprohibit EPA enforcement of state program requirements unless invited \nby a state.\n  This is why I am in support of the Butterfield/Rush/Clarke/Price/\nAdams Amendment, which attempts to improve this bill by allowing the \nAdministrator of the EPA to prevent the underlying legislation from \ngoing into effect if it is determined to have a negative impact on \nvulnerable populations.\n  In summary, I oppose H.R. 1734 because it places the health of \ncommunities and environment in great danger and fails to guarantee \nconsistent nationwide protection. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nprotecting the American people by opposing this bill.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 1734, \nthe Improving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation Act.\n  The Energy and Commerce Committee has looked at the issue of coal ash \nfor the past several Congresses. I have and continue to advocate for \ncoal ash to be regulated under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation \nand Recovery Act (RCRA), which would ensure that the recycling of coal \nash continues without disruption.\n  The beneficial reuse of coal ash is responsible for tens of thousands \nof jobs around the country--helping our economy and our environment.\n  I appreciate EPA's decision to regulate coal ash as a non-hazardous \nwaste in its April final rule. However, I do have concerns with the \nother parts of EPA's new regulations. In particular, the rule is self-\nimplementing, meaning that it does not require permits to be issued and \nthe federal government will have no authority to enforce EPA's \nstandards.\n  The best way forward is to create a state-based permitting program \nwith minimum federal standards. This legislation does just that, taking \nmany of EPA's requirements and folding them into state permitting \nprograms. The program created by this bill would give states the \nflexibility to meet their unique conditions and empower state agencies \nto enforce environmental and safety requirements that will protect \ncommunities and the environment.\n  EPA will be authorized to step-in for states that do not create their \nown programs.\n  This chamber passed coal ash legislation with bipartisan support in \n2011 and 2013. The legislation before us today is an improvement on \nthose bills and provides stronger protections for human health and the \nenvironment.\n  Mr. Chair, I ask for colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come \ntogether and vote in support of this commonsense, bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, I rise today to again voice my strong support \nfor H.R. 1734, the Improving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation Act. \nWe have been down this road before, and it has been bipartisan every \nstep of the way. Versions of this legislation already passed the House \non a number of occasions, and I believe that each Congress our \nthoughtful solution got better as we work to protect jobs, public \nhealth, and the environment. We worked closely with states as well as \nthe administration, and we have a balanced solution before us today.\n  This legislation incorporates the EPA's final coal ash rule that was \nannounced in December and eliminates the challenges to its \nimplementation. It sets up a state-based regulatory program to ensure \nthe safe management and disposal of coal ash.\n  States like my home state of Michigan have been, and will always be, \nbetter suited to implement rules and regulations because they \nunderstand local conditions. Folks who are on the ground are always \nbetter able to assess and handle a situation than bureaucrats in \nWashington.\n  We have received letters in support of this bipartisan bill from \nstate legislators, governors, and laborers--the list goes on. The \nWestern Governors Association wrote that they ``support congressional \nefforts to address problematic confusion'' created by EPA's final coal \nash rule. They point out that the rule produces an unintended \nconsequence by creating a dual federal and state regulatory system.\n  Why? Because EPA lacks authority to delegate the coal ash program to \nstates in lieu of a federal program. Their letter also notes that EPA's \nrule ``does not require facilities to obtain permits, does not require \nstates to adopt and implement new rules, and cannot be enforced by \nEPA.''\n  This bill is not about the fracas over burning coal. It's about who's \non the Clean-up Committee. It's about who has the expertise and \nresponsibility for protecting a state's natural resources and the \nhealth of a state's residents.\n  And it's not just Western Governors who understand this principle. \nThe Environmental Council of the States, the nonpartisan association of \nstate and territorial environmental agency leaders, has lent their \nstrong voices to this effort, unanimously writing is support of H.R. \n1734. This isn't just environmental chiefs from states with coal, or \nstates with governors from the same party. It's all ECOS member states.\n  We have a thoughtful solution before us today, and I want to \nrecognize the bill's author, Mr. McKinley, and the subcommittee \nchairman, Mr. Shimkus, for their hard work. We have been at this for \nyears and have struck the sweet spot. I urge all Members to vote \n``yes'' on final passage and to vote with the gentlemen from Illinois \non any amendments. I yield back.\n\n[[Page H5365]]\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1734, the \nmajority's haphazard effort to delay and weaken regulation of coal \ncombustion residuals--better known as coal ash.\n  Every year our coal plants consume nearly 800 million tons of coal. \nThat consumption produces nearly 100 million tons of coal ash loaded \nwith mercury, cadmium, arsenic, and heavy metals. These toxic compounds \nhave led even conservative towns like Conway, South Carolina--where \nPresident Obama lost by 28 points to Governor Romney in 2014--to vote \nfor coal ash removal.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency's Coal Combustion Residual (CCR) \nRule, issued on December 19, 2014, seeks to remedy the problem that \nmany communities have with coal ash. It prohibits storage in dangerous \nareas, like along fault lines and too close to the water table. It \ncreates strong liner requirements to prevent leaching of toxic \ncompounds. It requires groundwater testing of areas immediately next to \ncoal ash storage sites. It requires companies to clean up their mess \nwhen their coal ash leaches out or spills into waterways. It requires \ndisclosure and public notice of testing results and spillages.\n  H.R. 1734 would weaken most of these strong standards in favor state-\nrun permitting programs. And those programs that would take years to \ncreate and would then require fewer protections for the public.\n  But the watered down standards are merely the surface problem with \nH.R. 1734--the fatal flaw is in how H.R. 1734 would delay and undercut \nany effort to enforce coal ash regulations.\n  Under current law, private citizens may bring lawsuits to enforce the \nResource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA). Since EPA \npromulgated the Coal Ash Regulation under RCRA, that means that the \nsame people who care most about coal ash--those whose air and water are \nthreatened--may sue to enforce EPA's Coal Ash provisions. H.R. 1734 \nchanges that, creating a permitting program that could delay suits for \nmore than five years.\n  Still, the Chairman of one Energy and Commerce Subcommittee describes \nH.R. 1734 as a win for coal ash accountability, because it ``breathes \nreal-life enforcement authority into the standards.''\n  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  North Carolina--ground zero in the fight against coal ash--provides a \ncrystal clear example of the crony capitalist regulation and corrupt \nenforcement that H.R. 1734 would enshrine in law.\n  On February 2, 2014, Duke Energy spilled nearly 40,000 tons of coal \nash into the Dan River. The spill by itself was a disaster. But it also \ncalled attention to a decades-old problem--coal ash leaching in less \ndramatic ways into North Carolina's waterways.\n  Newly-aware North Carolinians were furious and demanded action. \nRaleigh, NC-based Public Policy Polling found that 93% of North \nCarolinians wanted the state to force Duke Energy to clean up the Dan \nRiver; 83% favored forcing Duke Energy to clean up all their coal ash \nsites.\n  But that was not what happened. North Carolina met Duke Energy's Dan \nRiver spill not with enforcement, but with what looks a lot like \n``constituent services.'' A three-decade Duke Energy employee occupied \nthe North Carolina governor's mansion. North Carolina's environmental \nregulator delayed the enforcement proceedings--as they have done with \nother leaching-based contaminations--to the benefit of Duke Energy. \nWhen they finally assessed a fine--they hit Duke Energy with just $25 \nmillion against a company who made $3 billion that year. But that \nagreement also had no requirement that Duke Energy clean up their \nspill--directly contradicting the wishes of 93% of North Carolinians.\n  H.R. 1734 tells us to trust in state enforcement. But as we have \nalready seen, it is far too easy for corrupt utilities to capture state \nregulators. H.R. 1734 repeals the EPA rule for one reason--it would \nwork. And unlike coal ash leaching into our drinking waters, that is \nnot something that unscrupulous special interest groups are going to \ntolerate.\n  I urge my colleagues to end the farce that H.R. 1734 represents; pull \nit from the floor like they did with the House Interior and Environment \nAppropriations; and figure out how they can help our communities \ninstead of poison them.\n  The CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, my amendment makes a technical and \nconforming change to the bill. Let me explain.\n  The final rule amends part 257 of title 40 of the Code of Federal \nRegulations. EPA put out a prepublication version on the final rule on \nDecember 19, 2014, meaning that it was public, but had not yet been \npublished in the Federal Register.\n  H.R. 1734 directly incorporates the requirements in the EPA's final \nrule, and so there are numerous citations in the bill to the Code of \nFederal Regulations because, as of the date of our full committee \nmarkup, the final rule had not yet been published in the Federal \nRegister and thus did not have a final citation in the Code of Federal \nRegulations.\n  It was necessary to include in the bill a reference to the date of \nprepublication of the final rule and include a paragraph regarding \nreferences to the Code of Federal Regulations.\n  The final rule was published in the Federal Register on April 17, \n2015; and as of that date, citations to the final rule were \nappropriately cited as citations to 40 CFR 257.\n  My amendment simply removes the paragraph from the bill that was \nadded as a placeholder until a final rule was published in the Federal \nRegister.\n  I urge all Members to support this amendment. I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Pallone\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in \npart C of House Report 114-216.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike page 9, line 1, through page 10, line 4, and insert \n     the following:\n       ``(B) Public availability of information.--The implementing \n     agency shall ensure compliance with sections 257.106 and \n     257.107 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations.\n       Page 47, strike lines 1 through 5.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 369, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pallone) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nin support of my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, this bill is dangerous for human health and the \nenvironment, in part, because it deletes or undermines important \nprotections in EPA's final coal ash rule. The deleted requirements \ninclude location restrictions, like a bar on disposing of coal ash \ndirectly in contact with natural aquifers. The undermined requirements \ninclude groundwater protection standards and monitoring requirements, \nwhich States would be able to change as they see fit. And all of the \nrequirements, including design, maintenance, and operation \nrequirements, would be delayed.\n  My amendment, however, focuses on just one of these dangerous \nshortcomings, which I think is very important, and illustrates the \nfundamental issues with this bill. EPA's rule establishes a strong \nnational floor for public disclosure of information. The rule specifies \nwhat information will be made available to the public and how it must \nbe posted. Utilities will have to maintain pages on their Web sites \nthat document their compliance with a wide range of criteria in the \nrule, including inspections and groundwater monitoring data.\n  These requirements will inform and empower communities and hold \nutilities accountable. Concerned citizens won't have to navigate an \narray of State agencies and offices to find out if the coal ash \nimpoundment in their neighborhood is contaminating groundwater. \nInstead, they will able to go directly to the utility Web site and see \nall monitoring results.\n  Mr. Chairman, EPA testified before the Energy and Commerce Committee \nthat these transparency requirements will be strong drivers of \ncompliance, just as disclosure requirements have been under other \nenvironmental statutes. The Toxics Release Inventory is a great \nexample. But this bill would eliminate these requirements.\n  Under this bill, there would be no national requirement to maintain a \npublic Web site and to post all of this important data. So my amendment \nwould simply restore these important requirements in EPA's final rule.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to ask why this bill does away \nwith this important compliance tool when its proponents suggest that \nthe bill will improve compliance and enforcement. I think the answer is \nthat this bill is not intended to increase compliance with the \nimportant standards EPA developed, but to allow the unsafe disposal of \ncoal ash to continue. But it has already gone on for far too long.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to address one of the \nmany shortcomings in the bill. I don't expect this amendment to pass, \nbut I want to be clear that even if it does, the underlying bill will \nstill be unnecessary and problematic. I will be urging a ``no'' vote \nwhen the question comes on final passage.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I share my colleague's concern for \ntransparency, and I too want to make sure that the public has access to \nall relevant information. The State certification program would have \nState public access through the State EPA, and that is in this bill. So \nthere is public access to information.\n  H.R. 1734 accomplishes the goal by making sure the public has access \nto information and guaranteeing that the public will be involved with \nthe decisionmaking process because it requires public participation in \nthe permitting process, and it requires States to make available on the \nInternet such information as: all groundwater monitoring data, \ninformation regarding structural stability assessments, emergency \naction plans and emergency response plans, fugitive dust controls, \ncertifications of closures, corrective action remedies, and all \ndocuments associated with the permitting process.\n  I would like to point out that Mathy Stanislaus, Assistant \nAdministrator for the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response at \nEPA, indicated at our legislative hearing that States making the \ninformation available on the Internet was just as good as requiring \nowners and operators of disposal units putting it on their Web site.\n  All that said, I understand my colleague's belief that the public \nwould be\n\n[[Page H5371]]\n\nbetter served by having utilities create individual Web sites where the \nsame information could be posted, and I offered to work with him to \nimprove his amendment so that it would have accomplished his goal of \nhaving individual utility Web sites and removing references to \nconfidential business information but would also have continued to \nensure that States would make information available.\n  I regret that we were unable to come to an agreement. I am willing to \nwork with the gentleman on this issue as we move forward, and I regret \nthat I have to urge a ``no'' vote on his amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey will be \npostponed.\n\n\n            Amendment No. 3 Offered by Ms. Castor of Florida\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in \npart C of House Report 114-216.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 14, strike lines 3 through 21.\n       Page 14, line 22, through page 16, line 10, redesignate \n     subclauses (V) and (VI) as subclauses (IV) and (V), \n     respectively.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 369, the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Castor) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, my amendment requires the owners \nand operators of coal ash ponds to immediately clean up pollution from \nspills or disasters that involve their coal ash waste. The underlying \nbill inexplicably did not contain such a requirement.\n  I know that is hard to believe, in the face of the horrendous coal \nash disasters of the past 2 years, that my Republican colleagues did \nnot include such a requirement. So my amendment reinstitutes the \nrequirement for cleanup of these disasters.\n  Now, the EPA rule requires an owner or operator of coal ash waste to \nrespond immediately to a spill or release, whether it is through the \nair, water, or soil. The rule requires the polluter to alert both the \nlocal authorities and the public and to immediately prepare a cleanup \nplan. I mean, that is a fundamental concept of doing business, isn't \nit? Yet the Republican bill eliminates that requirement for owners and \noperators.\n  They would no longer have to be responsible for their pollution or a \ndisaster? That is a scary proposition after the Dan River Duke Energy \nspill in North Carolina that spilled over 39,000 tons of coal ash and \n140,000 tons of toxic wastewater, and after the TVA blowout that they \nsay will cost over a billion dollars to remediate that community.\n  Now, there are over 600 coal waste disposal impoundments across the \nNation, and more than 100 million tons of coal waste are generated each \nyear.\n  In my home State of Florida, there are over 42 coal ash ponds at 8 \npower plants, 27 of which are unlined, and 13 landfills, 6 of which are \nunlined. My local power provider alone has 11 coal ash ponds and one \nlandfill. Over 6.1 million tons of coal ash are generated in Florida \neach year, yet Florida does not really regulate coal ash ponds, and \nthat is similar to a lot of communities across the country.\n  But we have learned the hard way that we need to have some basic \nstandards to prevent these type of disasters. The EPA has identified \n170 coal ash ponds and landfills that have contaminated groundwater, \nsurface water, or otherwise increased risks of harm to human health \nover the past years.\n  These surface impoundments where coal ash is stored in ponds pose a \nthreat, and even a threat to loss of life, if they fail. Coal ash ponds \nare located in 33 States, and 50 impoundments are currently considered \nhigh hazard, meaning that a failure would probably cause loss of human \nlife.\n  One such impoundment was at the TVA Kingston Fossil Plant, which \nburst on December 22, 2008, releasing 5.4 million cubic yards of coal \nash to the Emory and Clinch Rivers and surrounding areas, creating a \nSuperfund site that could cost about $1.2 billion, they estimate.\n  The initial release of material created a wave of water and ash that \ndestroyed three homes, disrupted electrical power, ruptured a natural \ngas line in the nearby neighborhood, covered railways and roadways, and \nnecessitated the evacuation of a nearby neighborhood. This disaster \nforever changed the lives of farmers, ranchers, and families. More than \n1 billion gallons of waste washed down the valley like a wave, covering \nmore than 300 acres. The volume of ash and water was nearly 100 times \ngreater than the amount of oil spilled in the Exxon Valdez disaster. \nThankfully, no serious injuries were reported since this occurred at \nnight while people slept.\n  And since 2008, we have had three major coal ash disasters, including \nthe largest toxic waste spill in United States history.\n  In addition to the TVA disaster, the Dan River plant spill in North \nCarolina was absolutely horrendous. February 2014, a pipe burst beneath \nan unlined coal ash impoundment, sending over 82,000 tons of coal ash \nslurry into the Dan River, spreading 70 miles downstream.\n  The cost of cleaning up spills and leaking dumpsites has already \nsnowballed, with six companies reporting liabilities that exceed $10 \nbillion. And we want to let them off the hook? I don't think so.\n  We have got to correct this by adopting my amendment. Without Federal \naction to guide cleanup within a reasonable time, we are going to let \nfolks off the hook, and that would not be fair. The chronic risks are \nsignificant. The risks to public and private property are significant. \nThe risks to public health are too significant to ignore.\n  So Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt the Castor amendment. \nVote ``yes'' to restore the rule's requirement to clean up releases of \npollution caused by these coal ash impoundment ponds.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, although I do not \noppose the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Illinois is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I appreciate my colleague \nbringing up this amendment. I just wish she, as a member of the \ncommittee, I wish we would have seen this in the markup of the full \ncommittee and the committee because maybe we could have just inserted \nit into the bill instead of having it as an amendment on the floor. I \nunderstand the gentlewoman's passion. I just wish, through regular \norder, we probably could have disposed of this in the committee \nprocess.\n  Having said that, the gentlewoman's amendment takes steps to more \nclosely conform the bill to the EPA rule with respect to cleanup \nrequirements, which is the entire intent of this bill. The intent of \nthe bill is to codify the EPA rule, and so the gentlewoman's amendment \nhelps us do that, and I appreciate that.\n  I agree with the gentlewoman that it approves a protectiveness of \nState permit programs. Again, the key thing about H.R. 1734, it creates \nState permit programs so that the States have Federal standards and \nthey have an enforceable permit program which they can enforce, just \nlike we do on solid waste.\n  I have no objection to the amendment. It is going to improve the \nbill, and I accept it on our side.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Connolly\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in \npart C of House Report 114-216.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n\n[[Page H5372]]\n\n\n       Page 27, line 19, strike ``Financial assurance'' and insert \n     ``Post-closure care and financial assurance''.\n       Page 27, line 24, strike ``section 257.104(b)(1)'' and \n     insert ``subsections (b) and (c) of section 257.104''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 369, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Connolly) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking the majority \nfor including my amendment offered to the coal ash bill considered in a \nprevious Congress requiring States to have a strong and comprehensive \nemergency response plan in the unfortunate event of a spill or a leak.\n  As I said then, and believe even more now, we simply cannot count on \na private company to be prepared for a spill. The State and local \ngovernments, who will be the first responders, must also be active \npartners. By requiring States to be prepared with their own emergency \nresponse plans, I think we are taking a modest step to ensure they are \nprepared to protect the communities.\n  Again, I acknowledge that and thank my colleagues.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  It is in that same spirit of bipartisan, commonsense, and modest \nsafeguards that I offer this amendment that would simply require that \nall inactive surface impoundments that begin closure procedures to put \nin place the same groundwater monitoring safeguards procedures required \nin the final Federal rule.\n  When we debated similar legislation in July of 2013, I spoke of the \ndevastating 2008 failure of the coal ash impoundment in Kingston, \nTennessee.\n  As a result of that breach, more than 5 million cubic yards of coal \nash were released, covering more than 300 acres in toxic sludge, \ndamaging and destroying homes and property, resulting in more than $1.2 \nbillion in cleanup costs.\n  We must not forget the lasting health consequences as well, some of \nwhich are still unknown, resulting from that incident. Some residents \nwill suffer from respiratory illnesses and other side effects.\n  Arsenic levels, where the Kingston coal ash runoff was disposed of, \nwere measured at 80 times higher than the amount allowed under the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, and the EPA already has said such exposure \nsignificantly increases the risk of cancer over time.\n  What is even more troubling is these incidents continue to occur, \nmost recently in my own home State of Virginia, where a neighboring \nNorth Carolina coal ash pond spilled more than 39,000 tons of toxic ash \nand 24 million gallons of wastewater into the Dan River.\n  Though much of the public and media attention of this spill was \nfocused on North Carolina's regulatory shortcomings, Virginians were \nalso left exposed to the dangers of that coal ash spill. It is \nestimated that only 2,500 tons of ash were removed, leaving over 90 \npercent of the coal ash in Virginia waters.\n  As a result of this incident, Virginia's Department of Environmental \nQuality has proposed a $2.5 million settlement against Duke Energy \nCarolinas, probably only a fraction of the ultimate cost of cleanup.\n  What has happened to communities in North Carolina, Tennessee, and \nVirginia can happen to any one of our communities that have or are near \ncoal ash impoundment ponds.\n  Today across the Commonwealth of Virginia, there are more than 30 \nactive and inactive ponds at 11 different sites, including one in my \ndistrict, with an average of 47 years.\n  As more of these facilities transition from coal-fired plants to gas-\nfired and biomass and as we close down these surface impoundments, we \nneed to make sure we are protecting our communities with proper \npostclosure procedures.\n  One of the easiest protections our constituents can expect is that we \nmaintain rigorous groundwater monitoring as these legacy ponds and \ninactive surface impoundments move toward postclosure status.\n  However, I worry that, as this bill is written and, admittedly, as \nthe EPA rule was finalized, regrettably, an unfortunate carve-out was \nmade that threatens our communities.\n  Why is it that a site that closes under the rule's guidelines must \nmonitor groundwater for 30 years, but one that is rushed to meet the 3-\nyear deadline only has to monitor for a fraction of that same time? \nWhat could go wrong with that?\n  Buried on pages 125 and 126 of the April 17, 2015, Federal Register, \nEPA notes that it ``received few public comments on the proposed \nactivities to conduct during the post-closure care. These commenters \nwere supportive of the activities and specifically urged the rule to \nrequire the monitoring of groundwater throughout the post-closure care \nperiod. The Agency received no comments opposing the proposed \npostclosure care activities.''\n  I will remind my friends that more than 450,000 comments were \nprovided on this rule.\n  It isn't often we can all agree on something. But I think we can \nagree our neighbors have the right to expect that the water they are \ndrinking is safe.\n  So here is our opportunity to come together and support strong \ngroundwater monitoring requirements at impoundment sites that keep all \nof our communities safe, and I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from West Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, when we analyzed all of the proposed \namendments to H.R. 1734 earlier this week, we were eager to accept \nthose amendments that might improve the legislation and make the State \npermitting process even stronger so we can ensure that the coal ash \nimpoundments are closed in a safe and efficient manner. Unfortunately, \nthis amendment would have the opposite effect.\n  This amendment would require that all inactive impoundments or legacy \nsites, as they are known, comply with the requirements in the final \nrule to conduct postclosure care, which includes the installation of \ngroundwater monitoring.\n  While I appreciate and share my colleague's concerns about inactive \nsurface impoundments, this amendment would not achieve what I believe \nis my colleague's goal of ensuring the timely closure of inactive \nsurface impoundments.\n  In the final rule, the EPA recognized the need for efficient and \ntimely closure of the inactive impoundments. In fact, the EPA \nincentivized the closure of legacy sites by ensuring that the utilities \nthat are able to safely closed inactive impoundments within the 3-year \ndeadline would not need to comply with any of the other requirements in \nthe final rule, including groundwater monitoring.\n  This amendment would wipe out the EPA's incentive for utilities to \ncomplete closure of inactive surface impoundments in a timely manner by \nrequiring that utilities comply with certain requirements immediately.\n  In addition, I think there is a broad agreement that the EPA final \nrule is protective with respect to taking steps to address inactive \nsurface impoundments.\n  The gentleman's amendment goes farther than even what EPA determined \nwould be protective to address the legacy site by requiring immediate \ncompliance with certain requirements which, as I indicated, would \nremove the incentive for EPA to close inactive impoundments by the \ndeadline.\n  Many of the inactive surface impoundments will be clean-closed. To \nexplain that, that means that all of the coal ash will be removed from \nthe impoundment. There is no need for 30 years of postclosure care for \nthese particular impoundments.\n  So for all these reasons, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote \n``no'' on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Connolly).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia will be postponed.\n\n[[Page H5373]]\n\n                  Amendment No. 5 Offered by Ms. Adams\n\n  The CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 369, the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Adams) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina.\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment provides strong and consistent \nsafeguards to inform communities about coal ash contaminants in their \ndrinking water supply wells.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about regulatory certainty, certainty for \nutilities, certainty for coal ash recyclers.\n  But what about certainty for children and families who live near coal \nash sites, certainty of transparency for their parents who rely on well \nwater to prepare their children's meals and to bathe them at night?\n  These parents have the right to know if their water is safe to \nconsume, and they have a right to access that information immediately.\n  And what about certainty of accountability to ensure that these \nfamilies can expect an alternate water supply if it has been \ncompromised by coal ash pollution?\n  North Carolina can give the Nation a lesson about what poor \nmanagement of coal ash looks like. It took a disastrous spill of coal \nash into the Dan River to make it clear that the protection of our \ncommunities and waterways could not rely on the goodwill of powerful \nutilities.\n  North Carolina learned the hard way that, when State regulators stick \ntheir heads in the sand to allow the unfettered disposal of coal ash, \nspills happen.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues the most recent update on \nwell testing from North Carolina's Department of Environment and \nNatural Resources.\n  Out of 285 wells tested, 265 show contamination. That is more than 90 \npercent of the drinking water wells showing contamination.\n  This information is made possible to communities because of S. 729, a \nbill that the North Carolina General Assembly passed last year while I \nserved in the legislature.\n  Following the Dan River spill, North Carolina now requires owners and \noperators of coal ash dams to identify all drinking water supply wells \nwithin one-half mile downgradient from the impoundments.\n  If sampling indicates high levels of contamination, the owner or \noperator must replace the contaminated drinking water with an alternate \nsupply of water that is safe.\n  My amendment seeks to provide rural communities across the Nation \nwith the same requirements that citizens in North Carolina now enjoy, \nrequirements that will give them the certainty that their water is \nsafe.\n  Americans in North Carolina and across the Nation have the right to \naccess safe drinking water, especially rural communities who rely \noverwhelmingly on private wells as their main source of drinking water.\n  Finally, coal ash pollution often affects low-income communities who \ndon't have the resources to go up against big utilities. Passing this \namendment will give these communities the resources they deserve to \nprotect themselves.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in standing with the people of North \nCarolina and rural communities across the Nation who deserve \ntransparency and nothing less.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, we applaud the activity of the State of \nNorth Carolina--and that is the whole benefit of H.R. 1734--because the \nFederal regulation proposed by EPA is a floor.\n\n[[Page H5374]]\n\n  And through a State certification program, if the States want to ramp \nthat up to a higher level, they can. So what North Carolina has done is \nable to be done under the current legislation.\n  But the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from North Carolina has \na lot of problems, and that is why I rise in opposition.\n  It would require each owner of a surface impoundment to provide EPA \nor a State certain types of data about all drinking water supply wells, \nto pay for and perform groundwater sampling at these wells, provide \nalternate sources of water, and issue regular reports on these \nactivities.\n  I understand the gentlewoman's concern, but I am not sure she gets \nthere with this amendment.\n  She talks about providing certainty. Well, there is already certainty \nto do this under Federal law. Under the Superfund law, which we call \nCERCLA, EPA already has the authority to obtain information, access \nproperty, and inspect and sample wells if there is a ``reasonable basis \nto believe there may be a release or a threat of release.'' So there is \nalready certainty under that law.\n  Not only does CERCLA already cover what the gentlewoman is proposing, \nbut the Safe Drinking Water Act provides the same authority.\n  The amendment would require owners or operators of coal ash disposal \nunits to provide an alternative source of drinking water if wells are \nfound to exceed existing Safe Drinking Water Act standards.\n  But section 1431 of the Safe Drinking Water Act already allows EPA to \nrequire that alternative sources of drinking water be provided if EPA \nhas information that a contaminant ``is likely to enter a public water \nsystem or an underground source of drinking water.''\n  So we already have that in Federal statute, especially if it ``may \npresent an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of \npersons.''\n  Beyond the duplication existing in the law that we already have, \nthere are also concerns with the amendment.\n  The amendment focuses on drinking water wells that are one-half mile \ndown-gradient from a surface impoundment. This seems an arbitrary \ndetermination, that for all States and for all impoundments, that that \nis where the groundwater is.\n  And that is definitely not true around the country. Can we be sure \nthat this is the correct distance? Why was that number selected?\n  The amendment would require the owners or operators to provide an \nalternative source of drinking water within 24 hours.\n  While we completely understand the need to move quickly to provide a \nsolution, it may not be feasible to secure an alternate source of \ndrinking water within that short a period of time.\n  Perhaps of greater concern, the amendment includes key terms like \n``drinking water supply well'' that are undefined, and the amendment \nwould trump all other groundwater monitoring requirements required by \nthe EPA final rule and State permit programs.\n  We are not trying to re-create existing authority. Rather, we are \nfocused on getting the folks with the most experience and knowledge of \nthis issue to address coal ash disposal units and ensure that they are \nnot causing contamination.\n  But I assure you that H.R. 1734 already mandates that, if disposal \nunits are causing problems, States will utilize all available \nauthorities to ensure that their citizens have safe drinking water.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment which would \nimprove protection for human health and the environment nationwide, and \nI would like to thank my colleague from North Carolina for her hard \nwork on this important issue and for offering this amendment.\n  The citizens and government of North Carolina recognize the \nseriousness of the risks posed by coal ash. They have experienced the \ndevastation coal ash can cause, and that is why even Republicans in the \nState government have supported strengthening regulation of coal ash.\n  Representative Adams speaks from personal experience that many of us \nhave been spared, but we should not wait for more coal ash disasters to \nadopt strong, preventive measures.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and vote \n``yes,'' but I do want to caution that, like my colleague, I will urge \na ``no'' vote on final passage even if this amendment passes.\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. ADAMS.

Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentlewoman from North Carolina will be \npostponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Butterfield\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in \npart C of House Report 114-216.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 47, after line 5, insert the following:\n       ``(m) Effect on Vulnerable Populations.--If the \n     Administrator determines that implementation of this section \n     would diminish protections for vulnerable populations, the \n     requirements of this section shall have no force or effect.\n       Page 47, line 6, redesignate subsection (m) as subsection \n     (n).\n       Page 50, line 17, strike the closed quotation mark and the \n     final period.\n       Page 50, after line 17, insert the following:\n       ``(9) Vulnerable population.--The term `vulnerable \n     population' means a population that is subject to a \n     disproportionate exposure to, or potential for a \n     disproportionate adverse effect from exposure to, coal \n     combustion residuals, including--\n       ``(A) infants, children, and adolescents;\n       ``(B) pregnant women (including effects on fetal \n     development);\n       ``(C) the elderly;\n       ``(D) individuals with preexisting medical conditions;\n       ``(E) individuals who work at coal combustion residuals \n     treatment or disposal facilities; and\n       ``(F) members of any other appropriate population \n     identified by the Administrator based on consideration of--\n       ``(i) socioeconomic status;\n       ``(ii) racial or ethnic background; or\n       ``(iii) other similar factors identified by the \n     Administrator.''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 369, the gentleman from North \nCarolina (Mr. Butterfield) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment that will ensure that \nvulnerable communities are protected from the unsafe storage of coal \ncombustion residuals known as coal ash.\n  My amendment is simple. It would prevent the coal ash regulation \nframework in this bill from going into effect if States fail to protect \nvulnerable populations from the adverse effects of haphazard coal ash \nstorage. Vulnerable populations defined in the amendment include \ninfants, children, adolescents, pregnant women, the elderly, racial or \nethnic groups, and others identified by the EPA Administrator.\n  Mr. Chairman, the EPA estimates that 70 percent of coal ash \nimpoundments are located in low-income communities. Coal ash \nimpoundments lacking proper safeguards can fail, resulting in the \nleaching of harmful chemicals into surface and groundwater. Coal ash \nstored in pools have caused water contamination in 37 States.\n  In worst case scenarios, catastrophic failures cause coal ash slurry \nto flow directly into rivers, streams, ponds, and lakes. The largest \ncoal ash spill in U.S. history occurred in 2008 in Kingston, Tennessee, \nwhen 5.4 million cubic\n\n[[Page H5375]]\n\nyards of toxic sludge spilled into a nearby river, causing a Superfund \nsite which could cost $1.2 billion in remediation costs.\n  In February of 2014, 82,000 tons of coal ash spilled into the Dan \nRiver in Eden, North Carolina, near the district of Ms. Adams, who just \nspoke a moment ago, after a pipe burst, causing a coal ash impoundment \nfailure. Costs for that cleanup are $300 million in the short term and \ncould potentially have a much greater long-term impact.\n  Mr. Chairman, the majority of coal ash ponds are located in close \nproximity to vulnerable communities. It is important to protect those \ncommunities from being disproportionately affected by poor coal ash \nstorage.\n  This commonsense amendment ensures that--if this bill were to go into \neffect--vulnerable populations are protected from the potentially \nadverse effects of coal ash exposure. Mr. Chairman, I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, we first learned about this amendment before us late on \nMonday. Of course, I was struck by the gentleman's deep concern for \nvulnerable populations, people who, because of circumstances or \nphysical attributes, are more at risk than others when it comes to \ncertain environmental exposures.\n  The gentleman knows well that I share his concern. He knows it from \nour committee work earlier this year on the TSCA Modernization Act. We \nreached a unanimous committee position in this area, in fact, \nthroughout the bill.\n  I reached out to him early Tuesday morning and tried to explain the \ngentleman's amendment was problematic as drafted; and we offered to \nwork with him on a version that addressed his concern without, frankly, \ngutting the rest of our bill.\n  Despite hard work from both teams and staff all day Tuesday, we were \nnot able to reach the agreement, so the gentleman opted to revert to \nhis original proposal which is what we are considering now.\n  Mr. Chairman, I see three basic problems with the amendments as being \noffered.\n  First, it gives the EPA Administrator effective unilateral veto power \nover the entire coal ash bill upon any EPA finding that somewhere, \nsomehow, a vulnerable subpopulation is not protected. This, of course, \nundoes the entire premise of the bill that brings together the best of \nthe EPA-proposed rule and the states' expertise and dedication in \nregulating solid waste through permit programs.\n  Second, the gentleman defines ``vulnerable subpopulation'' by listing \naround 10 specific population groups for protection. Everyone on his \nlist, I agree with, including, for example, infants, elderly, and \npersons based on racial or ethnic backgrounds; but when we include some \non a list, we can wind up excluding others.\n  It is a basic principle of legislative drafting. I think we should be \nsure to include all vulnerable groups, and we suggested to the \ngentleman language to do just that. I regret that we were not able to \nreach an agreement.\n  Third, Mr. Chairman, I am not sure the gentleman's amendment passes \nconstitutional scrutiny. I understand that we, in the Congress, have \nsweeping power to waive requirements of law; but I don't think we can \ngive a single Administrator power to cancel a law altogether. In my \nview, only the President himself has that power, subject to override \nvotes in the Congress.\n  I am willing to work this out with the gentleman, and we did try. I \nregret very much that this amendment does not reflect these efforts, so \nI have to urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. It is true that we did make a valiant effort \nyesterday to try to reach some common ground on this amendment, and \nregrettably, we were not able to get there.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his courtesy and his \nwillingness to have the conversation, and hopefully, we can continue to \ntry to legislate in a way that will protect vulnerable communities from \nthis type of activity.\n  Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member of the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support this amendment. It \nraises an important point that should be part of our dialogue on all \nenvironmental issues, and I thank my colleague for offering it.\n  The unsafe disposal of coal ash poses serious risk to human health \nand the environment. Those dangers are particularly acute for the \nminority and low-income communities that often live near coal ash \ndisposal sites.\n  Unfortunately, this dangerous bill would diminish protections for \nthose communities most at risk. Important safeguards would be \neliminated, and significant discretion would be given to States to \nchoose whether or not other safeguards will apply.\n  This discretion will hurt hotspot communities for the same reason \nthat they host these dangerous communities; it is because they do not \nhave the political clout and voice that other communities have. We must \nrecognize the disproportionate risks faced by vulnerable populations \nand ensure that those risks are addressed, and that is what this \namendment does.\n  While I don't support the bill overall, Mr. Chairman, I do urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment and vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the \nButterfield-Rush-Clarke-Price-Adams amendment.\n  The December 2014 coal ash rule was a reasonable compromise between \nthe EPA and the energy industry, based on sound science and three \ndecades of research into the significant human and environmental health \nconsequences of ash spills. I will oppose the underlying legislation \nbecause, as my colleagues have noted, it would unjustifiably eliminate, \nundermine, or delay the well-thought out protections included in this \ncompromise rule.\n  Our amendment gets at another issue. There is a great risk that this \nlegislation could be especially harmful to some of our nation's most \nvulnerable populations--and here I mean pregnant women, children, the \nelderly, low-income Americans--because nearly 70% of coal ash ponds are \nlocated in communities where the majority earns an income that falls \nbelow the national average, and where communities of color are \ndisproportionately represented.\n  Our amendment is very simple--it would require the Administrator of \nthe EPA to determine whether this legislation unfairly affects these \nvulnerable populations. If it does, its provisions would not go into \neffect.\n  Misguided deregulation is one thing; outright discrimination is \nanother. Let's make sure that we're not prioritizing the energy \nindustry's bottom line over the health and welfare of women, children, \nthe elderly, and low-income Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                       Announcement by the Chair\n\n  The CHAIR.

McDERMOTT. Mr. Chair, on rollcall Nos. 454, 455, and 456. I was \ndetained doing a TV appearance with Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC, Had I \nbeen present, I would have voted ``yes'' on 454, 455, and 456.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Chaffetz). There being no further amendments, \nunder the rule, the Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nHultgren) having assumed the chair, Mr. Chaffetz, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1734) to \namend subtitle D of the Solid Waste Disposal Act to encourage recovery \nand beneficial use of coal combustion residuals and establish \nrequirements for the proper management and disposal of coal combustion \nresiduals that are protective of human health and the environment, and, \npursuant to House Resolution 369, he reported the bill back to the \nHouse with sundry amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the \nCommittee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros.\n  The amendments were agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. FOSTER. I am in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Foster moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1734 to the \n     Energy and Commerce Committee, with instructions to report \n     the same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendment:\n       Page 11, after line 16, insert the following:\n       ``(D) Protecting drinking water and the great lakes.--The \n     implementing agency shall require that all structures that \n     are surface impoundments meet criteria for design, \n     construction, operation, and maintenance sufficient to--\n       ``(i) prevent any toxic contamination of groundwater; and\n       ``(ii) protect sources of drinking water, including the \n     Great Lakes, the largest freshwater system in the world.\n\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster) is recognized for 5 minutes \nin support of his motion.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill the bill or send it back to the committee. If \nadopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.\n  What this commonsense amendment does is something that I think we \nshould all be able to agree is a good thing; it protects our drinking \nwater. My motion to recommit would require that coal ash impoundments \nmust be sufficient to prevent toxic contamination of groundwater and to \nprotect all sources of drinking water, including but not limited to the \nGreat Lakes.\n  Coal ash--the material left after coal is burned--contains many toxic \nelements, including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and selenium. \nArsenic exposure can lead to nervous system damage, cardiovascular \nissues, urinary tract cancers, lung cancer, and skin cancer.\n\n[[Page H5379]]\n\n  When people are exposed to lead, they may experience brain swelling, \nkidney disease, heart problems, nervous system damage, a drop in \nintelligence, or even death. If not handled properly, these toxins can \nand do leach from storage sites and contaminate nearby water sources.\n  I think my colleagues on both sides of the aisle can agree that we \ndon't want our children drinking water contaminated with lead, arsenic, \nand other toxic compounds; but that is exactly what happens when these \nsurface impoundments are not properly built, maintained, and monitored.\n  According to a 2010 EPA risk assessment, people living near unlined \ncoal ash ponds have an increase in lifetime cancer risk as high as 1 in \n50 caused by the arsenic contamination alone in their drinking water. I \nsuspect that this is a much higher risk than any of us would accept for \nour families and ourselves.\n  I do not believe that it is an accident that coal ash ponds, as well \nas the coal plants that produce them, are disproportionately located in \neconomically disadvantaged areas, placing the burden on those with few \nresources to defend themselves and the health of their families.\n  A 2011 report by the Environmental Integrity Project found that my \nhome State of Illinois has the second most sites contaminated by coal \nash in the country, and that Illinois EPA data showed groundwater \ncontamination exceeding health standards at all 22 coal ash-related \nsites the Agency monitored.\n  We know that there are coal ash ponds contaminating groundwater. Some \nare located in Waukegan, Illinois, which borders Lake Michigan. \nContamination in Illinois is not just a problem for the people of \nIllinois; it is a problem for the entire country.\n  Water crosses State boundaries in lakes, rivers, and underground \naquifers. That is why coal ash should be regulated at the national \nlevel, but at a minimum, we should demand that groundwater and drinking \nwater be protected.\n  The Great Lakes are the largest freshwater system in the world, and \nit is unconscionable that we are considering a bill today that would \nweaken protections for the water that many of us drink.\n  The vote on this motion to recommit is fundamentally about whether or \nnot you believe that all people in our country deserve access to safe \ndrinking water.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this motion and ``yes'' to \nprotecting the health of millions of American families.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of \norder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation is withdrawn.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. I claim the time in opposition.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. We have had a good afternoon on debating the many \namendments that have been brought forward. Let me just briefly, in this \nshort time, talk about what we have done.\n  We have taken the recent EPA rule and codified it. In other words, we \nset it into statutory language so it can be enforceable. That allows \nStates to set up State permitting programs that can be enforced.\n  We trust States with what we call the Solid Waste Disposal Act, which \nis RCRA, to protect the Great Lakes. I think we can trust the States, \nin working with minimal Federal standards, to do the same thing.\n  The EPA, three times, has determined that coal ash is not toxic--the \nEPA has determined three times. In 1993, in 2000, and with their \nrecently released rule in December, they said coal ash is not toxic.\n  I am going to end on two letters that we mentioned in the bill \nmarkups and on the floor. We have the group called ECOS, Environmental \nCouncil of the States, which all the States' EPA directors; and also \nanother group, called ASTSWMO, which is the Association of State and \nTerritorial Solid Waste Management Officials, which is in all \nterritories; and the Western Governors' Association. There is not a \nsingle dissent. The Western Governors' Association includes California, \nOregon, and Washington State.\n  They all support H.R. 1734 because it actually does the opposite of \nwhat my colleague claimed. It strengthens the law. It codifies our \nability to enforce the result so that our communities are safe.\n  I appreciate my colleague's motion. I ask my colleagues to reject it, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5-\nminute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by a 5-minute \nvote on passage of the bill, if ordered.\n  This is a 5-minute vote.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 184, \nnoes 240, not voting 9, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 457]\n\n                               AYES--184\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Castro (TX)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Cleaver\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Costa\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeFazio\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Fattah\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Hinojosa\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jackson Lee\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

Mr. Speaker, today I would like to draw attention to the \nexcellent work that the Architect of the Capitol has been doing in \nrepairing and restoring the dome of our Capitol Building. I was \nrecently briefed with an update on the progress they are making about \nhalfway through the project. I am very impressed so far with the work.\n  Starting last June, they installed 52 miles worth of scaffolding at \n25 layers around the dome. It only touches the dome at three areas so \nthat the weight-bearing structures do not affect and damage the dome.\n  I am glad to know, also, that part of the repair devices come from \nCalifornia. In order to repair the cracks that they have in the iron \nstructure that happens over the years, a company from Turlock, \nCalifornia, devised a drill and self-tapping mechanism here that \nrequires no welding, no cornices, none of the complications you get \nwith cast iron, therefore making repair of the dome effective and very \ngood for the long term.\n  They have removed 12 layers of paint and will put on three new good \nlayers to make the dome gleam. We have some really excellent folks, 100 \npeople in construction at any one time, helping to make our dome gleam. \nThat is something we can all be proud of in our country, which is what \nI think this Capitol symbolizes: the greatness of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  So my hat is off to the great work of the Architect of the Capitol in \nrestoring our dome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5381-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING PHILIP SCHOLZ\n\n  (Mr. SWALWELL of California asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember and honor \nPhilip Scholz of Pleasanton, California, who died last year saving \nanother person from an oncoming train.\n  In January 2014, Philip saw someone on the Caltrain commuter tracks. \nHe reached out to try and help save this person. Both were tragically \nstruck by the train, and while the other man suffered injuries, he \nsurvived, and we lost Philip.\n  Originally from Washington State, Phil attended college in the bay \narea at Santa Clara University. At the time of his death, he and his \nwife had lived in Pleasanton, my Congressional district, for over 10 \nyears.\n  Phil was not just a hero for the way that he saved this man's life; \nthat is how he lived every day. Phil loved to hike, play organized \nsports, and rescue animals. He was also a regular blood donor and \nconstantly put others before himself.\n  His wife and friends have honored his memory by creating the Philip \nScholz Memorial Foundation to support the interests and causes in which \nPhil believed, such as donating to the Valley Humane Society of \nPleasanton.\n  Earlier this year, Phil was posthumously awarded the Carnegie Medal \nby the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission, given to recognize those who have \nrisked their lives to save others, and given to fewer than 10,000 \npeople since 1904.\n  Both the memorial foundation and this award are fitting tributes for \nsuch a courageous man. Hopefully, they serve to remind us of Phil's \nexample and inspire others as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5381-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF ANDRE IGUODALA\n\n  (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor \nAndre Iguodala, an Illinois native who was named the Most Valuable \nPlayer while playing for the Golden State Warriors in the 2015 NBA \nChampionship series.\n  Mr. Iguodala's basketball career began in Illinois' 13th District. As \na student at Lanphier High School in Springfield, Andre led his team to \nthe State championship game in his senior year and went on to play for \nthe University of Arizona. After graduation, Andre began his \nprofessional basketball career in the NBA.\n  Before his appearance this year in the NBA Finals, Andre proudly \nrepresented America as a member of the 2012 U.S. Olympic Team in \nLondon. He contributed to the team's efforts that ultimately earned \nthem a Gold Medal.\n  This year, Andre proved to be an important contributor to the \nWarriors' 2015 NBA Finals success. He was a crucial part in helping to \nearn the team the NBA championship title, and he was awarded the MVP \naward with a resounding vote of 7-4.\n  I am proud to recognize Andre Iguodala and his many accomplishments \nand his dedication to basketball from his time as a youth in \nSpringfield, Illinois, until now.\n  Congratulations, Andre. Congratulations to all the Warriors fans.

Mr. Speaker, 730 days; 17,520 hours; 1,051,200 minutes; 2 \nfull years since the Supreme Court ruled section 4 of the Voting Rights \nAct of 1965 unconstitutional; 2 full years without voter protections \nand full access to the ballot box.\n  Since the ruling, many Americans in States like Ohio have been \nsubjected to restrictive voter registration requirements, paying costly \nfees for State IDs or waiting in line for hours on election day.\n  Legislation to restore the VRA and strengthen the right to vote have \nbeen offered, but the majority has refused to take them up. It is clear \nCongress has dropped the ball.\n  Two years without the full protection of the Voting Rights Act is too \nlong. The clock is ticking. It is time to restore the VRA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5381-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WE NEED A COMMONSENSE SOLUTION\n\n  (Mr. LIPINSKI asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LIPINSKI.

ICE issued a detainer, but \nthe defendant was let out on bail and disappeared.\n  Donald Trump is wrong. Most immigrants to America are upstanding \npeople who come to our country to work hard, but policies that permit \nthese travesties should be stopped.\n  Unfortunately, we are not being offered a commonsense solution. We \nare offered the polarizing choices that we either do nothing or we harm \nthe very institutions and citizens we are trying to protect.\n  What we need to do is stop local policies that ignore ICE detainers \nand let criminals go who are in our country illegally. I know this \ncommonsense solution will anger people on both sides, but ask local \npolice. They want to focus on those who have committed crimes in their \ncommunities.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n\n[[Page H5382]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of \none of the great leaders that stood tall here in Washington, D.C., and \nback home in Texas, James ``Jim'' Claude Wright, Jr., who passed away \nrecently, back in May, at the age of 92.\n  And, Mr. Speaker, I am sad to announce that his wife Betty just died \non July 15, just last week. So the family has been through a lot.\n  We have a lot of really nice stories to tell about Speaker Wright and \nhow he has influenced so many people.\n  I want to begin by yielding to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. \nHoyer), our minority whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding.\n  Jim Wright would have been proud of Marc Veasey. He would have said \nMarc Veasey is in the Jim Wright tradition. I am going to speak a bit \nabout that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about a Mr. Speaker, to pay tribute to \nthe life and legacy of a man who served this House and our country with \ndistinction as a Member, as majority leader, and as Speaker.\n  Jim Wright was a man of principle and great political skill, and he \nrelied on both during his 34 years in Congress. I have now served 34 \nyears in Congress, and for part of that 34 years, I had the honor of \nserving with Jim Wright.\n  Just 2 years after he was first elected to represent Texas' 12th \nCongressional District, Jim stuck to his principles and refused to sign \nthe Southern Manifesto, opposing desegregation, as so many of his \nsouthern colleagues did.\n  It was a risk, of course, Mr. Speaker, politically, but he put his \nbelief in equal opportunity ahead of what was politically popular among \nhis constituents at the time.\n  When he voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1957, it was a further sign \nof his courage, of his conviction, and of his adherence to the \nprinciples that have made our country so great and so respected.\n  In spite of breaking with many of his southern conservative \nDemocratic colleagues on that issue, he forged friendships with them \nbased on mutual respect and good old-fashioned camaraderie, just as he \ndid with Members from other parts of the country and across party \nlines.\n  Jim was elected majority leader in 1976, and he was serving in that \ncapacity when I came to Congress in 1981. Today, Mr. Speaker, I am \nhonored to sit in the same office, H-148 in the Capitol Building, just \na few feet from this floor, where Jim Wright sat as the majority \nleader.\n  If you look up toward the ceiling in one corner of our office suite, \nyou can still see the great seal of the State of Texas painted on the \nwall. Emblazoned in the center of that seal is the proud lone star of \nTexas.\n  Sam Rayburn may have been one of those stars, Lyndon Johnson may have \nbeen one of those stars, and many other Texans may have been one of \nthose stars. But in our office, that lone star stands for Speaker Jim \nWright.\n  In many ways, Jim was that lone star who stood out at the center of \nour party in this House, a leader who knew how to bring Members \ntogether by inspiring them to follow his example.\n  He never wavered in his mission to bring Democrats and Republicans \ntogether and replace partisan divisions with cooperation, comity, and--\nyes--compromise, which is in such little supply on this floor right \nnow.\n  Jim was an extraordinary person. He was someone who refused to take \n``no'' for an answer and seemed destined to serve his community and his \ncountry.\n  Mr. Speaker, at age 10, he tried hard to join the Boy Scouts, even \nthough he was 2 years shy of the minimum age to participate.\n  At 13, Jim lied and said he was 16 in order to enter a boxing \ntournament. Now, there are some 13-year-olds who can empathize with \nthat. And, Mr. Speaker, he almost won that competition.\n  In high school, his classmates wrote in his class of 1939 yearbook \nthat Jim would likely be serving in Congress by 1955. How prescient his \nclassmates were, for he won his first congressional election in 1954.\n  While in college at the University of Texas, Jim learned that the \nattack on Pearl Harbor had occurred. Without hesitation, he decided to \ndrop out the next day and join the Army Air Corps.\n  Jim flew more than 300 combat hours over the South Pacific. He flew, \nas my stepfather did, in the battles that were fought in the Pacific to \ncombat those who had attacked Pearl Harbor. He was decorated for his \ndistinguished service.\n  Those of us who served with Jim in the House saw the same determined \nspirit he demonstrated in the Army as he applied himself to serving the \npeople of Texas' 12th District.\n  I had the opportunity to be at Jim Wright's funeral on May 11 of this \nyear.\n  On the day of his assassination, in the last speech of his life, \nPresident John Fitzgerald Kennedy visited what he called ``Jim Wright's \ncity'' and praised the Congressman by saying, ``I don't know of any \ncity that is better represented in the Congress of the United States \nthan Fort Worth,'' Texas.\n  I can remember the year after Jim Wright was elected Speaker of the \nHouse that I had the opportunity of chairing and emceeing a dinner that \nwas held in Fort Worth, one of the biggest ever held there.\n  I will echo, therefore, that sentiment. I can think of few who served \nin the Congress who will be remembered as fondly by those they served \nwith than Jim Wright, by his constituents, by his colleagues, and by \nhis family. He loved this institution dearly.\n  His family and those who served with him, like me, will miss him. A \ngrateful Nation thanks him for a lifetime of service to us all.\n  And I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Hoyer, I thank you very much. I appreciate those very \nkind words about Speaker Wright, and everyone in Fort Worth and the \nmetroplex will appreciate those kind words as well.\n  I also would like to recognize Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. She is \nanother Member of Congress who also served with Speaker Wright, someone \nthat she was also very fond of. She had the opportunity to talk with \nSpeaker Wright a couple of years before his passing when she was down \nin Fort Worth.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi).\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me on \nthis very special Special Order.\n  I thank you for affording me the opportunity to visit with Speaker \nWright, as you mentioned, in just the recent past. On a number of \noccasions and visits to Texas, I have had the privilege of basking in \nhis glow, because that is what we did here in the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  When Jim Wright was the Speaker of the House, I had the privilege to \nserve under his leadership for a short period of time because I was a \nnew Member at the time.\n  And when he would come to this floor, to this well, to speak as the \nSpeaker of the House, his oratory was just so compelling. People would \nstop what they were doing to listen to what Jim Wright had to say and \nhow he said it.\n  In some ways, that was of another era that hearkened back to how the \nbusiness or the work of Congress was conducted, where people would come \nand actually listen to the debate.\n  He was a man of great oratorical skill, of course, a legislative \nmaster, but he was also a person of great courage and a person of great \nprinciple.\n  Tonight we gather on the floor to honor the memory of this great \nSpeaker of the House. From the service that earned him the \nDistinguished Flying Cross in World War II to leadership that defined \nhis 34 years in the House, Jim Wright exemplified commitment to the \nbright future of America's families.\n  He was a great patriot. He was one of America's most distinguished \nand dedicated public servants, a person known for deep courage, \nbrilliant eloquence, and a complete mastery of the legislative process.\n  Wright's strong, decisive leadership built an indelible legacy of \nprogress not only in his beloved State of Texas, but around the world.\n  Jim Wright championed investing in our infrastructure. Jim Wright had \nbeen a member of the Transportation Committee. He helped forge a path \nto peace in Central America.\n  For that, I will always be grateful to him for his brilliance, for \nhis leadership, and especially for his courage. It\n\n[[Page H5383]]\n\nwas hard to do. Jim Wright sought prosperity for every hard-working \nfamily.\n  Speaker Wright was a patriot who held the respect of friends and \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. Even after he left the House, \nWright continued to contribute to building a better future for our \ncountry by sharing his wisdom with the new generation of leaders, as \nprofessor at Texas Christian University.\n  When Jim Wright was presented the gavel in 1987, becoming the Speaker \nof the 100th Congress, he spoke of the enduring promise of our \nConstitution and of the sacred responsibility it entrusts the Members \nof the House. He said:\n\n       We are its custodians. Those men of principle and vision \n     who penned the deed to freedom had in mind a very special \n     place for the Congress. Ours is a creative and dynamic role. \n     We alone can legislate. Only we can appropriate. We are \n     expected to initiate, to innovate, to see the obstacles on \n     the road ahead, and to chart a path around them for our \n     Nation.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Let us, with gratitude for the privilege that is ours, ask \n     Almighty God that He shall grant to each of us a portion of \n     the vision to see the right; the courage to stand for the \n     right; the honesty to admit human error; and the love that \n     binds our Nation and our people together, to the end that we \n     may continue to be not the envy of the world but an \n     inspiration to the world--and an instrument of His peace.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, 28 years later, Jim Wright's prayer for bravery and \nhumility still speaks to us through the decades. He was indeed a person \nwho had the vision to see the right and the courage to stand for the \nright. And, for that, we are enormously grateful.\n  Speaker Jim Wright never stopped serving our country, and his \nachievements will stand forever as a living monument to his determined \nvision and legislative ability.\n  I learned a lot from Jim Wright in the short period of time that I \nserved with him in Congress, and from time to time I share those \nlessons with newer Members of Congress, but also with great humor.\n  We hope it is a comfort to Speaker Wright's family, friends, \nstudents, and colleagues that so many of us share their grief and some \ncome to the floor to join with them in celebrating his memory.\n  May his legacy long keep watch over the House he led, and may it \nchallenge all of us to do more and do better on behalf of America's \nhard-working families.\n  Thank you to Jim Wright's family for sharing him with all of us. It \nwas an honor to serve with him. It was even a bigger privilege to call \nhim friend.\n  I will miss that I will not be seeing him from time to time in Texas. \nI always invited him to the Congress for any special occasion we had. \nAnd on one or two occasions, he did accept, and that was an honor for \nthis House.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding and for calling this Special \nOrder.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Mr. VEASEY. Leader Pelosi, I appreciate those kind words about \nSpeaker Wright, and I know that his family will appreciate everything \nthat you have to share. Thank you so much.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I do want to add to my remarks because I was \nso taken by speaking about Jim Wright; but on the occasions I did see \nhim in Texas, on the most recent occasions, he expressed the pride he \ntook in your service in the Congress.\n  Congratulations to you, Congressman Veasey, for carrying on that \nbeautiful legacy.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize, from the 30th \nCongressional District in Texas, the gentlewoman from Dallas, Ms. Eddie \nBernice Johnson, who also was very well acquainted and was a good \nfriend of Speaker Wright's and has some great stories about things that \nshe shared with Speaker Wright over the years.\n  Now, I would like to welcome and yield to the gentlewoman from the \n30th Congressional District from Dallas, Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice \nJohnson).\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with \ngreat pleasure to pay tribute to the life and legacy of the former \nSpeaker of the House, James ``Jim'' Wright, who passed away on \nWednesday, May 6, at age 92 of this year.\n  Speaker Wright served in Congress for more than three decades and \nleft an indelible legacy as chairman of the House Public Works \nCommittee that is now named the Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee.\n  He was elected by his peers as Speaker in 1987. He was born in Fort \nWorth, Texas, the son of a traveling salesman. He was educated at \nWeatherford College and the University of Texas at Austin. He dedicated \nhis life to serving the public. He bravely served in the United States \nArmy Air Force during World War II and was awarded the Distinguished \nFlying Cross for flying combat missions in the South Pacific.\n  Subsequently, he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in \n1946. He served as mayor of Weatherford, Texas, from 1950 to 1954; and \nhe was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1954. He was \nreelected 16 times.\n  Speaker Wright was a visionary who served the people of Fort Worth \nand this Nation well. He is deserving of this tribute. Because of his \nleadership, the House experienced one of the most prolific periods.\n  Speaker Wright demonstrated his skill as a political leader and a \nmaster legislator by shepherding extraordinarily complex legislation \nthrough the House. He understood that the business of legislating and \ngood politics required good skill in the art of compromise.\n  Speaker Wright never backed down from a challenge. Even after leaving \noffice, he continued to serve the public diligently. I was always able \nto consult with Speaker Wright, and I will always cherish those \nmemories.\n  He was the author of the Wright amendment at the time the Dallas/Fort \nWorth airport was built. When it came time for it to change, only \nSpeaker Wright, even in retirement, was able to get it loose in the \nSenate so that we could get it passed in the House as well.\n  Our country has lost one of its finest statesman; and I have lost a \nvery close personal friend whose wisdom, dignity, and knowledge of the \nlegislative process was unquestionably enviable.\n  He is among the most influential speakers in the history of the House \nof Representatives. Jim Wright is really an unforgettable public \nservant and leader. A man fueled by passion and concern for others, he \nset the bar high for his successors.\n  At the time of his death, he was survived by his wife, Betty, who was \ndeceased just recently, and four children.\n  I stand today to honor former Speaker of the House Jim Wright and \nthank him for his work in the service of the people of Texas and \nthroughout the Nation. He has left a powerful legacy that will live for \ngenerations.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Congressman Veasey, for having the \nleadership and the vision for waiting for a while to be able to sponsor \nthis hour in tribute to Speaker Wright.\n\n                           Speaker Jim Wright\n\n                     December 22, 1922-May 6, 2015\n\n       Jim Wright, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives \n     and Distinguished Lecturer at TCU, died Wednesday, May 6, \n     2015, in Fort Worth.\n       Jim Wright was born on December 22, 1922, to James Claude \n     and Marie Lyster Wright. His childhood years were spent in \n     Oklahoma and Texas during and after the Depression but for \n     the remainder of his life he referred to both Weatherford and \n     Fort Worth as home. This period in his life had a strong \n     impact on his later legislative priorities. He finished his \n     primary education by age 16 and soon thereafter enrolled in \n     Weatherford College and the University of Texas in Austin. In \n     his senior year, Pearl Harbor called many of the young men \n     his age to enlist in the military and to serve their country. \n     Wright enlisted in the Army Air Corps at age 19 and in 1943 \n     flew the first of five legs in the South Pacific movement of \n     the 380th Heavy Bomb Group as a bombardier. During World War \n     II, men painted a personal name on the exterior of their \n     aircraft and Wright's group flew nightly raids from Australia \n     to nearby Japanese bases in a B-24 Liberator Bomber known as \n     Gus's Bus.\n       Soon after enlisting, Jim married his college sweetheart, \n     Mary Ethlyn Lemons, on December 25, 1942. They were married \n     for 28 years and had five children: James C. III; Virginia; \n     Kay; Parker Stephen and Alicia Marie. Mary Ethlyn and Parker \n     Stephen preceded him in death. He married Betty Hay in \n     November 1972 and they lived together in Washington, D.C. and \n     later Fort Worth. Betty was his love and companion for 42 \n     years. In addition to Betty and these children, he is \n     survived by 15 grandchildren, 24 great-grandchildren and his \n     sister, Betty Lee Wright.\n       Wright returned from the war and at age 23 was elected to \n     the Texas State Legislature\n\n[[Page H5384]]\n\n     as one of the youngest men to ever serve in that body. He \n     subsequently served as mayor of Weatherford and worked in his \n     father's rural economic development business as an \n     advertising agent for National Trades Day. In November of \n     1954 Wright was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives \n     from Texas' 12th Congressional District. In Congress, he \n     served on the Public Works Committee, Budget Committee and \n     beginning in 1977 as the majority leader for the Democrats in \n     Congress. In 1987, his colleagues elected him to be Speaker \n     of The House. He had many lasting influences in Fort Worth, \n     including infrastructure projects such as DFW Airport, \n     veterans' programs and environmental projects.\n       After World War II, Wright referred to Congress as a heady \n     place to be, where members of both political parties \n     cooperated to make America a world leader and to build and \n     support a strong middle-class. He said, ``We'd had to cast \n     aside the restraining remnants of local chauvinisms, ethnic \n     schisms, religious bigotry, and regional mistrusts. In the \n     words of our pledge of allegiance, we were becoming more \n     nearly `one nation, indivisible.' '' He loved the \n     institution.\n       One of the most fulfilling days in Wright's political \n     career came on Nov. 22, 1963, when President John F. Kennedy \n     visited Fort Worth to meet and speak to residents. And less \n     than two hours after speaking in Fort Worth, it became one of \n     the most tragic in all of history when President Kennedy was \n     shot. The whiplash of that day's emotion haunted Jim as one \n     of the happiest then one of the saddest moments in his \n     lifetime. Before leaving Fort Worth, President Kennedy said, \n     ``I know of no other city in the United States that is better \n     represented in the Congress of the United States than Fort \n     Worth.''\n       Wright's accomplishments as a U.S. Congressman were many. \n     Among his proudest memories he would recall legislation \n     creating the Clean Water Act, interstate highway system, \n     benefits for returning veterans, and the honor he felt as a \n     witness and participant to creating peace. He visited the \n     Middle East, facilitating the initial meeting that lead to \n     the accord between Israel and Egypt in 1977; and in ending \n     the internal strife in Nicaragua in 1988 by leading a \n     compromise to end the U.S.-financed war between the \n     Sandinista Government and the Contras. In foreign affairs, \n     Wright enjoyed the role of bipartisanship and peacemaker, and \n     Nicaragua was perhaps the most difficult of all bipartisan \n     efforts. To the surprise of an increasingly partisan group of \n     legislators wanting to overthrow the Nicaraguan government, \n     his approach led to an end to U.S.-financed weapons and to \n     constructive talks among the Nicaraguan leaders and \n     eventually to democratically-held elections.\n       His success led a similar group of partisan legislators to \n     file ethics charges against him, and even though the initial \n     charges against him were dropped for lack of evidence, the \n     persistence of what had become an increasingly partisan and \n     combative Legislative Branch led to his resignation. In his \n     resignation speech he said, ``When vengeance becomes more \n     desirable than vindication, harsh personal attacks on one \n     another's motives, one another's character, drown out the \n     quiet logic of serious debate on important issues, things \n     that we ought to be involved ourselves in. Surely, that's \n     unworthy of our institution, unworthy of our American \n     political process. All of us in both parties must resolve to \n     bring this period of mindless cannibalism to an end. There's \n     been enough of it.'' To Jim's constant dismay, he did not \n     live long enough to see the end or even a diminished attack \n     by partisan efforts.\n       After returning to Fort Worth, Wright put his official \n     office papers with the TCU Library and for more than 20 \n     years, he taught at TCU a course on ``Congress and the \n     Presidents.'' His intention to keep the classes small was not \n     possible and his classes continued to grow by registering \n     interested students. In December 2010, his eyesight had \n     become an insurmountable challenge as a teacher and he \n     retired.\n       Jim Wright approached life with an eager and courageous \n     mission in each pursuit. He had the balance of knowledge, \n     intuition, direction and wisdom that comes from experience. \n     His ability to forgive and move on was amazing, and his \n     desire to overcome was persistent. When he loved he did it \n     with all his heart and he loved this lifetime. Horace Greeley \n     had a quote that Wright used--``and fame is a vapor, \n     popularity an accident, riches take wings, those who cheer \n     today may curse tomorrow, only one thing endures: \n     character.''\n       Well done, Jim Wright, your character endures and you will \n     be forever remembered.\n\n                                --After a private conversation\n\n                                                  with Dad in 2013\n                                                            Ginger\n\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman from the 30th \nDistrict, Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson, for her very kind words about \nSpeaker Wright. He was very fond of you and appreciated your leadership \nin an area that he excelled in, which was transportation. I just want \nto thank you for your kind words.\n  Now, I would like to recognize from Houston, Texas, the distinguished \ngentlewoman, Sheila Jackson Lee, who would also like to have a few \nwords about Speaker Jim Wright.\n  So many Texans that served with Jim Wright and those who didn't have \nthe opportunity to serve with him really appreciated his style and \neverything that he stood for. He was such a statesman.\n  You can tell how his influence was felt because so many individuals \nlike Sheila, so many other people that knew the Speaker reached out to \nme after his death and wanted to send condolences to his friends and \nhis family, and she was just thankful that he was so influential in \nSheila Jackson Lee's life as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Houston, Texas (Ms. \nJackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here with my \ncolleagues from all over the Nation, Leader Pelosi, Whip Hoyer, and my \ncolleague as well, Congressman Johnson from Dallas.\n  We all gathered at the funeral of Speaker Wright, and it was almost \nlike a reunion of family members from the many political persons, \npublic servants who not only through the years have known Speaker \nWright, but really, those who came to honor him because of the iconic \nrole that he played in the history of Texas and the history of America.\n  We are excited that he was a Speaker that cared about people and \ncared about Members. He, as was indicated, was born in Fort Worth, \nloved Fort Worth, and never wanted to leave Fort Worth.\n  I think it is interesting that he was the son of a professional boxer \nwho turned tailor. After the attack in Pearl Harbor in December 1941, \nhe left college to enlist in the United States Army and flew combat \nmissions in the South Pacific, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross \nand Legion of Merit. He was of the Greatest Generation.\n  He served in the Texas House. From his hometown of Weatherford, he \nbecame the mayor for his boyhood home. He served in that post for 4 \nyears, from 1950 to 1954, before his first congressional victory.\n  Speaker Wright had a way with words. He was an eloquent speaker. He \nwas a disciple of House Speaker Sam Rayburn, a fellow Texan. He was \nalso a disciple of another Texan, Lyndon B. Johnson, who served in the \nSenate during Wright's initial years in Congress before becoming Vice \nPresident in 1961.\n  He was in the Presidential motorcade on November 22, 1963, when \nPresident John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. To describe the \ndepth of sadness that engulfed us that day defies vocabulary, he once \nsaid, recalling how the friendly mood of the Dallas crowds turned to \nsheer terror and horror. It was that day that his friend, Lyndon B. \nJohnson, became the President of the United States.\n  He worked hard for the people of Fort Worth. He was a person of deep \ncourage, brilliance, eloquence, and complete mastery of the legislative \nprocess. He was decisive and strong, and he handled his Texas Members.\n  He championed the causes of Texas. He believed in the goodness of \nAmerica, and he was a great achiever. He loved the Boy Scouts. As I \nindicated, his father was a boxer, and he started out doing that as \nwell.\n  I come today to honor him as a great American and to add to this \ntribute that he served with President Lyndon Baines Johnson when the \nCivil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act were passed.\n  He was a friend of one of my predecessors, the Honorable Barbara \nJordan. They served together. They knew each other. They were strong \nTexans, but they loved America.\n  I know that, as we look to promoting his legacy, besides caring about \nthis institution and loving America and honoring our men and women in \nthe United States military, I know that it is also time, in his name, \nto bring forward the Voting Rights Act reauthorization that will, \nagain, restore and invest in the rights of people to vote and will \ncapture what he understood to be the right way to handle America's \nbusiness, and as well, it captures his friend's vision, the Honorable \nBarbara Jordan, who, in fact, wrote the language to add Texas to the \nVoting Rights Act.\n  I thank you, Congressman, for having this very special Special Order \nfor us to thank a dear friend who, again, I salute tonight as a great \nAmerican.\n  To his family, thank you so very much for sharing Jim Wright--Speaker\n\n[[Page H5385]]\n\nWright--a great Texan and a great American, with all of us.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, we mourn the loss of one of America's most \ndistinguished and dedicated public servants: Speaker Jim Wright.\n  From the service that earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross in \nWorld War II to the leadership that defined his 34 years in the House, \nJim Wright exemplified commitment to the future of America's families.\n  Jim Wright represented Fort Worth in Congress for 34 years. Jim \nWright was a peacemaker, local politician and international leader and \na consummate Democrat who offered his hand for bipartisanship.\n  Jim Wright worked for the people of Fort Worth, whether it was \nwinning a bomber contract for a Fort Worth defense contractor or \nhelping an individual with their Social Security.\n  Speaker Wright was a person of deep courage, brilliant eloquence, and \ncomplete mastery of the legislative process.\n  Speaker Wright's strong, decisive leadership built an indelible \nlegacy of progress, not only in his beloved state of Texas, but around \nthe world.\n  Speaker Wright championed prosperity for every working family, and \nhelped lead the way to peace to Central America.\n  After he left the House, Wright continued to share his wisdom with \nnew generations of leaders as a professor at Texas Christian \nUniversity.\n  Jim Wright was an achiever. When he was 10 years old, he tried to \njoin the Boy Scouts, two years ahead of the minimum age.\n  As a 13-year-old boxer, he told officials he was 16 in order to enter \nan AAU tournament, where he won two bouts and lost the third in a close \ndecision.\n  Jim Wright became hooked on history and decided to become a \ncongressman while he was sidelined from high school football by a knee \ninjury.\n  Jim Wright was 23 when he started his political career when he was \nelected to the Texas Legislature.\n  He never stopped serving our country, and his achievements will stand \nforever as a living monument to his determined vision and legendary \nability.\n  We hope it is a comfort to Speaker Wright's family, friends, students \nand colleagues that so many join them in grieving and honoring such a \nwonderful man. Today we bury a favorite son of Texas.\n  Speaker Wright was a man who loved his country and today we mourn his \nloss. He was the Speaker of the House in Congress and a humble man.\n  During the funeral many spoke to his ability to forgive and the words \nof his great-granddaughter will always stay with me which was that when \nwe leave the funeral today she wanted us to think of hope over despair \nand prosperity over scarcity.\n  If the Congress can begin to turn its attention to these philosophies \nAmerica will be a better nation.\n  We should always pay tribute to those who helped make Texas great. \nSpeaker Wright has left us with a remarkable story.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from \nHouston, Sheila Jackson Lee, for sharing so many great stories and fond \nmemories of Speaker Jim Wright.\n  I would like to add a few words of my own. Jim Wright was very \ninfluential to me. When I was elected into the State legislature in \n2004 was when I really started to get to know him well. I had known him \nprevious to that when I was an aide for United States Congressman \nMartin Frost, who was also from Fort Worth.\n  Once I got into the State legislature, I got to know him even more, \nand I realized very quickly what a great storyteller he was. Speaker \nWright had some amazing stories from people that he had met over the \nyears, people that influenced him in his life.\n  So many people always wonder how he became the great orator that he \nwas. There were so many stories that I heard early on about before the \nHouse had C-SPAN--now, we can watch coverage of the House of \nRepresentatives 24 hours a day, thanks to technology--but Speaker \nWright was such a great orator that, before C-SPAN came into effect, \nyou heard stories about staffers coming to fill the galleries so they \ncould come and hear this man from Fort Worth, Texas, come in and give \nspeeches because they were so amazing.\n  I asked him: How did you become the great orator that you were when \nyou were in the U.S. House of Representatives and that you still are \ntoday? Even, unfortunately, with the oral cancer that he had--his \nspeech had been hampered, but it was still amazing, the wisdom and the \nknowledge that he shared.\n  As you have heard from so many speakers tonight, boxing was a very \nimportant part of life. He loved boxing. It was something that he \nwatched over the years. When he was growing up in Weatherford, Texas, \nthat was one of the ways how young boys and men distinguished \nthemselves, was their boxing skills on the street.\n  He told me that, one day, his dad told him that while it was great \nthat he was able to distinguish himself with his fists through boxing, \nthat if he really wanted to improve himself and improve his lot in \nlife, that he would learn how to be a great orator, that he would learn \nwhat the anatomy of a great speech was all about; so Jim Wright, at a \nvery early age, decided that he was going to learn how he could become \na better speaker, and there are so many stories like that.\n  I went to his office right before I was sworn in, in 2012, and I \nasked him to just share some of that wisdom with me as an incoming new \nMember of Congress. He told me so many stories that day. One of them \nrelated to boxing.\n  Many of you know Larry Hagman from ``I Dream of Jeannie'' and from \nthe TV series ``Dallas.'' Some of you may know that Larry Hagman's \nmother is Mary Martin of Peter Pan fame. Mary Martin was actually from \nWeatherford, Texas, and she knew Jim Wright and knew Speaker Wright's \nfamily.\n  I said: Larry Hagman told a friend of mine that he ran into that you \ntaught him how to box; is that true?\n  Speaker Wright began to tell me the story about his mother thought \nthat maybe he needed to get back to his Texas roots and have a little \nbit more Texas upbringing in him, and so she sent him back to \nWeatherford, Texas, with his dad; and Speaker Wright taught him how to \nbox. That was how Larry Hagman learned how to become a boxer.\n  One of the areas that Speaker Wright--and Nancy Pelosi talked about \nit a lot--how he was a big influence in my life and so many others' \nlives--and I would be remiss if I did not mention some of the former \nMembers that also he was very influential in their lives.\n  Congressman Martin Frost, who was the ranking member of the Rules \nCommittee, Speaker Wright was very, very influential in getting him on \nthe Rules Committee his freshman year in office.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Also Secretary Pete Geren, a former Member of Congress and Secretary \nof the Army and Air Force, again, Speaker Wright was very influential \nearly on in his career. Pete Geren was actually Speaker Wright's \nsuccessor in Congress, and that was also very important to him.\n  Many people know that Speaker Wright was known as a very strong \nDemocrat. He was someone that loved the Democratic Party, that was very \nproud of his Democratic roots and had a very strong relationship with \norganized labor in Tarrant County. When you talk to people that are \nlongtime employees at Lockheed Martin, at General Motors, at American \nAirlines, the things that he did with transportation, all of those \nthings were very, very important for who he became.\n  In addition to that, he also learned a lot from some of the failures \nand mistakes that he made. He told me that his first term in the State \nlegislature, that it was not easy, that he didn't get along with the \nspeaker of the house in the State legislature.\n  When he was elected here, he wanted to make sure that he got along \nwith Sam Rayburn when he was elected to Congress. He told me: Marc, I \nhave learned my lesson from when I was in the State legislature, and I \nreally wanted to be on the Foreign Affairs Committee because that was \nwhat was really happening back in the 1950s when I first got elected. \nWith the cold war going on, I wanted to be on that committee. It was \nsomething very important to me. Speaker Rayburn put me on the Public \nWorks Committee--which is now the Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee.\n  He said, That ended up that was a mistake that I made because that \ncommittee ended up really making my career. It is hard to think that I \nwould have become majority leader and Speaker of the House had I not \nbeen on the Public Works Committee--which is where Speaker Rayburn put \nhim.\n  Again, in addition to being that strong, strong Democrat that he was, \nI can tell you that bipartisanship was\n\n[[Page H5386]]\n\nsomething that he was very fond of because he talked a lot after his \ncareer in Congress about how bipartisanship helped make this country \nstrong and about how it helped make him a better Member of Congress.\n  If you go and look in the archives of the Star-Telegram from just a \ncouple of months ago after he passed, you will notice the remarks that \nwere given from a very bipartisan group of people in the Dallas/Fort \nWorth area. Roger Williams, also from Fort Worth, he was quoted in the \nStar-Telegram; Kay Granger, former mayor of Fort Worth, was also quoted \nin the Star-Telegram--about how Speaker Wright did so many great things \nfor Fort Worth.\n  One of the areas that he liked to talk about was the Voting Rights \nAct and how important voting rights were to him and also Eisenhower and \nthe freeways. He told us a great story about how he and a few other \nCongressmen went to Eisenhower about getting the interstate highway \nbill passed and how President Eisenhower said, Let's get the votes; \nlet's get it done--and how they came together in a bipartisan way in \norder to get that legislation done.\n  My favorite story that he told me about is the importance of \nbipartisanship. I asked him: Mr. Speaker, I am going to be a new Member \nof Congress, and so many people talk about how Congress is broken and \nthey don't work together.\n  I said: Do you have any theories on why that is?\n  He said: That is a very good question. When I was in Congress, we \nspent a lot of time getting to know one another. We spent a lot more \ntime in Congress than we do today.\n  He said: I want to tell you a story. One time, I told my daughter, I \nwant you to go get a job--and this was before he was majority leader--I \nwant you to go and get a job, and I do not want you to use my name. \nWhatever you do, do not use my name. She came home that evening and she \nsaid, Daddy, I found a job. He was like, Oh, great, where did you find \na job? She said, I got a job in the minority leader's office.\n  Speaker Wright, a great storyteller that he was, he said: I just \nexploded, and I said, What, you got a job at the minority leader's \noffice? Did you tell them who I was? She said, Dad, you told me not to \nuse your name.\n  He said that he immediately picked up the phone; he called Gerald \nFord up, and he said, Gerald, I need to apologize to you. I want you to \nknow that my daughter has accepted a job in your office, and she is to \nreport to your office first thing in the morning and apologize and say \nthat she cannot accept the job.\n  He said that Gerald Ford said to him: Jim, if your daughter wants to \nwork here, it won't be any problem at all.\n  He said: Marc, can you imagine that happening today?\n  It really stopped and gave me pause just about how much things have \nreally, really changed.\n  Speaker Wright was an amazing person, a person of great wisdom, \nintelligence, humility. He would talk about how he lost the Senate race \nand it was fine for him to lose that special election for the U.S. \nSenate because things ended up working out for him in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. He could actually find humor even in something that \nwas a big defeat for him.\n  I just wanted to thank him, and I am so thankful that our paths \ncrossed and that he was such an influence to me and so many others. I \ncan tell you that the city that I am from, Fort Worth, Texas, that the \ncity is the great city that it is today because of the work and the \nstatesmanship of Jim Wright.\n  His legacy continues to live on through so many others that continue \nto serve in Congress today that are in other positions in office and in \nbusiness.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am just very, very grateful and very blessed that I \nknew Speaker James Claude ``Jim'' Wright.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life \nand legacy of a great American and a great Texan, former Speaker of the \nHouse Jim Wright.\n  Speaker Wright served our nation over five decades, first as a B-24 \nbombardier in the Pacific during World War II, where he earned the \nDistinguished Flying Cross. Returning home to Texas, Speaker Wright was \nelected to the Texas State Legislature and then as Mayor of \nWeatherford.\n  In 1954, Jim Wright would be elected to Congress, where he would \nserve for the next 34 years, 10 years as Majority Leader, and Speaker \nof the House from 1987 to 1989.\n  In Congress, Jim Wright was known for his hard work on behalf of the \n12th District, centered in Fort Worth, Texas. Through his work on the \nHouse Public Works Committee, then-Rep. Wright secured important \nimprovements to the Trinity River flood control and the revival of the \nFort Worth stockyards area and become an important advocate for the \nlocal defense industry.\n  As Speaker, Jim Wright guided the passage of significant legislation, \nincluding amendments to the Clean Water Act, the 1987 highway bill and \nexpanded education benefits for military personnel.\n  After leaving Congress, Speaker Wright said that his biggest \nachievement was sponsoring the bipartisan peace accord between the \nSandinista government and the contras in Nicaragua, which had been \nfighting for a decade.\n  Speaker Wright passed away on May 6, 2015, in his hometown of Fort \nWorth, at the age of 92. The passing of Speaker Wright is the end of an \nera in Texas politics. He was among the last of our great state's \nlegislative giants, who learned his trade from fellow Texans, Lyndon \nJohnson and Sam Rayburn.\n  Speaker Wright was a leader dedicated to bettering our country, and \nhe will be sorely and dearly missed by his family, friends, and this \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5386-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5386-H5393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF DODD-FRANK ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, there are a number of us who are \ngathered for a very important discussion tonight regarding the fifth \nanniversary of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n  Before we do, there is another important anniversary that needs to be \nrecognized in America today. For that, Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield \nto the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).\n\n\n           65th Wedding Anniversary of Gene and Kathy Shimkus\n\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give thanks to God and \npublicly celebrate the 65th wedding anniversary of my mom and dad, Gene \nand Kathy Shimkus.\n  Dad was raised by his grandparents, Charles Frederick and Dorothea \nHeinicke. He has been a lifetime member at Holy Cross Lutheran Church \nand School. Mom was raised in State Park, just down the road from \nCollinsville, by Harvey and Myrtle Mondy.\n  They are both graduates of Collinsville High School, dad in 1946 and \nmom in 1949. Dad started working for the telephone company in high \nschool, and mom worked as a telephone operator.\n  Mom and dad got married on July 22, 1950, 65 years ago today. Dad was \ndrafted during the Korean war and left for Korea. On August 3, 1951, \ntheir first child, Bill, was born. Dad returned from the war and \ncontinued to work for the telephone company and then various telephone \ncompanies as the industry changed. Using the GI Bill, he also received \nhis associate's degree from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.\n  Mom started her career and one that she has kept throughout known \ntime as mother and now matriarch of the family. From here, the family \ngrew as Dorothy, Joan, Helen, Jean, Jana, and I were born. The kids \ngrew up to become a pastor, teacher, healthcare worker, CPA, and even a \npolitician.\n  Bill now lives in the Northwest and is married to Bette. They have \nthree children, Matthew, Maria, and Emily. Dorothy has two boys, Terry \nand Dusty. Joan is married to Bernie and has two children, Niki and \nTim. Karen and I are married with sons David, Joshua, and Daniel. Helen \nis married to Pat and lives in Tennessee. They have two daughters, \nJennifer and Katelyn. Jean has two sons, Adam and Gene, as well as a \ndaughter, Elizabeth. Jana is married to Chris. There are nine great-\ngrandchildren.\n  In an era where everything seems to be disposable, it is helpful and \nuplifting to see something that has lasted. For things to last, you \nhave to work at it.\n  Thank you, Mom and Dad, for teaching us about life. We have survived \nthe good and the bad and, for the most part, have done it united as a \nfamily. The Shimkus clan will celebrate this accomplishment through \nthis weekend by just spending time together.\n\n[[Page H5387]]\n\n  Our gathering culminates with attending church together on Sunday. We \nhave much to be thankful for, but mostly for God's undeserved love in \nsending his son, Jesus, to die on the cross and rising again for our \nsalvation.\n  Congratulations, Mom and Dad, and thank you for being the parents \nthat you are.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on the subject of the Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, before we get started, I just want to \nthank the gentleman from Illinois to remind us of what is truly \nimportant in life having much to do with our faith and our family, and \nI thank him for allowing us to be a part of that very special moment \nfor him and his parents and his whole family tonight.\n  Now, to the topic of tonight, Mr. Speaker. This week marks the fifth \nanniversary of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed in \nthe wake of the great financial crisis of 2008.\n  We were told at the time, Mr. Speaker, that it would lift our \neconomy, end too big to fail, and promote financial stability. We now \nhave 5 years of data; we have 5 years of experience. The evidence is \noverwhelming, Mr. Speaker: 5 years after the passage of Dodd-Frank, the \nbig banks are bigger; the small banks are fewer; the taxpayer is \npoorer.\n  We will explore over the next hour, Mr. Speaker, all the different \nways that regrettably, regardless of what good intentions might have \nbeen behind this 2,300-page bill--the most massive rewrite of our \nfinancial laws in America since the New Deal, 400-plus new rules that \nhave been promulgated, only two-thirds of which--or not quite two-\nthirds have been finalized.\n  What this has done in many ways, Mr. Speaker, is to make the American \npeople and our economy less stable, to make us less prosperous and, \nmost importantly, Mr. Speaker--and most regrettably--how this law has \nmade us less free.\n  We need to work together. House Republicans are working to ensure \nthat every American has economic opportunity to climb the ladder of \nsuccess, to pursue happiness, to achieve financial security.\n  Today, 5 years after Dodd-Frank, we have way too many low- and \nmoderate-income Americans who lose sleep at night worrying about their \nmeager paychecks, worrying about their shrinking bank accounts, and \nworrying about their children's future because, again, Mr. Speaker, \nDodd-Frank has made us less stable, it has made us less prosperous, it \nhas made us less free.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am joined by many Members of the House Financial \nServices Committee that I have the honor and responsibility to chair. I \nam so proud to call them colleagues and for their great work, to try to \nextend, again, economic opportunity and financial security to all \nAmericans. They know firsthand how working men and women have suffered \nunder this Dodd-Frank Act lo these many years.\n  I want to start out yielding to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nGarrett), who happens to be the chairman of the Capital Markets and \nGovernment Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee.\n  He knows firsthand that in order to have the benefits of free \nenterprise, in order for small businesses to be capitalized, you have \nto have very vibrant and healthy capital markets.\n  Probably more so than anyone in Congress, he is most qualified to \ntalk to us about what Dodd-Frank has done to our capital markets and \nwhat it has done to stability, what it has done to prosperity, and what \nit has done to freedom.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Mr. GARRETT. I thank the gentleman from Texas for holding this \nSpecial Order tonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, birthdays are usually a cause of celebration, but, this \nweek we mark 5 years--the 5th birthday--of one of the most overreaching \nand damaging laws in recent memory that was heaved on our economy.\n  Now, when the Democratic majority passed Dodd-Frank, there were three \nbig promises they made about this legislation, first, that the \nlegislation would end too big to fail; second, that the legislation \nwould protect consumers; and, third, that Dodd-Frank would make our \neconomy more competitive.\n  Why don't we take a look at each one of those one by one and see how \nthey have worked out so far.\n  Promise number one, Dodd-Frank will end too big to fail.\n  First, did Dodd-Frank really end too big to fail?\n  For starters, by just about every measure, the biggest banks today \nare even bigger than they were before the financial crisis while \ncommunity banks and other small lenders continue to be shut out and \nshut down around the country.\n  In fact, according to recent statistics, the five largest banks in \nthe Nation now control roughly half of all of the assets in our banking \nsystem. To put that in another perspective, that means that outside of \nthese institutions it takes the collective assets of over 6,000 banks \nin order to equal the number of assets held by the five largest banks.\n  Moreover, the so-called resolution authority included in title II of \nDodd-Frank is not, as our former colleague Barney Frank put it, a death \npanel for banks. It is, in fact, instead, a mechanism for future \nbailouts enshrined now into the law.\n  This is not just a case of baseless accusations. One need only look \nat the actual text of Dodd-Frank to understand how it allows for big \nbanks to be bailed out--by whom?--by you, the American taxpayer.\n  For example, Dodd-Frank gives the FDIC, the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, the authority to do two things, first, purchase the debt \nfrom the creditors of a failing institution at par or even above par \nand, two, pay any obligations of an institution that it believes are \nnecessary and appropriate during that time of crisis.\n  Dodd-Frank, of course, also created the so-called FSOC. What is that? \nThat is the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which during its \ncurrent existence has done virtually nothing to enhance the stability \nof the financial market.\n  In fact, if you look at it through its systemically important \ndesignations of institutions, FSOC has gone in the other direction in \nthat it has now put taxpayers on the hook not just for banks and bank \nbailouts, but for the potential bailout of nonbank institutions as \nwell.\n  So a law that has made the big banks bigger, that has given \nregulators such a vast expansion of authority, and that has put \ntaxpayers now at so much risk cannot conceivably be described as having \nended too big to fail.\n  It is not just those on our side of the aisle who are skeptical of \nDodd-Frank's claims. Here are two examples.\n  The GAO, in a January 2013 report, concluded that there ``is no clear \nconsensus on the extent to which, if at all, the Dodd-Frank Act will \nhelp reduce the probability or severity of a future crisis.''\n  Cornelius Hurley, a former senior official at the Federal Reserve, \nstated recently, ``If the whole purpose of Dodd-Frank was to eliminate \nthe concept of too-big-to-fail and you judge it by that standard, then \nit's a failure.''\n  So, by any objective measure, it is clear, I think, that they failed \nat promise number one.\n  Let's look now at promise number two, Dodd-Frank will protect \nconsumers.\n  How has it protected consumers?\n  On this matter, it depends, in large part, on what you mean by \nconsumer protection.\n  You see, the drafters of Dodd-Frank and many of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle believe that consumer protection involves \ncomplete bureaucratic control over the entire credit market, which \ngives a handful of individuals right here in Washington, D.C.--the \nbureaucrats--the ability to decide what kind of mortgage you want, what \nkind of credit card you are going to get, the kind of student loan \nAmericans should have access to, and so on.\n  Hence, the creation of the unaccountable CFPB and the incredible \namount\n\n[[Page H5388]]\n\nof authority now that they have been given is given to a single agency \nor, actually, to a single dictator there, if you will.\n  Real consumer protection doesn't involve unelected and unaccountable \nbureaucrats who make decisions on behalf of you, the American citizen. \nNo.\n  Real consumer protection involves ensuring competitive credit markets \nand empowering the consumers to make their own choices based off of \nwell-disclosed information in the marketplace. By this measure, Dodd-\nFrank and the CFPB have again failed miserably.\n  Take, for example, the CFPB's qualified mortgage rule, which became \neffective just last year. According to a study from the Federal Reserve \nBoard, roughly one-quarter of Americans right now who obtained \nmortgages in 2010 would not have qualified for those mortgages that \nthey did get under the QM rule, increasing the likelihood then that \nmillions of Americans will find it harder in the future to actually \nqualify for a mortgage.\n  Moreover, the effect of QM is even more pronounced on certain \nsegments of the economy, such as minority borrowers. The same Federal \nReserve study noted that about one-third of both African Americans and \nHispanic borrowers would have been ineligible to have gotten a mortgage \nunder the QM loan.\n  Many of the Bureau's initiatives regarding credit cards and other \nloans will ultimately have the same effect, making it either impossible \nor too expensive for individuals who are starting businesses to draw on \na line of credit.\n  So it is clear that, on promise number two, Dodd-Frank is not \nprotecting consumers and that it is, in fact, harming consumers and \nmaking it harder for them with all of this red tape.\n  The next and final promise, number three, is that Dodd-Frank will \nmake our economy more competitive:\n  The third promise, that it will make our economy more competitive, \nclearly has not come true. In fact, Dodd-Frank is a direct cause of the \neconomic struggle that millions of Americans continue to face today.\n  For a minute, just take a look at the sheer breadth of regulation \nthat has come out of Dodd-Frank. The law provides so much regulation \nthat it is a burden on the economy.\n  The Davis Polk law firm performed a public service back in 2013 when \nit estimated at the time that, for every one word of text in Dodd-\nFrank, 42 words of regulations have been produced. Since that time, the \nnumber has even grown.\n  How can our economy possibly be more competitive today when such a \nhuge number of complex and burdensome regulations have been implemented \nover the last 5 years?\n  We need to look no further than the growth of our economy to figure \nthis out, which actually shrank during the first quarter of this year, \nanother reminder that we remain mired in the weakest economic recovery \nsince World War II.\n  So Dodd-Frank has actually served to weaken our economy, not to have \nstrengthened it, and the millions of Americans who have experienced a \nweak job market and decreased opportunity are the ones that are feeling \nthe pain of Dodd-Frank.\n  Since 2011, the Financial Services Committee, under the chairmanship \nof Jeb Hensarling from Texas, has led the charge to roll back some of \nthe most damaging provisions of Dodd-Frank, and I commend the chairman \nand all of my colleagues on the committee for their continued efforts \nin this regard.\n  Unfortunately, it now appears that many of these efforts, which used \nto be bipartisan in nature, are running up against the rigid ideology \nwhich believes that Dodd-Frank was chiseled into stone and should never \nbe changed.\n  I believe that their view is unsustainable as we continue to see \nevidence of the harm that Dodd-Frank is inflicting upon Americans, and \nhard-working Americans at that.\n  Our committee and this Congress must continue to do the important \nwork that will make it easier for our fellow citizens to get a job, to \nobtain a credit card, to obtain a mortgage, and to create opportunities \nfor themselves and their families.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for his comments tonight, and I \nthank him for his leadership on our committee.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, it is the unhappy occasion of the fifth \nanniversary of the signing of the Dodd-Frank Act, again, weighing in at \n2,300 pages.\n  It is so sad to realize, as the gentleman from New Jersey pointed \nout, that so many of the promises that were made have not been kept and \nthey have not been realized.\n  Again, the big banks are bigger, the small banks are fewer, and our \nhard-working constituents--many of them--are worse off. Many of them \nhave stagnant paychecks. And so many of them have smaller bank \naccounts. What they have seen is free checking cut in half in America, \nand bank fees have gone up.\n  This is all because of the Dodd-Frank law putting an incredible mass \nof regulations upon our community banks and on our credit unions, those \nwho serve our hard-working families and our small businesses. \nRegrettably, in so many different ways, we are less prosperous, we are \nless stable, and we are less free.\n  I was there 5 years ago, Mr. Speaker, at the conference committee. \nRepublicans had an alternative. We had a bill that, frankly, was \nwritten and filed before the Democrat bill was, but there was no \nwillingness to negotiate, no willingness to discuss, no willingness to \ncompromise. So we ended up with Dodd-Frank, and the American people are \npoorer because of it.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to yield to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Hultgren), a very hard-working member of our committee, a \ngentleman who brings a lot of expertise to this committee on a number \nof matters, especially insurance, which is near and dear to the \nfinancial security of so many of our constituents, and I am happy to \nget his views on this anniversary of Dodd-Frank.\n  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark 5 years of overly \nburdensome and costly banking regulations and a failed opportunity to \naddress fundamental problems in our economy.\n  Leading up to 2008, a perfect storm of easy lending, pushed by \nWashington bureaucrats, coupled with a spider web of duplicative, \nconflicting, and nonsensical regulations, led to a complete breakdown \nof the housing market.\n  A lack of regulation was not the problem. In fact, regulation \nincreased in the 10 years leading up to the crisis. Community banks \nwere faced with determining which of several regulators to answer to \nfirst.\n  Small businesses faced ever-expanding compliance mandates, raising \nthe cost of doing business. Yet, at the time, those in power seized on \nthe opportunity to never let a serious crisis go to waste in order to \nreward regulators with much more authority.\n  The fundamental issues of the housing crisis were never addressed. \nThose who put in place the policies that encouraged risky borrowing and \nlending were never held accountable.\n  Instead, the Dodd-Frank Act doubled down on the misguided government \npolicies that caused the crisis, doing nothing to stop another from \nhappening in the future.\n  Dodd-Frank's vast expansion of regulatory authority has not helped \nlift the economy or helped Americans looking to pursue opportunities \nfor themselves and their families.\n  It failed to end too big to fail. It failed to protect consumers who \nrely on the community banks in their local towns. It failed to help \nsmall businesses in search of funds to restart and rebuild. It failed \nto tackle much-needed housing reform. And it failed to protect \nAmericans from a power-hungry, regulation-happy Federal Government that \nwas bent on expanding its power.\n  Five years later, struggling families, struggling small businesses, \nand struggling community banks are the collateral damage of Dodd-Frank \nand its thriving Washington regulators.\n  The largest institutions have gotten larger. More than 500 community \nbanks have failed. And the number of bank options available to \nconsumers continues to decline due to crushing regulatory burdens. This \ndisturbing trend must be reversed.\n  Regulation must not be one size fits all. Banking regulators should \ntailor regulations for community banks, those local financial \ninstitutions that partner with families and small businesses to help \nstrengthen our communities.\n\n[[Page H5389]]\n\n  Decreasing the regulatory burden will allow our Nation's financial \ninstitutions to devote more time to the needs of consumers instead of \ndevoting more time to the whims of regulators like the CFPB. Decreasing \nthe regulatory burden will allow local banks to create innovative \nfinancial products and services for the benefits of their customers.\n  Even as Dodd-Frank remains in effect, I and the Financial Services \nCommittee will continue to stand up for Americans and stand against an \noverreaching Federal Government.\n  On this anniversary of the law, now is the time to recognize and to \nrespond to Dodd-Frank's vast imperfections and to also pursue true \nhousing reform that promotes responsible lending and borrowing.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Hensarling for his great work, and I thank my \ncolleagues on the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Once again, I thank the gentleman for his comments \nand for reminding us, yet again, that the narrative that the left has \nfostered is a false narrative.\n  Mr. Speaker, we were told that there was this massive deregulation \nthat somehow led to all of these bad mortgages and that the world was \nblowing up. Yet, as the gentleman from Illinois pointed out, for 10 \nyears, we have had increased regulation.\n  It has increased, I believe, by almost 20 percent more in \nregulations. You had Sarbanes-Oxley. You had FIRREA. You had FDICIA. We \nare very good at acronyms in Congress, but we had more and more \nregulation.\n  It wasn't deregulation that caused the crisis. It was dumb \nregulation. It was dumb regulation by the government that was \nincentivizing and cajoling and mandating financial institutions to loan \nmoney to people to buy homes that they couldn't afford to keep.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  What a tragedy. What a tragedy to put somebody in a home they can't \nafford to keep. That is the cause. Fannie and Freddie at the epicenter, \nand the Dodd-Frank bill was totally silent on the issue--totally silent \non the issue--and people suffered. People suffered.\n  I still remember my friends on the other side of the aisle said let's \nroll the dice a little on this affordable housing goal of Fannie and \nFreddie. Well, the dice got rolled, and the American people lost, and \nwe had the great American financial crisis. Now they are doubling down. \nEven more regulatory burden dragging down our financial institutions, \nmaking us less stable, taking away our freedom and prosperity. That is \njust wrong. That is why we have to commit ourselves: No more. It is \ntime that we have to replace this law. Five years later, it is obvious.\n  I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger) to hear \nhis views on Dodd-Frank as well.\n  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your leadership on behalf \nof the American people to bring opportunity to them.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the fifth anniversary of the burdensome \nand overreaching Dodd-Frank Act. As I have built two businesses from \nscratch, I understand the risks and sacrifice and the hard work \nnecessary to grow a business and create jobs.\n  Unfortunately, Dodd-Frank has made it incredibly difficult for \nAmerican small businesses to raise capital, and for the first time in \n35 years, small business deaths have outnumbered small business births. \nDodd-Frank was supposed to protect the American people. Instead, it is \nhurting the economy and it is costing jobs, particularly low- and \nmoderate-income families. Dodd-Frank is strangling the economy and job \ngrowth by creating a compliance nightmare of over 400 new rules and \nregulations.\n  I am not antiregulation, but the pendulum has swung too far. \nUnfortunately, Dodd-Frank goes overboard, fixing problems that don't \nexist and ignoring the root cause of the financial crisis, which was \nthe government requirement for easy credit for those who were a credit \nrisk.\n  We have all been told that Dodd-Frank ends too big to fail. This act \ndid not end too big to fail. It glorified it into law and made middle-\nincome paychecks almost $12,000 less compared to the average postwar \neconomic recovery. Five years later, our economy continues to sputter \nat a 2 percent growth rate while Washington bureaucrats continue to \nburden American businesses, those small enterprises, with never-ending \nregulations.\n  Dodd-Frank is deterring the entrepreneurship that has made this \ncountry great. Dodd-Frank is too big, and it has failed the American \npeople.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for his \ncomments tonight. I thank him for his leadership on our committee, not \nonly on dealing with Dodd-Frank, but dealing with the very serious \nissue of terrorist financing, where he serves as the vice chair of our \ntask force on that subject.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), the \nnewest member of the House Committee on Financial Services. Although he \nis new to the committee, it didn't take him too long to figure out, by \nspeaking to his constituents and speaking to his credit unions and \ncommunity banks, that Dodd-Frank is not working, that Dodd-Frank is \nhelping make this economy less stable and making the American people \nless prosperous and less free.\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago the President signed \nthe Dodd-Frank legislation into law. The American people were told that \nDodd-Frank would end Washington bailouts, protect consumers, and in the \nevent of another perilous economic situation, it would mitigate the \nimpact and stabilize the financial industry and our economy.\n  As American families and businesses have now learned, Dodd-Frank does \njust the opposite. Dodd-Frank has actually codified the too big to fail \nmentality in Washington, harmed consumers, and will fail to sound the \nalarm before the next economic crisis.\n  I have talked with many people in the financial services industry \nabout Dodd-Frank, and the theme I hear over and over again is that the \nregulatory burdens created by this law are harming their ability to \noffer affordable services to their clients, my constituents.\n  Since Dodd-Frank, approximately 1,500 community banks across the \ncountry have closed, and a recent study shows that Dodd-Frank has added \n61 million hours of paperwork and more than $24 billion in final rule \ncosts to the financial industry. These costs are not borne by Wall \nStreet executives but, rather, by working mothers, small-business \nowners, and retirees.\n  This body is not powerless. In fact, I am here with many of my \ncolleagues tonight standing up for working families impacted by this \nflawed law. We should subject this Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nand Financial Stability Oversight Council to congressional \nappropriations. We should establish a bipartisan commission to lead the \nCFPB and reduce regulation that is crippling our community banks and \ncredit unions. By enacting commonsense reforms, businesses can grow, \njobs will be created, and American workers can better provide for their \nfamilies.\n  I also want to thank the 146 banks, 8 credit unions, and nearly \n60,000 constituents in my district who provide vital financial services \nto Minnesotans despite the ever-growing regulatory burden from \nWashington.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. The gentleman is obviously a quick study, but it \ndoesn't take long when you speak to your constituents to realize, \nagain, they are still hurting in this limping economy.\n  When one looks at the President's economic program, it is really \nbased on a couple major pillars. It is based on his healthcare program, \nObamaCare, but it is also based on Dodd-Frank; and in many ways Dodd-\nFrank is to household finances what ObamaCare is to household health \ncare, and it is harming low-income and working American families. It is \nhurting their ability to achieve greater levels of economic \nopportunity, greater levels of financial independence.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have an economy that is limping along at about 2 \npercent economic growth, when historically we know it has been at 3\\1/\n2\\ percent. The economy is underperforming by 40 percent, and one of \nthe reasons is because of Dodd-Frank. You can ask any person who is out \nthere--an entrepreneur, small-business person who is\n\n[[Page H5390]]\n\nhelping create jobs--and they will tell you about this drag that the \nsheer weight, volume, complexity, and uncertainty of this tsunami of \nregulation is causing.\n  I am very happy, Mr. Speaker, that someone that we have on our \ncommittee is a businessperson who has a history of creating jobs in my \nnative State of Texas. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nWilliams) to give us his thoughts on Dodd-Frank as well.\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for your leadership.\n  Before I begin, I would just like to say, I am a small-business \nowner. I have owned my own business for 44 years. I have been through a \nlot. I have been through dollar gasoline; I have been through 20 \npercent interest, where I borrowed money; I have been through the \nslowdown in 1988; I have been through 9/11; and I must tell you, the \neconomy that we are in now, Main Street America is hurting like I have \nnever seen it hurt before. That is why I am up here to talk about this \nsituation that we seem to honor tonight, Dodd-Frank.\n\n  I join the chairman and my other colleagues here tonight to speak on \nwhat I believe is one of the most impulsive, deceiving, and un-American \npieces of legislation that has ever been passed through this body. What \nI am talking about is a 2,300-page law that has unfairly blanketed our \nentire financial system with more than 400 costly rules and \nregulations. Just as we have found out that the Affordable Care Act is \nnot affordable, we are learning that Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act doesn't do what its name suggests. I believe we \nprobably need a government protection act.\n  Now, Dodd-Frank is hammering small town America as we have talked \nabout, and I mean like I have never seen before in 44 years. Small town \nAmerica, Main Street America is hurting. They are hurting with \nunnecessary but very expensive compliance measures that are hard to \nmeet.\n  As a small-business owner, as I have said, of over 40 years, I can \nsay firsthand that Dodd-Frank is driving Main Street job creators and \ncommunity banks and credit unions out of business. Yesterday in our op-\ned, Congressman Randy Neugebauer and I wrote that the American people \nwere fooled into believing Dodd-Frank was necessary to ensure financial \nstability and prevent future market meltdowns. But instead of \nresponsibly studying the root causes of the financial crisis, Democrats \nin Washington rushed to regulate.\n  In my home State of Texas, one of the healthiest economies in the \nNation, 115 banks have closed their doors. These banks are far from the \nmajor financial institutions in New York. They are small town community \nlenders that cannot pull together resources to comply with Dodd-Frank. \nThey are community banks and credit unions that issue 51 percent of all \nbusiness loans under $1 million.\n  The crippling effects of Dodd-Frank have trickled down from the \nPresident's pen to local job creators who had nothing to do with the \nfinancial crisis. The costs have been passed along to them. It isn't \nright, and it is not fair. Dodd-Frank is another example of how this \nadministration discourages growth. Under President Obama and his \nadministration, the risk of running a business is no longer worth the \npossible reward, and that is a big problem.\n  This is America. Bad policies like Dodd-Frank are the product of \nlawmakers who have little to no business experience. They haven't \nworked on payrolls; they haven't met a payroll; they haven't counted \ninventory; they haven't met with employees that need personal help; \nthey haven't put people to work; but they have done something: issue \n153 new regulations, 87 compliance changes, and 59 annual adjustments \nto thresholds.\n  At what price, we ask. The Congressional Budget Office and the \nGovernment Accountability Office have both estimated that Dodd-Frank \ncosts $3 billion to implement and will result in nearly $27 billion in \nprivate sector fees, assessments, and premiums. We simply can't afford \nthis.\n  For this reason, I have introduced legislation that will loosen Dodd-\nFrank's choke hold on small businesses and Main Street America. The \nCommunity Financial Institution Exemption Act will require the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau to explain to Main Street lenders why they \nare not exempted from certain CFPB rules and regulations, as permitted.\n  My bill has the support of the Independent Bankers Association of \nTexas, the Texas Credit Union Association, the National Association of \nFederal Credit Unions, and the Credit Union National Association.\n  I ask all my colleagues to support my efforts. It is time we stopped \npunishing those who put their livelihoods on the line to realize the \nAmerican Dream and not the American scheme.\n  In God we trust.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I thank my friend and my fellow Texan for his \ncomments and the perspective that he brings as somebody who has \nactually successfully created jobs in the Lone Star State. He can look \naround at the customers of his business and to his employees and see \nhow they have lost their prosperity.\n  Mr. Speaker, we were told that when Dodd-Frank was passed that it \nwould lift the economy. They had a great celebration and signing \nceremony at the White House. It would lift the economy.\n  Well, so what do we discover 5 years later? What we discover is an \neconomy that is limping along at 2 percent. And that is not just some \nvague statistic. That translates into millions of Americans who remain \nunderemployed and unemployed in America.\n  If you ask the people who create the jobs what is the great \nchallenge, one of the great challenges is this regulatory burden. The \nquestion is not so much regulation or deregulation; the question is \nwhether we are going to have smart regulation or dumb regulation. Dumb \nregulation hurts low- and moderate-income Americans who are just trying \nto climb the ladder of success, who are seeking economic opportunity.\n  Had we just had the average recovery--the average recovery, Mr. \nSpeaker--we would have 12.1 million more jobs in America today. The \naverage working family would have an extra $12,000 of income to take \nhome in their pocket. That is just if we had the average recovery as \nopposed to this Obama recovery based upon Dodd-Frank as one of its \npillars. We would have had 1.6 million more who could escape poverty. \nBut, no, not the Obama economy. Dodd-Frank and the regulatory tsunami \nare keeping people down.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  We all hear about this. Regrettably, every Member of Congress still \ngets these letters. I had a letter from one of my constituents that \nsaid:\n\n       There are part-time jobs around my area, but always jobs \n     with no benefits and less than 40 hours. My son is a disabled \n     Iraqi Freedom combat veteran who has lost hope of a decent \n     full-time job.\n\n  That is the kind of angst we hear, but House Republicans are \ncommitted to helping these people. One of the ways we have to do it is \ndo something about Dodd-Frank.\n  I am very happy that I am joined by two other of my colleagues \ntonight, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), who chairs our \nMonetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee, and the gentleman from Arizona \n(Mr. Schweikert), who has a lot of experience with municipal finance in \nArizona.\n  I am happy first to yield to the gentleman from Michigan to get some \nof his perspectives on Dodd-Frank and how we are less stable, less \nprosperous, and less free.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your leadership \non this and so many other issues. I am going to have a couple of \nquestions for you in a minute because I, like my colleague and friend \nfrom Arizona, wasn't here when Dodd-Frank was created. I like to say I \nwasn't here for the creation; I just have to live with the echo effects \nof it. I have to figure out what it means in this post Dodd-Frank \nworld.\n  By the way, it has been mentioned tonight it was 2,300 pages. It \nsounds a little reminiscent to another bill that maybe they had to pass \nto find out what was in it. I think if it wasn't for ObamaCare--the \nAffordable Care Act--and that famous statement that was uttered about \nhaving to pass it to find out what is in it, this would be the poster \nchild for that.\n  This would be the poster child for Federal Government overreach. It \nwas\n\n[[Page H5391]]\n\nan agenda waiting for a crisis to come along.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I was here 5 years ago, and it is funny and \nreminiscent that Senator Dodd, the coauthor of Dodd-Frank--the Dodd of \nDodd-Frank--said at the time: ``No one will know until this is actually \nin place how it works.''\n  He said this in 2012. Here we are, 5 years later, and we know how it \nworks. We know it is a drag on the economy. We know that free checking \nhas been cut in half. We know that bank fees have gone up. We know that \nwe are losing a community bank and a credit union a day, mostly because \nof Dodd-Frank.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I have to disagree a little \nbit with you. We know that there is a tremendous amount of Dodd-Frank \nthat we have seen play out, but this is something I am not sure \neverybody understands. They are still writing the rules; 5 years into \nit, we are still writing the rules. I don't think that was your intent \nat the time this was passed.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. It was never my intent to support the law in the \nfirst place. Under then-Ranking Member Spencer Bachus of Alabama, my \npredecessor, Republicans had put forward a different law, and it was \nabout bankruptcy, as opposed to of bailouts. Instead, what Dodd-Frank \ndid was codify bailouts into law.\n  It codified this whole concept of too-big-to-fail institutions. I \nbelieve there is not one financial institution in America that is too \nbig to fail. The American financial system is too big to fail, but not \none particular financial institution.\n  We offered a different law in the first place, which was totally \nignored by the Democrats. At the time, they enjoyed a super majority; \nso we were left with this particular monstrosity that, again, is making \nthe American people less prosperous.\n  I thank the gentleman, and maybe we can get a comment from the \ngentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. One of the most painful things, Mr. Chairman, when I \nfirst got elected, I was blessed to be on the Financial Services \nCommittee, and I spent that summer trying to read every word of the \nDodd-Frank legislation.\n  What you learn is, even reading the legislation, you don't understand \nall it is going to do because it refers to this agency will make this \nrule set, this regulator will create this rule set--you start to \nrealize that 2,300 pages is taller than I am--and it is still coming.\n  Mr. Chairman, what percentage of the rule set is finished so far?\n  Mr. HENSARLING. A little over 60 percent, 5 years later; but in some \nrespects, nothing is finalized because, when we think about being less \nfree, in many respects, Dodd-Frank isn't even a law. Dodd-Frank is a \nlicense to unelected, unaccountable Federal bureaucrats to create \ndiscretionary results that they can change at their discretion.\n  Even the rules that are ``finalized,'' which is kind of a Washington \nterm, you still don't have something that is predictable, that you can \ncount on, and so it has led to all of these abuses.\n  When you think about the people who have run our VA, the people who \ndid the rollout for ObamaCare--a healthcare system that people didn't \nwant, they couldn't afford, and on a Web site that didn't work--all of \na sudden, we are entrusting them to decide whether or not we can get a \ncredit card, whether or not we can get a mortgage.\n  In that respect, no rule is particularly finalized.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I know Chairman Huizenga has actually taken a look at \nsome of these things.\n  One of the other aspects that almost never gets discussed is that \ninnovation is almost gone, the opportunity for what the next world is \ngoing to look like.\n  Think of this, when Apple Pay comes from a technology company and not \none of our banking companies, you have got to understand what this law \nhas done. It has basically stifled economic growth, but it has also \nstifled the very innovation that made our financial markets one of our \nengines of growth.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. I want to relay a little experience I had \njust today. I was speaking in front of a group of European Parliament \nmembers, a few European business folks; and this question was brought \nup about trying to harmonize our financial services laws and trying to \nmake sure that we are all kind of on the same page.\n  One of the members from a very liberal leftwing party was asking \nabout Dodd-Frank and whether that is a path that they should pursue, \nand even she was dubious about that. Certainly, some of the other \nmembers from the European Parliament were seeing that this is a \ncautionary tale.\n  They know that they have been down a tough spot in Europe because \nthey have seen such a lack of growth and innovation, and they are \nseeing that same thing happen here in the United States.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield to the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Let's face it. There is a wonderful irony here. The \nsystem has great stress; horrible things happened. Let's turn to the \nvery regulators who were in charge at that time and say: Let's double \ndown with them.\n\n  Instead of taking a step backwards and understanding we live in the \ntime of information and technology, where we could have used that \nsunshine to see into our markets, instead, we basically created a \ncommand and control regulatory system and handed it back to the same \nfolks who screwed it up in the first place.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Certainly, the gentleman from Arizona is \nnot implying that they are not well intended.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield to the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Well, think about this: How much reform has truly \nhappened at Fannie and Freddie? Where are we at right now? I know the \napologists on the left go out of their way to say don't blame the GSEs \nand their concentration risk and the cascade and the markets they built \nin subprime paper and don't blame the regulators who are supposed to be \nwatching them.\n  Here we are, 5 years later, and in many ways, the folks who soaked \nthemselves in gasoline are still there.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. It seems to me that part of our problem \nhere is not intentions, but it is ability to execute. What we have done \nis we have replaced the private sector. We have replaced the \ninnovators, the people that are getting stuff done in our economy.\n  We have replaced them with unelected bureaucrats who don't often know \nwhat the real world is like and how it operates. I think that has \ncaused so many problems.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. It is a very important point because America has \nalways been the land of the risk taker, the hard worker, the big \ndreamer, the entrepreneur. Now, what we are seeing in America today, \nbecause of Dodd-Frank and the Obama regulatory tsunami, is that we are \nhaving new business startups at their lowest level in over a \ngeneration. That means, increasingly, our garages are full of old cars, \nas opposed to new startups.\n  Economic growth is something that compounds. If you don't have \neconomic growth and American families can't grow, again, they lose \nsleep at night worrying about how they are going to pay their bills, \nhow they are going to cover their checks, what will their children's \nfuture be?\n  That is for those who still have checking accounts because another \nresult of Dodd-Frank is that bank fees have gone up. As bank fees have \ngone up, the unbanked, lower- and moderate-income Americans, those \nranks have grown. According to the FDIC, 9 million households don't \nhave a checking or savings account; and that is because account fees \nare too high or unpredictable, most of this courtesy of Dodd-Frank.\n  Another way it hurts hard-working American families is this \nOrwellian-named Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where there is \nnow one national credit nanny, has come up with a rule called the \nqualified mortgage rule that the Federal Reserve says, once fully \nphased in, one-third of Black and Hispanic borrowers will find \nthemselves disqualified for not meeting Washington's rigid one-size-\nfits-all debt-to-income requirements.\n\n[[Page H5392]]\n\n  We are losing our entrepreneurs. We are losing our small businesses. \nLow- and moderate-income people are falling behind because Dodd-Frank \ndidn't keep the promise of lifting the economy.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. If the chairman will yield, I have got a \nquestion for you--because I have had an experience in my time. This is \nmy third term here in Congress, and I have had a little bit of an \nexperience that was bothersome to me. I want to know if this matches \nyour expectations as well.\n  You talked about this qualified mortgage. I have a piece of \nlegislation called the Mortgage Choice Act, where rules that were \nwritten under the Dodd-Frank Act in an attempt to protect people from \nbeing gouged, I believe is actually doing the opposite.\n  In fact, it is not just me. It was a bipartisan group that got \ntogether and put this piece of legislation together that last Congress \npassed this House in this Chamber unanimously.\n  For the American people watching out there, yes, things actually pass \nunanimously here. You are not going to hear about that in the news a \nwhole lot, but we actually can work together.\n  Now, there is one disturbing thing, though. It passed the House \nunanimously, went over to the Senate, and there was one particular \nSenator who put the brakes on it. Not to name any names, but she didn't \nwant any changes to her baby, the Dodd-Frank Act.\n  We had to reintroduce the bill. As the chairman wells knows, we got \nit into committee again. Suddenly, it went from being unanimous to \nbeing a divisive issue. That was certainly not anything on our part \nbecause it was the exact same language, but people who had decided a \nyear ago this was the exact way to go have decided, for political \npurposes, that it is now something that can't be touched, can't be \naltered, can't even be addressed, and I am sure the chairman has some \nthoughts as to whether that is working.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for his, regrettably, accurate \nobservation.\n  I try not to question the motives of my colleagues, but something is \nawry when something goes through the House unanimously, and then just \nin a matter of a weeks to a couple of months later, all of a sudden, it \nbecomes a very divisive issue.\n  My fear is that the left hand doesn't always know what the far left \nhand is doing. The far left hand has decided that Dodd-Frank is sacred \ntext, notwithstanding the fact that, 5 years later, we understand that \nfree checking has been cut in half; 5 years later, we understand that \nbank fees are going up; 5 years later, we understand the ranks of the \nunbanked and the low- and moderate-income people who need to be able to \nhave access to credit--when you need $500 to repair your car to get to \nwork on Monday, you need $500 to repair your car to go to work on \nMonday.\n  Yet, for many, it is clear that Dodd-Frank has become a matter of \nbrand protection, of ideology; and it really doesn't matter how many \npeople suffer. That is so sad. I have strong thoughts on the matter, \nbut I will sit down and reason in good faith and compromise policy in \norder to advance principles on behalf of the American people.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, you just hit on the word \n``compromise.'' I think there are many of us that are looking to \ncompromise.\n  I was disturbed--and I am curious to hear the thoughts of my \ncolleague from Arizona as well about this--when we were sitting in \ncommittee and had a witness in front of us who characterized the Dodd-\nFrank Act as a compromise bill, it struck me that I guess maybe he is \nright. It was a compromise between Senator Dodd and Congressman Frank \nat the time, both Democrats, who didn't bother to get any input from \nthe Republicans.\n  As you pointed out, Mr. Chairman, you actually had a bill. A \ncompromise would have been to take parts of your bill and parts of \ntheir bills and marry them together. This isn't what happened, though, \nis it?\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman. Again, Republicans were frozen \nout. It was what Democrats wanted to do so they can own this particular \nbill that, again, is making America less stable. It makes it less \nstable because the big banks are bigger and the small banks are fewer.\n  Dodd-Frank has concentrated more financial assets in fewer \ninstitutions. It is a pillar of the President's economic program that \nis causing working families to have stagnant paychecks and lower bank \naccounts, that is, assuming they have a bank account, because the ranks \nof the unbanked has increased. It has made us less free.\n  We have one national consumer credit czar who decides now. It is \nWashington. Washington decides whether or not you can have a credit \ncard. Washington decides whether or not you can have a mortgage. \nWashington now decides whether or not you can get a small business line \nof credit.\n  I haven't even talked about this thing called the Financial Stability \nOversight Council that, for all intents and purposes, now has the \nability to control huge swaths of our economy by defining vague terms \nand systemic risks.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield to the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Thank you for the yield, Mr. Chairman.\n  You actually just hit on one of the wonderful ironies and one of the \ngreat difficulties we have in our discussions in our own committee.\n  First off, the regulation, the way Dodd-Frank is designed, it is \ndesigned for the last problem. It is not forward-looking of what the \nfuture looks like. And then there is always the arrogance here in \nWashington of thinking we know what the future looks like.\n  But there is also a number of professionals in the industry and \nacademia who are now writing about what they call concentration risks. \nWhat happens when you tell every bank that they can only hold certain \nassets? You now have a concentration risk. If something goes wrong in \nthat asset category, the cascade effect is universal. This is now \nhappening up and down our financial system.\n  In many ways, I can make you a powerful argument that the post-Dodd-\nFrank world is creating a banking system that ultimately is more \nfragile because of a contagion concentration risk.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. It is, in some respects, deja vu all over again. It \nis dangerous for government to have one view of risk--one view of risk. \nThe regulators told all the banks that there was virtually no risk in \nmortgage-backed securities, no risk in sovereign debt, so you don't \nhave to reserve practically any capital against those.\n  Think Fannie, Freddie, and Greek bonds, and it almost brought down \nthe entire national financial system, and we are obviously repeating \nthe same mistake. So I appreciate the gentleman from Arizona for his \nobservation.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. I know we have probably got about 3 or 4 \nminutes before a quick hour has gone by here, but I go back to my \nintention here and the question I have got for the chairman.\n  Obviously, a lot of well-intentioned things. Were there some issues \nand problems, abuses? Absolutely. I was in the real estate industry \nmyself, still am in construction. But the goal of having Dodd-Frank \nlift our economy, promote financial stability, end too big to fail, it \ncertainly doesn't seem like that from the perspective that I am. And I \nthink all the evidence is overwhelmingly that the answer is a \nresounding ``no'' on all counts.\n  I would love to hear the chairman's thoughts on that evidence.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Well, before I do, Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how \nmuch time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bost). The gentleman has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Again, in many respects, I do believe the economy is \nmore fragile. The good news is that more of our financial institutions \nare holding more capital. They are more liquid.\n  But what is ironic is the regulators, prior to Dodd-Frank, had all \nthe regulatory authority they needed to have made these balance sheets \neven safer; yet there has been no effort on the part\n\n[[Page H5393]]\n\nof the administration, notwithstanding the good work of our committee, \nto do anything about Fannie and Freddie that were at the epicenter of \nthe crisis.\n  Again, this whole government idea of putting people into homes that \nultimately they cannot afford to keep, it is terrible for them. It is \nbad for the taxpayer. It is bad for the economy. We have to move to a \nsustainable housing system: sustainable for homeowners, sustainable for \nthe economy, and certainly sustainable for taxpayers.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. I used to be a licensed Realtor, and I will \nnever forget that time in the late nineties when I went to my first \nclosing, where they slid a check, the closing agent slid a check across \nto the seller, as is expected. They are selling their home. Then they \nslid a check across to the buyer, and there was kind of a nervous laugh \nand a joke. ``Well, we know you are probably going need to buy some \nfurniture.'' That was the first time I personally witnessed someone \nborrowing more than what the house was actually worth. It is those \nkinds of decisions and that lack of risk, that lack of accountability, \nI think, that brought us to some of the areas.\n  I just wanted to relay that story of something that was just seared \ninto my mind, and one I hope we never, ever repeat.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I fear that, in many respects, the Obama \nadministration is making the same mistakes, and that is why, again, we \nneed the sustainable housing financial system.\n  But ultimately, what we are working for, as House Republicans, is to \nmake sure that all Americans have greater economic opportunity, and \nthat means competitive, innovative, and transparent financial markets. \nThat means an economy that is fair and works for everyone. It means \ngetting out of the bailout business once and for all. There ought to be \nbankruptcy for these financial institutions, not taxpayer bailouts.\n  We need all Americans to be able to climb the ladder of success, and \nthat means they need access to bank accounts. They need to go back and \nhave access to the free checking which they have lost under Dodd-Frank. \nWe need community banks to prosper for our rural areas, for our inner \ncities.\n  All of that can happen yet again, but it all starts--it all starts--\nwith having to replace Dodd-Frank, which is a clearly failed law 5 \nyears later. It didn't meet its promises. We are less stable, we are \nless prosperous, and we are less free.\n  House Republicans are putting forth a different plan today, just as \nwe did 5 years ago.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Honda) for 30 minutes.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today as the founder and \nco-chair of the Congressional Ethiopian American Caucus. This caucus \nwas established to give a legislative voice to the specific concerns of \nthe Ethiopian American community.\n  Founded in 2001, the caucus is comprised of Members who appreciate \nthe critical relationship between Ethiopia and the U.S. and value the \ncontributions of Ethiopian Americans to our Nation. Congressman John \nGaramendi and I co-chair this caucus of nearly 20 Members of Congress.\n  President Obama's upcoming visit to Ethiopia on July 27, which is \nnext Monday, will be the very first visit to this nation of 97 million \npeople by a sitting American President.\n  Ethiopia has Africa's second largest population and is a nation with \na rich, independent cultural history. And, by the way, Ethiopia is the \nonly African country in that continent that has not ever been \ncolonized.\n  It is a country of growing economic, humanitarian, and strategic \nimportance to the United States. Accompanying these opportunities are \nmany challenges that face Ethiopia today.\n  Situated at the center of the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia is located in \nan unstable region, making it a key ally of the United States in \ncombating radical extremists in the region.\n  Ethiopia has a checkered humanitarian record, and the government must \nlearn to embrace the voices of political dissent and promote basic \nhuman and civil rights.\n  I believe that President Obama's upcoming trip to Ethiopia provides a \nunique opportunity to promote respect for freedom of speech and press, \nin addition to supporting economic health, food security, and \nhumanitarian development in Ethiopia.\n  The United States must aggressively support and encourage Ethiopia to \nembrace democracy and its hallmarks: free speech and a free and \nindependent media.\n  With a base of young entrepreneurs, a large labor force, and a wealth \nof natural resources, Ethiopia has quickly become an important center \nof industry, agriculture, and technology. We must explore avenues for \nU.S. investment and partnerships with Ethiopia to further this growing \neconomic partnership.\n  Here at home, Ethiopians in the U.S. provide us with a large pool of \ntalent, education, and experience. If we are to draw lessons from U.S. \nrelations with China, Vietnam, and India, we can see that engagement is \nan important tool in bringing about sustainable change.\n  The U.S. and Ethiopian Governments must work closely to engage \nprivate business and Ethiopians in the diaspora. If we have learned \nanything about Ethiopia and Ethiopians, it is to never discount the \ncapacity for genius and resolve in the interest of their country and \nfellow countrymen.\n  I visited Ethiopia in 2005, and I left the country a changed man. The \nEthiopian diaspora's generosity and forward vision continue to inspire \nme as a person and as a policymaker.\n  Numbering over a quarter of a million people across this country, the \nvibrant and fast-growing Ethiopian American community greatly \ncontributes to the richness of American culture and strengthens our \neconomy to help make our Nation competitive in the 21st century.\n  As I traveled around Ethiopia and met people from all walks of life \nwho are bound by one truth, to control their own destiny, I was \ninspired more than ever to strengthening a long-established \nrelationship between Ethiopia and the U.S. and become an effective \nvoice to encourage lasting democratic, humanitarian, and security \nimprovements and partnerships with our friend in the Horn of Africa.\n  As President Obama prepares for his upcoming trip to Africa in the \ncoming days, many human rights groups are criticizing his visit to \nEthiopia as one that props up and supports a repressive regime; a \ngovernment that has been censoring and intimidating the media, and even \nimprisoning journalists who spoke out against the ruling Ethiopian \nparty.\n  Since 2014, six privately owned media outlets have shut down due to \ngovernment harassment of over two dozen journalists and bloggers who \nhave faced criminal charges, and at least 30 others have fled the \ncountry to avoid arrest. More journalists are in jail in Ethiopia than \nanywhere else in Africa.\n  This crackdown and use of antiterrorism legislation to stifle \npolitical dissent in Ethiopia is absolutely unacceptable. The State \nDepartment has publicly and privately expressed concerns about \nEthiopian restrictions on political and human rights. These issues \npresent complicated diplomatic engagement and security cooperation \nscenarios.\n  Stability, security, and economic development are sustainable only \nwith\n\n[[Page H5394]]\n\nthe development of democratic values, and Ethiopia has a long road \nahead to fully achieve these goals. But with our support and the \nsupport of the Ethiopian Caucus, we can help them move closer to those \nideals.\n  Over the past month, in the run-up to President Obama's visit, the \nEthiopian Government has released half a dozen journalists and bloggers \nwho were being held on dubious charges. While this is a positive step, \nthis does not forgive or cause us to overlook the restrictive and \nundemocratic pressures on the media in Ethiopia. The government's \nrecent actions of good faith are not an achievement but, rather, they \nrepresent the first step in a long road towards the government \ndemonstrating it can embrace a free and open democracy with a vibrant \nand free press.\n  I believe the U.S. can be most effective at championing human rights \nand democratic institutions in Ethiopia through engagement. The U.S. \nmust build on Obama's historic visit and work harder to encourage \npositive change. As a partner, we can have frank conversations with the \ngovernment and champion human rights and democratic principles.\n  Ethiopia is a young country in terms of democracy and, over time, we \ncan help shape their maturing political system in a way that provides \nreal choices for the people.\n  The Ethiopian Government needs to continue to uphold democratic \nprinciples and engagement while, at the same time, reconciling the need \nfor security with the increasing opportunities to engage talented \nEthiopians.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  I stand with Amnesty International and call for the immediate and \nunconditional release of any and all remaining journalists and bloggers \nwho remain in prison based on politically motivated convictions on \nterrorism charges.\n  As a friend to the people of Ethiopia, it is our responsibility to \nencourage President Desalegn's government to stick to this reform.\n  As the U.S. pursues closer economic and strategic relationships with \nEthiopia, we must remain adamant that improvements to human rights and \ndemocratic institutions are a requirement to a successful partnership.\n  Ethiopia is a valuable partner in a critical region, from \npeacekeeping, to fighting al-Shabaab, to pursuing peace in South Sudan.\n  In recent years, the number of attacks performed by extremists across \nthe Horn of Africa has been increasing. Ethiopia has been a vital \npartner and ally to confront extremism in the region.\n  U.S. national security is intertwined with countries like Ethiopia \nthat are on the frontline of fighting terrorism. The threat posed to \nAfrican countries posed by terrorism requires the support of the United \nStates Government in helping build stability that will allow democratic \ninstitutions to grow and flourish.\n  Ethiopia has historically been a key contributor to United Nations \nand African Union peacekeeping missions and, as the seat of the African \nUnion, has taken an active role in trying to bring peace to the region \nand the continent.\n  To this end, Ethiopia gets nearly $800 million a year in U.S. \nmilitary assistance to fight the Somali Islamic group al-Shabaab, a \ngroup that is responsible for numerous attacks across the region.\n  As we invest hundreds of millions to combat this brutal extremist \ngroup, we must remember that military strength alone will not defeat \nextremism.\n  The only lasting solution is a comprehensive one that addresses the \npolitical and economic concerns of the region, one in which the rights \nof all religious and cultural groups are respected.\n  I encourage President Obama to work with the Ethiopian, Kenyan, and \nSomali Governments to find ways to address the underlying social and \neconomic issues that are resulting in fertile grounds for extremist \nmovements like al-Shabaab.\n  Ethiopia has undergone amazingly rapid economic growth in recent \nyears and has made significant progress toward its Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. The U.S. must continue to support Ethiopia's \ndevelopment goals and increase opportunities for U.S. businesses in the \nregion.\n  Ethiopia has the fifth fastest growing economy of the 188 \nInternational Monetary Fund member countries. The Ethiopian economy has \nenjoyed strong economic growth, with average GDP growth over 10 percent \nin the past decade, double the average for sub-Saharan Africa.\n  This growth has largely been a result of government-led development \npolicies with an emphasis on public investment, commercialization of \nagriculture, and nonfarm, private sector development.\n  As part of this growth, Ethiopia has prioritized infrastructure \ndevelopment. Ethiopia is investing heavily in physical infrastructure \nas part of its development strategy.\n  This includes the development and upgrading of the country's power, \ntransport, and telecommunications facilities, with a brand-new railway \nnetwork and the construction of a number of hydroelectric power \nstations. These investments will allow the country to continue to \nexport power to neighboring countries.\n  Ethiopia has also proven to be a partner in renewable energy \ndevelopment. Their hydro programs are helping move Ethiopia to become a \nclimate-resilient economy by 2025.\n  Ethiopia has the second highest hydropower-generating capacity in \nAfrica and the continent's biggest wind farm.\n  These renewable resources have enabled Ethiopia to export electricity \nto Kenya, Djibouti, and Sudan despite having limited hydrocarbon \nresources.\n  This incredible growth has not gone unnoticed by the rest of the \nworld, and numerous developed nations, including China and India, are \ninvesting heavily in Ethiopia.\n  India is the biggest investor in land in Ethiopia, with Indian \ncompanies accounting for almost 70 percent of the land acquired by \nforeigners. The U.S. Government needs to do more to encourage American \ncompanies to invest in Ethiopia.\n  With the continent's second largest population, Ethiopia is a huge \nmarket for American companies and products.\n  Self-imposed congressional limitations on programs like OPIC, the \nOverseas Private Investment Corporations, are severely hindering U.S. \ninvestment into this economy. Self-imposed congressional limitations \nare severely hindering U.S. investment in this economy. We have to \nremember that.\n  According to figures from the World Bank and Ernst & Young, foreign \ndirect investment into Ethiopia has risen more than tenfold in 7 years, \nfrom $108 million in 2008 to $1.2 billion in 2014, with $1.5 billion \nprojected for 2015.\n  A significant portion of this investment growth is represented by \nChinese investment in Ethiopia ramping up. This includes a new $200 \nmillion African Union headquarters financed by China, a $300 million \ncontract to expand the Addis Ababa airport, and construction of a \nreported $2 billion factory for China's Huajian Corporation, which will \nemploy 30,000 Ethiopians.\n  It is critical that the U.S. Government mobilizes private sector \ncapital to address these development challenges or other countries \nwill.\n  Despite all this economic growth, Ethiopia has significant \nchallenges. Ethiopia's per capita GDP of $505 is one of the world's \nlowest.\n  Though per capita GDP is on the rise--7.2 percent in 2014--it is \nstill one of the poorest countries in the world, ranking 173 out of 187 \ncountries on the Human Development Index.\n  Although Ethiopia is outperforming many sub-Saharan countries in \npoverty reduction, widespread malnutrition continues to haunt the \nnation.\n  Estimates suggest that the country loses around 16.5 percent of its \nGDP each year to the long-term effects of child malnutrition.\n  Dependency on agriculture--coffee, in particular--leaves the large \nrural population vulnerable to droughts, natural disasters, and other \neconomic shocks.\n  Recent periods of rapid inflationary pressures and large refugee \ninflows from Eritrea and South Sudan further aggravate these trends. \nThis has led to food prices rising 100 percent in 2011.\n  Ethiopia still relies heavily on aid to achieve its development \ngoals. Ethiopia receives the most USAID assistance of any sub-Saharan \nAfrican country, ranked seventh worldwide.\n  Even among other donors, Ethiopia remains the single largest \nrecipient of\n\n[[Page H5395]]\n\nofficial development assistance in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  So Ethiopia has made progress towards reaching most of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals.\n  Together with government action and the largest social protection \nscheme in the region, Ethiopia has seen remarkable progress towards its \ndevelopment targets. Apart from the overall decline in poverty--reduced \nby 33 percent since 2000--positive gains have been made in terms of \neducation, health, and reducing the prevalence of HIV/AIDS and fistula.\n\n  USAID development funds and programs are having a massive impact in \nEthiopia in everything from nutrition, sustainability, food stability, \nhealth, and education. U.S. businesses and entrepreneurs also have a \nstrong role to play in Ethiopia.\n  Organizations like the U.S.-Africa Diaspora Business Council focus on \ntapping into the large entrepreneurial Ethiopian and African diaspora \npopulations in the U.S.\n  They help provide information, build capacity, and developmental \ninfrastructure to assist American companies to build business \nfootprints in Ethiopia and develop trade between the U.S. and Africa.\n  I would like to particularly highlight the budding benefit \ncorporations that are producing a positive impact on society and the \nenvironment as well as making a profit.\n  Ethiopian diaspora-owned company Blessed Coffee, the nation's second \nbenefit corporation, is established as a socially responsible business, \nfocusing on trade in coffee growing regions as well as in communities \nin the U.S. where coffee is sold.\n  A symbiotic relationship will be one that not only benefits the \nAmerican consumer but, also, the farmers in Ethiopia and the \ndevelopment of the region.\n  On a side note, I am not sure that it is well known, but according to \nDNA analysis, all coffee came from Ethiopia. So we can thank them for \nthat.\n  I was proud to help reauthorize the African Growth and Opportunity \nAct last month, which paves the way for continued investment in \nEthiopia and Africa through preferential duty-free treatment to U.S. \nimports of certain products.\n  This important bill incentivizes American companies to invest in \nindustry and development programs in Africa and Ethiopia that provide \nproducts to the United States and jobs to the region.\n  As the Representative from Silicon Valley, I take special note of the \nlarge opportunities in high technology and Internet fields.\n  With just over 2 percent Internet penetration and 27 percent cellular \nphone subscriptions, Ethiopia has one of the lowest rates of Internet \nand mobile phone penetration in the world.\n  Persistent State interventions, including nationwide Internet \nfiltering, public sector monopoly over the telecom sector, and a \nrelatively closed economy, have suppressed the growth of economic \nfreedom over the past 5 years.\n  All of this points to an opportunity for the U.S. Government and \ncompanies to help Ethiopia modernize and open its markets to American \ntech companies.\n  In closing, let me just say that Ethiopia is a nation of growing \nimportance and opportunity for the United States, a reality that is \nhighlighted by President Obama's visit next week.\n  As one of the poorest countries, yet with one of the fastest growing \neconomies and largest population in Africa, Ethiopia still represents \nenormous untapped potential for economic growth.\n  Ethiopia is a country where American companies can invest and bring \njobs and development. It is critical that the U.S. Government seizes \nthis opportunity for investment and mobilizes private sector capital to \naddress the development challenges Ethiopia faces.\n  Additionally, the U.S. has an opportunity to help Ethiopia address \nthe numerous humanitarian challenges it faces. The administration's \nFeed the Future initiative supports Ethiopia's food security strategy \nto reduce hunger, improve nutrition, and promote broad-based economic \ngrowth.\n  Ethiopia still has many serious unmet development needs in sectors \nlike small-business lending, private education, health care, and access \nto electricity.\n  Healthy bilateral aid programs through USAID and development programs \nlike Power Africa can help make significant improvements into the \nhealth and food security of millions of people in Ethiopia.\n  Notwithstanding Ethiopia's enormous development needs, we must secure \nties within the country to reinforce its constructive collaboration \nwith the U.S. on regional security issues in the Horn of Africa.\n  Ethiopia's ongoing strategic partnership with the United States in \ncombating al-Shabaab and defeating extremism in the Horn of Africa is \nan opportunity for the United States to change the narrative in the \nregion away from focusing solely on military solutions and, instead, \nfocusing on a comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying \nsocial, economic, and political causes that fuel extremist groups.\n  Stability, security, and economic development are sustainable only \nwith the development of democratic values.\n  Ethiopia is a young democracy where human rights and freedom of \nspeech are not respected by the ruling government. The United States \nmust take a strong position of standing with democratic institutions, \nsuch as free speech and open, fair, transparent elections.\n  The U.S. must build on Obama's historic visit and work harder to \nencourage positive change. As a partner, we can have frank \nconversations with their government and champion human rights and \ndemocratic principles.\n  Ethiopia is a young country in terms of democracy, and over time we \ncan help shape their maturing political system in a way that provides \nreal choices for the people.\n  The Ethiopian diaspora here in the United States are the natural \nbridges and ambassadors and human resources to build and strengthen the \neconomic, strategic, and humanitarian connections between our nations.\n  The future looks extremely bright for Ethiopia, and the United States \nhas an opportunity to be a strong partner as it moves towards a \nwealthier, more secure, and more democratic future.\n  I am proud to be the co-chair of the Ethiopian American Caucus, where \nI can help give a legislative voice to the specific concerns of the \nEthiopian American community and help the U.S. Government and diaspora \nbuild these important, necessary bridges to a brighter future.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of \nthe strong relationship between the United States and Ethiopia. As a \nmember of the Ethiopian American Caucus, I am proud to see our \nbilateral relationship grow.\n  As the United States continues to provide economic, humanitarian, and \ndevelopmental assistance, Ethiopia continues to struggle with human \nrights issues and food insecurity. Next week, I will visit Ethiopia \nwith President Barack Obama to highlight America's commitment to \ninvesting in Africa. I hope that with this visit, we can reinforce our \ncommitment to improving public health, food security, and human rights \nin Ethiopia.\n  It is my hope that in Congress, we can follow the lead of the late \nformer Congressman Mickey Leland, whose work to end hunger and poverty \nwas world-changing. Congressman Leland helped to form the House Select \nCommittee on World Hunger in 1984 which generated awareness within \nCongress regarding national and international hunger and prompted a \nbipartisan effort to find solutions to end hunger in the U.S. and \naround the world, particularly in Ethiopia and Sudan. Congressman \nLeland wag killed in a plane crash in Ethiopia during a mission.\n  Since the African Growth and Opportunities Act was reauthorized \nearlier this summer, Ethiopia is eligible for preferential trade \nbenefits. I hope to see our trade relationship grow as we work with \nEthiopia to improve humanitarian conditions. I am proud to be a member \nof the Ethiopian American Caucus and I ask my colleagues to support the \nrelationship between the U.S. and Ethiopia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5395-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5395-H5398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  2100\n                     THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. \nRos-Lehtinen) for 30 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, just a few days ago, the White House\n\n[[Page H5396]]\n\nformally transmitted to Congress the Iranian nuclear agreement. I am \nholding it here in my hand. And now there will be much discussion in \nCongress over the role of this legislative body regarding nuclear \nagreements, but I would like to remind my colleagues that a process is \nalready in place for civil nuclear agreements. This Iran deal that we \nhave in front of us includes sections about a civil nuclear cooperation \nwith Iran.\n  Under current law, section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act specifies the \nconditions by which the United States should enter into a civil nuclear \ncooperation agreement with other countries. Parts of the terms \ndetermined by the 123 agreement is the cessation from enrichment or \nreprocessing, a term that is coined, Mr. Speaker, as the gold standard. \nBut the Obama administration has taken the liberty to enter into 123 \nagreements without abiding by the gold standard.\n  Why should we hold different countries accountable for different \nterms when it comes to proliferation? We should be holding each country \nto the very strictest of standards to ensure maximum safeguards are in \nplace.\n  This is why, Mr. Speaker, in the last Congress I reintroduced, \nalongside with my congressional colleague Brad Sherman, a bill which \nreforms the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to provide greater congressional \noversight of nuclear agreements with foreign countries and to protect \nagainst the threat of nuclear proliferation. So when the President says \nthat it is either this deal or we go to war, there is actually another \noption.\n  Let's not forget about the U.S.-Russia nuclear cooperation agreement, \nwhich was previously withdrawn by the Bush administration in 2008 \nbecause the President could not certify under the Iran, North Korea, \nSyria Nonproliferation Act that Russia was not providing nuclear, \nmissile, and advanced conventional weapons to Iran. Yet, through this \nnew deal with Iran, Iran can buy nuclear, missile, and advanced \nconventional weapons from the Russians.\n  Next on the list was the 123 agreement with Vietnam. I strongly \nopposed this agreement because it allowed Vietnam to enrich.\n  Next up, the pending U.S.-China nuclear cooperation agreement. Again, \nI opposed that agreement because it allows China to enrich.\n  So what kind of message are we sending to our allies, Mr. Speaker? \nJordan and the UAE, some of our closest partners in the region, are not \nallowed to enrich based on their commitments to our 123 agreement, but \nbad actors such as Russia, China, and Vietnam, oh, they can enrich. It \ndoes not make much sense, Mr. Speaker.\n  Page 5, section 13--and I hope that our constituents read it--of the \ngeneral provisions of the Iran nuclear agreement states that the P5+1 \nnations will ``cooperate, as appropriate, in the field of peaceful uses \nof nuclear energy and engage in mutually determined civil nuclear \ncooperation projects as detailed in Annex 3.''\n  So when we go to Annex 3, the situation becomes really scary. \nAccording to Annex 3, the P5+1 nations and Iran can cooperate on civil \nnuclear and scientific projects.\n  What does that mean? Oh, it spells it out, and it includes--listen to \nthis--facilitation of Iran's acquisition of light water research and \npower reactors, for research, development, and testing; construction of \nnew light water power reactors, including small- and medium-sized \nnuclear reactors; construction of state-of-the-art light water \nmoderated multipurpose research reactors; supply of state-of-the-art \ninstrumentation and control systems for the research and power \nreactors.\n  Oh, but the list keeps going.\n  Supply of nuclear simulation and software solutions with regard to \nthese research and power reactors; on-the-job training on fuel \nmanagement scenarios for these research and power nuclear reactors; \nand, last but not least, joint technical review of Iran's current \nnuclear reactors, upon the request by Iran, in order to upgrade current \nequipment and systems.\n  So, essentially, we will be helping Iran to modernize and upgrade \ntheir reactors. This is absolutely absurd--and dangerously absurd, Mr. \nSpeaker. How could we ever expect any country to agree to the gold \nstandard when they can point to the JCPOA and say they want the Iran \nstandard? They don't want the gold standard. We want the Iran standard \nbecause that is what is going to be one of the lasting legacies of this \nweak and dangerous deal: we have obliterated any of our moral or legal \nstanding to insist that other countries forgo their own enrichment \nprograms.\n  No country's leaders in their right minds would ever agree to \nanything less than what we have allowed Iran to do; and now if we don't \nblock this deal's implementation, Mr. Speaker, we are putting into \nmotion a nuclear arms race that we will not be able to stop.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the most egregious mistakes of this nuclear \ndeal--which is saying something. It is a long list of bad things. This \ndeal is chock-full egregious mistakes, but one of the worst is the \nlifting of U.S. sanctions on conventional weapons and ballistic \nmissiles as well as the lifting of sanctions on Iran's central figures \nof its nuclear weapons program by the E.U. and the U.N.\n  Just last night, Mr. Speaker, The Wall Street Journal reported on the \nsanctions that are to be lifted on the Iranians and the institutions \nbehind Iran's decades-long, covert, and illegal nuclear program. This \ndoesn't even begin to touch on the issues of sanctions being lifted \nagainst Iran's Quds Force leaders and the IRGC, the very same people \nwho are responsible for carrying out and planning Iran's most deadly \nattacks and for supporting terror attacks across the world, the very \nsame individuals, Mr. Speaker, who have American servicemembers' blood \non their hands.\n  That is right. The administration and the P5+1 have agreed right \nthere in Annex 1 and Annex 2 to remove these individuals and these \nentities from the U.N. and European sanctions list. How the \nadministration can even begin to try to justify removing these people \nfrom these sanctions lists and these designations is beyond \ncomprehension. In fact, it is a direct affront to every man or woman \nwho has served in the U.S. Armed Forces and their friends, families, \nand loved ones.\n  The administration needs to explain--and I would like viewers to look \nat this poster--how Soleimani, the gentleman here in the middle, the \nhead of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, the commander of the Quds Force, \nnot only gets to get rid of these sanctions, but soon will get a boon \nto his coffers to increase his attacks against the U.S. and our \ninterests.\n  But look at this rogues gallery. We are not done yet. How about \nGeneral Vahidi? General Vahidi, this fine gentleman here, former Quds \nForce commander, Iranian defense minister, has been wanted by Interpol \nsince 2007 for his role in the 1994 AMIA Jewish center bombing in \nBuenos Aires, Argentina. He will come off some of these sanctions \nlists, this gentleman responsible for the murder of innocent men, \nwomen, and children.\n\n  But as The Wall Street Journal article notes, we are actually going \nto be lifting the sanctions on the scientists and the individuals \nresponsible for developing Iran's covert nuclear weapons program. Mr. \nSpeaker, this will leave these individuals free to continue to work on \nthe regime's nuclear program. But not only that, it will leave them \nfree to proliferate their expertise and knowledge.\n  What we have here, Mr. Speaker, is that we essentially have agreed to \nlift the sanctions and designations on most of the key individuals on \nIran's covert nuclear weapons program while, at the same time, allowing \nall of Iran's key components of its nuclear program to remain intact. \nHow does that benefit our national security?\n  We have agreed to lift sanctions on the Iranian equivalent of A.Q. \nKhan, this gentleman here, the head of Iran's WMD program. A.Q. Khan, \nif you remember, Mr. Speaker, is the Pakistani nuclear physicist \nresponsible for the proliferation network that helped Libya, North \nKorea, Iran, and China develop their nuclear programs. He is the \nequivalent of A.Q. Khan. The Iranian A.Q. Khan helped the regime in its \nattempt to develop a nuclear explosive device which the regime still \nrefuses to come clean about to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n  So look at this rogues gallery. We are not done.\n\n[[Page H5397]]\n\n  Now the Iranian equivalent of A.Q. Khan will be likely taken off the \ndesignation list before the terms of this agreement is up, meaning \nthat, by the time this deal expires, this Iranian, A.Q. Khan, will have \nhad years to perfect his explosive device without repercussions.\n  This deal will also lift sanctions on the nuclear scientist named \nAbbasi-Davani. This fine gentleman here was the head of Iran's Atomic \nEnergy Agency. Not only was this man once the head of the Atomic Energy \nOrganization of Iran, but he was sanctioned by the U.N. Security \nCouncil, sanctioned by the U.N. for his work on both Iran's nuclear and \nballistic missile program, which, by the way, just underscores the \nabsurdity of the notion that Iran's nuclear program is for peaceful \npurposes. Only nations that intend on having a nuclear payload develop \nballistic missiles, and this man was involved in both. Yet he too will \nbe removed from U.N. sanctions before this agreement expires, leaving \nhim several years to continue his work without any international \nscrutiny.\n  But we have one more fine gentleman to point out, Mr. Speaker, as if \nthat weren't enough. German engineer Gerhard Wisser, right over here, \nis a collaborating German scientist. He was an individual who was \nconvicted and imprisoned in South Africa for his involvement in the \nA.Q. Khan network and who has facilitated the sale of nuclear equipment \nto North Korea, to Iran, and to Libya. He will be delisted, as well.\n  On top of all of this, Iran's organization involved in spearheading \nits nuclear weapons research will be removed from the U.S. sanctions \nlist, despite its long record of noncompliance with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency.\n  All I see in this agreement, Mr. Speaker, is a path to the Iranian \nbomb and not the prevention of one, as the administration claimed was \nthe objective. Any way you slice it, Mr. Speaker, Iran will be a \nnuclear weapons state within a decade or so, and these individuals will \nbe free to harm our international interests.\n  Even if the U.N. Security Council opts to reimpose sanctions on the \nregime, Iran has built into the agreement that this would be a \nviolation of the agreement. Listen to that, Mr. Speaker. If the U.N. \nSecurity Council opts to reimpose sanctions, Iran has in this deal a \nstipulation that this would be a violation of the agreement, and then \nit can simply snap back its own nuclear program. That is the only \nsnapback that is involved, Iran snapping back its own nuclear program. \nAnd now it will be free of all the burdens of sanctions. It will have \nits entire infrastructure--complete with the added benefit of U.S. \nassistance in modernizing its equipment, in advancing certain aspects \nof it--as well as the key individuals involved and responsible for \nadvancing the program ready and able to produce a nuclear weapon \nwithout any problems whatsoever.\n  Mr. Speaker, if Congress approves this deal, we are guaranteeing that \nIran becomes a nuclear weapons state, and we are giving away every bit \nof leverage that we have against this rogue regime. This deal isn't \ngoing to avert a war. It might very well precipitate one. Our only real \noption for peace and a nuclear-free Middle East is to insist on a \nbetter deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must back that up with tougher sanctions, not a \npromise to lift sanctions on some of the world's most dangerous \nindividuals. How can we say, Mr. Speaker, that this nuclear deal is \nanything but a bad deal when it doesn't meet the benchmarks of the U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolutions or even the President's own benchmarks \nfrom 2013?\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  Iran was in violation of every one of those resolutions; yet, just 2 \ndays ago, the administration and the rest of the P5+1 went to the U.N. \nSecurity Council to bind ourselves to lifting the resolutions, even \nthough the Iranian regime never complied with a single one--six \nresolutions violated.\n  Each of those resolutions confirmed that Iran was not in compliance \nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency, had not halted enrichment, \nhad not stopped reprocessing, had not halted developing nuclear \ntechnology, and had not stopped its ballistic missile program.\n  Iran has never met a U.N. Security Council resolution that it didn't \nviolate; yet here we are, pretending that Iran has somehow complied \nwith the international community and can be trusted this time to live \nup to its obligation under international law.\n  Let's just take a look at what each of those resolutions required \nfrom Iran and what we are no longer requiring Iran to do as a result of \nthis disastrous deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will start with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1696, \nimplemented on July 13, 2006. It demands that Iran suspend all \nenrichment related and reprocessing activities, which would be verified \nby the International Atomic Energy Agency after Iran's noncompliance \nwith the IAEA for over 3 years.\n  It gave Iran 1 month to comply with the IAEA or face the possibility \nof economic and diplomatic sanctions. It endorsed the diplomatic \nsolution, specifically a P5+1 proposal from 2006 for a long-term, \ncomprehensive agreement to determine the exclusively peaceful nature of \nIran's nuclear program.\n  It called upon states to exercise vigilance to prevent the transfer \nof any item, materials, goods, and technology that could contribute to \nIran's enrichment and reprocessing activities and ballistic missile \nprogram. Iran did not comply.\n  U.N. Security Council Resolution 1737 passed on December 23rd, 2006, \nit imposed sanctions on Iran for failing to halt uranium enrichment as \nstipulated in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1696 that I \njust spoke about.\n  It reaffirms that Iran shall, without further delay, suspend all \nenrichment related and reprocessing activities, including research and \ndevelopment to be verified by the IAEA and work on all heavy water-\nrelated projects, including the construction of a research reactor, \nmoderated by heavy water.\n  The resolution further imposed sanctions on that country, blocking \nthe import or export of sensitive nuclear material and equipment and \nfreezing the financial assets of persons and entities supporting its \nproliferation-sensitive nuclear activities or the development of \nnuclear weapons delivery systems.\n  Also, this resolution established a new committee comprised of all \ncouncil members to monitor the implementation of the present text and \ndesignate further individuals or entities to which the sanctions should \napply. I bet Iran was really worried about that new committee.\n  How about this resolution, U.N. Security Council Resolution 1747, \nadopted on March 24, 2007? It widened the scope of the previous \nresolution by banning Iran's arms exports, arms embargo, prohibits \ntransfers to Iran of nuclear, missile, and dual-use items, exports from \nIran of arms or WMD useful technology.\n  It reaffirmed previous positions on Iran's nuclear program, including \nthe suspension of all enrichment activity. It sanctioned additional \nindividual and entities. How many more people could we put on that \nlist?\n  How about another resolution? U.N. Security Council Resolution 1803, \nadopted on March 3, 2008, it approved a new round of sanctions against \nIran for refusing to suspend nuclear projects and activities.\n  It reaffirmed all previous resolutions and demanded that Iran cease \nall enrichment and reprocessing and ballistic missile related activity. \nIt required countries to inspect suspected cargo to and from Iran, \nextended the freezing of financial assets to persons or entities \nsupporting Iran's nuclear-related programs or activities. It called \nupon countries to monitor activities of Iranian banks. It imposed \ntravel restrictions on sanctioned individuals\n  How about U.N. Security Council Resolution 1835, adopted on September \n27, 2008? It reaffirmed all previous resolutions. It reports that it \nfound conclusively that Iran is continuing to develop its nuclear \nprogram.\n  I bet that was a surprise. It found that Iran was making progress on \ndeveloping and operating its centrifuges and continued to deliberately \nblock and stonewall. It called on Iran to comply with obligations fully \nand without delay.\n  Remember, these resolutions are gone now, Mr. Speaker.\n  U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 adopted on June 9, 2010, it \nreaffirmed all previous resolutions. It prohibited Iran from investing \nabroad\n\n[[Page H5398]]\n\nin uranium mining, related nuclear technologies, or nuclear capable \nballistic missile technology.\n  It prohibited Iran from launching ballistic missiles, including on \nits own territory. It required Iran to refrain from any development of \nballistic missiles that are nuclear capable.\n  It mandated that countries not export major combat systems to Iran, \nbut does not bar sales of missiles that are not on the U.N. Register of \nConventional Arms. It called on the vigilance of international lending \nto Iran, providing trade credits and other financing.\n  It called on countries to inspect cargoes carried by Iran air cargo \nand Islamic Republic of Iran shipping lines or by any ship in national \nor international waters, if there are indications that they are \ncarrying cargo banned for carriage to Iran.\n  Searches in international waters would require concurrence of the \ncountry where the ship is registered, but it could happen. It froze the \nassets of Iranian persons and entities named in annexes to the \nresolutions and required that countries ban the travel of named \nIranians.\n\n  That was back in the day, Mr. Speaker; yet here we are today, 2 days \nafter the administration went around Congress to bind the United States \nto a U.N. Security Council resolution that will lift all of those \nresolutions. You see all of those resolutions; we just ripped them up, \nno longer needed. We did not achieve a single thing that those previous \nsix resolutions called for.\n  Now, to make matters worse, Mr. Speaker, the P5+1 countries will \nhonor their obligations on this new U.N. Security Council resolution, \nwhile the Iranian regime laughs at us all the way to the bomb.\n  Iran has never felt compelled to honor its international obligations; \nand now, we are just supposed to expect it to fully comply with this? A \nzebra can't change its stripes, and this Iranian regime will never feel \nobligated to abide by this new international agreement.\n  Why tie our hands like this, Mr. Speaker? This is a bad and dangerous \nnuclear deal. I would urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  There has been a lot of talk, Mr. Speaker, about these anytime, \nanywhere inspections. I think it is important for us to examine what \nthis agreement actually says about anytime, anywhere.\n  If the IAEA has concerns regarding undeclared nuclear materials or \nactivities, they can request clarification from Iran. They request \nclarification from Iran, Oh, please explain to us. If Iran's \nclarification does not satisfy the IAEA, then the IAEA can request \naccess to such locations--request.\n  If the two sides are unable to reach satisfactory arrangements within \n14 days of the IAEA's original request--look at the timeline, Mr. \nSpeaker--then the joint commission would advise on how to resolve that \nissue within an additional 7 days; then Iran will have another 3 days \nto implement such a decision.\n  Can you keep up with me, ladies and gentlemen? Do the math. Iran \nactually has 24 days to stall or hide any undeclared nuclear material.\n  Is that the definition now of anytime, anywhere inspections, Mr. \nSpeaker? I don't think so, and Iran's Defense Minister doesn't think so \neither. Why do I say that? Just 2 days ago, he said that the IAEA would \nnot be allowed to inspect any of Iran's military sites.\n  They have been saying over and over again--the Supreme Leader has \nsaid the same thing multiple times--Iran will not let foreigners \ninspect any military center or interview its nuclear scientists.\n  On top of that, Iran's Foreign Minister and chief negotiator said, \njust yesterday, that Iran has secured the so-called right to deny the \nIAEA access to its nuclear sites for inspections.\n  Iran has also banned American nuclear inspectors from entering any \nnuclear site or participating on any International Atomic Energy Agency \ninspection team. No American can participate.\n  Let's just say, for argument's sake, that Iran is caught cheating, as \nunlikely as that might be--and I am being facetious obviously--what \nhappens then? Well, it says it right here. It is very clear. The deal \nstates that, if the countries believe that Iran is not meeting its \ncommitment under this agreement, they can refer the issue to the joint \ncommission.\n  The commission would have 15 days or longer to resolve the issue; \nthen the issue can be referred to the ministers of foreign affairs if \nthe commission could not resolve the issue. That is another 15 days for \nthe ministers, Mr. Speaker.\n  Let's do the math. We are already up to 30 days at the minimum. Then \nthe compliance participant could request that the issue be considered \nto the advisory board, which will have another 15 days to issue a \nnonbinding opinion.\n  If it is not resolved during this process and the U.N. Security \nCouncil gets notified, by the end, another 2 months or so would have \npassed and given Iran enough time to lobby Russia, China, and the rest \nof the P5+1 to vote with them so that sanctions are not reimposed.\n  Remember, Mr. Speaker, sanctions will only be reimposed in the event \nof a significant nonperformance by Iran. The key word there is \n``significant.''\n  What does the U.S. consider significant violations? What do the \nEuropeans consider significant violations? What does China consider it? \nWhat does Russia and Iran, itself, consider significant violations?\n  Iran can prevent from sanctions being reimposed, as long as they \ncheat only in small increments and not significantly. If they just \ncheat a little bit, they can get away with it.\n  Additionally, the JCPOA explicitly states: ``Iran has stated that if \nsanctions are reinstated in whole or in part, Iran will treat that as \ngrounds to cease performing its commitment under this JCPOA in whole or \nin part.''\n  Iran is saying: If you put sanctions on us, we don't have to continue \nwith this agreement.\n  I am not making it up. That is a quote. Even if Iran is caught \ncheating and we move to reimpose sanctions, as we are entitled to do \nunder the JCPOA, Iran is actually entitled to walk away from the deal.\n  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I feel that Iran will use this as its \ntrump card to bully the P5+1 into not addressing violations or holding \nIran accountable for its cheating. Even though the United States has \nthe ability to veto a Security Council vote, choosing not to reimpose \nsanctions and hold Iran accountable, we must, again, remember that such \na veto would unravel this deal, reapply sanctions, and allow Iran to \nclaim it can walk away.\n  Finally, an effective sanctions regime against Iran that was \nestablished over many years cannot be easily reapplied. The idea of \nsnapback sanctions is simply not viable.\n  Mr. Speaker, I could go on and on about all of the loopholes in this \ndeal. Suffice it to say, we can do better than this. We must do better \nthan this. We owe it to our children and our grandchildren to do better \nthan this.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5398-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5398-H5400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  2130\n                             THE IRAN DEAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I both applaud and appreciate the comments \nby my colleague, a person I love being a colleague with, Ms. Ileana \nRos-Lehtinen. These are profound points, excellent points, she has been \nmaking about the so-called Iran deal.\n  What is shocking to me--and I got this copy that a friend was using, \nbut the pages aren't numbered. By the way, Mr. Speaker, when Secretary \nKerry came to the Hill today--in having been through briefings by our \nSecretary previously--I knew that the best use of my time would be in \ngoing and reading the deal for myself, which is what I did.\n  It was interesting. I know that we have been assured over and over \npublicly that this is such a great deal, that this is what is going to \nreally save the world from the Iranians having a nuclear deal, but \nthere are some very troubling things that I haven't heard anybody \nmention about this agreement.\n  Actually, there is a report that there is an outside deal that has to \nbe arranged by the IAEA with Iran in order\n\n[[Page H5399]]\n\nto have a complete deal, which is that the IAEA is going to have to \nwork out terms--conditions--of its examination of some of the nuclear \nfacilities in Iran. That is deeply troubling.\n  Here is a story by Joel Gehrke from July 21, entitled ``House \nRepublican: Obama Administration Won't Release Full Iran Deal to \nCongress.''\n  It reads:\n  ``Senator Tom Cotton and Representative Mike Pompeo, who serves on \nthe House Intelligence Committee, learned of the arrangement while \nmeeting with the IAEA in Vienna, Austria, last week. `That we are only \nnow discovering that parts of this dangerous agreement are being kept \nsecret begs the question of what other elements may also be secret and \nentirely free from public scrutiny.' ''\n  Meeting with the IAEA is something that I have done in the last year \nand a half, but because of the ban by our Speaker on my being able to \ntravel because I was hoping to have a different Speaker, I am not able \nto visit anymore in a room with the IAEA in their office in Vienna. \nThat was immensely helpful to do in the job.\n  As one of the Speaker's folks mentioned, they see taxpayer-funded \ntravel as a reward, and I haven't earned their giving away taxpayer-\nfunded travel. Apparently, that is something you earn by voting like \nyou are told to. In any event, I am glad that Mike Pompeo and Senator \nTom Cotton have been over there and have met with them.\n  There is just so much about this deal that stinks to high heaven, \nespecially when you see it today, in that, apparently, in the last year \nor so, there must have been approval for an exception to the sanctions \non Iran to allow Iran to have 13 metric tons of pure gold shipped to it \nfrom South Africa.\n  Then we find out today that, actually, the U.S. was releasing $4.2 \nbillion to Iran, apparently in return, paying them to sit down and \nnegotiate further.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will tell you that our allies have got to be really \nmiffed as they find out more and more about the way this administration \noperates.\n  If you are our friend, we are going to cut deals with your enemy that \ncreate a real issue as to whether or not you may exist in the future. \nBut if you are our enemy, we will pay you just to sit down and \nnegotiate with us.\n  We will allow you to get gold shipped to you from 13 metric tons. \nThere is no telling how much grief those 13 metric tons of gold have \ncost the U.S. I wonder how many American lives have had their demise \ncontributed to because of the gold.\n  How many Jews or Christians around the world have lost their lives as \na result of this administration's paying the world's leading sponsor of \nterror all of this money, apparently, just to sit down with them and \nreleasing all of this money in the past just to get them to come to the \ntable? We don't do that with our friends. We don't pay them to sit down \nwith us.\n  We have already seen this in the attempted dealings with the Taliban. \nMr. Speaker, it has not been that many years ago. It has been since I \nhave been in Congress that this administration was reaching out to the \nTaliban, which has killed so many Americans and continues to kill \nAmericans.\n  In fact, under Commander in Chief George W. Bush, we lost--I believe \nit was--about 560 precious military American lives in Afghanistan in \nthat entire 7\\1/2\\ years--about 7\\1/4\\ years, actually.\n  This President has only been in office 6\\1/2\\ years, and under his \ncommand--his rules of engagement that cripple our military's ability to \ndefend themselves--under this administration and this Commander in \nChief's rules, there have been over three times that many lost \nAmerican, precious, military lives.\n  With this President being in command of three times the number of \nlost American military lives in Afghanistan, this administration's \napproach couldn't learn anything from the Bush administration's \nmistakes and successes.\n  Instead, it decided to reach out. There are all kinds of reports of \ntheir reaching out their offers. ``Look, Taliban. If you will just sit \ndown--no preconditions. If you will just agree to sit down with us, we \nwill be releasing murderers you want released from Guantanamo or \nanywhere else. Not only that, we will buy you luxurious offices in \nQatar--or wherever you say--just to sit down with us.''\n  Our enemies have really learned how to deal with this administration. \nOur friends have got to be scratching their heads, those who still have \ntheir heads. Therein lies another tragedy.\n  In this agreement, until I can be sure that the parts I read have \nbeen released publicly--and that is why I was asking for this copy of \nthe agreement. It is a different format from what I was reading earlier \ntoday.\n  As a judge, as a chief justice, even as a lawyer who has taken on the \nworld's largest oil company--I did years ago successfully--and as a \nlawyer who has taken on some pretty unbelievable efforts, words mean a \nlot when I am reading through things.\n\n  There is one word that particularly catches my attention, and that is \nthe little two-letter disjunctive word ``or.'' Until I can be sure that \nwhat I had read has been released--it should be. There is no reason \nthat this agreement should not be public so everyone can read it.\n  To those folks out there who are saying, ``Hey, it is a 10-year deal. \nIt will keep Iran from having nuclear weapons for 10 years. Even though \nit may come back and have a nuclear weapon within a month, 2 months, 3 \nmonths after the 10 years, at least it will keep them tied up for 10 \nyears,'' I would encourage anybody who has access to the actual \nagreement to look at any years mentioned--8, 10, whatever it is--and \nthen see if there is that little two-letter disjunctive word ``or'' and \nthen see if there is a provision for a shorter time than 10 years or a \nshorter time than 8 years to develop intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles.\n  These are things I have seen publicly, but I think it is critical. \nWhat kind of time or length of time of this deal are we looking at?\n  If there is this disjunctive little word ``or'' anywhere after any \ntime that this deal will last, we need to know how long that other \nprovision might be that would be shorter than 10 years.\n  If that provision, if such exists, puts the hands of how long this \ndeal will last completely out of the United States' hands, completely \nout of the P5+1, then that alone makes this deal a ``no'' deal. It is \noutrageous that anything but a hard timeline could exist in such a \ndeal.\n  There is a story from July 16 by James Jay Carafano. The first \nparagraph reads:\n  ``Once a major diplomatic agreement is inked, the world typically \nreacts by holding its breath, waiting to see if it will all turn out \nall right. Some deals, like the Munich Pact, crumble quickly. Others, \nlike the Camp David Accords, hang in there; but rarely has there been a \ndeal like the one reached in Vienna last night--a deal in which all the \nnations most closely affected by it, including Iran, pretty much start \nout knowing it won't end well.''\n  Here, Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that, as absolutely \natrocious as the Clinton-Albright-Wendy Sherman deal with North Korea \nwas, at least South Korea and Japan were involved and present for the \ntalks, because our allies Japan and South Korea were the ones most \naffected by any deal that the United States cut with North Korea.\n  Now, it was an outrageous agreement. I mean, I was just a district \njudge at the time, but I knew, clearly, from history and from current \nevents, that it was a deal that said, ``Here, North Korea. We will help \nyou build nuclear reactors, which will give you nuclear material to \nmake sure you have got what you need. All we ask in return, basically, \nis that you promise that you will never use any of this stuff to create \nnuclear weapons.''\n\n                              {time}  2145\n\n  Of course, North Korea jumped on that deal--different from here, \nthough. The number one most affected country by this deal is our dear \nfriend Israel.\n  Well, this President and all his minions could not get Prime Minister \nNetanyahu defeated and out of office, as they tried to do. This \nadministration has tried to punish Israel different ways, and those in \nthe administration who really do want to punish Israel, that don't like \nIsrael, they have got to be smiling over this deal because it is \nabsolutely unconscionable what has been done in the deal as it affects \nthe future of Israel. It is just incredible that we could allow this.\n  Then Saudi Arabia, right there in the vicinity, they certainly \nunderstand\n\n[[Page H5400]]\n\nwhat a bad deal this is. As we understand it, they are already making \nclear they are going to have to have a nuclear weapon. Egypt is going \nto need a nuclear weapon.\n  This deal makes clear that Iran is going to have nuclear weapons in \nat least 10 years; 10 years, 2 months, whatever anybody wants to say, \nor out of my concern, possibly much sooner than that legally under the \ndeal, even if it were ratified by the Senate. This is of tremendous \nconcern.\n  This is what the entire world, except for the most evil perpetrators \nin it, has worried most about, a point in world history where there is \nmassive proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  It won't do much good to return a Nobel Peace Prize after a President \ncauses nuclear proliferation that leads ultimately to the loss of \nmillions of lives and rampant destruction around the world and, \ncertainly, in the Middle East.\n  We have got all these folks worried about climate change, and here we \nare, on the brink of 10 years, at the most, before the most terroristic \nevil nation--well, the nation is not evil, their leaders are--the most \nevil leaders in the world have their hands on nuclear weapons that will \nkill millions of people.\n  It won't do much good for all those who lose their lives in a \nhorrible flash if the President sends back his Nobel Peace Prize as \nbeing the cause of that.\n  That is why it is so important that we stop this deal. I don't have \nany belief at all that anybody in this administration wants the world \nto go up, after nuclear proliferation, in one big mushroom cloud.\n  I don't believe that; I know that is not true, but that is what their \nactions--if not stopped by Senators and House Members, that is what is \ngoing to happen.\n  This is not just me saying so. Dr. Carafano says: ``The whole \nneighborhood will race to go nuclear. The number one concern with the \nway this deal was structured was that it was bound to accelerate \nnuclear proliferation. Iran has violated its obligations under the \nNuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and repeatedly thumbed its nose at \noversight from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA. Yet it \nwinds up getting a great deal under the agreement--better, in fact, \nthan the deal the United States gives its friends and allies, through \nthe 123 civil nuclear agreements. If regional powers like Turkey, \nEgypt, and Saudi Arabia believe that the likelihood of Iran getting a \nweapon is undiminished and the penalty for becoming a nuclear breakout \npower is plummeting, then the deterrent for them to cross the nuclear \nthreshold drops as well.\n  ``Tehran gets to keep its vast nuclear infrastructure and its missile \nprogram.''\n  It goes on to talk about that.\n  ``Sanctions relief will make the region far less safe.''\n  ``The deal is temporary, by design.''\n  I tell you, Mr. Speaker, we hear from our friends in the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, our local chambers of commerce, at least, about how \nnormally to calculate economic impact of $1 being spent somewhere, you \nhave to multiply it times seven because that dollar gets spent again \nand spent again and spent again.\n  I would submit that, with this deal with Iran, the most evil leaders \nin the world, the $100 billion to $150 billion that this administration \nmakes sure they have can't just be limited by $100 billion to $150 \nbillion when it comes to the calculation of evil that will result from \nthat money.\n  We can be sure that, since Iran sponsors terrorism around the world, \nthat it will spend a lot of that money creating terrorism with other \nterrorists and with other evil people; and those evil people will then \nbe able to take the billions of dollars they get from Iran and spend \nthat for their evil purposes with other evil people.\n  You may be looking at, really, a trillion dollars by the time all of \nthat money gets spent when you look at it as chambers of commerce \nnormally do. The potential for evil, for the $100 billion to $150 \nbillion going to an unrepentant sponsor of world terrorism, is really \ndramatic.\n  It is just incredible that this is happening on anybody's watch; \nRepublican, Democrat, it doesn't matter. It is incredible.\n  Here is an article by Sarah Wheaton, July 21st: ``In both a muscular \nspeech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Pittsburgh and a taping of \n`The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,' Obama cast critics of his diplomacy \nas the same kind of misguided warmongers who pushed for the invasion of \nIraq during George W. Bush's Presidency.''\n  I guess that includes Hillary Clinton; John Kerry, I think he may \nhave been on board with that.\n  The article says: `` `We're hearing the echoes of some of those same \npolicies and mindset that failed us in the past,' Obama said in \nPittsburgh. His loudest critics, he added, are `the same folks who were \nso quick to go to war in Iraq and said it would take a few months.' ''\n  Well, it is interesting to me that our President reserves making his \ncase for the Iran deal for a venue such as Comedy Central, and it \nreally would be a comedic escapade if this weren't so serious and we \nweren't talking about the existence of Israel, the continued lives or \nstoppage of lives of Christians and Jews around the world.\n  We know what the leaders of Iran think. They never, ever stop saying \nwhat they think. It is just incredible. They have never stopped \ndemanding ``death to America'' and ``death to Israel.''\n  I see this article by Raf Sanchez from July 21st: ``The U.S. said on \nTuesday it was disturbed by an outburst of anti-American rhetoric from \nIran's Supreme Leader in the wake of the nuclear deal, as fierce \ndebates over the agreement began in both the Iranian Parliament and \nU.S. Congress.\n  ``John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State, said he was troubled by a \nfiery speech in which Ayatollah Khamenei promised to continue fomenting \nunrest across the Middle East and said Iran's `policy towards the \narrogant U.S. will not change.'\n  `` `If it is the policy, it's very disturbing, it's very troubling, \nand we'll have to wait and see.' ''\n  No, we shouldn't have to wait and see. When Iran's evil leaders say \nthey are going to keep fomenting trouble, they are going to keep \nkilling Christians and Jews across the Middle East, they are going to \nkeep killing moderate Muslims in the Middle East, we should not wait; \nwe should take them seriously. They are saying it while the deal is \nstill not affirmed and ratified here in the United States.\n  You would have to be a blooming idiot to make a deal with people who \nare saying they are going to take the money they get from this deal and \nkill Americans, kill Christians, kill Jews, and give them the money \nanyway. There are going to be consequences for this kind of \nirresponsibility.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would just encourage anyone who has access to an \nupdated copy of the Iran deal, look to see for sure if it is limited to \na 10-year deal or perhaps could somebody do an inspection and say, Oh, \nit is all good--maybe it is a 5-year deal instead of a 10-year deal.\n  When the person making the agreement has no power after the deal is \nsigned, sealed, and delivered over when that deal ends, it is not a \ndeal that should be made. That alone ought to be enough to make anyone \nwalk away from it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am immensely concerned for our friends around the \nworld. I have mentioned numerous times--and I keep going back to the \nwords of a west African named Ebeneezer, a senior citizen there in west \nAfrica who explained how excited they were when we elected our first \nBlack President, but they have seen America get weaker, and he begged \nme to tell people in Washington that, when we get weaker in America, \nthey suffer more around the world and specifically in Africa. Those \nwords still bother me.\n  This deal with an evil group of leaders in Iran is going to spell \ndeath down the road for masses of people if we don't get it stopped.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is my plea. Let's stop the deal for the good of the \nworld.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5400-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5400-H5401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Clawson of Florida (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on \naccount of a family emergency.\n  Ms. Maxine Waters of California (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for \ntoday until 3 p.m.\n\n[[Page H5401]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/house-section/article/H5401-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          SENATE BILL REFERRED\n\n  A bill of the Senate of the following title was taken from the \nSpeaker's table and, under the rule, referred as follows:\n\n       S. 286.
