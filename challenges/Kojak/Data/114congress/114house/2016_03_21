It is an \nopportunity to learn more about water-related issues and find ways to \nmake a difference.\n  Growing up in the mountains of North Carolina, I lived in a house \nwithout electricity or running water. That experience taught me very \nquickly and very early in life that water is a valuable and precious \nresource when you have to carry it home from a spring twice a day, and \nthat lesson has stayed with me.\n  Many of us take for granted that when we turn on our taps or faucets, \nwater will always be there. However, more than 660 million people lack \naccess to safe water and 1.2 billion people live in areas with \ninadequate water supply.\n  There are many organizations throughout our country and throughout \nthe world that are working to change that situation. We can support the \nmany organizations that aim to preserve and defend this vital natural \nresource, but it is also important that we evaluate how we use water as \nindividuals.\n  On World Water Day, I hope all of us will explore how we can take \nsteps to preserve this fundamental resource and make it safe and \naccessible for the world's population.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1465-5", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WORLD DOWN SYNDROME DAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Bost) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, today is World Down Syndrome Day. This is a \nday that creates a global voice for the rights and inclusion of people \nwith Down syndrome.\n  According to the National Down Syndrome Society, there are more than \n400,000 Americans living with Down syndrome. This is an issue that hits \nvery close to home for me and my family.\n  On June 21, 2008, my grandson, Stanley, was born with Down syndrome. \nI have 10 grandchildren and one on the way. Each one is unique and \nspecial, but let me tell you about Stanley.\n  Stanley loves more than you can ever imagine. There is nothing more \nfun than coming in and looking up and seeing Stanley say: Hey, Grandpa \nMike, I need a hug.\n  I can tell you that when families find out that one of their children \nor grandchildren will have Down syndrome, you are worried and you are \nconcerned, but it is not something to be afraid of. It is something \nthat, yes, they will have special needs, but children and adults with \nDown syndrome can be trained and educated to a level where they can \nbecome self-supportive, active members of society, and be a great part \nof not only this Nation, but this world.\n  As I said earlier, there is no one that loves more, stronger, and so \nunconditionally. Maybe we should take a lesson from them, Mr. Speaker. \nOur family and all families that have members with Down syndrome are \nblessed beyond measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1465-6", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1465-H1466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    JUDGE MERRICK GARLAND NOMINATION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, President Obama nominated Judge \nMerrick Garland to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  Judge Garland is an extraordinarily qualified candidate, highly \nesteemed within the legal community, and highly accomplished as a \nprosecutor and appellate judge. He was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit \nCourt of Appeals in 1995, by a vote of 76-23, with a majority of \nRepublicans voting in favor of his confirmation. Indeed, an even larger \nnumber of Republicans said he was well qualified, and I will speak to \nthat.\n  Under normal circumstances, Judge Garland would now be sitting down \nthis week for one-on-one meetings with Senators on both sides of the \naisle in preparation for his confirmation hearings, but Senate \nRepublicans, Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, have made it clear that they \nwill not be operating under normal procedure. Instead, they\n\n[[Page H1466]]\n\nare refusing even to meet with Judge Garland. Let me suggest they are \nrefusing to do their duty.\n  Their approach is inconsistent with the expectations of our Founding \nFathers and a disservice to the American people, to the Court, to \nAmerican justice, and to the American people, and their justification \nhas no basis in fact.\n  Justice Anthony Kennedy, who sits now on the Court, was confirmed \nduring the final years of President Reagan's second term. In fact, he \nis one of the 14 Justices in our history who have been confirmed during \na Presidential election year, including Louis Brandeis and Benjamin \nCardozo.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, there is hardly precedent that a lame duck President \nmust allow a Supreme Court vacancy to sit unfilled for months. We do \nnot allow that for the House of Representatives and, for the most part, \nwe don't allow it for the United States Senate. There is a timeframe, \nindeed, in every State to fill seats in the House of Representatives so \nthat the American people will be represented. To politicize this \nprocess is irresponsible and jeopardizes the proper functioning of our \nSupreme Court.\n  In 1988, during the Kennedy confirmation process, President Reagan \nsaid, ``The Federal judiciary is too important to be made a political \nfootball.'' I agree, and I hope Senate Republicans would, too, because \nwe all know that their decision has nothing to do with Judge Garland's \nqualifications.\n  Senator Hatch, a Republican from Utah, in 1997, called Judge Garland \n``highly qualified'' and said, ``his intelligence and his scholarship \ncannot be questioned.'' When put forward for the D.C. Circuit Court, \nJudge Garland was cited by Senator Hatch as ``a fine nominee.'' He \nultimately voted to confirm Judge Garland to the D.C. Circuit Court.\n  While Chairman Chuck Grassley, who chairs the Judiciary Committee on \nthe Senate--also a Republican--opposed Judge Garland's nomination to \nthe Circuit Court, it ought to be noted that it was only because he \nthought there were already too many judges on that bench, not because \nJudge Garland lacked qualifications. In fact, Senator Grassley made \nthis clear by saying, ``I have nothing against the nominee. Mr. Garland \nseems to be well qualified and would probably make a good judge on some \nother court.''\n  Senator Jeff Sessions, a conservative Republican from Alabama, agreed \nwith Senator Grassley about too many judges on the Circuit Court, and \nsaid of Judge Garland: ``I would feel comfortable supporting him for \nanother judgeship.'' Although he didn't say it, but another judgeship \nwould be a Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. Now, \nSenator Grassley and Senator Sessions have an opportunity to put Judge \nGarland on another court--one that has a vacancy needing to be filled.\n  Our Founding Fathers set up a Court of nine Justices, cognizant of \nthe problem that would occur if there were a 4-4 tie. That is the \nsituation that exists today, and it can be remedied by the United \nStates Senate now.\n  Let's not play political games. If Republicans don't want Judge \nGarland on the Court, schedule a vote and cast their votes accordingly.\n  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said just yesterday on ABC's \nThis Week: ``Under the Constitution, we have a shared responsibility. \nThis is not something he''--referring to the President--``does alone. \nHe nominates; we confirm.''\n  That, of course, is absolutely accurate. I would say to Senator \nMcConnell that the President has met his responsibilities. Now it is \ntime for the Senate to do so as well.\n  Some Senate Republicans, Mr. Speaker, agree. Senator Mark Kirk of \nIllinois said on Friday: ``Cast a vote. The tough thing about these \nsenatorial jobs is you get `yes' or `no' votes. Your whole job,'' \nSenator Kirk observed, ``is to either say `yes' or `no' and explain \nwhy.'' That is democracy. That is responsibility.\n  Furthermore, in February, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, \nsaid: ``I think the obligation of the Senate is to carefully consider \nany nominee whom the President submits. The best way to do that, in my \njudgment, is public hearings.'' Senator Collins was absolutely right.\n  Under pressure from within their own ranks, Senate Republican leaders \ncan only stall for so long before they must face up to their \nresponsibility to give Judge Garland the fair hearing he deserves and \nthat the American people expect.\n  I believe Judge Garland will make a fine Supreme Court Justice, Mr. \nSpeaker, and I thank President Obama for selecting someone so ``highly \nqualified,'' intelligent, and whose ``scholarship cannot be \nquestioned,'' ``a fine nominee.'' All of those, of course, are Senator \nHatch's words.\n  I hope that Judge Garland will be swiftly confirmed. Leaving the \nSupreme Court with the possibility of gridlock, as we have seen the \nCongress at gridlock, is not good for our country, not good for the \nAmerican people, and does not serve our democracy well.\n  Senator McConnell, hold hearings. Reflect upon Judge Garland's \ncompetency, intellect, and suitability to serve on the Supreme Court. \nDo your duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1466-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SUNY POTSDAM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Since that \ntime, this school has developed a well-deserved reputation for \nproviding a topflight education, especially in the liberal arts and \nscience fields, and is the proud home of the world-renowned Crane \nSchool of Music, which I toured last year.\n  As the cochair of the Congressional STEAM Caucus, I am proud that \nSUNY Potsdam is leading the way in incorporating the arts into the \ntraditional science, technology, engineering, and math curriculum.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to stand on the House floor today to \ncommemorate the 200th anniversary of the founding of SUNY Potsdam.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1466-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1466-H1467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                 AMERICANS BEING UNJUSTLY HELD IN IRAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Issa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, these faces are not household names, faces; no \none knows who these unknown Americans are. And that is because they \nhave been held in Iran for so long.\n  September 18, 2015, and also detained in 2015.\n  Of course they were not detained the 444 days that Iran, a \ntotalitarian dictatorship and theocracy, held 52 American diplomats, \nand the world is not watching the same as they did then. That is how \nthis President could make a deal with Iran and not include these \nvictims of this dictatorship.\n  So today, Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to remind people that in \nthe years, the decades, since I was a young lieutenant in 1979, when \nthe Ayatollah Khomeini blamed students for somehow doing something--not \nhis government--and continued to blame them and blames them in many \nways until today, the Iranian Government, today, would still hold our \nEmbassy hostage. It still is a shell waiting for a return, a return \nthat I fear this President wants to do by executive order. He has \nalready thrown aside so much of what was working to stop this regime \nfrom spreading terrorism.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we speak today, these people are held hostage, and \nthe American people are being held hostage by a President who chooses \nto use the pen and the phone over the democratic means at his side.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will continue coming to the floor and pointing out \nthat Iran continues to be a dictatorship spreading violence throughout \nthe region; continues to fund Hamas and Hezbollah; continues to, in \nfact, destabilize countries in the region, and now does so with 140 \nbillion more dollars.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is extremely important that we stand firm in this \nHouse\n\n[[Page H1467]]\n\nthat this cannot be tolerated; that, ultimately, this body must stand \nand do what it is obligated to do, which is, in fact, to demand freedom \nfor Americans held involuntarily and illegally around the world, and \nparticularly in Iran.\n\n\n               President Obama's Supreme Court Nomination\n\n  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I will close by commenting on the Democratic \nWhip's statements. He is demanding that the Senate do its job.\n  At a time in which the political season is well underway and \npoliticians are campaigning around America for President, at a time in \nwhich two sides have two different visions of the Constitution--one is \nthat the original intent of the Constitution be adhered to and changed \nonly by the will of the people, as it has been 27 times; or, that it be \nsimply cast aside the way the current nominee for the Supreme Court \nwould do with the Second Amendment and others--I respect the minority \nleader's right to an opinion; but, of course, we all, on this floor, \nhave a right to be wrong from time to time. Mr. Speaker, he clearly was \nwhen he went on for more than 10 minutes, telling us that we have to \nconfirm a Supreme Court Justice in the middle of a political season.\n  I wish he had joined me in saying that this President should not make \nagreements that circumvent the Constitution, that circumvent this body \nand leave Americans stranded abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1467-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           LADIES IN WHITE AND PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TRIP TO CUBA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, when President Obama announced his \nefforts to normalize relations with Cuba in December 2014, many of us \nbelieved that his decision would only embolden the regime and end up \nhurting the Cuban people. Well, almost a year and a half later, we can \nsay, unfortunately, as expected, that our suspicions have been \nwarranted. This is indeed what has happened.\n  President Obama is only worried about legacy shopping and is willing \nto ignore the plight of the Cuban people who continue to suffer under \nCastro, and this normalization effort has been an abject failure for \nfreedom and democracy on the island.\n  The lives of the Cuban people have not improved. A record number of \nthem are fleeing the island to escape Castro's tyranny; and freedom and \nliberty, unfortunately, no longer seem to be the goals of this \nadministration for the people of Cuba.\n  In December 2015, President Obama said in an interview that he would \ngo to Cuba only when the human rights situation on the island had \nimproved. Well, Mr. Speaker, this is what human rights looks like on \nthe island, the valiant Ladies in White, who walk peacefully in Cuba to \ntheir church--and you see one being dragged away in the lower corner. \nThis is what happens to them every week in Castro's Cuba. They are \nharassed. They are beaten. This is not what an improved human rights \nsituation looks like at all, Mr. President.\n  Hours before the President arrived in Cuba, hundreds of pro-democracy \nadvocates were arrested. Listen to that, ladies and gentlemen. Hundreds \nof pro-democracy advocates were arrested just hours before the \nPresident's Air Force One touched down. Many of them were members of \nthe Ladies in White, Las Damas de Blanco.\n  The Ladies in White are mothers, wives, daughters, sisters of current \nor former political prisoners. These brave women continue to speak out \nfor justice and freedom against the regime that oppresses them daily \nand arrests them every Sunday when they walk peacefully to church.\n  Two weeks ago, the Ladies in White leader, Berta Soler--and we saw \nher in one of the posters--asked President Obama very pointedly--and \nthere they are getting arrested, harassed, as they do all the time. She \nsaid: Please visit Gandhi Park, where we meet. Meet with the victims of \nCastro's repression.\n  Well, President Obama responded by stating: ``No one should face \nharassment, arrest, or physical assault simply because they are \nexercising a universal right to have their voices heard.''\n  That is absolutely true.\n  And then he added that he would raise these issues directly with \ntheir oppressor, Raul Castro.\n  But once you have already embraced the oppressor of the Ladies in \nWhite and legitimized his regime on the world stage, what does this \nempty rhetoric and phrases matter to any of them?\n  In February 2015, Berta Soler testified before our House Committee on \nForeign Affairs, and she stated: ``Our demands are quite concrete: \nfreedom for political prisoners, recognition of civil society, the \nelimination of all criminal dispositions that penalize freedom of \nexpression and association, and the right of the Cuban people to choose \ntheir future through free, plural elections.''\n  Elections in Cuba? Fidel Castro famously said, elections for what? \nThey don't have any political system at all. There is only one party \nthat is allowed to operate; that is the Communist Party. They have \nselections, not elections.\n  The Cuban people deserve more than just lip service and platitudes \nfrom the White House. They are demanding actions and reforms in Cuba to \nunclench the fist of the Castro control.\n  But solely a meeting with Cuban civil society is a very low bar, Mr. \nSpeaker. It is not enough to help the Cuban people, especially after \nshaking the hand of a murderous tyrant like Raul Castro.\n  However, even this meeting with civil society is being undermined by \nCastro's thugs, even this low bar. Gee, if I just meet with \ndissidents--check off the list--then my trip will have been a success.\n  Many civil society members have stated that they are now under house \narrest, as I speak, and that Castro's security agents are preventing \nthem from leaving their own homes until President Obama leaves Cuba.\n  In Cuba's communist newspaper, called Granma, the regime noted that \nPresident Obama's trip to Havana dispels the myth that human rights are \nbeing violated on the island. They are no fools. They understand the \nimage is worth a thousand words. The image of President Obama in Cuba \nsays no human rights are being violated. And the regime knows that all \nof the concessions that President Obama has given come with no strings \nattached.\n  I will end with this, Mr. Speaker:\n  No reforms are needed. No changes need to be made. In fact, the \nCastro regime has already stated that it will not change one bit after \nall of these concessions.\n  The Cuban people deserve better.\n  The American people deserve better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1467-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, after years of extreme drought, California \nis finally receiving, thanks to the Good Lord and Mother Nature, \nsignificant rain and snowfall, perhaps enough to return to near normal \nconditions.\n  However, despite continued mandatory statewide rationing, Federal \nagencies are still making decisions that result in the loss of massive \namounts of water that could be stored, or decisions that will be \nharmful to agriculture. Just 5 days ago, the Sacramento River ran so \nhigh that enough water to supply over 54,000 people for an entire year \nflowed past each hour.\n  While recent storms have improved our water supplies, our largest \nreservoirs are not yet full. They soon could be, but are not yet full. \nIt is precisely during these times that water agencies need to be very \ncautious and very careful in managing these water supplies so that, as \nour reservoirs do become full, we can carry through until maybe the \nnext drought.\n  So will they allow these reservoirs to become full, or will they let \nwater flow down because of bad flood data or fish needs?\n  We will see.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1468-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING BLEEDING DISORDERS AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize March \n2016 as Bleeding Disorders Awareness Month. This month marks the 30th \nanniversary of President Reagan's declaration of March 1986 as \nHemophilia Awareness Month.\n  One of the most troubling bleeding disorders is hemophilia. \nHemophilia affects roughly 20,000 people in the U.S. and 1 in 5,000 \nnewborns. Treating the disorder is complicated, as well as expensive, \nas there is no known cure, and treatment may cost $250,000 a year.\n  Another bleeding disorder is Von Willebrand disease, or VWD, which \nresults in bruising, nosebleeds, and excessive bleeding following \nsurgical procedures. VWD occurs equally in men and women and is \nestimated to affect more than 3 million Americans.\n  Through this greater awareness of bleeding disorders, we can work \ntoward earlier diagnoses and the prevention of complications, \nunnecessary procedures, and disabilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1468-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL SHINAY\n\n  (Mr. POLIQUIN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, our proud State of Maine has sent many \nhardworking, principled leaders to the national stage.\n  Senator Margaret Chase Smith brought common sense and courage to \nWashington as the first woman to serve in both the U.S. House and in \nthe Senate.\n  Now, many other Mainers have served our country with distinction, but \nhave seldom made the headlines.\n  Michael Shinay grew up in a middle class family in Waterville and was \na loyal alum of the University of Maine. He was an immensely talented \npublic servant who, every day, helped American families and businesses \nduring his 30 distinguished years at the U.S. Postal Service. Mike \nserved as postmaster in Burlington, Vermont, and in the Postmaster \nGeneral's Office here in Washington.\n  In 1992, Mr. Shinay accepted the thankless job of cleaning up the \ntheft and inside dealings right here at the House Post Office. He then \ncut costs and introduced new technology that streamlined this huge, \ncomplex mail system.\n  In 1999, Mike retired from the Postal Service and consulted on global \nmail systems to some of the world's most successful companies.\n  Two months ago, on January 23, Michael J. Shinay peacefully passed \naway, surrounded by his loving wife, Jeanne, of 39 years, and their two \nwonderful children, Katie and Jonathan. Two months ago, Maine and \nAmerica lost a cheerful, hardworking public servant, full of fairness, \nintegrity, and goodness.\n  We will miss Mike Shinay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1468-5", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING VALOR CHRISTIAN GIRLS SWIMMING AND DIVING TEAM\n\n  (Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Valor \nChristian High School's varsity girls swimming and diving team on their \n4A State championship win.\n  It was a thrilling win for Valor. The team scored 320 points to \ncatapult past their competitors in the quest for the State championship \ntitle.\n  Senior Brooke Stenstrom showed tremendous leadership and dedication \nin her record-breaking 50-yard freestyle, 100-yard freestyle, and 200 \nmedley relay, earning her the title of ``Swimmer of the Year'' in the \nState's 4A classification.\n  Freshman Abbie Erickson finished fourth in the diving portion of the \ncompetition, contributing to the team's total points and ultimate State \nwin.\n  Ms. Lori Stenstrom, the swim team's head coach, led a tremendous \neffort all season long to get the team ready for their State \nchampionship performance, earning her the title of ``Swimming Coach of \nthe Year.''\n  I am honored to congratulate these young women on their State \nchampionship win.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1468-6", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CUBAN PRO-DEMOCRACY LEADERS\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, Raul Castro's thugs arrested or \ndetained many Cuban pro-democracy leaders in anticipation of the \nPresident's time in Cuba.\n  Berta Soler, the leader of the Ladies in White, was detained; Antonio \nRodiles, detained; and some of these activists were invited to \nparticipate in the meeting with President Obama.\n  Antunez and his wife, Yris, arrested; musician Gorki Aguila, \narrested; former political prisoner Angel Moya, arrested. Pastor Mario \nFelix Lleonart Barroso was arrested yesterday.\n  The Castro brothers have shifted their strategy to a catch-and-\nrelease program to intimidate activists who have been placed under \nhouse arrest by the repressive apparatus of the regime.\n  President Obama says that human rights are important to him, but \nempty words with no actions to back them up send the message to the \nCastro regime to continue with his repression, and Castro continues to \ndo so.

Mr. Speaker, today, March 21, is World Down Syndrome \nDay. This internationally recognized event is set aside to raise public \nawareness of what Down syndrome is and about the important role that \npeople with Down syndrome play in our lives and our communities.\n  According to the National Down Syndrome Society, there are currently \nabout 400,000 people living with Down syndrome in the United States \nalone. These people are faced with elevated risks for many other health \nconditions and must confront obstacles every day of their lives.\n\n[[Page H1469]]\n\n  Organizations like the Upper Peninsula Down Syndrome Association in \nnorthern Michigan help to raise awareness of this condition. Through \nhosting events like the Buddy Walk, these organizations help to educate \nthe general public and raise funds for programs that benefit those \nliving with Down syndrome.\n  In my own life, my family and I are blessed to have my youngest \ngrandson, Archie, in our lives. We want Archie to have the ability and \nthe freedom to be the best Archie that he can be.\n  While we have made tremendous strides in helping those with Down \nsyndrome, it is my hope that we continue to improve the quality of life \nand the opportunity for kids like Archie.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1469-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEDIA SILENT ON LACK OF GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the media were quick to cover a \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration study last year where \nscientists altered global surface temperature data to try and refute \nthe two-decade halt in global warming. The LA Times, The New York \nTimes, and USA Today all headlined NOAA's announcement that there was \nnot a halt in global warming.\n  However, a new peer-reviewed study, published in the journal Nature, \nconfirms the halt in global warming. According to one of the study's \nlead authors, it ``essentially refutes'' NOAA's study. But the many \nwell-respected scientists and their findings were ignored by much of \nthe national media, including those that had previously reported there \nnever was a halt in global warming.\n  Americans deserve all the facts that surround climate change, not \njust those that fit the view the liberal national media wants to \npromote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1469-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RED TIE CHALLENGE FOR BLEEDING DISORDERS AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. LONG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to take the National Hemophilia \nFoundation's Bleeding Disorders Awareness Month Red Tie Challenge, in \nrecognition of more than 3 million Americans who suffer with \ndebilitating bleeding disorders like hemophilia or Von Willebrand \ndisease, which prevent blood from clotting naturally.\n  It is currently estimated that more than 400,000 people worldwide \nsuffer from hemophilia alone, and 75 percent of them either lack \nadequate treatment or have no access to treatment.\n  Also, Von Willebrand disease occurs genetically and is believed to be \nthe most common bleeding disorder. It is estimated to affect 1 percent \nof the United States population.\n  If these problems are not treated effectively, these problems can \nresult in extended bleeding after injuries, surgery, or trauma, and can \nbe fatal for those suffering with them.\n  This March is the first Bleeding Disorders Awareness Month, which \nfurther underscores the need for legislation like the 21st Century \nCures package, which will spur greater medical research and innovation \nwhen it becomes law.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow colleagues to also take the Red Tie \nChallenge so these millions of Americans suffering with bleeding \ndisorders will be helped.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1469-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1415\n      REMEMBERING ELIZABETH GARRETT, CORNELL UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT\n\n  (Mr. REED asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the measure before the House today directs the Architect \nof the Capitol to obtain a chair featuring the logo of the National \nLeague of POW/MIA Families and to prominently place it on display in \nthe U.S. Capitol.\n  As Members of Congress, certainly we each represent diverse \ncongressional districts, but one of the things that ties us together \nare the many brave men and women we represent who stood on the battle \nlines in defense of our Nation's freedom, our liberty, and our way of \nlife.\n  This legislation introduced by our colleague, Representative Stephen \nLynch of Massachusetts, honors American prisoners of war and Americans \nmissing in action. The chair will serve as a permanent reminder of the \nenormous sacrifice made by those who served our country and were taken \nas POWs or listed as MIA.\n  The importance of remembering and honoring their great sacrifice can \nnever be overstated. Our Nation has a responsibility to them and to \ntheir families who have shared in their sacrifice, and we must never \nforget.\n  Our heroes deserve to be honored, especially in the U.S. Capitol, \nwhich is itself a symbol of our American beliefs and the liberties and \nfreedoms that they sacrificed to defend.\n  This chair will honor veterans like Sam Johnson, one of our \ncolleagues here in the House. Sam is one of the most stalwart \nprotectors of those who have served and who himself endured nearly 7 \nyears as a POW, including 42 months in solitary confinement, in the \ninfamous Hanoi Hilton.\n  Forty-three years ago Sam Johnson returned to the United States to be \nreunited with his loved ones, and we are so honored to have the \nprivilege to serve with him today here in this House.\n  In addition to Sam Johnson, Mr. Speaker, when I think about the \nmeaning behind this memorial, I think about an individual who lives in \nmy district. His first name is Donald, but we all call him Digger, \nDigger O'Dell.\n  Digger enlisted in 1952 into the Air Force. He was shot down in \nOctober of 1967, and he, like Sam, was a prisoner in the Hanoi Hilton, \nin Digger's case, for 5\\1/2\\ years.\n  Thankfully, Digger made it home, as Sam did, after all of those years \nin a North Vietnamese camp. He is now in his eighties and serves as a \nmember of our local air base community council and chairs a fundraising \nevent for the Special Olympics. Digger is a remarkable man. He is one \nof many who selflessly served our Nation facing enormous adversity.\n  I might even mention my husband, who was a fighter pilot and is a \nproud member of Vietnam Veterans of America and is now a proud member \nof Chapter 154 of the VVA in Macomb County, which is actually one the \nlargest chapters in our entire Nation.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, these heroes who so bravely served our Nation \ndeserve to be honored, especially in the U.S. Capitol, and certainly \nthis chair with the MIA/POW logo on it will forever demonstrate that we \nwill never forget.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Michigan for her \nkind words in support of this bill.\n  And I want to thank Mr. Brady, the ranking member on the House \nAdministration Committee, for his support as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1670, the National \nPOW/MIA Remembrance Act. Before I begin, I want to thank House \nAdministration for their great support and staff support as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill actually comes from the recognition we all \nshare that, in our country, oftentimes the families of POWs and MIAs \nsuffer alone.\n  And it is through the efforts of groups like Rolling Thunder and \nother veterans' groups who have brought to the forefront the fact that \nwe should carry more immediately the memory of the sacrifice of those \nfamilies.\n  In my own life, I came to know a man named James Fitzgerald, who was \na member of Operating Engineers Local 4 in Boston. I worked on a job \nwith him. I remember at noontime, when everyone would go off to lunch, \nhe would go off into his pickup truck and eat his sandwich by himself.\n  Day after day in his lap he would have a tri-corner flag that this \ncountry gave him in remembrance of his son, who went down as a result \nof enemy fire in Vietnam in the early 1960s.\n  It was not until the late 1980s, early 1990s, that his son was \nactually recovered, returned to his family, and buried in \nMassachusetts. For many, many years, the Fitzgerald family carried that \nburden by themselves. They carried it alone.\n  I had a chance to travel with JPAC, the Joint POW/MIA Accounting \nCommand, to Vietnam, to Korea, and to the South Pacific, the \nPhilippines.\n  We have 83,000--83,000--men and women from this country that died in \nthe Second World War, in Korea, and in Vietnam who are still there.\n  About 1,000 remain in Vietnam. About 5,000 remain in North Korea up \naround the Chosin Reservoir. And then the great majority of those MIA \nare buried at sea as a result of the great naval battles in World War \nII. They are buried in place, and their resting places are our sacred \nground.\n\n  We have an opportunity here to place within the Capitol a \nremembrance, a shrine, in effect, to their sacrifice in remembrance of \ntheir service to this country. H.R. 1670 would honor them by \nauthorizing a placement of a POW/MIA Chair of Honor on the grounds of \nthe United States Capitol.\n  That chair will forever stand unoccupied as a solemn reminder of the \nover 83,000 brave Americans from as far back as World War II who are \nstill waiting to be brought home.\n  Chairs of honor carrying the POW/MIA insignia have already been \nplaced in public spaces in cities and towns around the country. It is \nonly fitting that the Capitol, the seat of the U.S. Congress, should do \nso as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, when our fellow Americans go to war, we make them a \npromise never to leave them behind. That vow is sacred. When we pass \nthis chair every day, we will be reminded of our commitment to our POW/\nMIAs and their families that we have not forgotten them, we will never \nforget them, and we will not rest until they all come home.\n\n[[Page H1471]]\n\n  I want to take a moment to thank Joe D'Entremont, who first \napproached me about undertaking this initiative a couple of years ago. \nHe is a past president of Rolling Thunder of Massachusetts Chapter 1 \nand is now a Rolling Thunder, Incorporated, National member.\n  I want to thank all the members from all the chapters of Rolling \nThunder from across the country who have kept this idea alive.\n  Joe D'Entremont is a passionate advocate on behalf of our veterans \nand our POWs and MIAs. Joe has worked with my office from the very \nbeginning on this effort.\n  I also want to thank Gus Dante, also with Rolling Thunder National, \nwho has worked steadfastly at Joe's side to see this through.\n  Finally, I want to thank the members of Rolling Thunder Massachusetts \nChapter 1 and all of the Rolling Thunder chapters around the Nation. \nTheir efforts were integral to bringing us here today.\n  After today, H.R. 1670 will move to the Senate for its consideration. \nI want to recognize and thank my Massachusetts colleague, Senator \nElizabeth Warren, for introducing her Senate companion bill and for \nmaking this truly a bicameral effort.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with her to get this past the \nfinish line and have the National POW/MIA Remembrance Act signed into \nlaw.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker.)\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1670, the National POW/\nMIA Remembrance Act of 2015, which would direct the Architect of the \nCapitol to place a commemorative chair paid for by private donations in \nthe United States Capitol to honor American prisoners of war and those \nmissing in action. This bill is a way to acknowledge and remember those \nwho have paid the ultimate sacrifice for our country.\n  One of the groups supporting this bill is the Rolling Thunder, as was \njust mentioned. The mission of the Rolling Thunder is to educate the \npublic of the American prisoners of war who were left behind. I am \nhappy to state that this bill is not a cost to the American taxpayers.\n  In coordination with the Rolling Thunder, I have also introduced H. \nRes. 590, which calls for a selective committee on POW and MIA affairs.\n  As a minister for nearly two decades, I can tell you that these \nsituations are sometimes not always resolved, but the closure that it \nprovides and benefits to the families is immeasurable.\n  I am proud to once again stand with my colleagues today in honoring \nour brave men and women.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I thank the chairwoman for her \nwillingness to put such a wonderful piece of legislation forward, \nsomething that truly should be unanimous in its bipartisan support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also rise in strong support of H.R. 1670, the National \nPOW/MIA Remembrance Act. This bipartisan bill, as many of those who \nhave spoken before me have said, authorizes the placement of a \ncommemorative chair on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol that is going to \nbe a reminder to all of us of the great sacrifice that our brave men \nand women in uniform have made to keep our country safe and promote our \nvalues around the globe.\n  These commemorative chairs, which carry the POW/MIA insignia and are \npurchased with privately raised funds, remain perpetually unoccupied as \na solemn reminder of the 91,000 brave servicemembers still waiting to \nbe brought home.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is truly an honor for me to be able to serve with \nsome in this institution who were POWs and made it home. They need to \nbe commended for their service, like Congressman Sam Johnson from \nTexas, who spent way too many months--48, I believe, to be exact--as a \nguest at the Hanoi Hilton.\n  He was able to make it home. But so many more--so many more--families \nexperience tragic losses because they never know what happened to their \nfamily members.\n  Mr. Speaker, ensuring that our veterans are properly cared for is one \nof my top priorities as a Member of this great institution.\n  And while the Veterans Administration continues to require \nsignificant reforms, having a commemorative chair in the Capitol will \nremind all Members--all Members--of this great institution of the \ncommitments we have made to those who have fought so hard and ensure \nthat we hold the VA accountable for their actions, too.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1670 so that \nfamilies of POW/MIA servicemembers know also that the United States \nwill never forget the sacrifices their loved ones who served this \ncountry with such valor and honor made.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me just say, in support of H.R. 1670, I do want to \nshare in the acknowledgment of Sam Johnson's service and sacrifice on \nbehalf of this country.\n  In fairness, I have to say that, when we went to the Hanoi Hilton, \nthey did have a reconstructed version of what Senator John McCain went \nthrough in Hanoi. It is a sanitized version of what he suffered there, \nbut I also want to recognize his service. He is truly an American hero \nas well.\n  I thank my Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle for \ntheir support. I am glad we can work on this together. I think we owe \nit to all our MIA and POWs and their families to get this done.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1670.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I conclude, I just want to reiterate again that these \nbrave men and women who served as POWs or those missing in action are \nour Nation's patriots and heroes, and they certainly do deserve to be \nhonored. I am just proud to be a part of this effort to install this \nfitting memorial recognizing those who sacrificed so that we could all \nbe free.\n  I certainly want to thank our colleague from Massachusetts, Stephen \nLynch, who introduced this bill. He came to me and asked that we would \nwork together on this.\n  I am delighted to do so because there is absolutely nothing more \nbipartisan and important, I think, than how we remember our veterans \nand those who are currently serving as well. This is a very, very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to join us in passing \nthis measure today.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1670, \n``National POW/MIA Remembrance Act of 2015'' which directs the \nArchitect of the Capitol to place in the United States Capitol a chair \nhonoring American Prisoners of War/Missing in Action.\n  I support this legislation sponsored by Congressman Stephen Lynch of \nMassachusetts, because all soldiers should be commemorated for their \nheroic efforts.\n  This important bill directs the Architect of the Capitol to enter \ninto an agreement to obtain a chair featuring the logo of the National \nLeague of POW/MIA Families, and place it in the U.S. Capitol in a \nsuitable permanent location within two years after enactment of this \nAct.\n  The Architect of the Capitol may enter into an agreement with any \ntax-exempt, charitable organization to solicit private donations to \ncarry out this Act; and accept resulting donations of funds, property, \nand services.\n  An astonishing 83,000 American service personnel are still missing in \naction--from previous wars--and 142,233 Americans have been Prisoners \nof War (POW).\n  Thankfully, revolutionary new communications, information management \nand surveillance technologies, the total dominance of the air \ndimension, better training, and the nature of the adversary and \ngeography has halted the increase of POWs and soldiers missing in \naction.\n  It is our duty as Americans to remember those who have bravely fought \nfor our beloved country.\n  Having this chair at our Nation's capital will serve as a continuous \nreminder that our freedom was fought for.\n\n[[Page H1472]]\n\n  This bipartisan bill stands as a testament that our soldiers should \nbe honored for their efforts in protecting our freedom and rights as \nAmericans.\n  Our nation has a proud legacy of appreciation and commitment to the \nmen and women who have worn the uniform in defense of this country but \nfor those who never reunite with their families it is our duty as \ncitizens to keep their memory alive.\n  I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 1670.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 1670.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1472-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1472-H1480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            OLDER AMERICANS ACT REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida.

In developing the guidance, the Assistant \n     Secretary for Aging shall consult with experts and \n     organizations serving Holocaust survivors, and shall take \n     into account the possibility that the needs of Holocaust \n     survivors may differ based on geography.\n       (b) Contents.--The guidance shall include the following:\n       (1) How nutrition service providers may meet the special \n     health-related or other dietary needs of participants in \n     programs under the Older Americans Act of 1965, including \n     needs based on religious, cultural, or ethnic requirements.\n       (2) How transportation service providers may address the \n     urgent transportation needs of Holocaust survivors.\n       (3) How State long-term care ombudsmen may address the \n     unique needs of residents of long-term care facilities for \n     whom institutional settings may produce sights, sounds, \n     smells, emotions, and routines, that can induce panic, \n     anxiety, and retraumatization as a result of experiences from \n     the Holocaust.\n       (4) How supportive services providers may consider the \n     unique needs of Holocaust survivors.\n       (5) How other services provided under that Act, as \n     determined by the Assistant Secretary for Aging, may serve \n     Holocaust survivors.\n       (c) Date of Issuance.--The guidance described in subsection \n     (a) shall be issued not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Curbelo) and the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on S. 192.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I rise today in strong support of S. 192, the Older Americans Act \nReauthorization Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, for decades, the Older Americans Act has been a vital \nresource for the Nation's seniors. It established and has sustained a \nnumber of services, including nutrition services, family caregiver \nsupport, community service employment, and elder abuse prevention.\n  These and other services have allowed seniors to stay active and \nindependent. They have helped them live healthy, independent lives in \ntheir homes and their communities, and in many cases, they have enabled \nolder Americans to remain out of institutional care.\n  This bill updates and improves the law to ensure it continues to \nserve a senior population that has changed significantly since the \nOlder Americans Act was first enacted more than 50 years ago.\n  One of the hallmarks of the original law--and something that this \nreauthorization maintains and strengthens--is the flexibility it \nprovides States and local entities to serve the specific needs of \nseniors in their communities. This bipartisan legislation maintains \nthat strong commitment to State and local control and makes a number of \ncommonsense reforms to the law.\n  For example, the bill includes specific measures to better protect \nseniors from abuse and neglect. Among those measures is a provision to \nstrengthen a program designed to investigate and resolve complaints \nfrom residents of nursing home facilities and other adult care homes. \nIt also clarifies responsibilities related to the development and \nimplementation of programs related to the health and economic welfare \nof older individuals.\n  The bill also continues support for Senior Medicare Patrol, a program \nthat helps train senior volunteers to prevent and identify healthcare \nfraud and abuse. Congress should continue to fund this important \ninitiative because it is good for seniors and it helps save taxpayer \ndollars by protecting the integrity of healthcare programs.\n  Additionally, this legislation improves alignment between existing \nprograms designed to provide employment and community service \nopportunities to older Americans. It simplifies and clarifies how \nservices are funded and includes responsible and defined authorization \nlevels.\n  These are just a few of the important changes and updates this bill \nmakes, in addition to the many vital services it continues, to help \nseniors age with dignity and independence.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the reauthorization of the Older \nAmericans Act.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to start by thanking Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott \nfor working to bring this important legislation to the floor today. \nReauthorizing the Older Americans Act has been one of my top \npriorities. Over the years, I have sponsored legislation to strengthen \nessential programs that help keep seniors healthy and independent. \nSeniors in Oregon and across the country know how important the Older \nAmericans Act programs are, so I have met with them to discuss ideas \nfor improving the law, and I have advocated for funding for Older \nAmericans Act programs and services.\n  All along, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been \ncommitted to reauthorizing this important law.\n  On behalf of seniors across the country, I thank my colleagues for \ntheir support for this legislation before the House--a 3-year \nreauthorization of the Older Americans Act.\n  I also want to thank the advocacy community and service delivery \ngroups for their ongoing support for a strong, bipartisan \nreauthorization. Backing from a wide range of groups that are dedicated \nto the well-being of America's seniors helped make possible the \nlegislation we are considering today.\n  Every day in our country, about 10,000 people turn 65. As the \npopulation of older adults continues to grow, we have a responsibility, \nas policymakers, to reevaluate and bolster the programs that keep \nseniors healthy, active, and engaged in their communities. The \nlegislation we are considering will help older Americans from all \nbackgrounds lead meaningful lives with dignity by continuing to support \nthe delivery of health, transportation, and nutrition services to \nseniors in every State.\n  This legislation includes modest increases in authorization levels, \nbuilding on the amounts appropriated in the Fiscal Year 2016 Omnibus \nAppropriations Act. Investments for currently funded Older Americans \nAct programs are overdue and will help meet the growing demand placed \non these programs and services.\n  Increasing investments in programs like Meals on Wheels, which serves \nthousands of seniors, many of whom are homebound or low-income, will \nallow more adults to stay in their homes, where they can remain \nconnected to their communities and avoid costlier long-term care.\n  For many adults, the hot meal they get from Meals on Wheels is the \nonly one they will get that day. The volunteers who deliver the meal \nmay provide their only social interaction, which is important for all \nseniors, but especially for those in isolated or rural areas.\n  Significantly, this legislation provides tools to curb both financial \nand physical elder abuse by promoting proven strategies for responding \nto elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation.\n  According to the Elder Justice Coalition, there are more than 6 \nmillion victims of elder abuse every year--roughly 1 out of every 10 \npeople over age 60. According to the National Center on Elder Abuse, \nvictims of elder financial abuse lose an estimated $2.9 billion a year, \nand too often they lose their entire life savings. I am pleased that \nthis legislation continues to address the problem of elder abuse and \ntakes steps to make sure older adults are not robbed of their resources \nor denied the dignity they deserve.\n  In addition, my colleague from Florida has expressed support for the \nSenior Medicare Patrol, a program that helps train senior volunteers to \nprevent and identify healthcare fraud and\n\n[[Page H1478]]\n\nabuse. I want to reiterate support for this program and note that the \nEducation and the Workforce Committee supports full funding for this \nimportant initiative, which should not come at the expense of funding \nother programs.\n  The Senior Medicare Patrol saves taxpayer dollars by protecting the \nintegrity of healthcare programs. The return on investment for Older \nAmericans Act programs is undeniable, and this is certainly the case \nfor Senior Medicare Patrol as well.\n  Americans are living longer, more productive lives, and our policies \nneed to keep pace. Older adults should not have to struggle to afford \nreliable transportation, nutritious food, and high-quality supportive \nservices. Congress will need to continue to invest in and modernize \nservices for seniors so all older adults, including LGBT elders and \nolder individuals from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, have \naccess to programs that keep them healthy and engaged in their \ncommunities.\n  This legislation is an important step forward. I am glad that \nCongress is coming together today with bipartisan support to recognize \nthe valuable role that Older Americans Act programs play across the \ncountry. These programs work. Reauthorizing them means that America's \nseniors and their caregivers will continue to receive the services, \nresources, and support they need.\n  Mr. Speaker, the reauthorization we are considering today is an \nimportant way to recognize that in the United States of America, our \nseniors--our parents and grandparents across the country--deserve to \nlive healthy, fulfilling lives and live them with dignity.\n  I, again, thank Ranking Member Scott and Chairman Kline for their \nleadership. I also want to thank the hardworking staff on both sides of \nthe aisle for their dedication to improving the lives of all Americans.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline), the distinguished chairman of the \nCommittee on Education and the Workforce, who has worked tirelessly on \nthis reauthorization.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.\n  I rise today in strong support of this legislation reauthorizing the \nOlder Americans Act.\n  Since it was first enacted, this act has been a vital resource for \nAmerica's seniors and their caregivers. Through a wide range of \nservices, it has helped older individuals enjoy their independence and \nstay active, both in their homes and in their communities.\n  However, much has changed in the last 50 years. Today, Americans are \nliving longer, and the senior population is significantly larger and \nmore independent than it once was. What hasn't changed is the \nresponsibility we have to take care of our seniors. That is why, in \naddition to continuing the vital support established by the Older \nAmericans Act, this reauthorization makes a number of important \nimprovements to ensure the law is still providing the kind of help \nAmerican seniors need.\n  First, it provides better protections for our most vulnerable \nseniors. The bill promotes best practices for responding to abuse, \nneglect, and exploitation, strengthens protections for all residents of \nlong-term care facilities, and improves the coordination of activities \nbetween State and local aging offices.\n  Other important updates include measures to streamline and improve \nhow the programs under the law are administered. Too often taxpayer \ndollars go to programs that are outdated, ineffective, or simply not \nbeing used as they could be. That is why this bill streamlines programs \nand makes improvements to ensure program coordination and efficiency.\n  The legislation also makes changes to nutrition services programs to \naccount for geographic changes in the senior population.\n  Furthermore, the bill better aligns job training services for older \nAmericans with the broader workforce development system. In 2014, \nCongress passed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to provide \na more efficient, streamlined workforce training system that would help \nput Americans back to work. This legislation builds on that law by \nproviding seniors access to a less confusing and more seamless \nworkforce development system.\n  These are just some of the things this bill does to better serve \nthose individuals the law is intended to support. We have made a \ncommitment to help those who want and deserve to enjoy independence and \ncontribute to their communities as they grow older. This bill will help \nensure that we are not only honoring that commitment, but that we are \nhonoring it well.\n  In closing, I want to thank my colleagues--Representatives Carlos \nCurbelo, Virginia Foxx, Suzanne Bonamici, and Ruben Hinojosa--for their \ncontinued leadership on this issue and in helping move this important \npiece of legislation forward. We are grateful for their efforts.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member of the Committee on Education \nand the Workforce.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the \nlegislation today, which provides for a 3-year reauthorization of the \nOlder Americans Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Committee on Education and the Workforce has been \ncommitted to seeing this legislation through. I want to particularly \nthank, on our side, the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. \nHinojosa, and Representative Bonamici. I want to thank them and \nChairman Kline, Representative Curbelo, and all of the members of our \ncommittee, for making the passage of this bill a reality.\n  As ranking member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, I \nhave the privilege of working on legislation that affects Americans \nthroughout their lives, from childhood into advanced age. The Older \nAmericans Act was first passed 50 years ago as part of President \nJohnson's War on Poverty to help older Americans live in dignity and \nstay connected to their communities by receiving essential social and \nnutrition services.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Today, the commitment to our Nation's seniors is more important than \never. One in 10 Americans over the age of 65 lives in poverty, and \nolder Americans are also working longer--some because they want to but \nmany because they have to so that they can secure their financial \nfutures in the face of retirement insecurity. The spectrum of services \nprovided through the Older Americans Act, in conjunction with Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security, ensures that our Nation's older \nAmericans are not left behind in their golden years.\n  The Pew Research Center reports that the elderly population is \nexpected to double by 2015, and without meaningful investments in \nservices for our seniors, too many Americans who have worked hard all \nof their lives will be left struggling in their later years.\n  Unfortunately, since 2009, the Older Americans Act's funding has \nactually dropped. Failing to invest in the Older Americans Act is bad \nfor seniors, and it is bad for our country. Providing our seniors with \nhealth services, nutrition, and the supportive services they need makes \nthem less likely to suffer illness or injury, less likely to incur \nexpensive hospital visits, and more likely to live independently. These \ninvestments bring dignity to the lives of our seniors, and they, \nultimately, will result in a significant savings to taxpayers.\n  I am proud that we were able to agree on increased funding for these \nimportant programs. Had our investments in these programs kept up with \ninflation and the growing population, the funding levels would have \nactually been higher, but, thankfully, we can finally say that we are \nmoving in the right direction.\n  Vice President Hubert Humphrey once stated that the moral test of \ngovernment is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of \nlife, our children; those who are in the twilight of life, our elderly; \nand those who are in the shadows of life. It is my hope that, by \nprotecting and enhancing the Federal statutes to support our older \nAmericans, we will be passing this test.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their support of this legislation.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n\n[[Page H1479]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nthe great State of Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for her work, \nand thank the subcommittee chair and chair regarding this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I might be the only Member of Congress who has ever \nworked under the Older Americans Act. Another young man and I--\nobviously, many years ago--started the first Senior Companion Program \nin region 6, the Pacific Northwest.\n  These employment programs are fabulous. There are two things that we \nneed to keep in mind for seniors. The first is the vulnerability of \nmany: the economic vulnerability, the nutritional vulnerability, their \nmedical vulnerability, and the needs that have to be served there. The \nother is that a lot of people are retired--over the age of 60--who \nstill have a tremendous amount to contribute to this country.\n  Through the Older Americans Act and these Senior Community Service \nEmployment Programs, we are, actually, utilizing their talents. The \nparticular program I ran employed 60 low-income seniors to go out and \nwork in the community with other even more vulnerable seniors, who were \nin their homes, in order to try and keep them in their homes, to keep \nthem independent--a better quality of life for them and a heck of a \nsavings for the taxpayer--because nobody can afford nursing homes in \nAmerica except the richest among us. Inevitably, when seniors have to \ngo into nursing homes, they are going to end up on Medicaid at some \npoint, which is very expensive. So, if we can keep them at home, they \nare happier, and we save money.\n  On the other vulnerabilities, nutritional vulnerability is the \nlargest bulk. The single largest category under the Older Americans Act \ngoes to the nutrition programs, which are the senior Congregate Meal \nsites and the Meals on Wheels. I would urge anybody who is not \nparticularly familiar with these programs to go to one or the other and \nsee how important this is to so many millions of older Americans every \nyear. Often, the only time they will see other people in a day is if \nthey are at the senior Congregate Meal sites or if they are at home and \nsomeone shows up with Meals on Wheels. I have delivered Meals on Wheels \nand have seen seniors, basically, just cry to be getting a little bit \nof attention at home and getting a meal that will get them through the \nday.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. It is wonderful that we are reauthorizing this, but the \nfunding levels are inadequate. If you look at it over time, the senior \npopulation has grown dramatically, and those in need have grown \ndramatically; yet the funding, if you look back 10 years or so, in \nadjusted dollars, is actually less today. It is great we are \nreauthorizing it, but we do need to look for more funding.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Peters).\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, in San Diego and across the country, seniors \ndepend on the programs for health care, for meals, and for other \nessential services that are included in the Older Americans Act. These \nprograms help ensure that our seniors age successfully and with \ndignity.\n  Serving Seniors, which is here today from San Diego to support the \nreauthorization of the Older Americans Act, will be able to continue to \nprovide meals and other services to seniors at the Gary and Mary West \nCenter. Meals-on-Wheels of Greater San Diego will have the certainty \nthat it needs to keep delivering meals to seniors in their homes, and \nthe County of San Diego will have more resources and information to \ncombat elder abuse.\n\n  Together, we will continue to hold senior scam seminars in San Diego \nto equip members of our senior community with the tools they need to \navoid being scammed. For many seniors, an important part of aging with \ndignity is having the support of caregivers in their families. \nImproving the National Family Caregiver Support Program will continue \nto give these caregivers a network of information and services to care \nfor their loved ones.\n  As an active member of the House Seniors Task Force, I am committed \nto protecting the viability of Medicare and Social Security, which \nseniors have earned over lifetimes of hard work. By preventing Medicare \nfraud and abuse, this legislation will save on long-term costs and help \nkeep Medicare viable.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for seniors and support the passage \nof the bipartisan Older Americans Act. I thank leadership on both sides \nof the aisle for working on this.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In the United States, its population of older adults is projected to \nincrease from approximately 57 million people, who were aged 60 and \nolder in 2010, to about 76 million older adults by our next census in \n2020. Despite the rapid rise in the population of seniors and the \ngrowing strain that has been placed on important services for older \nindividuals, Congress allowed the Older Americans Act to expire in \n2011. Fortunately, today, the House has the opportunity to pass a \nreauthorization of the Older Americans Act, and it is not a moment too \nsoon.\n  This legislation increases the Federal investment in Older Americans \nAct programs, which serve millions of seniors in towns, in cities, and \nin rural areas across the United States. Reauthorizing these programs \nmeans that older adults will continue to receive nutritious meals, \nlegal assistance, preventative health care, and other essential \nservices that make it possible for them to live independently and to \nage with dignity.\n  I agree with my colleague from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) that, if one \nhasn't been to one of these programs, one should definitely go and \nspend some time with the people who are receiving these services. It is \nvery meaningful. It changes their lives.\n  I also thank my friend and colleague from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) as \nwell as Ranking Member Scott and Chairman Kline for their commitment to \nAmerica's seniors.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan \nmeasure to reauthorize the Older Americans Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  The important services that are provided by the Older Americans Act \nhelp us to achieve a goal that we can all get behind--that of \nsupporting the country's seniors in helping them maintain the active, \nproductive lives they desire. As I see it, that is not just a goal--it \nis our responsibility. The seniors we are talking about are veterans, \nparents, grandparents, teachers, caregivers, laborers, job creators. \nThey are individuals who have worked hard all of their lives, who have \nhelped this country grow and expand, and who, in a lot of ways, have \nsupported many of us throughout our own lives.\n  It is now on us to help support them in their senior years. This \nreauthorization will do just that, which is why it has support from \nMembers on both sides of the aisle and from nearly 50 groups, including \nthe AARP, the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, Meals on \nWheels America, and the National Association of States United for Aging \nand Disabilities.\n  It will enable older Americans to remain independent, to continue \ncontributing to their communities, and to remain in their homes with \ntheir families and among their friends. Many seniors are fortunate \nenough to have loved ones who are already helping them stay active and \nwho are already looking out for their best interests. Unfortunately, \nthere are many seniors who are not so fortunate. This bipartisan bill \nwill help those individuals live out their years with dignity whether \nthey are in their homes or in long-term care facilities. I believe that \nis an effort we can all support.\n  I thank Chairman Kline, Ranking Member Scott, and my friend and \ncolleague from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici). This is a wonderful model for \nbipartisan work--for working together--to help vulnerable people in our \ncountry.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the \nHouse Amendment\n\n[[Page H1480]]\n\nto S. 192, the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2015. It has \nbeen nearly ten years since Congress last reauthorized the Older \nAmericans Act (OAA), making today's amendment and the reforms in the \nunderlying bill long overdue.\n  Last year marked the 50th Anniversary of the OAA and its many social \nservices and programs that continue to provide a critical safety net \nfor seniors around the country. This includes supportive services, \nnutrition services--whether at group sites or home-delivered programs \nsuch as ``meals on wheels''--family caregiver support, community \nservice employment, and services to protect seniors from and prevent \nabuse, neglect, and exploitation.\n  In New Jersey, the Department of Human Services Division of Aging \nServices uses OAA funds to serve more than 500,000 individuals. From \n2000 to 2010, New Jersey saw a 15 percent increase in individuals age \n60 and older, representing 19 percent of the state population. By 2030, \nit is projected that those 60 and older will represent over 25 percent \nof the state population, making OAA services and programs more critical \nthan ever.\n  Among many reforms, S. 192 contains provisions to reduce elder abuse, \nneglect, and exploitation in long term facilities, improve federal \ncollaboration with state and local agencies and service providers on \nthe modernization of senior centers, and improve care coordination for \nthose with multiple chronic conditions with services through health \ncare entities such as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs).\n  It reforms funding allocations to ensure that money follows the \nperson, helping maximize the number of seniors reached by the OAA's \nservices and programs. It permits state grant programs to begin \nproviding support services for chronic condition self-care management \nand falls prevention. It also requires states to utilize a dietician in \nits nutrition projects and encourage the use of locally grown foods--as \nwell as partnerships and contracts with local producers and providers--\nin meal programs.\n  The ad-hoc means of funding these programs over the last several \nyears has made them less secure and efficient. As our population ages, \nit is imperative that we preserve access to these and other services \nthat enable senior citizens to live healthy and productive lives, and \ngive seniors the security and confidence they need when planning for \ntheir future medical care and financial security. Today's vote will \nprotect and improve OAA's vital programs to assist and protect older \nAmericans, allowing them to maintain their independence and quality of \nlife during retirement.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 192, the \n``Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2015,'' which amends the \nOlder Americans Act of 1965 (OAA), to require the Director of the \nOffice of Long-Term Care Ombudsman Programs to collect and analyze best \npractices to prevent and respond to elder abuse, neglect, and \nexploitation in long-term care facilities, and to publish a report to \ndocument best practices to achieve these goals.\n  S. 192 also requires the administration to provide information and \ntechnical assistance to State and local agencies on aging as well as \nservice providers.\n  S. 192 also mandates the development of a consumer-friendly tool to \nassist older individuals and their families in choosing home and \ncommunity-based services, with a particular focus on ways for consumers \nto assess how providers protect the health, safety, welfare, and rights \nof older individuals.\n  S. 192 directs the administration to ensure that programs authorized \nunder the OAA include training in the prevention of abuse, neglect, and \nexploitation and provision of services that address elder justice and \nexploitation of older individuals.\n  S. 192 also reauthorizes appropriations for specified supportive \nservices, congregate nutrition services, home delivered nutrition \nservices, disease prevention, health promotion services, and family \ncaregiver support.\n  Mr. Speaker, S. 192 will increase public awareness of elder abuse, \nneglect, and exploitation, and remove barriers to education, \nprevention, investigation, and treatment of elder abuse, neglect, and \nexploitation.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has been noted often that the moral test of \ngovernment is how it treats those in the dawn of life, our children; \nthose in the shadows of life, the sick and infirm; and those in the \ntwilight of life, the elderly.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 192 because it makes a significant \ncontribution to meeting our obligations to our senior citizens who have \ndone so much to make our country great.\n  Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the \nHouse amendment to S. 192, Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of \n2015, which passed by unanimous consent in the Senate. I commend my \nchairman, Mr. Kline, and Ranking Member Scott for their leadership and \nbringing this bill to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, about one (1) in every seven (7) Americans or 14 percent \nof the population is considered an ``Older American''--aged 65 or \nolder. As more ``baby boomers'' enter retirement, it is critical for \nCongress to update this law as the major vehicle for the delivery of \nsocial and nutritional programs for older persons and their \ncaregivers--and to help seniors maintain their independence and \ndignity.\n  According to a national survey of Older Americans Act participants, \n91 percent indicated that the home-delivery nutrition program helped \nthem stay in their own home. Additionally, 60 percent of participants \nindicated that a single home-delivered meal provided one-half or more \nof their total food for the day.\n  In my Congressional District, access to these transportation services \nis sometimes the only way our seniors can go to the doctor's office or \nto the grocery store. I am pleased that this bill also provides \ncommunity service employment, adult day care, respite care, \ntransportation services, legal assistance, long-term care and a range \nof programs protecting the rights of vulnerable seniors from fraud and \nexploitation.\n  For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to vote for the House amendment to S. 192. America's \nseniors deserve nothing less.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 192, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1480-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1480-H1484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COUNTERTERRORISM SCREENING AND ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill \n(H.R. 4314) to require a plan to combat international travel by \nterrorists and foreign fighters, accelerate the transfer of certain \nborder security systems to foreign partner governments, establish \nminimum international border security standards, authorize the \nsuspension of foreign assistance to countries not making significant \nefforts to comply with such minimum standards, and for other purposes, \nas amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4314\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Counterterrorism Screening \n     and Assistance Act of 2016''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FOREIGN PARTNER ENGAGEMENT PLAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the final report of the \n     Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives bipartisan ``Task Force on Combating \n     Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel'', Congress makes the \n     following findings:\n       (1) It is important for the national security of the United \n     States to assist foreign partners in closing security gaps \n     which may allow terrorists and foreign fighters to travel \n     internationally, avoiding detection.\n       (2) Building foreign partner capacity to combat terrorist \n     travel helps extend the United States security beyond its \n     border to mitigate threats before they reach the United \n     States.\n       (3) United States Government departments and agencies have \n     spent billions of dollars to help foreign partners improve \n     their security against terrorist travel since the attacks of \n     September 11, 2001, including through the provision of \n     technical assistance, equipment, training, and other tools.\n       (4) The lack of a United States Governmentwide, risk-based \n     approach increases the odds that systematic security gaps \n     abroad may persist and that United States response efforts \n     will not be maximized in order to close these gaps.\n       (5) Failure to effectively coordinate capacity-building \n     activities also results in greater risk of overlap, waste, \n     and unnecessary duplication between the United States and \n     international programs.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the United States Government must ensure capacity-building \n     assistance is coordinated both among United States Government \n     departments and agencies as well as with foreign implementing \n     partners, and assistance should be prioritized for the \n     highest-risk countries for travel by terrorists and foreign \n     fighters.\n       (c) Plan.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act and every two years thereafter at \n     the time of the President's budget submission to Congress \n     under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, until \n     2022, the Secretary of State shall, in accordance with the \n     protection of intelligence sources and methods, develop and \n     submit to the appropriate congressional committees \n     unclassified and classified versions of a foreign partner \n     engagement plan which catalogues existing capacity-building \n     initiatives abroad to combat travel by terrorists and foreign \n     fighters and identifies areas for adjustment to align ongoing \n     efforts with risk-based priorities.\n\n[[Page H1481]]\n\n       (2) Coordination.--The plan required under paragraph (1) \n     shall be developed in coordination with all relevant United \n     States Government departments and agencies and in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the \n     Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and \n     the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n       (3) Contents.--The plan required under paragraph (1) \n     shall--\n       (A) include an assessment of all countries and whether each \n     country is high-risk, medium-risk, or low-risk for travel by \n     terrorists and foreign fighters based on the minimum \n     standards described in section 4(b), as well as--\n       (i) an identification of the number of flights that \n     originate from last points of departure in each country to \n     the United States;\n       (ii) visa waiver program status or visa application and \n     denial rates for each country;\n       (iii) recent threats, terrorist and foreign fighter travel \n     trends, and the overall terror threat environment in each \n     country; and\n       (iv) other criteria as determined by the Secretary of State \n     and the Secretary of Homeland Security;\n       (B) detail existing United States Government programs, \n     projects, and activities which are intended to or have the \n     substantial effect of building the capacity of such countries \n     to combat travel by terrorists and foreign fighters, \n     including estimated spending levels by country where \n     practicable; and\n       (C) outline a plan for prioritizing United States \n     Government resources toward high-risk and medium-risk \n     countries, including--\n       (i) identifying efforts which should be reformed, \n     consolidated, or eliminated; and\n       (ii) detailing new programs, projects, or activities that \n     are requested, being planned, or are undergoing \n     implementation and associated costs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude any extraneous material on H.R. 4314.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Let me begin by thanking Mr. Zeldin of New York for his work on H.R. \n4314, the Counterterrorism Screening and Assistance Act, as well as to \nthank the other members of the Committee on Homeland Security's \nbipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter \nTravel.\n  Under the leadership of Chairman McCaul and with the significant \ncontributions of Mr. Katko of New York and the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, we unanimously approved this measure in January. Mr. \nSpeaker, the reason we did goes back to a little bit of history.\n  Al Qaeda planned the 9/11 attacks from Afghanistan because they had \nthe capacity to do so--to plan an attack there on the United States. \nNow, ISIS controls significant territory. They control that territory \nin Syria, in Iraq, in Libya. As long as terrorist groups maintain these \nsafe havens abroad, where they can work on new forms of munitions, \nbombing, and go through trial runs on how they carry out an attack, as \na consequence, we are under a threat here on our homeland, much like \nthe situation prior to 9/11.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  The perpetrators of the horrific attack that we all saw on that \ncoverage out of Paris that killed 130--those killed were European \nnationals. Those who did those murders had trained to fight in Syria. \nThey had traveled by train. They returned to Europe through Greece and \nthrough Turkey.\n  Despite the fact that many of those local attackers were known by \nauthorities, they were still able to move across borders. They moved \nwithout detection. In some cases, they moved with those fraudulent \npassports from Syria.\n  Given the high number of foreign fighters returning home from that \nISIS stronghold in Syria and from the ISIS training camps in Iraq--and, \nfrankly, from Libya as well, we have now heard--there is a recognized \nand urgent need for improved border security and information sharing \nbetween governments.\n  This bill is a way to get there because this threat is not just \nlimited, by the way, to us in the United States and to Europe.\n  Earlier this month terrorists who had received training inside Libya \nwere killed by Tunisian security forces during an attempted attack \ninside Tunisia.\n  So these attacks now demonstrate how easy it has become for \nterrorists and for foreign fighters to move across open borders.\n  This legislation makes several important changes to how border \nsecurity is administered. It improves the tools deployed at the border. \nIt increases the border security coordination between Allied states.\n  It does it in the following way: This legislation requires the \nDepartments of State and Homeland Security to produce an annual \nscorecard assessing the border security efforts of countries around the \nworld.\n  This is going to identify the weaknesses and areas for improvement \nabroad. It will also mandate a streamlining of our own efforts to \nassist partners overseas with their border security programs. The \nadministration will then submit a plan to Congress for prioritizing \nU.S. assistance on this.\n  This bill requires the establishment of minimum standards for border \nsecurity on the part of our Allied states. Countries that fail to meet \nthese minimum standards can have U.S. foreign assistance suspended, cut \noff, employing the same incentive already in place that we use today in \norder to force compliance against human trafficking overseas, against \nthose states that commit human rights violations.\n  Many of the Members here are familiar with how we leverage those \nstates to force them to pass legislation and change the way in which \nthey address these issues. We are going to deploy the same leverage \nhere.\n  So this bill reflects the recommendations made by our colleagues on \nthe Homeland Security's bipartisan task force on combating terrorists \nand foreign fighter travel, which we have worked together on.

The bill contains provisions that fall within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security.\n       I recognize and appreciate the desire to bring this \n     legislation before the House of Representatives in an \n     expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on \n     Homeland Security will forego consideration of this bill. The \n     Committee takes this action with the mutual understanding \n     that by foregoing action at this time we do not waive any \n     jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar \n     legislation.\n       This waiver is also given with the understanding that the \n     Committee on Homeland Security expressly reserves its \n     authority to seek conferees on any provision within its \n     jurisdiction during any House-Senate conference on this or \n     any similar legislation, and requests your support for such a \n     request.\n       I ask that a copy of this letter and your response be \n     included in the Congressional Record during consideration of \n     this bill on the House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael T.

I \nrise in support of this measure.\n  Let me thank Chairman Royce for his leadership on the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee and, also, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin) for \nbringing this bill forward.\n  Violence in recent months has shown us that the threat of violent \nextremism isn't isolated to particular countries or regions. More and \nmore we see the danger posed by terrorists and foreign fighters when \nthey can cross borders unimpeded.\n  So the United States, along with our allies and partners, need to do \nwhatever we can to stop those dangerous individuals as they cross from \ncountry to country. This bill would help us move in that direction.\n  Here at home, this legislation would ramp up coordination among \ngovernment agencies dealing with this problem. I would call on the \nadministration for a specific plan laying out how we are going to meet \nthis challenge.\n  Around the world, it would help governments by speeding the transfer \nof software and technology we can use to track people entering a \ncountry, to collect biometric data, and to figure out what sort of \nrisks they might present. It would prioritize the sharing of specific \nborder security systems with foreign partners.\n  It would put a particular focus on countries where this danger is \nparticularly acute. It would establish minimum standards for \ninternational border security and makes it clear that governments that \ndon't take this problem seriously are putting their American foreign \nassistance at risk. This legislation provides commonsense steps to \nensure our own security and that of our allies and partners.\n  I again thank Mr. Zeldin for all his hard work. I am pleased to \nsupport this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Zeldin). He is a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. \nHe is also the author of this bill.\n  Again, we appreciate the expertise he has brought in crafting this \nlegislation as it relates to border security because of his experience, \nhis distinguished career in the U.S. Army and, also, as an intelligence \nofficer, a former prosecutor in the Army, and a military magistrate.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the House Foreign \nAffairs Committee as well as his great staff for all of their \nincredible assistance in making sure that this legislation not only \ncame to the House floor for a vote, but came to the House floor for a \nvote swiftly and, fortunately, with very strong bipartisan support.\n  So I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, especially to \nChairman Royce and to Chairman McCaul as well of the House Homeland \nSecurity Committee, for all of their efforts.\n  I rise today in support of my bill, the Counterterrorism Screening \nand Assistance Act of 2016. This legislation is about protecting \nAmerica's security at home and abroad.\n  Foreign fighter movement is a very serious challenge that has \nresulted in the well-recognized need for improved border security \naround the world and better information sharing between governments.\n  The horrific terror attacks in Paris that killed over 100 people \nshowed us just how easy it is for terrorists to move undetected across \nborders.\n  This attack was largely carried out by European nationals, many of \nwhom traveled to train and fight in Syria and then later returned to \nEurope through Greece and Turkey.\n  Although local authorities already knew some of the attackers, they \nwere still able to move across borders without detection and, in some \ncases, using fraudulent passports.\n  It is essential that the United States work with the international \ncommunity to monitor and stop the movement of terrorists abroad.\n  Additionally, this legislation helps us counter the spread of \ninfectious diseases like Zika. With the recent outbreak of the \nmosquito-borne Zika virus which has spread at rapid rates across South \nAmerica, Central America, and the Caribbean, and the number of Zika \ncases among travelers visiting or returning to the United States, we \nmust take action now.\n\n[[Page H1484]]\n\n  As evidenced with the Ebola outbreak in 2013, which decimated \npopulations across Western Africa, if the proper effort is not \nimplemented proactively, the consequences can be truly devastating.\n  The Counterterrorism Screening and Assistance Act recently passed the \nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously with bipartisan support.\n  This bill would establish international border security standards to \nclose security gaps that currently exist that allow terrorists and \nforeign fighters to travel internationally.\n  These standards would be developed in coordination with all relevant \nU.S. Government departments and agencies in consultation with the \nSecretary of Defense, Attorney General, Director of National \nIntelligence, and Director of the FBI.\n  Our resources would be utilized in the most efficient way possible, \nwith a special focus on high-risk and medium-risk countries to boost \nsecurity.\n  A reporting system would also be established to monitor efforts of \nforeign governments to combat terrorism and foreign fighter travel and \nto suspend foreign assistance to countries not making significant \nefforts to comply.\n  Furthermore, the bill would put in place a monitoring system that \nwould screen for infectious diseases to contain and prevent any \npotential outbreaks, which will help quarantine viruses by authorizing \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to provide the necessary equipment \nand supplies to mitigate the risk or threat of infectious diseases such \nas Zika, a disease that has caused widespread alarm as it has continued \nto spread across the global community.\n  I also thank Congressman John Katko for his assistance as well.\n  The Counterterrorism Screening and Assistance Act of 2016 is a \nbipartisan measure long overdue to not only protect our homeland from \nterrorism, but also ensure the U.S. is always prepared to combat the \nspread of any infectious diseases.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues in Congress to join me in this \nimportant effort to address a serious national security threat and vote \ntoday to pass the Counterterrorism Screening and Assistance Act of 2016 \nto keep America safe.\n  Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Poe).\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this commonsense \nlegislation.\n  Thousands of Europeans who have traveled to fight alongside ISIS and \nother terrorist groups throughout the world pose a serious threat to \nour national security.\n  One of the problems is making sure that those terrorists who go fight \nin Iraq, Syria, and other places don't go back to their home countries \nin Europe undetected because, once a person gets in Europe, it is \neasier for Europeans to travel to the United States from Europe than it \nis from some other countries. Terrorists often travel through a number \nof countries before they get home, and some of these countries have \nvery good border security and others not so good.\n  The United States has the technology to help our friends and our \nallies track down these bad guys. But our bureaucracy, of course, has \ngotten in the way of national security. This bill expedites the \nprocess, cutting through the red tape and giving our partners the tools \nthey need to track terrorist travel throughout the world and in their \ncountries.\n  Terrorist travel is not a problem we can solve by ourselves. We must \nstop terrorists before they show up in America. We must work with our \npartners overseas.\n  I strongly support this legislation.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this measure.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, again I thank the Congressman from New York, Major Lee \nZeldin, for authoring this bill.\n  Let me also again express my appreciation for the cooperation of \nRanking Member Engel and to commend his work and, also, that of our \ncolleague from California (Mr. Bera), on this legislation.\n  The 9/11 Commission states in their report to the Congress on \nrecommendations: ``The U.S. Government cannot meet its own obligations \nto the American people to prevent the entry of terrorists without a \nmajor effort to collaborate with other governments. We should do more \nto exchange terrorist information with trusted allies, and raise U.S. \nand global border security standards for travel and for border crossing \nover the medium and long term through extensive international \ncooperation.''\n  This bill does that. It adds another component, and that is as it \nrelates to the collateral benefit, which will come through trying to \nprevent infectious diseases borne by these exotic vectors, like these \nmosquitoes that bring the Zika virus or like Ebola.\n  So this bill, H.R. 4314, increases collaboration with our allies \nthrough improved information sharing, tightened border security \nscreening methods overseas, and the Department of State and Department \nof Homeland Security are required to accelerate the delivery of certain \nborder security systems and prioritizing delivery to countries deemed \nto be at high or medium risk for foreign fighter or terrorist travel.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  It also establishes minimum border security standards. The Department \nof State and the Department of Homeland Security are required to submit \nan annual report to us in Congress detailing how countries are meeting \nthe minimum border security standards established there.\n  The annual report will not only assess partner country efforts over \nthe previous 12 months, but it is also going to identify those areas \nthat are most necessary for improvement. Countries that don't meet \nborder security standards could have their nonhumanitarian, nontrade-\nrelated U.S. assistance suspended, cut off. Suspension of assistance is \nmeant to ensure that countries take the necessary steps to improve \ntheir border security.\n  I again want to thank Mr. Zeldin and other members of the Committee \non Homeland Security's bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and \nForeign Fighter Travel and all the bipartisan cosponsors for their \nsupport for this bill, which deserves our unanimous support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4314, as amended\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1484-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1484-H1485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FORECLOSURE RELIEF AND EXTENSION FOR SERVICEMEMBERS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. COFFMAN.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nadd extraneous materials on S. 2393.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2393, the Foreclosure \nRelief and Extension for Servicemembers Act of 2015. This bill was \nintroduced by our colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Whitehouse, and \npassed the Senate in December.\n  This bill would extend, through December 31, 2017, mortgage-related \nprotections for servicemembers who are called to Active Duty under the \nServicemembers Civil Relief Act. Specifically, these protections would \nprohibit a bank or mortgage company from selling, foreclosing, or \nseizing a property owned by a servicemember without a court order for 1 \nyear after a servicemember returns from Active Duty.\n  This protection allows servicemembers the opportunity to avoid \nforeclosure or seizure during this 1-year period following their \nservice, giving them the opportunity to hopefully get back on track \nwith mortgage payments.\n  In 2008, the report produced by the Commission on the National Guard \nand Reserves found that the threat of foreclosure is a stressor that \nshould not be placed on members of the Armed Forces upon their return \nto civilian life.\n  Today, as a shrinking Active Duty force leaves more and more \noperational responsibilities to the Guard and Reserves, these home \nforeclosure protections are more important than ever. This year it is \nexpected that more than 10,000 members of the Army National Guard and \nArmy Reserves will cycle through to Europe, nearly double the number of \nlast year. Many thousands more will serve in other theaters of \noperation all over the globe.\n  I believe it is essential that we ensure members of the military \nreturning home have plenty of time to regain their financial footing, \nparticularly when they have selflessly given up their civilian jobs to \ndeploy with their Guard or Reserve units.\n  This protection has been extended several times by Congress and has \nbeen considered a noncontroversial extension of existing authorities. \nWithout our action on this bill, the protection would slip to only a \n90-day period of foreclosure protection and could impact servicemembers \nas early as the end of this month.\n  I would also note that the mortgage industry is supportive of this \nextension. I thank them for their advocacy and for their continued \nsupport of veterans and active and reserve servicemembers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the work of \nthe gentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson) and the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Fincher) for their work on this issue, as they also had \nsimilar bills to S. 2393 pending before this body.\n  Once again, I urge all Members to support S. 2393.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today in support of S. 2393, the Foreclosure Relief and \nExtension for Servicemembers Act of 2015.\n  This bill provides a 2-year extension of current protections so \nveterans transitioning out of the military don't lose their homes that \nthey owned before beginning their military service, if they are \nexperiencing financial hardships for up to a year after they leave the \nservice.\n  S. 2393 allows courts to pause proceedings to foreclose on or seize a \nhome for 1 year following service, allowing time for transitioning \nsoldiers to adjust their financial situations, as well as all other \naspects of their lives, to civilian life.\n  We owe our veterans the benefit of the doubt when they may have \nmissed payments while facing the tough realities of serving our Nation. \nThere is broad support for this provision in both Chambers of Congress, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Millions of people are losing their homes and have lost their homes \nto foreclosure. I have worked with the banking community, Federal HUD, \nand NACA. Our veterans and other individuals are still losing their \nhomes, and now many churches in my district are closing and losing \ntheir properties through foreclosure.\n  I am pleased that we have this bipartisan legislation, but this bill \nis a temporary fix. We need to work together, as a Congress, to find a \npermanent fix so that our veterans, other individuals, and churches are \nprotected from foreclosure.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. \nCoffman), for bringing this legislation forward. I urge the passage of \nS. 2393.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to \nsupport S. 2393.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2393, the \n``Foreclosure Relief and Extension for Service Members Act of 2015,'' \nwhich amends the ``Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp \nLejeune Families Act of 2012'' by extending through December 31, 2017, \nthe provisions that protect service members from actions to foreclose \non a mortgage for one year after their service.\n  S. 2393 prohibits the sale, foreclosure, or seizure of a service \nmember's mortgaged property without a court order or a waiver from the \nservice member.\n  In 1940, Congress passed the ``Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief \nAct'' (SSCRA) to provide protections and rights to individuals based on \ntheir service in the U.S. armed forces.\n  In 2003, Congress passed the ``Service Members Civil Relief Act,'' \nwhich was modernized and reauthorized the protections and rights \npreviously available to service members under SSCRA.\n  The Service Members Civil Relief Act protects service members in the \nevent that their military service impedes their ability to meet \nfinancial obligations incurred before entry into active military \nservice.\n  In 2012, the ``Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp \nLejeune Families Act of 2012'' amended the SCRA to extend the timeframe \nfrom nine months to one year in which service members are protected \nfrom the sale, foreclosure, or seizure of mortgaged property and any \nactions filed against them for an inability to comply with the terms of \nthe mortgaged obligation.\n  The ``Foreclosure Relief and Extension for Services Members Act of \n2014,'' which passed the House by voice vote, extended this provision \nthrough December 31, 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, our service members keep us safe from all manner of \nthreats around the globe, so the least we can do is to keep them and \ntheir families safe from foreclosure as they transition back to \ncivilian life.\n  I urge my colleges to support this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Coffman) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 2393.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1485-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1485-H1487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AIRPORT AND AIRWAY EXTENSION ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on H.R. 4721.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This bill, as amended by the Senate, extends the authorization of the \nFederal Aviation Administration programs and the revenue collection \nauthorities for the Airport and Airway Trust Fund through July 15, \n2016.\n  The current FAA reauthorization expires at the end of this month. \nWithout this bill, the authority to collect aviation taxes will lapse, \ndepriving the trust fund of more than $40 million per day. That is \nfunding for air traffic control, airport development, and other \naviation programs that can never be recovered.\n  Additionally, the airports will be unable to receive grant money that \nhas already been awarded to them, putting dozens of construction \nprojects at risk.\n  H.R. 4721 will avoid these unnecessary consequences while Congress \nworks to finish a long-term aviation bill. I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 4721.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, here we are a week later, and now we are doing another \nextension, which of course I support. This one will go to July 15, \nwhich is truly a drop-dead date. Congress will be out for the longest \nsummer break since probably the 1950s, starting just after July 15, so \nwe must get the long-term bill done by then.\n  There is substantial agreement between the bill that came out of \ncommittee in the House and the Senate bill, with the exception of the \ntombstone rule on lithium batteries, a difference on flight attendants' \nrest hours, and, of course, the issue of privatization of the air \ntraffic organization.\n  I would hope that we can move ahead and preconference the many other \ntitles and begin working on those, the differences on the flight \nattendants' rest time, and I will continue to push on lithium \nbatteries. I would hope that this is the last extension.\n\n[[Page H1487]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, again, I urge all my colleagues to join me \nin supporting this piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nthat all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and \nextend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 1180.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has a long \ntradition of tackling FEMA and emergency management issues in a \nbipartisan manner.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  I would like to acknowledge Chairman Barletta and Ranking Member \nCarson of the Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency \nManagement Subcommittee for leading efforts in the House to improve our \nNation's Emergency Alert System.\n  Public alerts save lives. And their efforts, along with this bill, \nwill save even more. This committee was the first to introduce \nlegislation in 2008, and every Congress since, to modernize the \nIntegrated Public Alert and Warning System, also known as IPAWS, \nbecause we recognized the critical need to provide timely and effective \ndisaster warnings to our citizens and communities. Modernizing the \nalert and warning systems will help save lives.\n  At the committee's request, the GAO issued a report in 2009 detailing \nkey problems with FEMA's development of IPAWS. GAO's findings supported \nthe need for legislation to ensure consultation and coordination with \nkey stakeholders, strategic planning, and the timely rollout of the new \nsystem. GAO issued a subsequent report in 2013 identifying a continued \nneed for guidance and testing of the system.\n  We also heard from many stakeholders, including people with \ndisabilities, the elderly, and industries like the broadcasters and \nwireless industry, that FEMA was not giving them a seat at the table as \nFEMA modernized the system. Involving these stakeholders who are the \nprimary users and owners of the infrastructure is key. Without them, \nalerts couldn't go out.\n  I am happy to stand here and support the culmination of that work in \nS. 1180, the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization \nAct of 2015. I commend the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee for continuing to advocate for a \nnationwide integrated and interoperable system.\n\n[[Page H1489]]\n\n  The IPAWS Modernization Act modernizes and integrates the Nation's \nalert and warning infrastructure to provide public safety officials \nwith an effective way to alert and warn the public about serious \nemergencies.\n  This legislation sets a clear framework to ensure money is not \nwasted, while making certain key stakeholders are a part of FEMA's \nmodernization of the system. The bill will also ensure that the ongoing \ndevelopment and modernization of our Nation's alert system is done \neffectively and efficiency.\n  As technologies change, the legislation will ensure that this system \nadapts and continues to work toward the most effective alert and \nwarning system possible. This system impacts everyone in America, Mr. \nSpeaker. Whether it is a hurricane, tornado, flood or wildfire, unless \nwe can ensure the public can be effectively alerted, lives will be at \nrisk.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello); Chairman \nBarletta; and my good friend, Ranking Member Peter DeFazio.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure today. The Integrated \nPublic Alert and Warning System Modernization Act of 2015 directs the \nadministrator of FEMA to codify the Integrated Public Alert and Warning \nSystem, commonly known as IPAWS.\n  With IPAWS, Mr. Speaker, public safety officials are able to warn the \npublic of impending hazards using multiple communications platforms, \nsuch as radio and television broadcasts, mobile devices, and other \nInternet services. These warnings, Mr. Speaker, can even be \ngeographically targeted so that only those in harm's way will receive \nthe messages. All of this leads to saving lives, Mr. Speaker, and \nreducing property damage.\n  During the months of May and June, tornados are most likely to strike \nthe great Hoosier State. Getting citizens to safety or even alerting \nthem to shelter in place before a tornado strikes can ultimately be the \ndifference between life and death. Success in that effort, Mr. Speaker, \ndepends largely on access to timely and precise information.\n  During 2011, a violent storm caused the sudden collapse of a concert \nstage at the Indiana State Fair. This tragic incident killed seven and \nseverely injured dozens more. It could have been much worse. Timely \nalerts enabled fair officials to clear the midway minutes before the \nstorm struck, potentially saving hundreds of lives.\n  Our committee has primary jurisdiction over IPAWS, and we have worked \nhard, Mr. Speaker, on this issue for several Congresses. While this \nbill is similar to another bill--H.R. 1472--that the Transportation \nCommittee reported last year, I am very disappointed that regular order \nwas not followed in S. 1180. It should have been referred to the \ncommittee of jurisdiction so that the House of Representatives can do \nthe job we were elected to do: consider the details and implications of \nall the different provisions and how they impact our alert and warning \nsystem. Despite the lack of regular order, Mr. Speaker, I still support \nthis measure greatly.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan).\n  Mr. DONOVAN. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's \nSubcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I \nrise today in support of S. 1180, the Integrated Public Alert and \nWarning System Modernization Act of 2015. This important legislation \nwas introduced by the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senator Ron Johnson.\n  IPAWS provides public safety officials with a mechanism to alert and \nwarn the public about emergencies using multiple communication \nplatforms, including the Emergency Alert System, Wireless Emergency \nAlerts, and NOAA Weather Radio.\n  The bill we are considering today authorizes the IPAWS program and \nprovides it with needed direction to help ensure that we can make \navailable as much information to the public as possible to get them out \nof harm's way in the event of a terror attack, natural disaster, or \nother threat to public safety.\n\n  We know that these alerts can help to save lives. IPAWS was used \nafter the Boston Marathon bombings to direct residents to shelter \nduring the manhunt. In my district, IPAWS was used to warn people \nduring Hurricane Sandy. Elsewhere, IPAWS has been vital to locating \nmissing children through the AMBER Alert system.\n  We also know that the system is not without its challenges. While I \nunderstand that in a recent test of the Emergency Alert System, a \ncomponent of IPAWS, worked for stations in my home State of New York, \nthere were challenges in other States. The test was canceled in several \nStates due to weather concerns. However, a number of those States were \nnot informed of the cancellation, leaving their broadcasters to wonder \nwhy the test didn't occur.\n  We must ensure better communication between IPAWS and relevant \nstakeholders. That is why the IPAWS subcommittee of the National \nAdvisory Council, established in this bill, is so important.\n  This advisory committee will provide stakeholders with a mechanism to \nprovide input into the program. Ensuring stakeholder engagement and \nfeedback will serve to enhance the effectiveness of IPAWS.\n  The Committee on Homeland Security has a long history of oversight of \nthe IPAWS program, having held a number of hearings and briefings. \nLegislation similar to the bill we are considering today was approved \nby the Committee on Homeland Security just last year.\n  Like the legislation passed out of the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity, this legislation is supported by the National Association of \nBroadcasters, the National Alliance of State Broadcasters Association, \nand CTIA--The Wireless Association. We thank these organizations for \ntheir continued engagement on this bill to improve the text and get us \nto this point.\n  The enactment of legislation to authorize IPAWS has been a long time \ncoming. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this commonsense \nlegislation so that we can send it to the President's desk to be signed \ninto law.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), a good friend of \nmine and the ranking member of the committee.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank my friend and the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee for yielding to me on this important bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, yes, indeed, we have spent a number of years overseeing, \nholding hearings, and working to push for a more modern public alert \nwarning system. So this legislation is somewhat overdue. In fact, we \npassed similar legislation last year in the House.\n  I do support the legislation. However, I will point out that it is a \nbit irregular because we passed it a year ago, and suddenly we are \npassing a version which just happens to have come from a Senator who \njust happened to be one of the most vulnerable Republicans up for \nreelection so that he can get a notch on his belt. But that is the way \nthings work around here: we get good things done for sometimes the \nwrong reasons. It should have been done a year ago. The Senate should \nhave taken up our version.\n  That said, this will modernize the system tremendously. We are well \npast the days of CONELRAD alerts. Yet, technology has not moved as far \nas it could for the 21st century.\n  In particular, I was in Japan with a congressional delegation \nobserving what they have done post the dramatic earthquake and tsunami \nevents. They estimated the wave heights and were able to get the \nmessage out, to some extent, on public broadcasts and with sirens \nbefore further shocks brought down the grid and silenced, for the most \npart, the sirens.\n  Unfortunately, the first estimates were off. When the waves reached \nthe nearshore monitoring devices, they found that they were \nconsiderably higher and a much more vigorous evacuation should have \nbeen conducted. Unfortunately, at that point they had no way to get the \nword out to the people who had gone to high ground, but\n\n[[Page H1490]]\n\nnot high enough, or those who had sheltered in place when they believed \nthe height of the tsunami would be less. So they lost many lives, they \nfeel, unnecessarily, because of a lack of redundancy in the system.\n  This will move us toward a redundant system. They have now moved to a \ncellular-based system so that individuals can be alerted.\n  I was just at a tsunami event in the town of Florence, Oregon, called \nthe Blue Line, where they have evacuation routes and people say: When \ndo I stop running or driving?\n  And so they are painting lines on those critical routes showing what \npoint where you are safe from the highest predicted tsunami. They did, \nessentially, a drill while we were there, but you couldn't even hear \nthe siren. These are World War II-era raid sirens. Some work, some \ndon't.\n  So we need a much more robust and redundant system because we know \nthat in the Pacific Northwest and northern California, it is only \nwhen--not if--we will have a dramatic earthquake, potentially with a \nmagnitude up to 9, with a subsequent tsunami.\n  We need in place both deep ocean detection to give more warning time, \nwave detection, and a robust system to inform the people where to go \nand how far they need to go in these events. This is overdue \nlegislation, and I do urge its adoption.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1180, the \nIntegrated Public Alert Warning System, or IPAWS, Modernization Act.\n  Modernizing our alert and warning capabilities is essential to \nkeeping us safe. We must effectively communicate important information \nto the public during national emergencies, and our warning efforts must \nevolve with the growing and emerging threats of today.\n  During my time as chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on \nEmergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, this was a top \npriority of mine. I have worked to update our alert and warning systems \nand utilize innovative new technologies.\n\n  Since the 112th Congress, I have introduced and advocated for the \npassage and enactment of this important piece of legislation, which is \nvery similar to my bill, H.R. 1738.\n  During my work on the Integrated Public Alert Warning System \nModernization Act, I heard from many stakeholders and experts who \nhighlighted the need to ensure alert systems are available to the \nlargest number of people, including individuals with disabilities and \nthose living in rural areas.\n  In 2006, FEMA implemented the Integrated Public Alert and Warning \nSystem, which improved public safety by quickly disseminating emergency \nmessages and lifesaving information to the public. However, these \nsystems have not been modernized in decades, which is why I have \nconsistently reintroduced this bill. With congressional oversight, we \ncan ensure our constituents have alert systems that work reliably, \neffectively, and efficiently.\n  S. 1180 provides authorization to update our communications \ninfrastructure to allow important information and alerts for \ninstantaneous message delivery over cell phones, text messaging, the \nInternet, and broadcasting.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Additionally, this bill improves our capabilities and communications \nnetwork by creating a national public warning working group to bring \nState and local officials together. This will ensure systems \ndevelopers, regulators, users, and relay participants meet on a regular \nbasis. This important legislation allows us to uphold our \nresponsibility in the protection of the people we serve.\n  I want to thank Senator Johnson for his work and advocacy on this \nissue.\n  I also want to thank my colleagues: Representative Susan Brooks; \nchairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Chairman McCaul; and \nSubcommittee Chairman Donovan, for their support in cosponsoring my \nbill, H.R. 1738.\n  This is a great step in the right direction, and we must continue \nthis progress of modernizing our capabilities with the passage of this \nbill. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                                        National Alliance of State\n\n\n                                    Broadcasters Associations,\n\n                                                   April 29, 2015.\n     Hon. Michael McCaul,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The undersigned, who are the chief \n     executive officers of the fifty State Broadcasters \n     Associations in the United States, the District of Columbia, \n     and Puerto Rico, are pleased to offer our support and \n     endorsement for H.R. 1738, the Integrated Public Alert and \n     Warning System Modernization Act of 2015.\n       If passed, this bill will ensure that more people receive \n     life-saving information in more parts of America, more of the \n     time, through current and future alert and warning \n     technologies, while strengthening broadcasters' role as the \n     backbone of America's public alerting system.\n       Many of us serve as chairs or members of our respective \n     State Emergency Communications Committees, which are charged \n     with managing the Emergency Alert System (EAS) in our states. \n     We have all worked tirelessly to ensure that a robust, \n     reliable alerting system is available when it is needed.\n       We have observed over the years that the system needs a \n     higher level of coordination among the various federal, state \n     and local public safety and emergency management agencies as \n     ``message originators'' on the one hand, and the broadcast, \n     cable and satellite ``message relayers'' on the other hand; \n     and that the absence of any formal, ongoing training of state \n     and local public safety and emergency management personnel on \n     the proper use of EAS has hampered state and local officials' \n     willingness and ability to use it efficiently in times of \n     emergency, thus putting lives and property at risk.\n       This bill will address these problems and will make giant \n     strides toward improvement of alert and warning capability in \n     our states and across our nation. We look forward to the \n     successful passage of this important measure.\n           Very truly yours,\n          The Undersigned CEOs of the Fifty State Broadcast Trade \n                                                     Associations.\n       Alabama Broadcasters Association, Sharon Tinsley; Alaska \n     Broadcasters Association, Cathy Hiebert; Arizona Broadcasters \n     Association, Art Brooks; Arkansas Broadcasters Association, \n     Doug Krile; California Broadcasters Association, Stan \n     Statham; Colorado Broadcasters Association, Justin Sasso; \n     Connecticut Broadcasters Association, Michael C.

Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is \nremaining on both sides.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Indiana has 13\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 10\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1180, \nthe ``Integrated\n\n[[Page H1491]]\n\nPublic Alert and Warning System Modernization Act of 2015.''\n  I support this bill because it would address interoperability \ndeficits among information technology systems and radio communications \nsystems used by emergency services to exchange voice, data, disasters, \nand video in real time\n  As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I am \nintimately aware, as are many of my colleagues, of the essential and \nlifesaving role of communications during a crisis.\n  S. 1180 directs FEMA to establish the Integrated Public Alert and \nWarning System Subcommittee to develop and submit recommendations for \nan integrated public alert and warning system to the National Advisory \nCouncil through: establishing common alerting and warning protocols, \nstandards, terminology, and operating procedures for the system; \ninclude in such system the capability to adapt the distribution and \ncontent of communications on the basis of geographic location, risks, \nand multiple communication technologies and to alert, warn, and provide \nequivalent information to individuals with disabilities, access and \nfunctional needs, or limited English proficiency; ensure that specified \ntraining, tests, and exercises for such system are conducted and that \nthe system is resilient, secure, and can withstand external attacks; \nand conduct public education efforts and a general market awareness \ncampaign about the system.\n  The bill requires the system to: be designed to adapt to and \nincorporate future technologies for communicating directly with the \npublic, provide alerts to the largest portion of the affected \npopulation feasible, and improve the ability of remote areas to receive \nalerts; promote local and regional public and private partnerships to \nenhance community preparedness and response; provide redundant alert \nmechanisms; and protect individual privacy.\n  Because the tragedies of September 11, 2001, were compounded by \ncommunication failures among first responders who entered the burning \ntowers that comprised the World Trade Center it has been an imperative \nof the Homeland Security Committee to address first responder \ncommunication interoperability challenges.\n  S. 1180 amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency to modernize the integrated U.S. \npublic alert and warning system to help ensure that under all \nconditions the President, federal agencies, and state, tribal, and \nlocal governments can alert and warn the civilian population in areas \nendangered by natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made \ndisasters or threats to public safety.\n  Hurricane Katrina is an example of the need for emergency response \nagencies to be connected.\n  After the storm the majority of the rescue operations were being \nconducted by the U.S. Coast Guard locating people who were on the roofs \nof their houses.\n  The coast guard was not aware of the individuals who were stuck in \ntheir home calling 911, because they could not reach their roofs, \ncausing about 986 Louisiana residents to perish after the storm due to \nthe lack of effective communication.\n  An estimated 1,836 lives were lost as a result of the hurricane.\n  The City of Houston covers over a 1,000 square mile region in \nSoutheast Texas. It has a night-time population of nearly two million \npeople, which peaks with over three million daytime inhabitants.\n  The city of Houston's 9-1-1 Emergency Center manages nearly 9,000 \nemergency calls per day. The volume of emergency calls can easily \ndouble during times of inclement weather or special City social/\nsporting events like Hurricanes Ike in September 2008; and Katrina as \nwell as Rita, which occurred in September and October of 2005.\n  The types and severity of potential emergencies can encompass floods, \nhurricanes, and industrial incidents which would require multiple \nemergency agencies to respond.\n  On the average, EMS responds to a citizen every 3 minutes. Each EMS \nresponse is made by one of 88 City of Houston EMS vehicles.\n  There are over 200,000 EMS incidents involving over 225,000 patients \nor potential patients annually.\n  In 2013, the City of Houston's fire Department lost Captain EMT \nMatthew Renaud, Engineer Operator EMT Robert Bebee, Firefighter EMT \nRobert Garner and Probationary Firefighter Anne Sullivan when they \nresponded to a hotel fire.\n  Throughout the history of the Houston Police Department over 110 \nofficers have lost their lives in the line of duty.\n  Each member of the House of Representatives knows of the loss of a \nfirst responder who was going to the aid of those in harm's way.\n  S. 1180 will offer additional resources that can save the lives of \nfirst responders and those they help.\n  S. 1180 will ensure that FEMA's response to a crisis is organized \nwith state and local resources.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of S. 1180.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, S. 1180.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1491-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the heroics of \nPlymouth 17-year-old Urias Jah, who was recently recognized with the \nCitizens Award from Plymouth fire officials.\n  After hearing shouts of ``Fire,'' Urias ran out of his apartment to \nsee a fire spreading on the third floor of the complex and a woman on \nthe second floor yelling for help. Urias was able to jump and pull \nhimself up onto the second floor balcony and the third floor balcony \nwith a fire extinguisher attached to his hips.\n  He then was able to extinguish the flames, saving property and, \npotentially, lives. Two hundred people, Mr. Speaker, reside in the \ncomplex. When firefighters arrived, they were flabbergasted that the \n5\\1/2\\-foot Urias would actually be able to scale the building.\n  Mr. Speaker, Urias' selfless actions are heroic and brave.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nrecognition of World Down Syndrome Day, which seeks to draw awareness \nto Down syndrome and how people with Down syndrome play a vital role in \nour lives and our communities.\n  All of us know someone who lives with Down syndrome, and we know that \nin spite of some extra challenges, they live full and robust lives \nsurrounded by family and friends.\n  In order to provide those living with Down syndrome and other \ndisabilities the best start possible, I was happy to cosponsor, along \nwith a majority of my colleagues in the House, the Achieving a Better \nLife Experience, or ABLE, Act, which was signed into law in 2014. This \nlaw empowers people with disabilities and their families to create a \nflexible account to help save for medical and dental care, education, \ncommunity-based employment, community-based support, training, housing, \nand transportation.\n  My office participates in the Congressional Internship Program for \nIndividuals with Intellectual Disabilities. This program, which is a \npartnership with George Mason University's Mason LIFE program, gives \nstudents with intellectual disabilities an opportunity to gain \ncongressional work experience. We have welcomed several bright young \nmen and women who have made significant contributions to our office, \nand I am proud to participate in this vital program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1492-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1492-H1493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CUBAN MILITARY ENRICHED\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the President's failing \nvisit to Cuba was dismissed by the Communist foreign minister, who \ndeclared ``under no circumstance is the realization of internal changes \nin Cuba on the negotiation table.''\n  Since the President's outreach to the Castro dictatorship, the \nconsequence has been a surge in dissident arrests of patriots who \noverestimated the hope and change that a relationship might bring. \nSadly, by doing business with the Castro regime, the benefits of trade \nwill not reach the Cuban people. It will enrich the Cuban military, \nwhich stole\n\n[[Page H1493]]\n\nabout 70 percent of companies in the most profitable industries.\n  This failure follows the Iranian nuclear deal, providing over $100 \nbillion to a regime that proclaims ``death to America'' and ``death to \nIsrael.''\n  By failing to stop ISIL-Daesh, the President's legacy has led to \nSyrians fleeing, children drowning at sea, and chemical weapons attacks \nkilling Iraqi children in their homes. The President can still change \ncourse to promote a strong America with peace through strength.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1493-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            STEVEN STEINER IS A CREDIT TO THE GRANITE STATE\n\n  (Mr. GUINTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a New Hampshire \nhero.\n  Conway's Steven Steiner, an emergency medical technician, has devoted \nhis life to helping others. Off duty in Manchester one day, he noticed \na commotion. A car had stopped in traffic. Steven saw that the man \nbehind the wheel had lost consciousness. He pulled the man from his car \nand successfully administered CPR, not once, but twice, after the man \nlost consciousness a second time. He had overdosed, unfortunately, on \nheroin.\n  Steven, who lost his own son to an OxyContin overdose, saved that \nman's life. ABC News happened to be there to document New Hampshire's \nfight against opiates and heroin, capturing the life-or-death moment.\n  Steven is a credit to the Granite State. He started Dads and Moms \nAgainst Drug Dealers to stop the spread of opiates and heroin in our \ngreat State of New Hampshire.\n  Most heroin enters our country across the southern border, where I \nwill visit this April to investigate. As Steven knows from experience, \nwe must stop deadly drugs like heroin from entering our country, just \nas we must help those who are struggling with this addiction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1493-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1900\n                         PRESERVE CASTNER RANGE\n\n  (Mr. O'ROURKE asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. O'ROURKE.

These 7,000 acres are a jewel to our \nbinational region of 3 million people and a treasure to the United \nStates.\n  For that reason, I ask Congress to join my community in its \ngrassroots efforts to preserve Castner Range as a national monument so \nthat this generation and those that follow can enjoy this national \ntreasure in perpetuity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1493-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            IRAN AND NORTH KOREA COCONSPIRATORS IN MISCHIEF\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a satellite flying in space over the \nSuper Bowl, a long-range missile test, 15 other missile launches, the \ntest of a so-called hydrogen bomb, and threats to destroy Manhattan. \nThis is North Korean saber rattling in 2016 alone.\n  It is safe to assume the Iranians were on site as witnesses to these \nlatest violations of international law.\n  Why? Because the Iranian scientists have been present nearly every \ntime the North Koreans have issued or launched missiles for decades.\n  The rogue nations of Iran and North Korea have been working together \nsince the 1980s on missile development. During the 1990s, they started \ndeveloping long-range ballistic missiles. By the 2000s, the Iranians \nwere giving North Korea sensitive data from their own tests to improve \nNorth Korean missile systems.\n  Mr. Speaker, North Korea already has the ability to attack South \nKorea, and Iran has the ability to attack Israel. These long-range \nmissiles are intended for the United States.\n  The American people should understand the threat we face. We should \nbe prepared. Our Nation must sanction these belligerent powers and \ndevelop a robust missile defense system to protect our homeland.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1493-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FAILURES OF WMATA\n\n  (Mrs. COMSTOCK asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address an issue of grave \nconcern to my constituents.\n  Last week's unprecedented closure of the entire Metrorail system \ndemonstrated Metro's ongoing safety failures. This week, the Federal \nTransit Administration launched its safety blitz of Metro, focusing on \nthe training and oversight of inspectors and the maintenance workers, \nas well as the management of track defect data.\n  Paul Wiedefeld, the new general manager of Metro, issued a letter to \nthe public several weeks ago identifying many of the problems, \nincluding management problems. First and foremost, he said: ``The \nsafety culture at Metro is not integrated with operations, nor well-\nrooted at all levels.''\n  For example, although this has already been noted, he noted that \nthere were more red lights blown through in 2015 by its operators than \nin either 2013 or 2014. Clearly, we are going the wrong direction, and \nwe need to improve Metro.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important \nmeasure to protect the Metro system of the Nation's capital.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/21/house-section/article/H1493-5", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STOP SEXUAL ABUSE OF AFGHAN CHILDREN\n\n  (Mr. ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. ROONEY of Florida.
