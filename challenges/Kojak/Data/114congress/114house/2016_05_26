Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the long and \nfruitful public service of a member of my staff, Ruth Richardson.\n  With degrees from Aurora and Northern Illinois Universities, Ruth \nbegan her career as an admissions counselor at Aurora University.\n  In 1990, she started her service to the U.S. House of Representatives \nas a caseworker in the office of Congressman Dennis Hastert. The \ncaseworker plays a central role in a congressional office as the \nprimary advocate for constituents having challenges with the Federal \nGovernment, and Ruth excelled at her job.\n  For 26 years, she worked tirelessly to help seniors who were having \ntrouble obtaining their Social Security benefits or to help veterans in \nsearch of medical care or military acknowledgement of their service, \nand she spearheaded the U.S. annual Congressional Art Competition to \nshowcase the young talent in Illinois.\n  To many, Ruth has been a strong ally navigating the intricate and \narcane Federal bureaucracy. I was thrilled Ruth joined my team when I \nfirst entered Congress in 2011, and she has delivered professional and \ncaring service to the 14th District residents. Everyone who comes in \ncontact with Ruth is warmed by her selfless heart and willingness to \nhelp. In many ways, she is irreplaceable, and we will greatly miss her \nas she retires at the end of this month.\n  Ruth, it is now time for you to enjoy your family and your next \nadventure in life. Don't be a stranger to the office. And may God bless \nyou in your retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/house-section/article/H3269-7", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3269-H3270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REMEMBERING AUBURN POLICE OFFICER RONALD TARENTINO\n\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Officer Ronald \nTarentino, a member of the Auburn Police Department in Massachusetts, \nwho was tragically shot and killed in the line of duty this past \nweekend.\n  Officer Tarentino exemplified the courage and dedication that defines \nour incredible men and women in blue. His neighbors and friends \ndescribed him as a ``gentle giant,'' a ``great guy,'' and ``always \nwilling to help.'' He always kept an eye out for the 91-year-old widow \nliving across the street.\n  Remembering Officer Tarentino this week, Auburn Police Chief Andrew \nJ.\n\n[[Page H3270]]\n\nSluckis said: ``He got along with everybody. He was somebody who was \nalways smiling. He was an outstanding guy, and we're going to miss \nhim.'' Mr. Speaker, that is how he will be remembered.\n  In the days since this tragedy, it has been truly inspiring to see \nthe Auburn, Leicester, and surrounding communities come together to \nsupport Officer Tarentino's wife and three children. My heart goes out \nto them, and I know I am not alone in saying that Officer Tarentino \nwill never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/house-section/article/H3270-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING SCOTT MEADOR\n\n  (Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a local act of \ncourage.\n  Earlier this week, in my hometown of Newburgh, Indiana, a car wreck \nat a local gas station quickly turned into a life-or-death situation. \nIn what was described as a scene from an action movie, Boonville native \nScott Meador, who was a bystander to the incident, bravely pulled the \ndriver to safety before the car was consumed by flames, saving the \ndriver's life.\n  Scott Meador is a hero and an example for us all. Because of his \nselfless action, a family remains whole. That is what it means to be a \nHoosier--to come to the aid of your fellow citizen when they are in \nneed.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is important to highlight the positive things that \nhappen daily in our country.

Mr. Speaker, a new CDC study shows a 13 percent risk that \nthe Zika virus will result in microcephaly, causing incomplete fetal \nbrain development.\n  Already, nearly 300 pregnant women in the United States have acquired \nZika. In light of these risks, how can this Congress continue to \nobstruct, delay, and deny the necessary funding for a response?\n  On many issues, this Congress is divided. I get it. But this is our \nmost basic job. This emergency will test us as Americans, and it will \ntest us as an institution. Will we come together to prevent a Zika \noutbreak? Will we protect these families? Will we act in the common \ngood, or will we continue to play politics, ignore the science, and \ndisregard these serious risks?\n  The study's author, CDC biologist Michael Johansson, said: ``We need \nto do whatever we can to help women avoid Zika virus infections during \npregnancy.''\n  Let's listen to him.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 39,000 \nVerizon workers currently on strike. These hardworking members of CWA \nand IBEW are on strike for a number of reasons, but the number one \nreason is to keep their jobs and prevent them from being shipped \noverseas to the Philippines or India.\n  What Verizon is doing is not unique. In fact, it has been the \nexperience of too many families in my district in Houston and Harris \nCounty and families throughout the country.\n  As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to fight for these \njobs and improve the lives of average Americans. This spring, I \nintroduced bipartisan legislation, the United States Call Center Worker \nand Consumer Protection Act, H.R. 4604, that would make companies that \noffshore American jobs ineligible for Federal grants or loans and put \nthem at the back of the line for Federal contracts.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMcGovern),\n\n[[Page H3271]]\n\npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and reported \na rule to expedite consideration of legislation that would deal with \nthe imminent threat of the Zika virus. The rule provides that the House \nconcur in the Senate amendment with a further amendment consisting of \nthe text of H.R. 4974, H.R. 5243, and H.R. 897, as passed by the House, \nand provides a motion from the chair of the Committee on Appropriations \nto request a conference with the Senate.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I said last week, the debate between Republicans and \nDemocrats is not over whether or not to address the Zika threat, but \nwhether to pay for it or just to add it to the national credit card.\n  This rule would provide for a conference between the House and the \nSenate on the Zika response legislation, as passed by the House. As \nopposed to the Senate approach, which adds an additional $1.2 billion \nto the national debt, the House approach acts responsibly by using \nexisting funds designated for Ebola and other infectious diseases to \npay for our response to the looming Zika threat.\n\n                              {time}  0915\n\n  Mr. Speaker, many of my friends on the other side have claimed that \nthe House Republicans' response to the Zika threat has been wholly \ninsufficient. Frankly, I disagree with that view. In our view, our \nresponse is, really, the second of three tranches of funds directed at \nZika.\n  First, Chairman Rogers, Chairman Granger, and I directed the \nadministration to use existing funds for Ebola and other infectious \ndiseases to deal with the immediate threat. Thus far, the \nadministration has used nearly $600 million to support efforts to \ncombat Zika.\n  The second tranche of money that is included in this legislation \nwould provide an additional $622 million for Zika.\n  Finally, I want to assure my colleagues that we will commit \nadditional resources in the FY 2017 appropriations process to ensure \nthat the administration request is fully fulfilled, providing nearly \n$1.9 billion, which is the amount requested by the administration to \ncombat Zika.\n  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to reiterate that \nI do not disagree with my friends about the need to confront the Zika \nvirus quickly. In fact, I have been to Brazil. I have been to \nArgentina.\n  I have visited the infected areas and have spent a lot of hours in \ntalking to our people on the ground there who are both investigating \nthe disease and working with local governments to try and take care of \nsome of the outbreak down there.\n  We have visited extensively with our friends up here at the National \nInstitutes of Health and at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. The only difference I have with my friends is whether or \nnot we pay for the activity.\n  I believe, Mr. Speaker, that, if we already have the resources to \nconfront the crisis, which we do, we should do so within our existing \ncapabilities as opposed to adding to the deficit.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in conference, through \nregular order, to ensure a bipartisan agreement can be reached. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), my good friend, for \nyielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying how disappointed I \nam by the inadequate and long overdue response by this Republican \nmajority to the Zika crisis.\n  With nearly 1,400 Americans, including more than 275 pregnant women \nwho are currently infected with the virus and well over a million cases \nexpected before the end of the year, it is absolutely shameful that \nthis House has failed to act on legislation to adequately fund a \nresponse to this potentially devastating crisis.\n  Mr. Speaker, Zika is not coming to the United States. It is here. As \nsummer arrives, along with mosquito season, the mosquito that carries \nthe Zika virus will be active and knocking on the doors of our southern \nStates and territories.\n  This is an emergency, and it should be treated as such. But my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle have spent months in delaying \naction and in making excuse after excuse after excuse about why we \ndon't need to provide the full funding that our Nation's public health \nexperts say we need.\n  I appreciate the fact that my friends on the other side of the aisle \nconsider themselves public health experts, but there are people who are \ntrained to be public health experts who tell us that what we are doing \nhere today is underfunding an adequate response to this crisis.\n  I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by this, as my friends in the \nmajority have made it a habit of ignoring the advice of scientists and \nof experts in favor of appeasing a small group in their Conference on \nthe extreme right.\n  In February, President Obama requested $1.9 billion to address the \npublic health threat that is posed by the Zika virus. Instead of taking \nthe swift action that was needed to confront this crisis, the House \ndelayed and delayed and delayed as the Zika crisis continued to spread.\n  We should have sent a bill to President Obama's desk months ago, but, \ninstead, this leadership allowed months to go by without there being \nany action on this issue until last week, when they brought to the \nfloor a completely inadequate $622 million package that provides only \none-third of the funds that have been requested by the administration.\n  House Democrats, under the leadership of Leader Pelosi and \nAppropriations Committee Ranking Member Lowey, have tried to bring to \nthe floor meaningful emergency funding to address Zika, only to be \nblocked by House Republicans five times.\n  While the administration has taken significant steps to help keep \nAmericans safe from the Zika virus, significant additional \nappropriations are needed. In a letter to Speaker Ryan, OMB Director \nShaun Donovan and National Security Advisor Susan Rice said, without \nemergency supplemental funding, mosquito control and surveillance may \nneed to be suspended.\n  State and local governments that manage mosquito control may not be \nable to hire personnel for mosquito mitigation efforts, and vaccine \ndevelopments, which require multiyear funding commitments, may be \njeopardized.\n  To make matters worse, Mr. Speaker, House Republicans sent to the \nfloor last week and again this week a bill to undermine the Clean Water \nAct and protections for our waterways under the guise of helping to \ncontain the Zika virus.\n  But the truth of the matter is that the legislation is nothing more \nthan a carve-out for pesticide special interests and it would have \nabsolutely no effect on spraying pesticides to combat the spread of the \nZika virus.\n  It is a bill my friends have brought to the floor in the past, but \nthey just couldn't help themselves in using this crisis as an excuse to \nfurther undermine environmental protections.\n  Instead of working with Democrats to address this public health \nemergency in a serious bipartisan way that puts the health and safety \nof the American people first, the Republican leadership has once again \nbrought to the floor partisan legislation that will not adequately meet \nthe needs of the CDC, of the NIH, of the USAID, and of other \ngovernmental agencies that are on the front lines in responding to this \ncrisis.\n  Let me close, Mr. Speaker, by saying that I have great respect for \nthe gentleman from Oklahoma. When he says that he intends to support \nevery effort to make sure that adequate funding is available, if I \nthought this whole decision were up to him alone, I don't\n\n[[Page H3272]]\n\nthink I would be as nervous as I am at this particular point, but his \nparty that is in control has shut this government down.\n  We have seen them lurch from one crisis to another crisis and \nunderfund one priority after another priority. Quite frankly, I don't \ntrust the people who are running this House to do the right thing, to \nbe able to get a majority of their majority to go along with providing \nthe appropriate funding.\n\n  Yes, we all want to be fiscally responsible, but let me tell you \nthis: if all you are worried about is the bottom line--and that is the \ncost--by not adequately funding what is needed to combat this crisis, \nthe costs that will result if this crisis gets out of control will be \nprohibitive. You ain't seen nothing yet.\n  So we can nickel-and-dime this all we want, but we do so at our own \nperil. We ought to be concerned primarily with the safety and well-\nbeing of the citizens of this country.\n  But if that is not enough to prompt my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle to support the President's request, I would suggest that the \ncost of ignoring this problem of not adequately funding an appropriate \nresponse will be a cost like you have never seen before.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this rule and to bring up strong \nbipartisan legislation that will fully fund the administration's \nrequest. This is a public health emergency, and we must act now.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I begin by pointing out to my good friend that, actually, we are \ndoing, in a sense, what he is urging us to do right now. We are moving \nexpeditiously to go to conference with our friends in the Senate, who \nhave passed one version of the Zika response.\n  We will have our version. We will sit down and work out a compromise, \nand I suspect we will be able to move pretty smartly through this. What \nwe are doing here today is exactly what I know my friend wants us to \ndo, and that is to move and respond.\n  I also point out--and it gets lost in the rhetoric sometimes around \nthis issue--that there is not one thing the Federal Government has \nproposed to do about Zika that it has been unable to do because of a \nlack of money. The Federal Government has had every cent that it has \nasked for.\n  Frankly, it was Hal Rogers, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, who solicited Ms. Granger, the chairman of the Subcommittee \non State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies, and I, as the chair \nof the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and \nRelated Agencies, to write the administration and tell them to start \nspending money immediately from the things they had. Then that money \nwould be backfilled as needed during the normal appropriations process.\n  That is exactly what has been done. No measure has failed to be \nimplemented because of a lack of money. There has been no delay in \nmoney for the Zika response, and there are substantial efforts to move \nahead in this regard.\n  My friend made the point that we sometimes seem to ignore the advice \nof scientists. That is just simply not true. For Ebola last year, the \nadministration got the response it wanted out of this Congress \nimmediately. Frankly, it has gotten an immediate response out of Zika.\n  I point out to my friend--he may not be aware of this because he is \nnot on the Appropriations Committee--that last year the President of \nthe United States asked for $1 billion for additional research at the \nNational Institutes of Health. We gave him $2 billion.\n  He asked for a certain amount of money--forgive me for not \nremembering the exact figure--for the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. We gave him more money than he asked for. This year we will \ndo that again. He has made requests for additional money.\n  We will go beyond what he has requested at both the National \nInstitutes of Health and at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. So in suggesting we are not funding these efforts robustly, \nthe truth is, if you look at the numbers, we are actually spending more \nmoney than the President asked for because we think these are national \npriorities.\n  While we listen to scientists, we also listen to economists. They \ntell us that running up a national debt willy-nilly is not a very good \nthing to do. In this case, we have the money and we have the time to \ndeal with this in a thoughtful and prudent way and to advance the \nefforts without running up the national debt. It is the appropriate way \nto proceed.\n  I would just ask my friend to think back. When we hear this figure, \nthis is only a third of the response. Somehow my friends on the other \nside have forgotten that the first third is already done. That was the \nfirst $600 million that is being deployed as we speak. This is the next \nthird.\n  Frankly, it reaches not only the balance for the remainder of this \nfiscal year, but it reaches into next year. This is more money, once we \npass this, than the administration has proposed to deploy in this \nfiscal or even this calendar year.\n  Then, in the normal appropriations process, which is underway right \nnow--the bill will probably be presented sometime in the middle of June \nto the Appropriations Committee--you will see additional money in both \nthe State and Foreign Operations bill and in the Labor-H bill that is \ntargeted toward Zika. The one difference is it will all have been paid \nfor.\n  I think that is what shocks my friends the most. They would much \nprefer to save that money so as to spend it someplace else. We think it \nis a crisis. We have the money. We ought to spend the money right now \nand take care of Zika.\n  We are going to continue to work with our friends, and I think we \nwill arrive at a good place. My hope is that that measure that we enact \nat the end is fully paid for. That is what we are trying to achieve \nhere.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I think what we are concerned about on this side of the aisle--and I \nknow some thoughtful Republicans are also concerned about this--is the \nfact that, without certainty, a lot of the research projects and a lot \nof initiatives that need to be done at the Federal and State levels \nwill not happen because no one knows whether the money is going to \nfollow for what is needed.\n  I think there is a lack of certainty because we are in a House of \nRepresentatives that has shut the government down before. If people \ndon't get their way, people have a tantrum and they shut the government \ndown. That is the history of this House of Representatives.\n  I quote here from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National \nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes \nof Health, whom I actually have a great deal of trust in.\n  He says:\n\n       If we do not get the money that the President has asked \n     for--the $1.9 billion--that is going to have a very serious, \n     negative impact on our ability to get the job done.\n\n  That is Dr. Fauci. That is not I. That is a highly respected \nscientist, whom I think we all have a great deal of respect for in this \nHouse. We ought to listen to him more than to the Tea Party wing of the \nRepublican Party.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my friends to defeat the previous question. If we \ndo, I will offer an amendment to the rule that modifies the House \namendment by replacing the Zika virus provisions with the text of H.R. \n5044, which is the Democratic alternative that fully funds the \nadministration's request.\n  The Republican majority's current plan is to pass creatively named \nbills that have nothing to do with Zika and to offer short-term \nspending commitments that will, unfortunately, fail to properly \nincentivize the private sector to help develop a vaccine.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Our alternative would give our scientists and our doctors the \nresources they need to mount a longer-term, robust response to the \ngrowing Zika crisis.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Massachusetts?\n\n[[Page H3273]]\n\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 4 minutes \nto the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), the distinguished \nranking member of the Committee on Appropriations.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, before I make my statement, I just want to \nrespond to our distinguished chair of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health \nand Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies.\n  Has the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations introduced \nsubcommittee allocations for either the Subcommittee on Labor, Health \nand Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies or the Subcommittee \non State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs?\n  The answer is no.\n  Has the chairman set markup dates for either the Subcommittee on \nLabor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies or \nthe Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs \nbill?\n  The answer is no.\n  So there is no chance that Congress will send either appropriations \nbill to the President by September 30. This really is a charade. CDC \nDirector Tom Frieden says 3 months is an eternity for control of an \noutbreak. There is a narrow window of opportunity here, and it is \nclosing.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous \nquestion so we can support a robust and aggressive response to an \nimminent public health emergency.\n  Researchers at Harvard and CDC reported that pregnant women who \ncontract the Zika virus in their first trimester face as high as a 13 \npercent chance that their baby will have microcephaly. Nearly 300 \npregnant women in the United States and its territories are terrified \nthat their child will have a devastating birth defect, and that number \nincreases every day. Every day we learn more about the devastating \nvirus, and each piece of news is more alarming than the last.\n  That is why President Obama acted responsibly and requested $1.9 \nbillion to research and develop vaccines and diagnostic tests, invest \nin mosquito vector control, and implement an aggressive public \neducation and outreach campaign.\n  Yet, the House Republican Zika bill would provide a mere $622 \nmillion, which is less than one-third of the $1.9 billion that public \nhealth experts tell us is necessary to protect American communities. To \nmake matters worse, the bill robs Peter to pay Paul, stealing funding \nstill needed to protect against Ebola and increase public preparedness \nat home.\n  The spread of the Zika virus is taking a severe toll on Brazil and \nother South and Central American countries. It has spread to Puerto \nRico, and the outbreak is knocking at our door.\n  Why are my friends in the majority acting more like bureaucrats and \naccountants than responsive representatives of hardworking Americans?\n  Protecting American communities is the foremost responsibility of the \nFederal Government. Yet, the majority has failed to lead the way to a \nresponse worthy of this emergency.\n  If the previous question is defeated, Mr. McGovern will amend the \nrule to offer my bill, H.R. 5044, as a substitute, providing the full \n$1.9 billion the administration requested, without offsets, to ensure \nan adequate response to Zika that doesn't rob our Ebola response.\n  I urge me colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Dent), the chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related \nAgencies.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. He is \nobviously a very thoughtful member of the Committee on Rules and a fine \nmember of our Committee on Appropriations.\n  I believe we have something really important to discuss today, and \nthat is that today really does mark a return to regular order for our \nappropriations bills and process. That statement is so significant that \nwe need to pause and recognize it as a tremendous achievement. This has \nbeen the intense focus of Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers \nfor more than 5 years. And the committee's esteemed ranking member, \ntoo, Mrs. Lowey, has been equally determined to have regular order \nrestored. They have worked relentlessly to get us to this place, which \nis, in fact, a better place. So I commend Chairman Rogers and Mrs. \nLowey and appreciate the support of the House leadership to make this \nhappen. This is the best way to serve our citizens, our Federal \nagencies, our veterans, our military services, and the members and \ntheir families.\n  It is also my honor to have the Military Construction, Veterans \nAffairs, and Related Agencies appropriations bill move forward as part \nof the conference committee. That is very significant to me as chairman \nof that subcommittee. Of course, we are also going to deal with the \nZika threat as we must and as we should, and that will be part of these \ndiscussions. I am sure we are going to be able to come to an agreement \nwith the Senate just on how we will proceed on that very important \nissue, and I think everybody here is committed to moving forward both \non the MILCON piece of this as well as Zika.\n  H.R. 4974--and that is the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, \nand Related Agencies bill--demonstrates our firm commitment to fully \nsupporting our Nation's veterans and servicemembers. Our investment of \n$81.6 billion for Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related \nAgencies, at $1.8 billion over last year's level, is unprecedented. The \nbill will address issues to help veterans in every part of the country, \nevery congressional district, and our troops throughout the world.\n  The bill provides comprehensive support for servicemembers, military \nfamilies, and veterans with $7.9 billion. It supports our troops with \nfacilities and services necessary to maintain readiness and morale at \nbases here in the States and, again, overseas. It provides for the \nDepartment of Defense schools and health clinics that take care of our \nmilitary families.\n  For the VA, this bill includes $73.5 billion in discretionary \nfunding. The bill funds our veterans healthcare systems to ensure that \nour promise to care for those who sacrificed in defense of this great \nNation continues as those men and women return home. We owe this \nsupport to our veterans and we are committed to sustained oversight so \nthat programs deliver what they promise and taxpayers are well served \nby the investments that we make.\n  So I certainly support this motion to go to conference. I certainly \nurge adoption of this motion so we can deal with taking care of our \nservicemembers, our veterans, and their families. We must do this. Of \ncourse, we must also deal with the Zika threat that is affecting so \nmany of us. I commend everybody involved in that issue.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to commend Chairman Cole for his \nefforts on this issue. I serve with him on the Subcommittee on Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. I know he \nhas been in constant communication with our friends at the NIH and the \nCDC to make sure we get the resources necessary to them so they can \nhelp us deal with this very real threat.\n  Again, I am very pleased that we have returned to regular order and \nthat we are going to conference this bill on Military Construction, \nVeterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, and on Zika. It is great for \nthe Congress, great for the country, and we need to move forward.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I have great respect for the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and I agree \nwith him that there are a lot of issues that he has championed here.\n  He used the words ``regular order.'' We have no allocations, no \nbudget resolution. We know that many of the appropriations bills will \nnever see the light of day on the House floor. There will be this mad \nrush after the election to put together some big omnibus package that \nmost people will never be able to read. If that is regular order, we \nhave a very strong difference of opinion of what regular is all about.\n  Mr. Speaker, I insert into the Record a letter that was sent to the \nHouse leadership signed by close to 70 health organizations--every \nmajor health organization in the country--calling for\n\n[[Page H3274]]\n\nnew funding rather than repurposing money from other high-priority \nprograms to combat Zika, also supporting the President's request. It \ntalks about how we have a brief window of opportunity to slow the \nspread of the Zika virus and avert a wave of preventable birth defects \nand urging Congress to act certainly in a much more aggressive way than \nwhat we are doing here today.\n\n                                                    April 5, 2016.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Fred Upton,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Hal Rogers,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Frank Pallone,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Nita Lowey,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi, Chairman \n     Upton and Representative Upton, and Chairman Rogers and \n     Representative Lowey: The undersigned organizations committed \n     to the health and wellbeing of our nation's families and \n     communities urge you in the strongest terms to immediately \n     provide emergency supplemental funding to prepare for and \n     respond to the Zika virus here in the United States. We also \n     urge that Congress provide new funding rather than repurpose \n     money from other high priority programs at the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other federal \n     agencies that ensure our health security and public health \n     preparedness.\n       As you know, the Zika virus has been linked to \n     microcephaly, a serious birth defect of the brain, in babies \n     of mothers who contracted the virus while pregnant. Thousands \n     of devastating birth defects have been observed among infants \n     born in South and Central America in recent months. Zika has \n     already been diagnosed in travelers returning to the U.S. \n     from these areas. As the summer months approach and we enter \n     mosquito season, our nation can expect to be exposed to \n     mosquitos that can spread this virus. Over four million \n     babies are born in our nation each year, and many of their \n     mothers could be at risk for contracting Zika during \n     pregnancy.\n       With emergency supplemental funding to respond to the Zika \n     virus, state and local public health professionals would have \n     access to increased virus readiness and response capacity \n     focused on areas with ongoing Zika transmission; enhanced \n     laboratory, epidemiology and surveillance capacity in at-risk \n     areas to reduce the opportunities for Zika transmission and \n     surge capacity through rapid response teams to limit \n     potential clusters of Zika virus in the United States. \n     Moreover, supplemental funding will assist the CDC and USAID \n     in efforts to contain the Zika virus in Zika-endemic \n     countries and ensure that there are resources for \n     surveillance, vector control and services for affected \n     pregnant women and children.\n       If we take immediate action, we may be able to dramatically \n     slow the spread of Zika, giving scientists time to develop \n     and test a vaccine. Without action, however, we fear the \n     number of newborns born with debilitating birth defects will \n     only continue to rise. In addition to the human toll on \n     children and families, the CDC estimates that the average \n     lifetime cost of caring for each child born with microcephaly \n     will likely be millions of dollars per child. For hard-hit \n     communities, an epidemic of severe birth defects could \n     quickly overwhelm health care and social services systems, \n     and put extreme pressure on educational and other \n     institutions.\n       The President has requested emergency funding to educate \n     Americans about protecting themselves, reduce the mosquito \n     population, and accelerate Zika vaccine research. Each of \n     these steps is vital to reducing the likelihood that pregnant \n     women will be exposed to the Zika virus.\n       Our nation has a brief window of opportunity to slow the \n     spread of the Zika virus and avert a wave of preventable \n     birth defects. We urge you to act immediately to provide the \n     emergency resources necessary to protect pregnant women, \n     infants and children from this devastating infection.\n           Sincerely,\n       Academic Pediatric Association, American Academy of Family \n     Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American \n     Association for Clinical Chemistry, American Association for \n     Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, American College of \n     Nurse-Midwives, American College of Preventive Medicine, \n     American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \n     American Medical Association, American Nurses Association, \n     American Pediatric Society, American Public Health \n     Association, American Sexual Health Association, American \n     Society for Clinical Pathology, American Society for \n     Reproductive Medicine, Association for Professionals in \n     Infection Control and Epidemiology, Association of Maternal & \n     Child Health Programs, Association of Medical School \n     Pediatric Department Chairs, Association of Public Health \n     Laboratories, Association of Reproductive Health \n     Professionals, Association of Schools and Programs of Public \n     Health, Association of State and Territorial Health \n     Officials, Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and \n     Neonatal Nurses.\n       Children's Environmental Health Network, Children's \n     Hospital Association, Commissioned Officers Association of \n     the U.S. Public Health Service, Inc., Cooley's Anemia \n     Foundation, Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, \n     Easter Seals, Every Child By Two, First Candle, GBS/CIDP \n     Foundation International, Healthcare Ready, HIV Medicine \n     Association, Infectious Diseases Society of America, \n     Intrexon, Johnson & Johnson, March of Dimes, National \n     Association of County and City Health Officials, National \n     Birth Defects Prevention Network, National Association of \n     Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, National Council of La Raza, \n     National Environmental Health Association, National \n     Foundation for Infectious Diseases, National Hispanic Medical \n     Association, National Medical Association.\n       National Network of Public Health Institutes, National \n     Organization for Rare Disorders, National Partnership for \n     Women & Families, National Recreation and Park Association, \n     Novavax, Inc., Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health, OraSure \n     Technologies, Inc., Oregon Public Health Association, \n     Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, Pediatric Policy \n     Council, Public Health Institute, Research!America, Resolve: \n     The National Infertility Association, Save Babies Through \n     Screening Foundation Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of \n     America, Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Society for \n     Pediatric Research, Society for Women's Health Research, The \n     Arc, The Newborn Foundation, Trisomy 18 Foundation, Trust for \n     America's Health.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to take \nmeaningful action to address the public health crisis that the Centers \nfor Disease Control recently called scarier than we originally thought, \nand to support the President's request for supplemental funding for the \nZika virus as outlined in H.R. 5044, the FY16 Zika supplemental \nappropriations.\n  I thank Appropriations Ranking Member Nita Lowey and Labor, Health \nand Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee \nRanking Member DeLauro for their ongoing leadership to help protect our \nconstituents.\n  More than 120 Floridians now have the Zika virus, including 36 \npregnant women. Last week there were an estimated 157 pregnant women in \nthe continental United States and 122 more in the territories who have \ncontracted Zika.\n  The House must take real action to protect our citizens. It is an \noutrage that we are not adequately responding to the calls of public \nhealth officials at the Federal, State, and local levels who are \nclanging the alarm bells, imploring Congress to act.\n  Last week the House approved a Zika bill that is absolutely \nunacceptable. The bill the House passed would raid existing public \nhealth accounts, a dangerous precedent to set for appropriately \nresponding to public health crises. This is an approach that Dr. Fauci \nof the National Institutes of Health, the so-called Zika czar, has \ncalled illogical. Furthermore, it only authorizes use of funds through \nSeptember 30th. Let me assure you that mosquitos carrying the Zika \nvirus do not adhere to a congressional calendar.\n  The Republican bill does nothing to specifically help Puerto Rico \nwhere Zika is wreaking the most havoc and where close to 1,000 people \nhave been infected.\n  We need more funds now to equip our local health centers with testing \nkits. We need to assure the National Institutes of Health that there is \nsustained funding to develop a vaccine as well as a cure, and we need \nto protect our constituents. That is our responsibility.\n  It continues to baffle and frustrate so many of us that the majority \nwishes to address this crisis, this public health crisis, by combatting \nZika through robbing Peter to pay Paul. That is irresponsible. It is \nimmoral. And the majority will have to look in the eyes of the mothers \nwho have contracted the Zika virus beyond the point of which we will \nhave lost control of the ability to contain this virus and this public \nhealth crisis, look those mothers in the eye and explain why they did \nnothing to ensure that their babies were not born with birth defects. \nIt is unconscionable, and we need to act now.\n\n[[Page H3275]]\n\n  I urge the House to support the full request for funds and vote \n``no'' on the previous question.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, what is unconscionable is to make charges that are \nsimply untrue, and to suggest that there is money that has not been \ndeployed that would otherwise have been spent is untrue. Everything the \nadministration has wanted to spend, it has been able to spend.\n  Now, we hear a lot of talk about raiding funds. Let's talk about \nraiding funds. The administration took $500 million out of emergency \nresponse money--I believe in December or earlier this year--and \nredirected that to the global climate fund. That is money that was set \naside that could have been used for Zika. Instead, it is in a global \nclimate fund. The administration, in its own budget, took $40 million \nout of the Ebola fund and directed it into a worthy cause, malaria \nsuppression. So we don't have objection, but the idea that this money \nisn't used is untrue.\n  Now, when we hear discussions about the Ebola money, that is money \nthat was not to be spent in the next weeks or the next months, but in \nfuture years. We don't even know if it is enough or if it is too much. \nSo the idea that using some of it now in an immediate emergency is \nwrong with the idea and the commitment that that would be replenished \nlater, as needed, is the responsible thing to do.\n  As for NIH funding, in the Zika bill that this House passed, there \nare $230 million that fully funds the NIH's request for vaccination \nresearch for all of next year. So, again, the idea that money is not \navailable and they don't know what to do if we pass this legislation is \nuntrue.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  So I would just suggest again we look at the real difference here. It \nhas nothing to do with Zika response. It has everything to do with \nwhether or not you want to pay for it when you have the money available \nor you just want to add another $1.9 billion to the national credit \ncard.\n  It is thinking like that that got us into a situation where we were \nrunning $1.4 trillion deficits when my friends were in control on the \nother side. Where we still have a $450 billion, roughly, deficit for \nthis fiscal year--and it will go up next year--we ought to be doing \nthis in a prudent way.\n  Now, Zika response does not happen in a single day. It is something \nthat will last, frankly, over multiple months and years. The \nadministration's request for $1.9 billion is not for just today. It is \nfor at least a period of 2 years.\n  So they have the money they need right now. The bill provides the \nnext amount of money they need, and we will provide additional money in \nthe course of the appropriations process.\n  I want to assure everybody that nothing will not be done because the \nmoney was not available. To date, the administration has been able to \ndo everything it wanted to do. This debate that we are having here \ntoday is actually another step in that process.\n  This moves us toward conference. My friends probably look on the \nSenate bill with more favor than they do the House bill. Fair enough. \nWe will go to conference with the Senate. So the process is underway. \nIt is moving as it should.\n  When the administration asked for emergency funding, they immediately \ngot a response from Chairman Rogers, saying: Spend whatever you need to \nspend right now. We will back you up. We have made good on that \ncommitment. We are going to continue to make good on that commitment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Ms. Lowey).\n  Mrs. LOWEY. As my colleague knows, I have great respect for the \ndistinguished chairman of the Labor-HHS Subcommittee, for which we \ndon't even have a number right now, so we don't know how much we have \nto spend.\n  But I also would like to respond to your comments about we have \nenough now, we may have enough next year. We don't in the United States \nof America respond to crises on the installment plan. As you well know, \nDr. Frieden and Dr. Fauci have said: This is the request. We need the \nmoney.\n  This isn't extra money that we are requesting. This is what the \nexperts have requested to address this crisis now.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me just again make clear so that \neverybody understands this that this House Republican Zika bill \nprovides less than one-third of the funds requested by the President to \nrespond to the Zika threat. The House bill also cuts the request for \nresearch and development of vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics by \n$132 million, or 28.4 percent.\n  The House bill does not replace the more than $40 million taken from \nStates and cities for public health and emergency preparedness that HHS \nwas forced to move into the Zika response due to the inaction by \nCongress. The House bill also does not replace the more than $500 \nmillion taken from Ebola funds that HHS was forced to move into Zika \nresponse due to Congress' inaction.\n  Finally, to make matters worse, the House bill rescinds $622 million \nto pay for the Zika package, including taking an additional $352 \nmillion from Ebola. So the total being taken from Ebola efforts under \nthe House Republican approach reaches nearly $900 million.\n  Now, I appreciate the fact that we don't want to keep on adding to \nour national credit card, but we have no problem adding tens of \nbillions of dollars to the national credit card for war.\n  Well, this is also a war, a war for the health and welfare of the \nAmerican people and for the health and welfare of many women and \nchildren in this country. This is a big deal. This is an emergency. \nShame on us for not stepping up to the plate and doing what is right.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, there has been a great deal of discussion this morning \nabout the Ebola fund and how it is being used and in what ways it is \ngoing to be used. Let me just go back and make a few points to clarify \nthat situation.\n  When Congress acted, it appropriated almost $6 billion for Ebola. \nThat money was to be spent over years. It wasn't really clear whether \nit was too much or, frankly, not enough. We simply didn't know.\n  Now, the reality is, even after the amounts of money that my friend \nhas talked about that have been shifted from Ebola to deal with Zika, \nthat fund still has over $1.7 billion in it, more than enough to \nfinance all the planned activity not only for this fiscal year, but all \nof next fiscal year.\n  This is a multiyear fund. When you are in an emergency, it makes \nsense to take money like that and move it over, particularly with the \nassurance that that money will be replaced, as needed, in the regular \nappropriations process.\n  The administration itself is doing the same thing. In its own budget, \nit proposed taking money out of the Ebola fund and spending it on \nsomething else that it thought was more immediate. So the idea that \nthis is somehow unprecedented or different than what the administration \nis doing is simply not true.\n  Now, the reality is--again, my friends seem to imply or perhaps \nbelieve that there is something that hasn't been done to date that the \nFederal Government wanted to do on Zika. That is not true.\n  They have had the funds to do everything they have wanted to do. They \nwill continue to have the funds to do everything they want to do. So to \nsuggest that somehow they are not being funded is just not the case.\n  Frankly, we have effectively in the Zika bill advance funded money \nfor the NIH to actually begin research and have given them all the \nmoney in that bill they asked for for next fiscal year on the vaccine \nside of this.\n  So we will continue to work the process. We will continue to make \nsure that the resources are available to fight Zika because we all \nbelieve it is a danger. We will continue to do it in a responsible way \nby using the funds that are available, putting them on an immediate \nproblem, and replenishing accounts as we need to.\n  Again, I remind my friends that that is something the administration \nitself has been doing not only with Ebola funds, but with other funds, \nwhen it has moved emergency response money to the global climate fund. \nI mean, goodness, that was $500 million that,\n\n[[Page H3276]]\n\nhad it been left there, would have been available right now for Zika \nfor the response in other parts of the world.\n  So it is easy to get lost in the thicket of numbers here and this \nmuch from this pot and this much from that pot.\n  The reality is, number one, everything that the Federal Government \nhas wanted to do to date they have had the money to do.\n  Number two, it has been paid for.\n  Number three, we are proposing to continue that, making sure they \nhave all the funds that are needed, as needed, but we pay for them.\n\n  Number four, we are actually moving the process forward to sit down \nwith the Senate by passing this rule and the underlying legislation and \ngoing to conference and actually hammering out a common bill that will \nbe acceptable to all sides.\n  I appreciate the concern. I know it is genuine, quite frankly, but I \nalso know that we are acting and acting effectively to deal with the \nproblem.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for \nhis forceful arguments against this reckless rule that is before us \ntoday.\n  I rise, Mr. Speaker, in strong opposition to the rule and, really, in \na state of wonderment, wonderment about how on earth this Congress of \nthe United States can be so insensitive to a challenge to the American \npeople.\n  It is our responsibility to honor our preamble to the Constitution, \nto promote the general welfare. That is in the preamble of our \nConstitution, which we take an oath to defend.\n  The distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma, whom I respect, said just \nbe patient. No. No. Ninety-four days since the President of the United \nStates asked for the amount of resources necessary to address the Zika \ncrisis, an amount of money that was requested by the scientists, \ndocumented by the urgency of this challenge for the research and for \nthe prevention and for the resources needed to address this public \nhealth emergency.\n  I rise not only as the House Democratic leader, I rise as a mother \nand a grandmother, and I speak to parents and grandparents in this body \nbecause that is all I am allowed to speak to.\n  The questions that I have for you are: How can we ignore the \nPresident's scientifically based request expressed in the words of Dr. \nFauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases at the National Institutes of Health, a person, a healthcare \nleader in our country, a researcher, a scientist who has been described \nby President George Herbert Walker Bush as a hero--as a hero--in his \nwork for the American people and their public health?\n  Dr. Fauci says: If we don't get the money that the President has \nasked for, the $1.9 billion, that is going to have a very serious \nnegative impact on our ability to get the job done.\n  Another scientist, Dr. Tom Frieden, Director of the Centers for \nDisease Control, the public health agency to stop this threat, said: \nNever before in history has there been a situation where a bite from a \nmosquito can result in devastating fetal malformation.\n  Testimony went on to say that we are talking about children with \nirreversible brain damage who will never be able to walk, talk, see, or \nhear, children whose care over a lifetime is estimated to cost more \nthan $10 million.\n  The money is one thing. The devastation to that child and to that \nfamily is far more consequential. So the $1.9 billion is a great deal \nof money.\n  It is an emergency. It is a small price to pay to prevent \nirreversible brain damage in our children. It is a small price to pay \ninstead of saying to families: Don't think about having children now \nbecause of this epidemic.\n  The Republicans are treating the threat of Zika with so little \nseriousness that they decided to use the crisis as an opportunity to \neliminate protections for the water that our children drink.\n  The so-called Zika Vector Control Act the Republicans are adding to \nthis package this morning that they are asking you to vote for is \nnothing but a longstanding and craven repackaged Republican effort to \ngut the Clean Water Act. It is a pesticide Trojan horse that will do \nnothing to protect Americans from Zika.\n  This is really a dishonoring of our responsibility to protect and \ndefend our fellow Americans. As our distinguished member of the \nCommittee on Rules mentioned, this is a defense issue. It is about \nprotecting the American people.\n  This proposal today puts forth one-third of what the President has \nasked for--one-third. People say: Aren't you happy with one-third of a \nloaf? It is not one-third of a loaf. It is one-third of a shoe. You \ncannot get there from here with one-third.\n  It is really an insult to the scientists who have spoken out. \nActually, it is one-third of the President's request, but it is one-\nfifth of what the CDC has requested for the public health activities.\n  We must elevate the importance of the public health responsibility \nthat we have. If we had a natural disaster, FEMA has funds to come to \nthe rescue of the American people. That is our compact with the \nAmerican people, to help them in ways that they could never help \nthemselves because of the scope of the challenge.\n  This is no less a challenge. In fact, it would probably result in \nmore loss of life, malformation of unborn children. On top of that, \nthink of the negative impact it will have, distrust to travel to \ncertain regions in our country.\n  This is so reckless. Just when I thought I had seen it all on the \npart of the Republicans in the Congress to disregard meeting the needs \nof the American people, along comes this incomprehensible explanation \nto anybody why this might be a proposal worthy of the floor of the \nHouse, worthy of the public health challenge to the American people, \nworthy of our concerns about the American people.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  My Republican colleagues, you have outdone yourselves today. What you \nare doing is reckless. In this bill, we should be meeting this \nchallenge the way we meet emergencies: with adequate resources, which \nwill end up saving money because they will be an investment in the \nhealth of the American people. It has been over 90 days since the \nPresident has made the request.\n  I will just say this one other thing. It is not our role to instill \nfear, but we have to face the challenge in a very clear-eyed way. The \nvirus from this mosquito is sexually transmitted. We have no idea--it \ncould be as long as 18 months--how long it would reside in a gentleman \nwho might be bitten by the mosquito. It could be over a year, it could \nbe shorter, but it is not one night.\n  Secondly, if you get bitten by this mosquito when you travel \nsomeplace where it might be pervasive, you not only get bitten \nyourself, you bring it home. Again, it is sexually transmitted.\n  It is transmitted in even more pervasive ways. Any other garden \nvariety mosquito that would bite you, who have already been bitten by \nthe other mosquito, now is a carrier of that virus. We turn garden \nvariety mosquitoes into an army on the assault of the public health of \nthe American people.\n  So, again, as a mother and a grandmother, as a parent, and for the \nfathers and grandfathers who serve here, think of the children, think \nof the risk, think of the responsibility that we have. Think of the \nirresponsibility of this bill before us today and the reckless \ndisregard for public health in our country that the Republicans are \nputting forth in this legislation, and vote ``no.''\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time we have \nremaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma has 13 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 11 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by saying I also have a great deal of \nrespect for the distinguished minority leader. She used in her remarks \nand made the point that the President had asked for a number of things.\n  Last year, the President asked for a billion dollars more for the \nNIH. We said: You know, we didn't think you asked for enough, so we are \ngoing to give you $2 billion.\n  Somehow, that seems to get lost.\n  Last year, the President sent down his request for the Centers for \nDisease\n\n[[Page H3277]]\n\nControl. We said: You know, we don't think you are spending enough on \npublic health, Mr. President. We are going to spend more money than you \nasked for.\n  This year, when the President submitted his budget, he decided: I am \ngoing to take a billion dollars of discretionary spending away from the \nNational Institutes of Health and spend it someplace else.\n  We said: No, Mr. President; we think that is pretty reckless.\n  By the way, my Democratic friends agreed with that, too.\n  We said: We are not going to let you take a billion dollars of \ndiscretionary money away from the NIH and spend it someplace else. We \nare going to keep it right there. And, by the way, we are going to put \nmore money than you asked for in this agency when the bill comes out, \nand we are probably going to do the same thing for the Centers for \nDisease Control.\n  So, to suggest that the President hasn't gotten what he has asked for \nis to, frankly, misstate the facts.\n  We have had a great deal of mention that the President has had the \nrequest for 94 days. What we have not had is one shred of evidence \nthat, in those 94 days, he has not had the money to do every single \nthing he wanted to do. Indeed, the chairman of the committee urged him \nto start spending money immediately to do that. So there has been no \nloss of effort, and the bill in front of us now funds it for the rest \nof the fiscal year. It also funds the research on the vaccine at the \nNIH into next year.\n  So, again, I am just going to simply disagree with my friend that \nmoney has not been available. It has been available; and, frankly, to \nthe appropriate agencies, more money has been available than the \nPresident has asked for. More money will be available next year than he \nasked for.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nSessions), the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee and my \ngood friend.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman, not only a \nmember of the Rules Committee, but an appropriator who is directly in \nline with and understands the needs of not only the American people as \nit relates to the NIH, but also the funding mechanisms.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand up to really disagree with the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia. To call my party and our efforts reckless and \nirresponsible, I believe, is unfair.\n  I believe it is unfair because, last night at the Rules Committee, we \nhad this virtually same discussion. And the discussion started with me \nwhen I said that I had Republicans and Democrats, only Monday, with the \nDirector of NIH, Dr. Francis Collins, and the Director of the Institute \nof Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and we talked \ndirectly about this issue.\n  What we learned, Mr. Speaker, is that there was a request for \nadditional money and that the NIH had some $600 million that was \nsitting in a fund from Ebola that had not been completely used. A \ndetermination was made--including the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. \nCole), Hal Rogers, and Nita Lowey, who were engaged in the decision--\nthat said we will allow the money to be switched over if you would like \nto do that. Switch it over and use that money for this specific event \nthat we are now looking at. What happened is they used the money very \nquickly. They accelerated spending the money--that is fine; we want \nthem to do what they need to do--some $600 million.\n  As soon as that was known, the gentlewoman Mrs. Lowey, the gentleman \nMr. Rogers, and the gentleman Mr. Cole went about looking at a request \nto fill for the next 5 months what would be some $1.2 billion that \nwould be spent just this year remaining--we are in May--just until the \nend of September.\n  The President asked for $1.9 billion for 5 years, and we gave $1.2 \nbillion of that $1.9 for 5 months. We are accelerating the money that \nis necessary to NIH.\n  The minority leader outlined how terrible this destructive behavior \ncan be to a child, to an embryo. We agree. But to suggest that \nRepublicans are reckless is not fair.\n  What is fair to say is that we are responding appropriately, we are \nresponding immediately, and we are putting it together before we are \ngone next week on a district work period. We are doing it this week. We \nare moving it as quickly as possibly. If we weren't, we would be \naccused of the reverse, evidently.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Republican Party, the gentleman Mr. Cole, the \ngentleman Mr. Rogers, and our Speaker care about people. We are doing \nthe right thing.\n  Now, in the Rules Committee, the gentleman Dr. Michael Burgess, \nacknowledged some other frailties that he sees from the \nadministration's point, and that would be: Where is the alert to \ncities? Where is the administrative action to say let's do something \nabout alerting travelers? Where is the information that is going to \npublic health officials? Where are we preparing ourselves to look at \nwhat would happen in Brazil? What is the administration doing other \nthan just accusing us of not spending more money?\n\n  Mr. Speaker, we all live in glass houses. We need to look at this the \nsame way, and calling each other names is not a way to get there.\n  So, Mr. Cole will be responsible and reasonable; Hal Rogers, the \nchairman of our Appropriations Committee, will responsible. I said to \nmy committee last night, as quickly as we need to get together, the \nRules Committee will come in, even if it is on an emergency basis, to \nhandle this, based upon a request. And that is what we are going to do.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and \nRelated Agencies.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I just will say, what my colleague, Mr. \nSessions, just said: that the NIH had $600 million in unused Ebola \nmoney, that really is false. The NIH has used all of its Ebola funds \nthat Congress allocated. So the statement of the gentleman from Texas \nis not factual.\n  The Zika virus is a public health emergency. It is a crisis, and we \nmust treat it as such. As of last week, there were almost 1,400 \nconfirmed cases of Zika in the United States and its territories. \nNearly 300 of them are pregnant women. And one person has died.\n  This Congress, when we appropriate money for defense or defense \nspending or for wars, Republicans say: Listen to the generals in the \nfield; they are the ones who know best. Well, we are in the midst of a \nwar against the Zika virus, and we should be listening to the generals \nand the experts in the field. And who are they? They are at the Centers \nfor Disease Control; they are at the National Institutes of Health; and \nthey are the scientists in our country.\n  We need to give them the resources that they need, and they have told \nus that they need $1.9 billion. We should do the right thing. We should \nfund their request. One-third of that request, which is what the House \nRepublicans have proposed, is not adequate.\n  Typically, microcephaly occurs in 0.02 percent to 0.12 percent of all \nU.S. births, but The Washington Post reported yesterday that, among \nZika-infected pregnant women, that risk is as high as 13 percent.\n  This summer, every woman who is pregnant or trying to get pregnant \nwill be afraid: afraid to go out on the patio, afraid to take your kids \nto the Little League, afraid to go to a barbecue. It is our duty here \nto do everything that we can to ease those fears, to stop this disease \nfrom spreading any further.\n  We must not put American women in a predicament of choosing whether \nor not they should get pregnant or, if they are already pregnant, \nwondering whether or not their baby is going to be okay.\n  Ron Klain, the Ebola czar, wrote in The Washington Post: ``It is not \na question of whether babies will be born in the United States with \nZika-related microcephaly--it is a question of when and how many. For \nyears to come, these children will be a visible, human reminder of the \ncost of absurd wrangling in Washington, of preventable suffering, of a \nfailure of our political system to respond to the threat that \ninfectious diseases pose.''\n  According to the CDC, pregnant women are already facing unacceptably \nlong delays in learning Zika results. CDC Director Tom Frieden has said \nthat experts estimate a single child with birth defects can usually \ncost $10 million to care for--or more. That says\n\n[[Page H3278]]\n\nnothing about the life of that child with microcephaly. They cannot \neat; they cannot speak; they cannot walk.\n  I do not often quote Senator Marco Rubio, but last week, he said:\n\n       It is a mistake for Congress to try to deal with the Zika \n     virus on the cheap. If we don't spend money on the front end, \n     I think we are going to spend a lot more later, because this \n     problem is not going away.\n\n  We could not agree more. We have stolen $44 million from our States \nto deal with this crisis, and the Republican bill does not reimburse \nour States for the money that they need for dealing with emergencies \nsuch as this.\n  We should defeat the previous question, and we should consider the \nLowey-DeLauro-Wasserman Schultz amendment and fully fund the \nPresident's request of $1.9 billion. It is the responsible and moral \nthing to do.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Lucas). The time of the gentlewoman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Months from now, when the results of our inaction become \napparent, we will ask ourselves: Why did we delay? Why did we wait?\n  We must take appropriate action now. We must reject the previous \nquestion. We must do what is the morally right thing for the people of \nthis country who put their faith and trust in us to come and represent \ntheir best interests and the public health.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma has 7 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 6\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I want to thank Ms. DeLauro, the ranking member of the Subcommittee \non Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the story in The Washington Post. It is front \npage. It is about the crisis that we confront, about the danger to \nAmericans' health, about the dangers that young children will be born \nwith microcephaly.\n  Dr. Frieden, the head of our communicable disease operation and \ndefense force, if you will, says it will cost $10 million per baby born \nwith microcephaly; $10 million per child. That does not count the \nheartache that will be counted.\n  I want to tell my friend, Mr. Cole--and he is a dear friend and a \ngood legislator--the action you take today belies the representation \nyou have made.\n  What do I mean by that?\n  If there is enough money now, as Mr. Cole argues, why take this \naction?\n  This was not scheduled earlier this week. This was not have a rule \nuntil 9:30 last night. So if the gentleman's proposition is correct, \nthat there are sufficient funds right now, we don't need to act on this \nbill today.\n  So why, my friends, are we acting on it today?\n  Because the public believes we ought to act. And the Republicans are \ntrying to protect themselves against the attack, that they took no \naction until 94 days into the President's request because, if Mr. Cole \nis right, we need not worry: there is plenty of money available.\n  But they know the American people don't agree with that. So 9:30, in \nthe dead of night, they passed this rule, brought it to the floor so \nthat they can say: Oh, we have acted.\n  Nothing, my friends, will happen as a result of what we do today. The \nSenate passed a bill with 69 votes, $1.1 billion, not taking from Ebola \ndefense, not taking from the other health needs of America, as our bill \ndoes, but saying: this is an emergency.\n  Now, very frankly, my friends on your side of the aisle, Mr. Cole, \nwhen you want $18 billion from defense, you have no problem not paying \nfor it. You take it from OCO, which is not scored. No problem. But when \nthe President asks for $1.9 billion, about a tenth of that, well, my \ngoodness, this is a problem. It is, after all, not the Taliban. It is \nnot Iran. We have to protect against that. It is a health crisis in \nAmerica, and we have fiddled for 94 days.\n  If, in fact, Mr. Cole's representation is correct, there is no need \nto act. But if the actions that they are taking speak loudly that, yes, \nthere is a need to tell the American people: we get it; there is a \ncrisis; we are going to act, the problem is nothing will happen as a \nresult of this action, other than a bill will go over to the Senate, \nwith which the Senate does not agree. They passed a bill with 69 votes. \nHalf of the Republicans, all of the Democrats, said we need the $1.1 \nbillion.\n  Now, the President asked for $1.9 billion, but what they didn't do is \nsteal from Ebola, steal from other health priorities.\n  And I hear the gentleman talking about how much money is out there, \nbut if that is true, why did we need to act in the dead of night last \nnight and today, just as we walk out the door?\n  We have not dealt with Zika. We will not have dealt with Zika.\n  We haven't acted on the Puerto Rican debt. We haven't acted on a \nbudget resolution. We haven't acted on the Flint water crisis. We \nhaven't acted on criminal justice reform. And we haven't acted on the \nVoting Rights Act.\n  This is a cover vote. Vote ``no.''\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to reply to my very good friend from Maryland, \nwhom I have not only great esteem for, but, frankly, great personal \naffection for, and I want to respond to his question. This is not a \ncover vote.\n  First of all, the main item here is actually veterans and military \nconstruction that is over $83 billion; that, through normal order, is \nmoving forward. Now, to also move the Zika bill with it makes a lot of \nsense.\n  Frankly, one of the things in this bill--and I disagree with my \nfriend's characterization--we want to make sure that misguided \nenvironmental regulations don't stop us from deploying pesticides that \nwe may need. That is in this bill. That is pretty important to move \nforward.\n  The funding is also important. Now, my friends seem to forget, again, \nthe long record here of who has been willing to support the NIH and who \nhas been willing to support the CDC. We gave the NIH twice what the \nPresident asked for in additional new money last year. That is being \nspent right now, by the way. We also gave the Centers for Disease \nControl more money than the President asked for. This year, when the \nPresident tried to take $1 billion of discretionary money away from the \nNIH, both Republicans and Democrats on the Appropriations Committee \nsaid: No, Mr. President, we are not going to let you raid NIH and take \nmoney away and weaken the healthcare apparatus of the United States.\n  I made the point then--and I can assure my friends we will be happy \nto back it up--that we will put more money into NIH this year for next \nfiscal year than the President actually requests.\n  Now, in terms of Zika, the moment there was a crisis, the chairman of \nthis committee, Hal Rogers, immediately sent a letter to the President \nand said: Spend all the money you need. There are whole pots of it in \ndifferent spots. We will replace the dollars as they are needed.\n  So taking money out of funds that were meant to be spent over years \nand using them in immediate crises is not unusual. Indeed, the \nadministration itself has done this twice in recent months: once taking \n$500 million from the Emergency Response Fund in the Department of \nState and spending it on climate change, instead of an emergency \nresponse; $40 million in their own budget out of Ebola money that they \nwere going to spend on malaria money.\n  I don't condemn them for that, by the way. They just simply were \nusing something and they said: This is an account that is going to take \nseveral years. We want to deal with malaria right now. Let's take some \nof that money. If we have got a problem later, we will fix it.\n  That is all that is going on here. At the end of the day, the amount \nof resources that are necessary will be made available. The only \ndifference here is one side wants to pay for it and not add to the \nnational debt. The other side really doesn't think that is a big \nconsideration. That is a debate worth having. I don't mind having that \ndebate.\n\n[[Page H3279]]\n\n  But we heard the word ``reckless'' earlier. It is also shameless to \nexploit a crisis for political gain, and I think we are seeing some of \nthat here today. Some of it is sincere, but some of it is great \ntheatrics. It doesn't change the fact that when the President made his \nrequest, he has had every dime he has needed for that 94 days.\n  When my friends say the Republican bill only provides a third of the \nmoney, they somehow forget a third had already been provided. This is \nthe second third. The rest of it will come. The money is to be spent as \nthe administration requested, not over weeks or days, but over months \nand years. That is how they have proposed to deploy it. So giving them \nthe money as they need it instead of writing them a blank check and not \neven paying for it ahead of time seems to us to be the prudent and \nresponsible thing to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Thomas Frieden, the Director of the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, just recently said in response to the \nway this House has handled funding for the Zika crisis:\n  ``This is no way to fight an epidemic. Three months is an eternity \nfor control of an outbreak. There is a narrow window of opportunity \nhere and it's closing. Every day that passes makes it harder to stop \nZika.''\n  So whether it is Dr. Frieden, or Dr. Fauci, or any of our Nation's \nleading scientists or medical experts who all say that what is going on \nhere today is grossly inadequate, my friends on the other side of the \naisle seem to think that they know more than our scientists and medical \nexperts; at least they have convinced themselves that they know more.\n  Well, they haven't convinced me and they haven't convinced the \nmajority of the American people who are watching this in disbelief.\n  This is an emergency. This is a crisis. Why aren't we acting more \naggressively?\n  I include in the Congressional Record a letter to Congress from the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, and our National \nSecurity Adviser, in which they talk about the importance of multi-year \nfunding, long-term funding because they have multiyear commitments that \nthey need to make to the private sector in order to prioritize Zika, in \norder to develop vaccines and other prevention to protect the American \npeople.\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2016.\n     Hon. Paul D. Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan: As you are aware, on February 22, the \n     Administration transmitted to Congress its formal request for \n     $1.9 billion in emergency supplemental funding to address the \n     public health threat posed by the Zika virus. Sixty-four days \n     have passed since this initial request; yet still Congress \n     has not acted.\n       Since the time the Administration transmitted its request, \n     the public health threat posed by the Zika virus has \n     increased. After careful review of existing evidence, \n     scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC) concluded that the Zika virus is a cause of \n     microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. The Zika \n     virus has spread in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the U.S. \n     Virgin Islands and abroad. As of April 20, there were 891 \n     confirmed Zika cases in the continental United States and \n     U.S. territories, including 81 pregnant women with confirmed \n     cases of Zika. Based on similar experiences with other \n     diseases transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito--believed \n     to be the primary carrier of the Zika virus--scientists at \n     the CDC expect there could be local transmission within the \n     continental U.S. in the summer months. Updated estimate range \n     maps show that these mosquitoes have been found in cities as \n     far north as San Francisco, Kansas City and New York City.\n       In the absence of action from Congress to address the Zika \n     virus, the Administration has taken concrete and aggressive \n     steps to help keep America safe from this growing public \n     health threat. The Administration is working closely with \n     State and local governments to prepare for outbreaks in the \n     continental United States and to respond to the current \n     outbreak in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. We are \n     expanding mosquito control surveillance and laboratory \n     capacity; developing improved diagnostics as well as \n     vaccines; supporting affected expectant mothers, and \n     supporting other Zika response efforts in Puerto Rico, the \n     U.S. territories, the continental United States, and abroad. \n     These efforts are crucial, but they are costly and they fall \n     well outside of current agency appropriations. To meet these \n     immediate needs, the Administration conducted a careful \n     examination of existing Ebola balances and identified $510 \n     million to redirect towards Zika response activities. We have \n     also redirected an additional $79 million from other \n     activities. This reprogramming, while necessary, is not \n     without cost. It is particularly painful at a time when state \n     and local public health departments are already strained.\n       While this immediate infusion of resources is necessary to \n     enable the Administration to take critical first steps in our \n     response to the public health threat posed by Zika, it is \n     insufficient. Without significant additional appropriations \n     this summer, the Nation's efforts to comprehensively respond \n     to the disease will be severely undermined. In particular, \n     the Administration may need to suspend crucial activities, \n     such as mosquito control and surveillance in the absence of \n     emergency supplemental funding. State and local governments \n     that manage mosquito control and response operations will not \n     be able to hire needed responders to engage in mosquito \n     mitigation efforts. Additionally, the Administration's \n     ability to move to the next phase of vaccine development, \n     which requites multi-year commitments from the Government to \n     encourage the private sector to prioritize Zika research and \n     development, could be jeopardized. Without emergency \n     supplemental funding, the development of faster and more \n     accurate diagnostic tests also will be impeded. The \n     Administration may not be able to conduct follow up of \n     children born to pregnant women with Zika to better \n     understand the range of Zika impacts, particularly those \n     health effects that are not evident at birth. The \n     supplemental request is also needed to replenish the amounts \n     that we are now spending from our Ebola accounts to fund \n     Zika-related activities. This will ensure we have sufficient \n     contingency funds to address unanticipated needs related to \n     both Zika and Ebola. As we have seen with both Ebola and \n     Zika, there are still many unknowns about the science and \n     scale of the outbreak and how it will impact mothers, babies, \n     and health systems domestically and abroad.\n       The Administration is pleased to learn that there is \n     bipartisan support for providing emergency funding to address \n     the Zika crisis, but we remain concerned about the adequacy \n     and speed of this response. To properly protect the American \n     public, and in particular pregnant women and their newborns, \n     Congress must fund the Administration's request of $1.9 \n     billion and find a path forward to address this public health \n     emergency immediately. The American people deserve action \n     now. With the summer months fast approaching, we continue to \n     believe that the Zika supplemental should not be considered \n     as part of the regular appropriations process, as it relates \n     to funding we must receive this year in order to most \n     effectively prepare for and mitigate the impact of the virus.\n       We urge you to pass free-standing emergency supplemental \n     funding legislation at the level requested by the \n     Administration before Congress leaves town for the Memorial \n     Day recess. We look forward to working with you to protect \n     the safety and health of all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n     Shaun Donovan,\n       Director, The Office of Management and Budget.\n     Susan Rice,\n       National Security Advisor.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, what we are doing here today represents a \nfailure, a miserable failure. This represents a failure of this \nCongress to do everything humanly possible to protect the people of \nthis country. It is shameful. It is unbelievable.\n  A rigid, right-wing ideology is trumping common sense, is trumping \ndoing what is right, what I think most of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle understand.\n  We need to aggressively fight this crisis. And here is the deal: if \nwe don't get this right, all the talk about fiscal responsibility and \ncontrolling the debt goes out the window because the cost of this \ncrisis getting out of control is astronomical.\n  Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle can explain \naway or rationalize or justify this inadequate response all they want, \nbut it is reckless and irresponsible.\n  And for the life of me, I can't understand why on this issue, as we \nare confronted with this health crisis, we all can't come together and \ndo what is right.\n  When it comes to wars halfway around the world, nobody cares about \npaying for it; but when it comes to a war to confront a healthcare \nepidemic, crisis, to confront an epidemic, my friends can't find the \nmoney.\n  Please vote ``no'' on the previous question so we can actually have \nan amendment to properly fund this. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' \non the previous question and ``no'' on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H3280]]\n\n  I want to respond quickly to some of my friend's points, Mr. Speaker, \nand I want to go back to the essential reality that we are facing.\n  Number 1, last year, when the President asked for $1 billion more for \nNIH, we said: That is not enough. We are going to give you two.\n  Last year the President submitted a request for CDC. We looked at it \nand said: You know, it is not enough. You evidently don't care enough \nabout public health, Mr. President. We are going to spend more money.\n  This year he brought us a request to try and take $1 billion of \ndiscretionary funding away from NIH. My friends on the other side were \nas appalled as we were. We said: No, Mr. President, you are not going \nto take $1 billion out of NIH in a dangerous time of disease. We are \nnot only going to keep that money there, we are going to put more \nmoney, additional money than you asked for.\n  We said the same thing about the CDC, and so we will do it.\n  In terms of what has been done, the minute the Zika virus appeared \nand the administration asked for emergency money, Hal Rogers, the \nchairman of the committee, responded and said: Spend whatever it takes.\n  And, indeed, the administration has done that.\n  My friends seem to suggest that there is something that hasn't been \ndone, yet they never tell us what that one thing is.\n  The reality is the administration has had the money to do everything \nit has wanted to do. This bill provides more money on top of that. Our \nSenators are proposing even more, so we go to conference to figure out \nthe appropriate amount and whether or not and to what degree it should \nbe paid for. I would hope it is all paid for. It should be because we \nhave the funds to do that.\n  So to suggest that there is some sort of failure of funding is simply \nnot true, and my friends know it is not true. To suggest that we are \nnot willing to put the money here would suggest that recent history has \nno relevance, because we have put more money here than the President \nasked us to put, and we have committed to put even more going forward.\n  The only difference here, and what drives my friends into a frenzy, \nis that we actually want to pay for this. They simply don't. They \nthink, let's just put another $1.9 billion on the national credit card. \nThis is a great excuse to do that.\n  Well, we are not prepared to do that, but we are prepared to respond \nto the legitimate needs of the American people and use the resources \nthat we have.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, in closing, I agree with my colleagues on the other \nside. We should address the issue. We disagree with the other body on \nhow to do it, and we will go on from there.\n  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nconference on these important issues.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:\n\n          An amendment to H. Res. 751 Offered by Mr. McGovern\n\n       On page 2, line 4, insert ``as modified by the amendment \n     specified in section 2 of this resolution'' before the \n     semicolon.\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     section:\n       Sec.2. The amendment referred to in section 1(a) is as \n     follows: Strike divisions B and C and insert the text of H.R. \n     5044 as introduced.\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/house-section/article/H3280-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3280-H3283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  2017\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

If not, the Chair will put them en gros.\n  The amendments were agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. I am opposed to the bill in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Langevin moves to recommit the bill H.R. 5055 to the \n     Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report the \n     same back to the House forthwith with the following \n     amendment:\n       In the ``Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation'' account on page \n     53, line 11, after the dollar amount, insert ``(increased by \n     $20,000,000)''.\n       In the ``Federal Salaries and Expenses'' account on page \n     54, line 14, after the dollar amount relating to the National \n     Nuclear Security Administration, insert ``(reduced by \n     $20,000,000)''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Rhode Island is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich would not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthe bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, this amendment is simple. It adds $20 million to nuclear \nnonproliferation accounts so that nuclear materials do not fall into \nthe wrong hands.\n  The possibility that terrorists or rogue nations will acquire nuclear \nweapons, fissile material, or radiological material that could be used \nin a dirty bomb are among the gravest threats facing our Nation and the \ninternational community.\n  Right now, luckily--though there are, of course, exceptions--these \nmost dangerous weapons are in the hands of responsible actors. We \ncannot allow that dynamic to shift, and we must ensure that these \nweapons never fall into the hands of bad actors who would seek to do us \nor the rest of the international community harm.\n  However, today, there is more fissile material in the world than at \nany other time in our history, and the bad actors are taking notice. \nAccording to several studies conducted at Harvard, at least two \nterrorist groups--al Qaeda and the Japanese terror cult Aum Shinrikyo--\nhave made serious efforts to buy, steal, or otherwise obtain nuclear \nweapons in recent years.\n  There is clear evidence that ISIL would, if given the opportunity, \nstrive to do us great harm. After all, it only takes a grapefruit-sized \namount of highly enriched uranium to make a nuclear weapon, and there \nare hundreds of metric tons of material out there, some of which is \nstill vulnerable to theft. Now, according to reports, ISIL has been \nmonitoring a senior official of a Belgian facility, by way of example, \nwith substantial stocks of highly enriched uranium.\n  We absolutely cannot assume the risk that the United States would be \nambushed by a rogue nuclear threat, and we must not leave ourselves \nexposed to a threat that would forever change our American way of life. \nWhile we can never protect against every threat, we can, however, \nmitigate it by working with our international partners, Federal \nagencies, national laboratories, and the private sector to more quickly \nsecure and eliminate vulnerable nuclear materials.\n  Small investments, such as the ones offered in this amendment, can \nyield significant national security benefits. By moving $20 million \ninto the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account, we would ultimately \nmake our country--and the world--a safer place to live.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress has worked across the aisle on this issue many \ntimes before, and we have seen some incredible success stories that \nhave a profound impact on the security of our nuclear materials.\n  During the fiscal year 2012 Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations bill, the House approved an amendment--by a voice vote, \nno less--offered by Congressman Fortenberry and Congresswoman Sanchez \nto do exactly what this motion to recommit seeks to do today.\n  Their amendment to increase appropriations for the Global Threat \nReduction Initiative under the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account \nwas enthusiastically supported on both sides of this Chamber, securing \nan important bipartisan victory for the international effort to secure \nvulnerable fissile material and keeping our Nation safe from the threat \nof nuclear terrorism.\n  Mr. Speaker, this House did not cower when faced with this challenge \nback then, and we must not do so today. Let today be another one of \nthose bipartisan success stories. Let us redouble our efforts to \nprevent the proliferation and catastrophic abuse of sensitive nuclear \nmaterials and technologies across the globe and here at home.\n  I beseech my fellow Members, adopt this amendment, keep our Nation \nsafe, and deny the nuclear terrorists who would seek to do us harm \ntheir own success story.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5055, is a good bill that invests \n$37.4 billion in priorities we can all support--national security, \ncritical water resources, infrastructure projects for our districts, \nand energy independence--through an all-of-the-above approach.\n  First and foremost, this legislation is a defense bill. $19.44 \nbillion out of the 37.4 billion, or 51 percent, is dedicated toward our \nnational security. Carrying out our Nation's nuclear deterrence mission \nis, in part, the responsibility of the Department of Energy; while DOD \nprovides delivery vehicles and operators, DOE provides nuclear warheads \nthemselves.\n  Congress provides funding for this critical defense mission through \nthe Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. As we drafted \nthis bill, we carefully considered 2,700 Member requests. This \nlegislation addresses 95 percent of those requests in one form or \nanother. This included four requests from Democratic Members to fund \nnonproliferation programs at the budget request level of $1.8 billion, \nwhich this bill does.\n  I agree that nonproliferation is a critical part of our overall \nnuclear defense strategy. We need to be doing everything we can to keep \ndangerous nuclear materials away from rogue nations and terrorists. \nExtra funding for DOE nonproliferation programs, however, is not the \nonly way to do this. We must also provide for a strong defense \ncapability, and this bill accomplishes that.\n  While I appreciate the passion for the nonproliferation and securing \nthese materials abroad, I would also like to see the same passion for \nsecuring these materials at home. While the prospect of a terrorist \ngetting hold of nuclear materials in the Middle East, Africa, or East \nAsia is terrifying, the prospect of them getting ahold of these \nmaterials in Tennessee, Texas, or California is even more so.\n  In 2012, three peace activists--a drifter, an 82-year-old nun, and a \nhouse painter--penetrated the exterior of the Y-12 National Security \nComplex in Tennessee, supposedly one of the most secure nuclear \nfacilities in the United States. If they had been terrorists armed with \nexplosives, that scenario would be frightening to imagine. That is why \nthis funding in this bill is so critical.\n  The bill increases funding $30 million above the request to improve \nsecurity at aging nuclear weapons facilities to make sure our own \nnuclear materials are secure on our home soil and address a backlog of \n$2 billion in security upgrades needed at nuclear weapons facilities.\n  In a tight fiscal environment, we need to be making these investments \nat our own nuclear facilities, not spending American taxpayer dollars \nto perform work in Russia's nuclear facilities.\n\n[[Page H3282]]\n\n  In addition to these investments, the bill also continues \nprohibitions on funding for nonproliferation projects in Russia, which \nis spending billions of dollars on its own nuclear modernization.\n  In all, this is a fiscally responsible, economically smart, and \ncritically important national security bill. It deserves to be passed \nquickly without further changes or delays.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this motion and to \nsupport the underlying bill.\n  Lastly, let me say, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate every Member of this \nbody, on both sides of the aisle, for the 2 days of debate we have put \nin for the amendments that we have debated and the respectful debate \nthat we have had on a lot of important issues. It has been a good \ndebate, and I look forward to seeing my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle who had some of their amendments adopted now voting for this \nbill because of the amendments that were adopted in the Committee of \nthe Whole.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to vote against this motion to recommit \nand vote for passage of the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

This is not the time for the presumptive \nnominee of the Republican Party to call for debates that are frivolous \nand for entertainment.\n  We in the United States Congress have to do our jobs.

JANE MAHARAM\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, Jane Maharam was, above all, a \nsurvivor. She always rose above adversity. She was a teacher, a music \nproducer, a textile owner, a mother, a grandmother. She was happily \nmarried to her childhood sweetheart, but 31 years after her marriage, \nher husband took off in the darkness of the night with the property.\n  After a 15-year court battle, her ex-husband was ordered to return \nher assets, but instead of following the court order, he snuck off \nagain, hiding in another State. Jane was left with nothing. She was \nforced to rely on public assistance.\n  There are many spouses like Jane who find themselves victims of this \ninjustice. Jane's Law provides Federal enforcement to retrieve stolen \nmarital property that is illegally taken across State lines. It targets \nstealing spouses who have deliberately evaded payment. Jane's motto, \nthough, was: Don't give up.\n  Her passion drove me and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) \nalong with a number of other House Members to champion Jane's Law.\n  Jane Maharam died recently on April 28, 2016, at the age of 85. She \nwas a strong-spirited woman but, Madam Speaker, she died without \njustice. To honor her memory, we must pass Jane's Law to rectify this \ninjustice that she had to live through.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/house-section/article/H3286-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Asian Pacific \nIslander Heritage Month, but also to highlight the harmful impact of \npoverty on the AAPI community all across our Nation.\n  In my home district--the beautiful East Bay--and across the Nation, \nthe achievements of Asian Pacific Americans are front and center. By \nserving in elected office, advocating for equality and justice, and \ncreating new businesses, they are an integral part of our vibrant \ncommunity.\n  But far too many Asian Pacific Americans are just making ends meet. \nIt is a struggle, and the American Dream seems far out of reach. The \nsad reality is that in 2016, poverty rates for Asian Americans is over \n12 percent. And this problem is getting worse. Since the Great \nRecession, the AAPI community has had one of the fastest growing \npoverty rates in the Nation.\n  There are also enormous disparities in healthcare access, treatment, \nand outcomes for the AAPI community. Too many Asian Pacific Americans \nstill lack the fundamental human right that is health care.\n  As chair of the Democratic Whip Task Force on Poverty, Income \nInequality, and Opportunity, I will continue to fight to help all \nhardworking Americans--all hardworking Americans--including the Asian \nPacific American community, achieve the American Dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/house-section/article/H3286-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1145\n                            ZIKA VECTOR ACT\n\n  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ALLEN.

It \nis another classic example of the Federal Government finding problems \nin every solution.\n  Now is not the time to nit-pick policies for politically charged \nreasons. The Zika virus is a public health emergency that deserves our \nimmediate attention.\n  This is close to home for me. My youngest daughter is in her first \ntrimester with her third child. We need an all-hands-on-deck approach \nto deal with Zika. We cannot let it get caught up in Washington \npolitics.\n  With the summer months approaching rapidly, we need to harness our \nresources and wipe out this virus. I would hope that we can all agree \nthat the Federal Government should not be making it harder for people \nto kill mosquitoes, which could be carrying Zika, with pesticides.\n  I strongly support this legislation, and I encourage the \nadministration to change their position on this legislation.

Disney cares about wait \ntime. In fact, there is an app for that. I can get on my phone right \nnow and tell you it takes 90 minutes to get on Space Mountain in \nFlorida.\n  The VA needs to take an example from Disney. They are legendary for \ntheir customer service, cleanliness, efficiency, and the fact that they \nnever say no to anyone.\n  Our VA right now is a national disgrace.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, since December 15, 1791, nearly 225 \nyears, our Congress has operated under the constitutional requirement \nto do the following. Amendment 1 of the Bill of Rights to the \nConstitution of the United States of America:\n  ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, \nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of \nspeech, or the press; or the right of the people to peaceably assemble, \nand to petition the government for a regress of grievances.''\n  I am saddened, Madam Speaker, that, in our current day, the greatest \nassault on the free exercise of religion is being perpetuated, \nseemingly, by those most responsible to protect it: those who are sworn \nto uphold the law.\n  Worse still, we see our Armed Forces, whose singular purpose is to \nsupport and defend the Constitution, now perpetually being used as the \nvehicle to subvert the very document that they risked their lives to \ndefend.\n  In a recent example, we have seen executive guidance with regard to \nreligious corporations, religious associations, religious educational \ninstitutions, and religious societies placed in jeopardy.\n  More than 2,000 Federal Government contracts a year are awarded to \nreligious organizations and contractors that provide essential services \nin many vital programs. Now many of these services are being impacted \ndue to conflicting, ambiguous executive guidance.\n  Here are some examples:\n  Chaplain services. Multiple organizations provide chaplains and \nrelated services to the military and other government agencies.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  Chaplains have faced significant religious liberty challenges in \npursuing contracts with religious education directories, youth \nministers, musicians, and other religious service providers who adhere \nto the teachings of their particular faith. Without protecting free \nexercise of religion, chaplains have been forced to hire people that \nwork directly against their teachings, tenets, and faith. This is a \nclear violation of the First Amendment.\n  Here is another example: refugee service providers. The vast majority \nof refugee and suffering vulnerable population relief is done by \nreligious service organizations. I have worked with many on \nbattlefields in my time as a career soldier.\n  Because of bad agency guidance, now these organizations are facing \nmounting liability related to their performance under grants, \ncontracts, and cooperative agreements. Sadly, when these organizations \ncannot partner with the government, the relief of human suffering just \ngoes away, seldom being replaced.\n  The groups under assault are often the best--if not the only--\norganizations able to offer the assistance they perform, doing \ninvaluable work to relieve the suffering, aid the returning combat \nwarrior, assist in the rehabilitation of substance abuse for those not \nadjusting well, and many other such services that have been going on \nfor many decades.\n  To curtail the blatant discrimination against these groups, I offered \na simple amendment to protect them under existing law which passed in \nthe National Defense Authorization, and that existing law upheld is the \n1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  You would have thought I had killed someone's mother. Instead of \nupholding the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, we have now \nseen this body continue its assault on faith in America. It is not \nenough to level accusations of injustice by some. They will not be \nsatisfied until their assaults of intolerance on people of faith in \nthis country has produced an elimination of God in public life in \nAmerica.\n  We are accused of hatred, called out as shameful on this floor, and \nenjoined to use the whole Constitution to support an opposing view that \nembodies behavior, mores, and outcomes that not only violate our \nconscience, but have been prohibited under the laws of nature and \nnature's God.\n  In the last 50 years, we have seen the Constitution used by these \nideologues to kill American children in the womb, eliminate family \nstructure, elevate behavior over belief, redefine marriage, and assault \ninto silence and inaction any who may oppose them. Not satisfied, we \nsee them without rest on their quest to eliminate free exercise of \nfaith in the United States.\n  Do we really want a Nation without God?\n  They would call it progress, yet our conscience knows differently. \nThe Apostle Paul explains why when he said this:\n\n       For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all \n     ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth \n     in unrighteousness, because what may be known of God is \n     manifest in them, for God has shown it to them. For since the \n     creation of the world, His invisible attributes are clearly \n     seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His \n     eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, \n     because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as \n     God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, \n     and their foolish hearts were darkened. Professing to be \n     wise, they became fools.\n       Therefore, God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the \n     lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among \n     themselves, who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and \n     worshiped and served the creature, rather than the Creator.\n\n  The Creator, our Nation has always been anchored in the Creator, from \nits inception throughout our history. God has been the foundation of \nour Republic as seen in the sweeping lines of the Declaration of \nIndependence, when it drove our Founders to proclaim ``the separate and \nequal Station to which the Laws of Nature and Nature's God entitle \nthem, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they \nshould declare the causes which impel them to the Separation.\n  ``We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created \nequal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable \nRights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of \nHappiness.''\n  That life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness could not be realized \nwithout God in our Republic. George Washington spoke for all Americans \nin his first inaugural address, that ``No people can be bound to \nacknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of \nmen more than . . . the United States.''\n  Our Nation's survival and prosperity in the future were understood to \nbe dependent upon faith. When Washington left office in the most \nremarkable, peaceful transfer of power the world had seen, he warned of \na future that somehow supposed that we could have order and prosperity \nwithout faith. In his last address to the Nation, he declared:\n\n       Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to the \n     political prosperity, religion and\n\n[[Page H3289]]\n\n     morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that men \n     claim the tribute of patriotism, who would subvert the great \n     pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties \n     of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \n     pious man, ought to respect and cherish them. And let us with \n     caution indulge in the supposition that morality can be \n     maintained without religion.\n\n  None of the Founders of this country believed that a governmental \nconnection to religion was an evil in itself. They opposed the \nestablishment of a national religion because it could prohibit the free \nexercise of faith but that faith would and should be freely exercised. \nThis same foundational belief extended to a prohibition of a national \npress so that it could express freely, so people could speak and \nassemble freely, and that their grievance would not only become known, \nbut redressed. This was embodied in the First Amendment of the Bill of \nRights.\n  The Framers of our Constitution understood that restriction on \nreligious conduct should not be from application of general laws but, \nrather, should be applied to those laws that target religion. Laws that \n``substantially burden'' religion, even if they are generally \napplicable, must be justified as the ``least restrictive means'' of \nachieving a ``compelling interest.''\n  The same day the Bill of Rights was introduced, July 13, 1787, this \nCongress also introduced the Northwest Ordinance that laid guidelines \nand instruction on new territory acquired for a future United States.\n  Article 3 of that Ordinance stated: ``Religion, and morality, and \nknowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of \nmankind, schools and the means of education shall be forever \nencouraged.''\n  ``Forever be encouraged.'' Some in this body today, Madam Speaker, \nwould believe forever stops in 2016 and should have stopped much \nsooner. They claim that Congress grants these unalienable rights and \nuses the powers of the government, without the consent of the governed, \nto regulate and diminish faith and eliminate it from public life.\n  In 1798, in response to the claim that Congress could regulate First \nAmendment freedoms without abridging them, James Madison condemned it \nsaying: the liberty of conscience and the freedom the press were \ncompletely exempted from all congressional authority whatever.\n  Every constitution of our Thirteen Original States, and all \nthereafter following their example, understood this and embodied such \nlanguage in their State constitutions, which survive today.\n  New York, article I, section 3: ``The free exercise and enjoyment of \nreligious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, \nshall forever be allowed in this State to all humankind.''\n  New Hampshire, article 5: ``Every individual has a natural and \nunalienable right to worship God according to the dictates of his own \nconscience, and reason; and no subject shall be hurt, molested, or \nrestrained, in his person, liberty, or estate, for worshipping God in \nthe manner and season most agreeable to the dictates of his own \nconscience; or for his religious profession, sentiments, or \npersuasion.''\n  Vermont, article 3: ``That all persons have a natural and unalienable \nright, to worship Almighty God, according to the dictates of their own \nconsciences and understandings, as in their opinion shall be regulated \nby the word of God; and that no person ought to, or of right can be \ncompelled to attend any religious worship, or erect or support any \nplace of worship, or maintain any minister, contrary to the dictates of \nconscience, nor can any person be justly deprived or abridged of any \ncivil right as a citizen, on account of religious sentiments, or \npeculiar mode of religious worship; and that no authority can, or ought \nto be vested in, or assumed by, any power whatever, that shall in any \ncase interfere with, or in any manner control the rights of conscience, \nin the free exercise of religious worship.''\n  Massachusetts, part 1, articles II and III: ``It is the right as well \nas the duty of all men in society, publicly, and at stated seasons to \nworship the Supreme Being, the great Creator and Preserver of the \nuniverse. And no subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained, in his \nperson, liberty, or estate, for worshipping God in the manner and \nseason most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience; or for his \nreligious profession or sentiments . . . As the happiness of a people, \nand the good order and preservation of civil government, essentially \ndepend upon piety, religion and morality; and as these cannot be \ngenerally diffused through a community, but by the institution of the \npublic worship of God, and of public instructions in piety, religion \nand morality.''\n  Connecticut, article I, section 3: ``The exercise and enjoyment of \nreligious profession and worship, without discrimination, shall be free \nto all persons in the state.''\n  Rhode Island, article I, section 3: ``Whereas Almighty God hath \ncreated the mind free; and all attempts to influence it by temporal \npunishments or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend to beget \nhabits of hypocrisy and meanness; and whereas a principal object to our \nvenerable ancestors, in their migration to this country and their \nsettlement of this state, was, as they expressed it, to hold forth a \nlively experiment that a flourishing civil state may stand and be \nmaintained with full liberty and religious concernments; we, therefore, \ndeclare that no person shall be compelled to frequent or to support any \nreligious worship, place, or ministry whatever, except in fulfillment \nof such person's voluntary contract; nor enforced, restrained, \nmolested, or burdened in any body or goods; nor disqualified from \nholding office; nor otherwise suffer on account of such person's \nreligious belief; and that every person shall be free to worship God \naccording to the dictates of such person's conscience, and to profess \nand by argument to maintain such person's opinion in matters of \nreligion; and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or \naffect the civil capacity of any person.''\n  Pennsylvania, article 1, sections 3 and 4:\n  ``All men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty \nGod according to the dictates of their own consciences; no man can of \nright be compelled to attend, erect or support any place of worship or \nto maintain any ministry against his consent; no human authority can, \nin any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of \nconscience, and no preference shall ever be given by any law to any \nreligious establishments or modes of worship . . . No person who \nacknowledges the being of a God and a future state of rewards and \npunishments shall, on account of his religious sentiments, be \ndisqualified to hold any office or place of trust or profit under this \nCommonwealth.''\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  New Jersey: Article 1, sections 3-5: ``No person shall be deprived of \nthe inestimable privilege of worshipping Almighty God in a manner \nagreeable to the dictates of his own conscience; nor under any pretense \nwhatever be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his \nfaith and judgement; nor shall any person be obliged to pay tithes, \ntaxes, or other rates for building or repairing any church or churches, \nplace or places of worship, or for the maintenance of any minister or \nministry, contrary to what he believes to be right or has deliberately \nand voluntarily engaged to perform.\n  ``There shall be no establishment of one religious sect in preference \nto another; no religious or racial test shall be required as a \nqualification for any office or public trust.\n  ``No person shall be denied the enjoyment of any civil or military \nright, nor be discriminated against in the exercise of any civil or \nmilitary right, nor be segregated in the militia or in the public \nschools, because of religious principles . . .''\n  North Carolina: Article 1, section 13: ``All persons have a natural \nand inalienable right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates \nof their own consciences, and no human authority shall, in any case \nwhatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience.''\n  Maryland: Article 36: ``That as it is the duty of every man to \nworship God in such manner as he thinks most acceptable to Him, all \npersons are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty; \nwherefore, no person ought by any law to be molested in his person or \nestate, on account of his religious persuasion, or profession, or for\n\n[[Page H3290]]\n\nhis religious practice . . . nor shall any person, otherwise competent, \nbe deemed incompetent as a witness, or juror, on account of his \nreligious belief; provided, he believes in the existence of God, and \nthat under His dispensation such person will be held morally \naccountable for his acts, and be rewarded or punished therefor either \nin this world or in the world to come.''\n  Virginia: Article 1, sections 11 and 16: ``That religion or the duty \nwhich we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be \ndirected only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and, \ntherefore, all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of \nreligion, according to the dictates of conscience; and that it is the \nmutual duty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity \ntowards each other . . . all men shall be free to profess and by \nargument to maintain their opinions in matters of religion, and the \nsame shall in nowise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil \ncapacities . . . it shall be left free to every person to select his \nreligious instructor, and to make his support such private contract as \nhe shall please.''\n  South Carolina: Article 1, section 2: ``The general assembly shall \nmake no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the \nfree exercise thereof . . . ''\n  Last among them, the State of Georgia: Article 1, section 1, \nparagraph 4: ``No inhabitant of this state shall be molested in person \nor property or be prohibited from holding any public office or trust on \naccount of religious opinions.''\n  These constitutions are still in effect in each of these States \ntoday. All speak of the exceptions on maintaining the peace and safety \nof each State.\n  Forever--forever--be encouraged. That is the way it was phrased. Is \nthat where we stand today? Shall religious freedom, the hallmark of \nColumbia's shores, continue to be forever encouraged or do we who are \nso humbly honored to serve in these Chambers now just step aside and \nsee the indispensable supports of religion and morality knocked from \nunder our foundation?\n  Madam Speaker, I cannot be silent. Since I was 18 years of age, I \nhave pledged to support and defend the Constitution of this great \nRepublic. I have been moved by conscience and dictates to speak out \nagainst the coercion of people of faith who are being discriminated \nagainst because they merely hold to the laws of nature and nature's \nGod.\n  Our institutions, once based on the Creator of life, have now \nappointed themselves to usurp the authority of God, who is the author \nof life, marriage, and family. The most elemental sovereign unit, our \nfamilies, has been destroyed by our foolish decisions.\n  We are told instead by those of us sworn to uphold the law that \nmurder is not murder, marriage is not marriage, and family is not \nfamily. We have allowed constitutional constructs to kill a child and \ncall it a choice.\n  We have seen discreet behaviors and private sexual preferences \npromoted to public display while what is constitutionally guaranteed to \nbe able to express--religion--is now being publicly prohibited. This \nNation, at its highest level, has taken a position against God.\n  Is it possible, if that be the case, that we can form a more perfect \nunion? Can we establish justice absent the giver of law? Can domestic \ntranquility be ensured that when we abandon His precepts? Can we \nprovide for a common defense absent a mighty fortress and an unfailing \nbulwark?\n  How do we promote the general welfare when every American is \nunanchored, adrift to do what seems right in his own eyes? Do we \nsuppose that we can secure the blessings of liberty without Him? Can \nthose of our posterity expect to obtain His blessing without \nacknowledging His existence?\n  So, Madam Speaker, like our forebears, I cannot be silent. My faith \ndirects that I act with love and civility in a gentlemanly manner. As a \nwarrior on battlefields, I have seen the worst that human beings have \nto offer.\n  But my optimism is secured by eternal hope and everlasting truth. My \nconscience speaks to God's eternal Being. So I am without excuse. His \nlove and mercy cannot be separated from those that answer His call.\n  I take solace in the words of Christ when He encourages: ``Blessed \nare you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil \nagainst you falsely for My sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for \ngreat is your reward in Heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who \nwere before you.''\n\n  Like the Founders of our Nation and Framers of our great \nConstitution, I speak with many as a Representative in this august body \n``with a firm reliance on the protections of Divine Providence, we \nmutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred \nHonor.''\n  So, Madam Speaker, I will stand with Joshua when he said: ``And if it \nseems evil to you to serve the Lord, choose for yourselves this day \nwhom you will serve . . . But as for me and my house, we will serve the \nLord.''\n  I stand with the Apostle Paul when he said: ``Putting away falsehood, \nlet each one of you speak truth with his neighbor, for we are members \nof one another. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but \nagainst principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the \ndarkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the \nheavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may \nbe able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.''\n  So I ask America: Who will stand with me?\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/house-section/article/H3290-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3290-H3293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ISSUES OF THE DAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Mooney of West Virginia). Under the \nSpeaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is inspiring to hear my friend, Mr. \nRussell, speak such inspiring words. It is interesting that the book \nfrom which he kept quoting is the best-seller book of all time and also \nhappens to be the most quoted book in U.S. history here in both the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  There was a time when most legislators felt it was helpful in getting \nlegislation passed if they had a verse of Scripture from the Bible that \nsupported their position.\n  Then we arrive at the point today where, if someone in Congress makes \nthe statement in quoting Jesus Himself when He discussed marriage and \ndivorce and was asked about it, that He, God, made male and female. \nHaven't you read? Don't you understand He created male and female?\n  So you would have to believe, if you supported the agenda that was \nexhibited today, that Jesus didn't know what He was talking about \nbecause God not only created male and female, He created a lot of \nquestion marks, like the cartoon that somebody did of a doctor holding \na newborn and the mother asks, ``What did I have?'' and the doctor \nsays, ``The baby hasn't decided yet.''\n  We have come so far. We thought we had advanced so far. Yet, as \nSolomon said: ``There is nothing new under the sun.'' I know Justice \nGinsburg was talking about same-sex marriage when she said: Well, we \njust know so much more now than we used to know.\n  In some ways--but in the nature of human nature, things haven't \nchanged. Things from 3,000 years ago, just as Abraham Lincoln said in \nquoting Scripture in his second inaugural, are just as true today as \nthey were 3,000 years ago or 2,000 years ago. It is why Lincoln quoted \nthem.\n  But when we get to the place as a Nation that truth is not important, \neverything is relative, and there is no absolute, unqualified, black-\nand-white justice or injustice, then our prisons fill up.\n  You have more people committing suicide than ever. You have more \npeople using drugs and trying to escape by using drugs. You have all \nkinds of problems in schools and in society. Things are turned upside \ndown because a society loses its way, says there is no absolutes and \neverything is relative.\n  But as C.S. Lewis pointed out, what led him from being an atheist to \nbelieving in God was in poking fun at Christians and saying: Why don't \nyou just admit it. Wouldn't it just be easier to admit that there \ncannot be a just God when there is so much injustice in the world?\n  After doing that for years, this brilliant man finally realized: If \nthere were no just God, if there were no absolute-in-the-universe \nstandard of justice and injustice, right and wrong, if that\n\n[[Page H3291]]\n\nstandard did not exist, then I would have no way of knowing whatsoever \nthat injustice even existed.\n  As he illustrated, if a man is blind from birth, then he would not \never know what light was like. If there were no absolute standard of \njustice in the universe, we could never know when there was injustice. \nWe just wouldn't know the difference.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  But there is that standard. And as he points out, although some have \na more heightened understanding of justice and injustice, of fairness \nand unfairness, and some of those standards differ, it doesn't mean the \nstandards don't exist any more than the fact that some people can hit a \nmusical note more closely than others. And just because somebody \ndoesn't hit it exactly the same does not mean the music does not exist.\n  So we arrive at all these massive problems, and we are told the cure \nfor the problems of society is if we start letting more people out of \nprison much sooner. And then people misrepresent and mischaracterize \nthe reason why people are in prison in order to justify having a \nmassive prison break that is authorized by the President of the United \nStates. He is already authorizing prison breaks from Guantanamo Bay and \nis continuing to do that.\n  There is an article from the National Review by Sean Kennedy this \nweek. The subtitle is, ``The Truth About the Sentencing Reform Act is \nScary, and Not a Reason to Support It.'' The title is, ``Our Prisons \nAre Crowded Because We Have a Lot of Criminals.'' The article points \nout, ``mandatory minimums are for real bad guys.''\n  In Texas, as in many States, we have what we call ranges of \npunishment. If you do something wrong--you commit a felony, for \nexample--then, depending on how serious that has been judged to be--it \ncould be a State jail felony, a third-degree felony, a second-degree \nfelony, or a first-degree felony, being the most serious. Well, \nactually, a capital felony would be the most serious, where the death \npenalty is authorized under certain, very strict conditions. But for \nnoncapital, there is a range of punishment.\n  For example, a third-degree, minimum of 2 years, maximum of 10 years; \nsecond-degree, minimum of 2 years, maximum of 20 years; first-degree, \nminimum of 5 years, maximum of life or 99 years.\n  Some say we should not have those minimums, and certainly not a \nmandatory minimum that says you can't go below this point. For some of \nus, you are saying we have got to get rid of the bottom of the range.\n  But as we saw, and with the circumstances that motivated the original \nsentencing guidelines in Federal court 30 years or so ago, we had \nFederal judges appointed for life, completely unaccountable, that would \nface some heinous, despicable act, and then give a very light slap on \nthe wrist. So Congress came back and said, look, we are going to have \nto have some sentencing guidelines and keep judges within these \nguidelines. There was nothing wrong with that, as long as you give a \njudge at least some ability to discriminate between more serious and \nless serious, some ability to use judicial decisionmaking.\n  Over time, we have seen the serious crime rates go down. Murders, \nassaults, rapes, a lot of those numbers have gone down for some time. \nThey were a result not of society becoming more lawful and concerned, \nbut actually just enforcing the law more strictly. Society has taken a \nturn for the worse as we have continued to say through the media, \nthrough entertainment, and through Congress everything is relative, \nthere are no absolutes.\n  Well, the Founders knew there were some absolutes. They knew the only \nway we could ever be considered to have rights that government could \nnot take is to make clear that our rights do not come from the \ngovernment. The government is the protector of the rights that came \nfrom our Creator. Once people decide your rights are given by the \ngovernment, then obviously the government can take them away. But if \nthose rights come from our Creator, as our Founders made very clear in \nthe Declaration of Independence, then the government is supposed to \nprotect them and not let anyone take them away.\n  That is why it was a bit heartbreaking to hear the President say--I \nbelieve he was in Hawaii, but saying this week--oh, no. He was in a \nforeign country at the time. But he was explaining that, in the United \nStates, we have these founding documents, and they indicate that we are \nendowed with certain unalienable rights. He went ahead and rewrote--\nactually, omitted--the most important words of that line in the \nDeclaration, not where it just said we are endowed with certain \nunalienable rights, but we are endowed by our Creator. He just failed \nto mention ``endowed by our Creator.'' Maybe it bothers him to say \nthat, I don't know, but he left it out. And there is the problem: when \npeople who are in leadership of the government of the United States \nthink that they are the source of their rights.\n  The oral argument in the Little Sisters of the Poor case should have \ngotten more notoriety than they got because some of the positions taken \nby President Obama's attorneys were absolutely outrageous. The \nindications basically were that the government can tell, potentially \neven a church, which religious beliefs you can practice and which you \nare not allowed to practice. The government has that right, which would \nmean those rights didn't come from our Creator; they came from the \ngovernment. So the government giveth and the government will take away, \nwhich makes it very consistent with what the President just said in the \nlast few days in eliminating that our rights were endowed by our \nCreator.\n  There was no accident in the first part of the Bill of Rights, the \nFirst Amendment, having to do with religious liberty: ``Congress shall \nmake no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the \nfree exercise thereof.'' They knew if that freedom is abridged in any \nway, the rest of them will not matter.\n  Once the government, for example, recognizes secular humanism as the \nofficial religion of the United States, then it can dictate to people \nof all faiths exactly what they can believe and disbelieve. That is \nexactly what has happened.\n  There is a prior Supreme Court case that, in the footnotes, lists the \ndifferent religions in the United States. Secular humanism was one of \nthem. Secular humanism does not recognize a creator.\n  There has been so much misinformation and miseducation of our young \npeople. People were told that Ben Franklin didn't believe in God. You \nhave to be totally fraudulent in your representation of Benjamin \nFranklin to tell any student that, when he said in his own words--which \nwere later illustrated in his own handwriting exactly what he said when \nhe spoke in 1787, the end of June, to the Constitutional Convention \nimploring them that they needed to be praying--when he told them:\n\n       We have been going nearly 5 weeks with more noes than ayes \n     on virtually every vote. How has it happened, sir, that we \n     have not once thought of humbly applying to the Father of \n     Lights to illuminate our understandings? In the beginning of \n     the contest with Great Britain, when we were sensible of \n     danger, we had daily prayer in this room for the Divine \n     Protection. Our prayers, sir, were heard, and they were \n     graciously answered.\n\n  He went on and eventually said:\n\n       I have lived, sir, a long time.\n\n  He was 80 years old. He had gout. He had arthritis very bad. He was \noverweight. He had trouble getting up and down.\n  He said:\n\n       And the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of \n     this truth: that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a \n     sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it \n     probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have \n     been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings that ``except \n     the Lord build, they labor in vain that build it.''\n\n  That is the basis on which this Nation was built. We were endowed by \nour Creator with certain unalienable rights.\n  Ben Franklin knew what the Declaration of Independence said. It was \nAdams who told Jefferson, basically: You do the first draft. In \nessence: You are the best writer we have. It was Adams that Jefferson \nshowed the first draft to, and then they both showed it to Franklin. \nApparently, Franklin made some little interlineations. It\n\n[[Page H3292]]\n\nwas brought up for debate, and some things were knocked out.\n  He knew exactly what was important in that Declaration that would \nstand as the building foundation for this Nation for our rights. When \nthat foundation is cracked, when parts of it are eliminated, the \nbuilding on which it stands would no longer stand. That is the kind of \nerosion that has occurred.\n  When the Federal Government of the United States can tell the Little \nSisters of the Poor--these incredibly ethical, loving, caring, giving \nwomen, who devoted their lives to helping others, far more than anybody \nin this city in government--and people in this city would tell them, \nno, you cannot practice your religious beliefs because we are secular \nhumanists, and we will tell you you cannot believe and practice what \nthe Bible tells you.\n  Of course, Moses said it came from God. That is why he is right up \nthere as the only full-face image in this whole room of lawgivers, \nconsidered the greatest lawgivers of all time. Moses is the only full-\nface, because he was considered for most of our history to be the \ngreatest lawgiver of all time.\n  This is the guy that says it is coming from God, but a man shall \nleave his mother and father, a woman shall leave her home, and the two \nwill become one flesh. And when Jesus was asked about it, he said: \nHaven't you read? Don't you understand? God made them male and female.\n  He didn't mention question marks.\n  These are people we need to love and encourage. The diagnostic \nstatistical manuals for most of existence have pointed out that these \nare mental disorders. These are people that we are to love, encourage, \nand help every way we can. For among educated, compassionate people, \nfor our civilized history, a man that didn't know which he was was \npitied, loved, and encouraged. But educated people said that is \nbasically where the word 'perverse' is most widely used.\n  Now we have a government that says forget what the Bible says, forget \nwhat Moses said, forget what Jesus said when he quoted Moses verbatim \nand then added, ``What therefore God has joined together, let not man \nseparate.''\n  Even if you don't believe Jesus was part of the Holy Trinity, as our \nFounders did, do you really want to leave this life and potentially, \nwhether you believe in a judge, a maker, or not, say, ``Oh, I didn't \nthink you were serious when you said those things about marriage''?\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  I didn't think you were serious. You just weren't smart enough to \nknow that he didn't just create male and female. I really wonder how \nmany people in this body who had the ultimate power to decide whether \nhumanity would go forward or not, whether there was an asteroid coming \nor something that would end humanity on Earth as dinosaurs were ended \nat one time--okay. We have a spaceship that can--as Matt Damon did in \nthe movie--plant a colony somewhere. We can have humans survive this \nterrible disaster about to befall.\n  If you could decide what 40 people you would put on the spacecraft \nwho would save humanity, how many of those would be same-sex couples?\n  You are wanting to save humankind for posterity--basically, a modern-\nday Noah. You have that ability to be a modern-day Noah. You can \npreserve life.\n  How many same-sex couples would you take from the animal kingdom and \nfrom humans to put on the spacecraft to perpetuate humanity and the \nwildlife kingdom?\n  That is why it has been called part of the natural law, natural law \ngiven by the Creator; but when we continue to abolish the first words \nof the Bill of Rights--the First Amendment--and we continue to prohibit \nthe free exercise of religion, we don't have much longer to go.\n  Jonathan Cahn has a great book--interesting. The dialogue could be a \nlittle stronger, but ``The Harbinger,'' and the more recent one, ``The \nMystery of the Shemitah Unlocked,'' really are thought-provoking even \nif you are a secular humanist. He makes the comparison that the United \nStates, just as the Founders said, was founded by the grace of God and \nas an instrument to bless the world.\n  Even for those who have not recognized the exceptional nature of the \nUnited States, it is still a fact that you can't find nations \nthroughout history that have done what this one has, where we have sent \nour best and brightest and our most valuable commodity--American blood, \nsweat, toil--and fought for the freedom of others. We have fought to \nprotect others, not just ourselves. You don't find nations through \nhistory that did that. This Nation had because they believed there was \na higher power. They believe our rights come from our Creator, and we \nhave an obligation to that same Creator.\n  This Nation has spread goodness around the world despite those who \nwould say otherwise. It has happened. We have been the most generous, \ncharitable, helping, loving nation in the history of the world. We have \nmore opportunities and more assets per individual than even Solomon's \nIsrael. We have been blessed beyond measure.\n  Jonathan Cahn makes the comparison to the ninth chapter of Isaiah, \nwhere at that point, long after Saul and long after David and Solomon, \nwe come to 732 B.C. By that time, Israel is divided into two parts--the \nnorthern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. The \nsouthern kingdom of Judah is where Jerusalem was. Jonathan Cahn draws \nthe parallel, which is actually scary when you start looking at the \nthings that actually are parallel to that time.\n  God is telling Isaiah: Look, the people whom I have blessed--I have \nprovided more than anyone else--have turned away from me; so I allowed \nthe Assyrians to come in and attack and harm them. I pulled back the \nhand of protection.\n  Back in those days, the Assyrians were known as the true fathers of \nterrorism. They came in and attacked and did the strange thing of going \nback to Assyria.\n  God is telling Isaiah: I have given them a warning to turn back to \nme.\n  I know that for 90 days, churches all over America were packed after \n9/11. Basically, we saw people say: Never mind, God. We don't have to \nworry anymore. We have got this.\n  God said: They didn't turn back to me. I am going to let them go.\n  Ten years later, he allowed the Assyrians to come in and wipe them \nout. The southern kingdom, where Jerusalem was, continued to turn away \nfrom him. Then, over 100 years later, he allowed them to be attacked as \na warning. They didn't heed the warning. Now, they got about 19 years \nbefore God withdrew his hand of protection and allowed the children of \nIsrael to be taken into exile, and the nation of Israel ceased to \nexist. The northern kingdom and the southern kingdom of Judah ceased to \nexist because they wouldn't turn back.\n  If Jonathan Cahn is accurate in that comparison--well, we are beyond \n10 years since that warning. Maybe people believe there is a God and \nbelieve as our Founders did and as Ben Franklin said in his talking \nabout the Bible, in quoting it, and as Jefferson did in the quote that \nis still engraved in his memorial: that he trembles for our country \nwhen he realizes God is just, but he is not going to remain silent \nforever--well, the southern kingdom got 19 years after their warning, \nand then God let them go.\n  Tough times are upon us. We have a President who has now got an \nagenda to release more murderers, killers, haters of America to go \nforth and continue to kill and murder and hate Americans. I mean, I \nknow some people are saying: But it has been 15 years; they have got to \nbe released.\n  No. The way it has always worked among civilized nations when it has \ncome to prisoners of war is, when someone declared war on a nation or \non a people, and when some of those warriors were captured, they were \nheld in a civil manner; they were held until those at war said: We are \nno longer at war.\n  Then the prisoners were released unless they had committed war crimes \nfor which they could be tried. At any time in the last 15 years, all of \nthem could have been released--unless war crimes had been committed--if \ntheir friends, their allies, had said: Okay. We are the Muslim \nBrotherhood, we are radical Islam, and we are no longer at war with the \nGreat Satan, the United States. We want peace. We won't be terrorizing \nand attacking you and trying to destroy your way of life anymore. We \nare done.\n\n[[Page H3293]]\n\n  That is when they cease the violence against the United States. We \ncan release the prisoners unless war crimes have been committed. Then \nat that point, as in Nuremberg, you try them for their war crimes. This \nPresident is jumping the gun. They are still at war.\n  Muslim leaders in the Middle East and Africa have asked me: Why is it \nyou don't understand that radical Islamists, the Muslim Brotherhood, \nhave been at war with you since 1979, and you are helping them? Iran is \nthe greatest supporter of terrorism. You are helping them more than you \nare willing to help us. What is wrong with you?\n  The answer is: We have turned away from the Creator, the source of \nour rights and our blessings.\n  I believe God exists. For those who think that maybe he does, maybe \nthey are agnostic.\n  If God exists, the question is: Does he love us more than he loved \nJerusalem?\n  Because, if he doesn't, it is doubtful we have more than 4 or 5 years \nto go.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/house-section/article/H3293-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nAUTHORIZING THE SPEAKER TO DECLARE A RECESS ON WEDNESDAY, JUNE 8, 2016, \n FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING IN JOINT MEETING HIS EXCELLENCY NARENDRA \n                     MODI, PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT.
