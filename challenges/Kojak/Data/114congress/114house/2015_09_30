The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. The Pope visited America and he inspired a lot of \npeople, even cynical Washington, D.C. For one, he inspired Speaker \nBoehner to wake up the next morning and announce his resignation.\n  As I said last week, it must be hard for a decent man like Speaker \nBoehner to be head of a new know-nothing party of increasingly extreme \nmeasures to cut health care for women and to round up and deport \nmillions of undocumented immigrants. It remains to be seen how \nRepublicans in the House will conduct themselves without adult \nsupervision, but the Speaker is going out on a high note.\n  Having the Pope speak to America from the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives was a crowning achievement for the Speaker. Now that \nhis job is no longer on the line, I hope we will see immigration reform \nas the jewel in that crown and act before he steps down. But we all \nknow that is unlikely. The concurrent hysteria on the campaign trail \nmakes action by these Republicans or any Republicans unlikely.\n  Even though I still believe we have the votes--like we did for the \nlast several years--to pass immigration reform in the House, I don't \nthink the Speaker, even as a lame duck, will allow a vote. But the \nPope's visit certainly inspired me to think about the moral example he \nsets.\n  Look, the Holy Father simply reminded Members of Congress about the \nGolden Rule--``Do unto others as you would have them do unto you''--and \nhe could not even complete his sentence before he got a standing \novation.\n  If we had a daily reminder of the Golden Rule, we could cut through a \nlot of the bull in Congress and have a better country and a better \nworld. It is the Golden Rule I am here to discuss. Treat your brother \nand your sister and your neighbor with compassion as you would like to \nbe treated yourself.\n  And in the case of health care and access to health care, it is not \nsimply out of a sense of moral altruism, although that is part of it. \nRather, it is out of the reality that treating our brothers and sisters \nand neighbors as we want to be treated when it comes to health care and \naccess to health care and access to health insurance is in our own \nself-interest as well.\n  That is why I am introducing the Exchange Inclusion for a Healthy \nAmerica Act of 2015, a bill to give complete access to the Affordable \nCare Act regardless of their immigration status. The Exchange Inclusion \nfor a Healthy America will extend healthcare insurance access to \nmillions of our neighbors and family members who live here, work here, \nraise families here, and will probably live here for the rest of their \nlives, but who lack legal immigration status.\n  It gives them access to healthcare exchanges in ObamaCare under the \nordinary rules of residency in the States in which they live and makes \nthem eligible for subsidies if and when they file taxes, just like the \nrest of us. It also subjects them to the individual mandate that \nrequires individuals to have health insurance.\n  The goal is to make integration and inclusion real for millions of \nfamilies that are locked out under current law.\n  Now, if I remember correctly, the President was standing right here \nin 2009 talking about his healthcare reform proposal would exclude \nundocumented immigrants and one of our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle interrupted him by shouting, ``You lie'' to the President of \nthe United States of America, who, we should all note, was reelected \ncomfortably in 2012.\n  I do not expect that Member of Congress to join me as a cosponsor. \nBut, in fact, as we all know, he was dead wrong about the Affordable \nCare Act. In addition to death panels and a number of other fictions, \nthe Republicans were wrong that undocumented immigrants were included \nin ObamaCare. They just weren't.\n  I am and have always been an advocate for the single payer approach \nto universal health coverage, and I fought to include all of the people \nwho live in this country in the Affordable Care Act, but they were \nwritten out. As it stands right now, undocumented immigrants are not \nsubject to the individual mandate and cannot buy into the\n\n[[Page H6710]]\n\nhealth insurance exchanges, even if they use their own money.\n  My legislation will change that. It says that we stand for inclusion. \nIt says that we understand the principle that, if you are here, if you \nare working and caring for your family and contributing to society, you \nshould be healthy. Not only that, but your health and your protection \nfrom diseases, injuries, and preventable illnesses impacts my health \ncare and the health care of my family.\n  As a nation, we all benefit when we spread the risk, invite younger, \nhealthier workers to join our exchanges, reduce the costs of \ncompensating hospitals for caring for the uninsured, and reducing the \nnumber of uninsured who live and work here.\n  Doing unto others as you would have them do unto you means moving \nforward with no restrictions on which brother and sister and neighbor \nwe think of as eligible or deserving or is, in fact, considered my \nneighbor, my sister or my brother.\n  My party and the vast majority of my country understands that getting \nimmigrants on the books and into the system and integrating them into \ntoday's American society should be the goal, just as we have done with \nevery other group of immigrants throughout our history. My legislation, \nthe Exchange Inclusion for a Healthy America Act, is a step in that \ndirection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6710-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NORTH EAST BLUE RIBBON\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend \ntwo schools in my district that were named this week as National Blue \nRibbon Schools for 2015.\n  The National Blue Ribbon Schools program was started by the United \nStates Department of Education in 1982 and recognizes overall academic \nexcellence or the success of the schools in closing achievement gaps in \ntheir student population.\n  Youngsville High School in Warren County and North East High School \nin Erie County both received this honor. They are among less than 20 \nschools in the State of Pennsylvania to be recognized, which is quite \nan accomplishment when you consider the many hundreds of schools in \nPennsylvania's 500 school districts. Overall, 285 public schools across \nthe Nation received this honor.\n  For Youngsville High School, this honor is many years in the making. \nThe school has greatly improved its test scores and is using the \ncollaboration of teachers, students, and staff, along with community \nmembers, to make sure its academic success continues to grow.\n  In Erie County, administrators at the North East High School say that \ntheir learning model is built on heart, trust, and respect. School \norganizations such as National Honor Society, student council, and the \nschool's Inspire group are intended to boost student performance in the \nclassroom and highlight their service in the community.\n  I know that the administrators for both the Youngsville and North \nEast High Schools have worked for many months toward this goal. I \ncongratulate them, their students, and teachers on this major \naccomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6710-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TAX REFORM AND INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, Politico yesterday had a fascinating \nstory about Chuck Schumer, widely expected to become the next \nDemocratic leader in the Senate, in talks with Republican leaders in \nthe House and Senate about a major tax and infrastructure deal.\n  It would give a lower tax rate on hundreds of billions of dollars \nparked overseas by international corporations and use the tax on those \nproceeds to finance a more robust 6-year transportation bill. What is \nnot to like?\n  I have been working tirelessly for us to be able to finance America's \nfailing infrastructure, having introduced the first gas tax increase on \nthe Federal level in 22 years. I have been working with stakeholders, \nlike the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, organized labor, truckers, AAA, \ncontractors, transit, the whole array of people who build, operate, \nuse, and rely upon American infrastructure.\n  I am sympathetic to getting this job done. America is falling apart \nwhile we are falling behind. It doesn't work to try to pay for 2015 \ninfrastructure with 1993 dollars.\n  The simple answer that Ronald Reagan successfully championed as \nPresident was raising the gas tax, in his case, 125 percent. It is \ntaking hold around the country as even very red Republican States--six \nalready this year--have raised their gas taxes, and our legislation in \nCongress is gaining more attention as people understand that this is \nthe best way forward to solve the problem.\n  What is wrong with the deal that is being examined by Senator \nSchumer? Well, first of all, the path towards international tax reform \nis very complex and rocky, with many competing interests. No one \ndisputes that the patchwork of our corporate tax system that we have \ncurrently is unfair to some and produces distorted results.\n  We have the highest stated statutory corporate tax rate in the world. \nBut, for many corporations, that is not so much of a problem because \nthey have been working to carve out their own exemptions and loopholes \nso that what the average that corporations pays is much less than the \nstated rate. But, for some, particularly those that build and operate \nin the United States, they do pay that statutory rate and it is a \nproblem and it is unfair.\n  There is also still the incentive for some to park more money \noverseas. Most of us think that it is going to require revenue to buy \ndown the corporate rate, to reform it, and repatriated dollars would be \na source to adjust that in a way that doesn't make the deficit much, \nmuch worse.\n  There is also a problem of competitiveness. Some organizations \nactually have offshore operations to be closer to their markets. If you \nare going to sell in China, for instance, it makes sense perhaps to \nmanufacture it there rather than ship it halfway around the world with \nall the complexity and expense.\n  I have been meeting with a wide variety of corporate tax officers who \nask the question about equity. Why should they with their overseas \noperations pay for domestic infrastructure that everybody benefits \nfrom? That is a great question.\n  This has the potential of actually costing the Treasury more in the \nlong run, making it harder to have an equitable adjustment in corporate \ntax reform, and shift the burden that should be paid by all American \nusers instead concentrated on a small portion of American taxpayers on \ntheir overseas operation. They ask where is the equity, and it is hard \nto see.\n  That is why we have the basic principle of a user fee: People use a \nservice and they pay for it. The gas tax for decades has served that \npurpose since it was first introduced in my home State of Oregon in \n1919 for road construction. It is still the simplest, most direct, most \nfair, easiest to administer, and would enable us to solve this problem \nin a matter of months.\n  Unfortunately, the path we are on is very uncertain as well as \nunfair. We are going to have the 35th short-term extension of the \nhighway trust fund next month. No country has become great building its \ninfrastructure 10 months at a time.\n  The answer is not an elaborate deal that is being discussed which \nmakes it less likely we solve the problems. Why don't we just deal with \nit directly, put hundreds of thousands of people to work at family-wage \njobs, actually reduce the deficit, increase the economy, and strengthen \nthe quality of life in communities large and small all across America.\n  Let's not engage in gimmickry. Let's rebuild and renew America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6710-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6710-H6711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING SPECIALIST KYLE GILBERT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

He was a 10th Mountain Division soldier with the 2nd \nBattalion, the 14th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to share with you that Specialist Gilbert \nreceived the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, and the Army Service Ribbon. \nAdditionally, Mr. Speaker, Kyle received the Bronze Star, the Army Good \nConduct Medal, and the NATO Medal.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Though I did not have the privilege of meeting Kyle personally, I \nwould like to use this opportunity to sincerely thank him for his \nincredible service to the State of Georgia and to our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has been relayed to me that Specialist Gilbert's \ndeepest dream was to serve our Nation in the military, and I thank him \nfor his incredible service and sacrifice so that so many others can \nshare the American Dream. Kyle leaves a legacy of service, dedication, \nand kindness that will be sorely missed.\n  Mr. Speaker, I humbly ask that you join me in praying for Specialist \nGilbert's family during this time of their bereavement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6711-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    21ST CENTURY WOMEN'S HEALTH ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nOregon (Ms. Bonamici) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the 21st Century Women's \nHealth Act to increase access to reproductive health care and to \nprovide compassionate care to survivors of sexual assault.\n  Funding for the government runs out in a matter of hours. Rather than \ncrafting a bipartisan solution on the Nation's budget, House leadership \nhas been focusing on denying women their right to make their own \nhealthcare decisions.\n  This is 2015. We should be doing all we can to increase access to \nhealth care for women. We should not be rolling back women's rights and \ncutting access to lifesaving cancer and preventative health screenings \nfor women, men, and youth across the country.\n  As a mother, a daughter, and a Member of Congress, I understand the \nvalue of increasing access to health care for women; and that is why I \nam proud to introduce the 21st Century Women's Health Act, with my \ncolleagues Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Congresswoman Diana DeGette, and \nwith our leadership of our ally in the Senate, Senator Patty Murray \nfrom Washington.\n  This comprehensive bill will increase access to preventative health \nservices and contraception for low-income women, and it will help women \nreport instances of inappropriate charges for birth control, a problem \nthat affects too many women across the country. It will also expand the \nprimary care workforce and ensure that survivors of sexual assault are \nprovided with free emergency contraception and compassionate care.\n  I want my daughter and every woman in this country to live in a place \nwhere they have access to affordable healthcare providers like Planned \nParenthood, a full range of reproductive choices, and, most \nimportantly, the ability to make their own healthcare decisions.\n  Colleagues, I grew up before Roe v. Wade, and I know what our country \nlooks like when women don't have access to a full range of reproductive \nhealthcare options. We know that if abortion is restricted, it does not \ngo away.\n  Let us not return to a time when women had to seek care in the \nshadows or the back alleys. Let us come together to prevent unwanted \npregnancies, and let us champion our march forward toward a more equal \nsociety with the introduction of the 21st Century Women's Health Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me as cosponsors, and I look forward to \nworking toward the passage of this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6711-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6711-H6712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THANK YOU STATE SENATOR BRANDEN PETERSEN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Emmer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor State \nSenator Branden Petersen of Andover for his public service. Branden was \nelected to the Minnesota House in 2010 at the young age of 24 and then \nreelected to serve his constituents, but this time in the Minnesota \nSenate in 2012. Recently, Branden resigned to spend more time with his \nyoung family. His leadership in the Minnesota Legislature will be \nsorely missed.\n  Branden represents portions of my district, and I have been honored \nto work with him and to know him. He is a man of great character and \nprinciple.\n  While in office, Branden worked hard to improve Minnesota's schools, \neconomy, and budget, all while being part of a growing family that now \nincludes three little ones at home. It has been wonderful to see \nBranden's dedication over the past 5 years, and I believe that the \npeople of his district are so lucky to have benefited from his service. \nBranden's leadership will be truly missed, but I have no doubt that he \nwill find success and happiness in his future endeavors.\n  Enjoy your time with your family, Senator. You deserve it.\n\n\n                         Manufacturing Day 2015\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate \nManufacturing Day and the importance of Minnesota's manufacturing \nindustry.\n  Manufacturing is one of the main drivers of the economy in my \ndistrict and my State. Manufacturers generate billions of dollars in \nrevenue for my State each year, making them a key pillar of Minnesota's \neconomy.\n  Minnesota is home to an impressive 292,000 manufacturing jobs, and \nthe State's manufacturing industry has the second largest payroll of \nany business sector.\n  Minnesotans are hardworking people, and they deserve the best that \nlife has to offer. They deserve a strong State economy, which allows \nfor individual growth, prosperity, and the pursuit of happiness. That \nis why I will continue to emphasize the importance of manufacturing-\nfriendly policies for as long as I serve in Congress.\n  I am proud to support Manufacturing Day in our country, but I want to \nmake it clear that every day is Manufacturing Day in Minnesota.\n\n\n                    Hal Becker, a Servant to Delano\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Hal \nBecker for his tireless service to the city of Delano and to wish him \nluck in his upcoming retirement.\n  Hal graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1977 with a degree \nin mathematics. Not long after completing his education, Hal began to \nwork at Delano Municipal Utilities and served as the general manager \nthere for 30 years. He was the perfect candidate for this position, as \nhe also graduated from the St. Paul Public Schools electricity course, \nholds an electrician's license and a water supply system operator \nlicense.\n  Hal has done an outstanding job over the past 30 years, which is \nproven by the recognition he has received for his work. In 2013, he was \nthe recipient of the impressive American Public Power Association's \nLarry Hobart Seven Hats Award.\n  Hal has been a great neighbor and member of our Delano community and, \nabove all, our friend.\n  Hal, your shoes will be tough to fill, and we will all miss your \nservice. I wish you a peaceful and happy retirement.\n\n\n                  Marco, Inc., of St. Cloud, Minnesota\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate\n\n[[Page H6712]]\n\nMarco, Inc., of St. Cloud, Minnesota, for making Fortune's list of best \nsmall- and medium-sized companies to work for.\n  Marco has an incredible story and is proof that the American Dream is \nalive and well. What began as a small typewriter shop in St. Cloud \nquickly evolved into one of the top technology providers in the \ncountry, with offices located throughout the Midwest.\n  However, what truly stands out about Marco is that they are one of \nthe first companies to create an employee stock ownership plan, and \nthey are among the few companies in this country to be 100 percent \nemployee owned.\n  I truly commend Marco, Inc., for understanding that employees are the \nheart and soul of every company and that they must be taken care of and \nrewarded. Your quick rise and large success is undoubtedly due to the \nway you treat your employees and your positive work environment.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Butterfield) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great \nAmerican, Howard Curtis Jones, a constituent and dear friend who is the \nfounder and president of the Wilson, North Carolina, Opportunities \nIndustrialization Center.\n  This past Monday, September 29, Mr. Jones was presented with the \nOutstanding Rural Leader of the Year award at an auspicious occasion in \nRaleigh, North Carolina, the highest award bestowed by the North \nCarolina Rural Center and the Rural Economic Development organization.\n  This recognition could not be awarded to a more deserving individual. \nMr. Jones has long been an inspiration to many with his compassion and \nwork. I am honored to call Howard Jones my friend of more than 45 \nyears.\n  The Rural Leader award recognizes an individual who demonstrates \nremarkable commitment to improving the way of life in rural North \nCarolina by enhancing the community and positively impacting the \nquality of life for its residents.\n  Mr. Jones has been helping people from Wilson and surrounding \ncommunities for more than 40 years. He has earned this recognition \nthrough decades of hard work and community involvement.\n  Born in Sims, North Carolina, during the Depression in 1933 as one of \n16 children, Howard has spent the majority of his life trying to \nempower disadvantaged populations in rural eastern North Carolina. He \nmotivates them to reach their full potential by teaching vocational \nskills and helping them secure gainful employment.\n  In 1972, after returning to his home community from employment in New \nYork City, Mr. Jones started OIC of Wilson, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt \norganization, with the goal of helping to empower individuals to find \nemployment opportunities.\n  Wilson OIC, as we call it, provides services to disadvantaged youth \nand adults, including prevocational training, employment readiness and \nreferral services, health educational programs, and programs to help \ndislocated workers transition to new careers.\n  Remarkably, Mr. Jones began OIC with little more than his faith in \nGod and an unshakeable resolve and steadfast dedication that it could \nbe done. He had no funding. He had no staff when he started except \nvolunteers.\n\n  Over the years, Wilson OIC has expanded to employ 35 workers and \nplace more than 200 citizens per year in jobs. Importantly, Wilson OIC \nadapts the services and training they provide through our changing \nworld and assists clients in acquiring the skills needed to compete in \nthe 21st century economy.\n  For 10 years, I had the honor of serving as board chair for Wilson \nOIC and was involved in helping to secure its present site, which was \nan abandoned elementary school in the city.\n  In addition, Mr. Speaker, to Mr. Jones' work with OIC, he has been a \nleader among OICs nationally and internationally. He was a personal \nfriend and confidant of the national founder, the Reverend Dr. Leon \nHoward Sullivan, who must be remembered as the first African American \nto serve on the board of directors for General Motors and the author of \nthe Sullivan principles, which led to the dismantling of South Africa's \nsystem of apartheid.\n  Mr. Speaker, Howard Jones has received more than 100 awards during \nhis career: in 1987, he received the Governor's Award for Outstanding \nVolunteer Service; in 1987, he was recognized at the national level \nwith the Thomas Jefferson Award; in 1997, President Clinton presented \nMr. Jones with the Lifetime Achievement Jefferson Award; and in 2009, \nhe received the First Community Stellar Award by Success Dynamics. The \nlist goes on and on.\n  Finally, Howard Jones and Wilson OIC, four times each year, \ndistribute thousands of pounds of food to low-income families in the \ncommunity. When they conduct their food distribution program, hundreds \nof citizens literally line up through the night to receive these \ncommodities. Howard Jones, Mr. Speaker, is an icon in our community.\n  Howard has been married to his wife, Sylvia Neal Jones, for many \nyears. He is the father of five adult children and seven grandchildren.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Howard \nCurtis Jones on being selected as Outstanding Rural Leader of the Year. \nHe is most deserving of this honor.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Kinzinger) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I had no intention of coming \nto the floor and actually speaking this morning--I have a committee \nhearing, in fact--until I saw the news.\n  Now, let me paint a picture just briefly. Every day there are men, \nwomen, and children that live in a nation called Syria that wonder if \nthe next barrel bomb is going to come and drop in their neighborhood. \nNow, this isn't a barrel bomb targeted, by the way, at any real \nopposition. It is targeted at inflicting the maximum amount of pain on \ninnocent civilians so that a brutal dictator by the name of Bashar al-\nAssad can ruthlessly, heartlessly keep power for himself in a country \nthat does not want him.\n  We know that Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his own \npeople. Young kids were choking and gasping for air, knowing that this \nwas their last breath and knowing that their dreams of becoming a \ndoctor, a police officer, maybe a teacher was cut short by this \nruthless, heartless man, Bashar al-Assad.\n  You know, Mr. Speaker, the President said a few years ago, almost \ndivisively, that the opposition to Bashar al-Assad is just a bunch of \ndoctors, lawyers, and pharmacists, as if that were a bad thing.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  I believe that a bunch of doctors, lawyers, and pharmacists in charge \nof Syria today would be a very good thing. Mr. Speaker, about 2 weeks \nago I stood in this Chamber and gave just a 1-minute address and said: \nLet me be clear. There is one reason and one reason only that Russia \nfinds itself in the Middle East and one reason and one reason only that \nRussia finds itself in Syria, and that one reason is to prop up this \nbrutal dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n  Now, let me remind people that ISIS would not exist in Syria had it \nnot been for Bashar al-Assad brutally cracking down on the opposition, \nthe peaceful opposition of his own people, but today we see that ISIS \ncalls Syria home and we find ourselves engaged--albeit halfheartedly--\nin a war against ISIS because of this brutal dictator Bashar al-Assad. \nI stood in this Chamber and warned that the reason Russia is there is \nto prop him up.\n  Now, I told you that this morning I had no intention of coming onto \nthe floor, Mr. Speaker, except this morning I saw the news that Russia \nhas begun airstrikes in the Middle East. Now, if they were striking \nagainst ISIS, some could maybe argue that, hey, this is an opportunity \nto unite a world coalition. But it appears that, actually, the Russians \nhave struck the doctors, lawyers,\n\n[[Page H6713]]\n\nand pharmacists that are the loyal opposition for a free Syria against \nBashar al-Assad.\n  This is not a Russia interested in defeating ISIS for the sake of the \npeace of the world. This is a Russia interested in rebuilding the \nSoviet empire and propping up their dictators in the Middle East, \nregardless of that dictator having killed a quarter million of his own \npeople. This is not a choice between Bashar al-Assad or ISIS. Mr. \nSpeaker, to defeat ISIS, you must defeat Bashar al-Assad. The two \nchoices are not separate. They are one and the same.\n  Sometimes in my party's Presidential debate I hear candidates, one or \ntwo in particular, that say Assad is our best choice in the Middle \nEast. Mr. Speaker, if you would allow me, as a Christian, to say, as a \nfollower of Jesus myself, no Jesus Christ I follow would call a man who \nbrutally murders 250,000, at least, of his own people, especially women \nand children--no Christ I follow would call that man an ally or a \nfriend in any way.\n  This is not a choice that is just one layer deep. This is a \ncomplicated situation in the Middle East that must be handled with \nAmerican leadership. Mr. Speaker, I hope that the President sees this \nas an opportunity to reassert America's role in the Middle East. It \ndoesn't mean he has to send 300,000 troops back into the Middle East. \nNot a single person I have heard on either side of the aisle has \nsuggested even once another 300,000 troops in the Middle East.\n  What is being suggested is that, in the absence of American \nleadership, chaos, violence, death, and poverty follow suit. What we \nare seeing in the Middle East is a lack of American leadership and a \nsituation spun out of control.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know George W. Bush has taken his licks for his policy \nin the Middle East, but at the end of the George W. Bush \nadministration, if you looked at the Middle East then compared to the \nMiddle East today, it is no comparison.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope I wake up tomorrow and hear on the news that \nPresident Obama has said that America will reassert its leadership in \nthe Middle East, but I won't hold my breath.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6713-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE RESPONSIBLE GOVERNING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has \ndescribed the Republican House and Senate as a ``responsible right-of-\ncenter governing majority.'' But how responsible is it that we are \nabout to start a new fiscal year with no plan for how to fund our \ngovernment? We are hours away from a shutdown, and Congress has yet to \neven begin budget negotiations.\n  Instead of doing the job the American people sent us here to do, we \nare celebrating that maybe we have found a way to keep the government \nopen for 2 months--2 months. That is what we consider a bipartisan \nvictory these days. Now, we may prevent a shutdown today, but let's be \nclear. Doing the bare minimum to keep the government from closing is \nnot responsible. It is hardly governing at all.\n  The American people sent us here to take on the big issues and to get \nthings done. They want us to fight for infrastructure, for education, \nfor jobs, not just to keep the lights on. We are letting partisan games \nget in the way of governing, and it is not only hurting our government, \nit is hurting our constituents.\n  Unreliable, unpredictable short-term funding prevents the government \nfrom operating effectively and efficiently, and it costs taxpayers \nmoney. We are short-term funding, and we are ignoring changes in our \npolicy priorities and restricting agencies from shifting dollars around \nto meet emerging challenges.\n  Defense officials recently warned that forcing the Pentagon to \noperate on a short-term CR would hurt our national security by \nrestricting our ability to respond to new threats. Moreover, a CR \nseverely limits the government's ability to plan ahead or start new \nprojects. That is because there is no guarantee the money will be there \nin 2 months.\n  How do agencies manage this uncertainty? By freezing hiring and \ntraining, shortening terms for grants and contracts, forgoing \nmaintenance, and delaying scheduled pay raises. In addition, agencies \nhave to waste countless resources preparing for contingency plans for \nshutdowns that may or may not happen.\n  Republicans like to talk about running government more like a \nbusiness. Is this how they would run a business? What successful \nbusiness budgets 2 months at a time?\n  What we need and what Democrats have been demanding is for \nRepublicans to sit down with us and craft a long-term, bipartisan \nbudget so we can finally get rid of the harmful, across-the-board \nspending cuts of sequestration so we can reprioritize and restore \nfunding in areas like education, R, infrastructure, and national \nsecurity in a fiscally responsible way so we can plan for the future.\n  The best way to do that is to return to regular order. That means \noffering pro-growth budget resolutions that address our long-term \nfiscal challenges in a responsible way. No partisan austerity plans \nthat keep the indiscriminate and harmful sequestration in place. It \nalso means bringing appropriation bills to the floor free of \nideological policy riders. There is a time and place to debate \ncontroversial issues. That is why we have authorizing committees.\n  I am confident that, as long as we can put partisan politics aside \nand ignore obstructionist demands, we can get back to passing budgets \nunder regular order, not a partisan budget that fails to address the \nsequester, not a CR that operates to keep agencies from planning more \nthan 2 months out, and definitely not the threat of another shutdown.\n  My hope is with the new Republican leadership will come a renewed \neffort to bring back long-term budgeting under regular order. That is \nthe kind of responsible government the American people expect of us. \nThat is the kind of responsible governing that the American people \ndeserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6713-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6713-H6714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PROTECTING PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Reed) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I have come to this floor numerous times to \nstand for a priority that I have committed myself to here as a Member \nof this Congress, and that is to stand up for individuals and protect \nthe private property rights that our fellow American citizens enjoy in \nowning their properties, their homes, their family farms, and their \nother property that they have worked tirelessly to obtain.\n  I care about defending the constitutional rights given to all \nAmericans and the generations that will follow us in the future. I \nfundamentally believe, Mr. Speaker, the American citizens' land is \ntheir land; it is not our government's.\n  Every day, Mr. Speaker, I am getting more and more input in our \noffice about examples of Big Government taking people's property \nwithout just compensation and abusing the power of eminent domain. I \nhave heard of family farms. I have heard of homes. I have heard of \nrights that have been squashed time and time by Big Government.\n  And individuals have nowhere to go. They essentially have two \nchoices, either roll over, submit to the government and take what the \ngovernment gives them or they try to fight and they use up their own \nprecious resources while they fight a Big Government that seems to have \nendless amounts of resources and time, Mr. Speaker, on their side.\n  I want to put this in a personal perspective for my fellow Members \nand American citizens. This gentleman is a gentleman by the name of \nCharlie Birnbaum of Atlantic City, New Jersey. Mr. Birnbaum is the son \nof immigrants who came to America after surviving the brutality of the \nHolocaust. His parents bought a home, raised a family, and passed that \nhome on to Charlie. They lived and are living the American Dream.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is that home. This is something where they have \nraised their family, enjoyed family memories, and where Mr. Birnbaum is \nliving the American Dream and providing resources by teaching piano \nlessons out\n\n[[Page H6714]]\n\nof this home and renting portions of it to tenants to make ends meet.\n  Since early 2014, the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority of \nNew Jersey wants to take this home and give it to an unknown entity. \nThey don't even have a plan to redevelop this home. They just want his \nproperty. That is not right, Mr. Speaker. That is not the American way \nof life. That is not the American Government that I am going to allow \nto abuse this man's precious home.\n  The solution is something that I have put together. The Defense of \nProperty Rights Act is a piece of legislation that has come out of the \nProperty Rights Caucus, working with my fellow Members from Maine to \nAlabama, to California, to stand up for private properties in America.\n  I introduced the legislation in January. The Defense of Property \nRights Act would stand with people like Charlie and say: What America \nand the Big Government mentality of today is doing is wrong, and there \nare Members in Washington, D.C. who are joining us in the fight to say \nno more. We will force through that legislation accountability. We will \nmake sure that government thinks about what it is doing before it \ndestroys Charlie's American Dream and the Charlies across the country. \nBecause, if it can happen to Charlie, Mr. Speaker, it can happen to \nanyone.\n  On my watch in Congress, I will do whatever I can to stand with those \nfellow American citizens and say: We are not going to let this happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6714-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING FRED SIMON\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dear friend who has \nnot only left his mark on a nationally recognized Omaha business, but \nalso on the city itself. Fred Simon joined the family business Omaha \nSteaks back in 1959, helping to make it the household name and success \nstory it is today.\n  But the memory of Fred Simon goes beyond the bottom line. Through his \nlove of the arts, he spent many years helping propel the city of Omaha \ninto a world-class community. Art lovers in Omaha have long recognized \nthe role Fred played in elevating the city's cultural stature. It has \nbeen said that he knew that great cities need great art. With that goal \nin mind, Fred helped bring a full-time professional opera company to \nOmaha, and he didn't stop there.\n  Serving as Opera Omaha's board president, financially backing and \nattending the opera for more than four decades, Fred once said that he \nwas sensitive to the meaning of words and the power of music.

Iran currently owes $43.5 \nbillion to victims of state-sponsored terrorism. Hundreds of Americans \nhave personally felt the impact of Iranian terrorism. In the last 30 \nyears, Americans studying abroad, teaching or traveling through the \nMiddle East have been taken hostage, killed in suicide bombings and \ngunned down by members of the Islamic jihad.\n  The damages owed have been previously awarded by U.S. courts under \nFederal law, and the judgments remain unsatisfied by the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran. Under the President's Iran deal, sanctions on Iran \nwill be lifted, and an estimated $150 billion in assets will be \nreleased to them, and not one single cent will be used to pay the debts \nowed to the victims of Iranian-sponsored terrorism.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  H.R. 3457 holds Iran accountable to the victims of its terrorism by \nensuring that not one cent of sanction relief goes to Iran until the \nvictims are paid.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of Mr. Meehan's legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6714-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6714-H6715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNWAVERING BOND WITH ISRAEL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, this morning, the United Nations will \ntake yet another action that only serves to further undermine the \nprospects for peace between Israelis and Palestinians and underscores \nthe lengths to which the United Nations and many of its member states \nwill go in order to wrongly isolate and delegitimize the democratic \nJewish State of Israel.\n  By raising the Palestinian flag for the first time ever at the U.N., \nthat body is allowing Palestinians to continue with their scheme to \nachieve unilateral statehood without having to honor their obligations \nto reach a peaceful settlement through direct negotiations with Israel.\n  While addressing the U.N. General Assembly this week, President Obama \nhad an opportunity to denounce this latest stunt and press for the \nUnited Nations to abandon its course of action and return to the \nprinciples of its own diplomatic agreements with regard to resolving \nthe peace process; yet, as usual, the President remained silent. That \nsilence speaks volumes about the administration's policy toward Israel, \nour closest friend and ally, and it will surely only serve to embolden \nAbu Mazen. Today, Abu Mazen will address the U.N. General Assembly, and \nhis speech will be nothing more than political theater.\n  In his speech later today, Abu Mazen will surely continue his ploy to \nachieve unilateral statehood recognition from sympathetic states and \nU.N. entities that are dominated by anti-Israel bias, like the Human \nRights Council. What a misnomer. And, of course, he will blame Israel \nfor not being able to achieve peace, when it is Abu Mazen who \nrepeatedly has rebuffed overtures from Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu \nto return to the table to discuss a mutually agreeable resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have seen over the past several years--a sight \nunseemly and unbecoming--the administration publicly admonish and \ninsult our ally Israel and its leaders, applying a false moral \nequivalency between Israel and the Palestinians; yet when it comes to \nAbu Mazen's intransigence or Palestinian incitement, the Obama \nadministration remains reserved in its condemnation, if it feigns the \nappearance of disapproval at all.\n  For peace, Abu Mazen must recognize Israel's right to exist as a \nJewish state, must renounce the use of violence and put an end to the \nrepeated rocket attacks and acts of terror, and must sit down with \nIsrael to be an earnest partner for peace.\n  Abu Mazen, who is currently in his 10th year of a 5-year term as the \nleader of the Palestinian Authority, is only interested in self-\npreservation and self-interest. The onus lies with Abu Mazen and the \nPalestinian Authority to live up to their obligations and previous \ndiplomatic agreements. If and when it doesn't--for surely, I know that \nthey won't--the U.S. must be ready to cut off financial assistance to \nthe Palestinians.\n  We must see that our assistance is used as leverage to ensure that \nthe Palestinians honor their commitments and negotiate a peaceful two-\nstate solution directly with Israel without any preconditions. We must \nalso veto any attempts by the Palestinians to bring another resolution \nto the U.N. Security Council to advance their illegal unilateral \nstatehood scheme and must make Abu Mazen pay for the consequences of \nthese destructive actions.\n  The Obama administration will offer platitudes, and the \nadministration officials will say that no other President has done more \nfor Israel's security. But I caution that it isn't what the \nadministration or the President says regarding Israel; it is what they \ndon't say that we should also be paying attention to. That is why the \nPresident's silence on Israel and the Palestinians at the U.N. General \nAssembly this week is all too telling, and that is why it is up to us \nin Congress to do what we can to support Israel, to support the Jewish \nstate's right to exist and its right to defend herself, and to use the \nleverage we have.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, nearly $10 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars, \nyour\n\n[[Page H6715]]\n\nmoney, is being sent to the U.N. We must use that leverage at the U.N. \nto hold those entities accountable and to fight back this fraudulent \nunilateral statehood scheme and these efforts to delegitimize Israel.\n  We need to make every effort we can to signal to the world that our \ncommitment is an unbreakable bond between the U.S. and the democratic \nJewish state and that that bond is unwavering.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6715-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ARE WE IN OR OUT IN ELIMINATING ISIS?\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 10, 2014, President Obama \nannounced that the United States would ``degrade and ultimately \ndestroy'' ISIS. ISIS has obviously not gotten the memo. This terrorist \ngroup keeps moving across the Middle East, killing those who stand in \nits way by raping, pillaging, and murdering those who disagree with \nthem. ISIS controls half of Syria and large parts of Iraq. Civilized \nsociety is losing to these barbarians.\n  Despite the U.S. spending billions on a counterterrorism strategy, \nthe terrorist group's numbers have not decreased. In fact, ISIS has \ngrown in size, with affiliates all over the world, including Indonesia, \nYemen, Egypt, and even Libya.\n  A $3 billion U.S. airstrike campaign has been plagued with little \nmeasurable successful results. From the very beginning, military \nofficials warned that airstrikes alone that relied on virtually no \nhuman intelligence or on-the-ground intelligence would not be \nsuccessful. Without good intelligence, the number of airstrikes the \nU.S. has carried out have been few, and the results are uncertain.\n  Also, ISIS fighters killed by our airstrikes are just replaced by \nother jihadists. Our intelligence estimates that ISIS' numbers are the \nsame as they were when our airstrikes began.\n  In addition, the administration's $500 million train and equip \nprogram has proved to be a failure by anyone's measure. In July, \nofficials reported they had identified 7,000 planned participants but \nonly trained 60 of these mercenaries. Later that month, 54 fighters \ncrossed into Syria to fight ISIS forces that numbered in the tens of \nthousands. Of those 54 mercenaries, virtually all were killed, \ncaptured, or scattered when attacked. We are now down to four or five \nU.S.-trained mercenaries, according to General Lloyd Austin of CENTCOM.\n  Despite this failed policy, just last week, we sent a second group of \n70 U.S.-trained mercenaries into Syria. Just 1 day later, reports \nsuggested that one of the officers defected and surrendered his arms to \nal Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, and several truckloads of weapons were \nallegedly traded to the terrorist group al-Nusra for safe passage.\n  It is time to abandon this failed train and equip program.\n  The reality is just as bleak on the online battlefield. ISIS has \n30,000 to 40,000 social media accounts. It uses the Internet to spread \npropaganda, raise money, and find recruits as far away as Washington \nState.\n  In 2011, the administration promised a strategy to combat terrorist \nuse of social media. Four years later, we still haven't seen that plan. \nNo plan, no degrading ISIS, no defeating ISIS.\n  The intel given to the administration has also been doctored to cover \nup how badly the war against ISIS is going. Meanwhile, thousands of \npeople are fleeing the Middle East--flooding Europe and demanding entry \ninto other Western nations because of the ISIS carnage and the chaos in \nSyria as well.\n  In the face of our failure to destroy ISIS, we should be focusing on \nwhat we can do better and how we can improve our strategy without using \nU.S. ground troops.\n  ISIS' advances in Syria translate into more direct threats to our \nnational security and interests, both abroad and at home. ISIS wants to \ndestroy the United States and everything we stand for. ISIS fears no \none--certainly not the United States--so it continues to murder in the \nname of its radical jihad. It has already killed innocent Americans.\n  We need a strategy that protects American people from this radical \nIslamic threat. So what is the plan? Let the Russians defeat ISIS and \nprop up the butcher of Syria, Assad, and let him remain in power? Who \nknows. The current U.S. plan seems to be like the war in Vietnam: don't \nwin, don't lose.\n  The American people need to know if the U.S. is in or out in the \nfight against ISIS. If it is in the national security interest of the \nUnited States to degrade and defeat them, we need to define the enemy \nand defeat them.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6715-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6715-H6716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SITUATION IN SYRIA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

It has created 4 million refugees and displaced more \nthan 6.5 million people into places like Jordan and Turkey--and now, in \nEurope and elsewhere around the world.\n  Sadly, it appears that the efforts that we have made, which my friend \nfrom Texas referred to, have been ineffectual, to put it mildly, and \nthe situation grows worse. We watch now the Russians introducing \nmilitary equipment into Syria, something that can only result in more \nviolence, more death, and more refugees. We see, sadly--and I have \nwatched this closely from my perch on the House Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence--ISIS gaining in strength, not losing \nstrength.\n  There are lots of conversations to be had about U.S. efforts to train \nand equip the so-called Syrian moderates. There are conversations to be \nhad about how we deal with Russian influence in the area. But something \nwe must focus on now, and something that is the subject of a letter \nthat I and 54 of my colleagues have sent to the President of the United \nStates, is that the only real solution in Syria, a solution that should \nbe implemented today, is for the international community, all of the \nplayers that have a stake and influence in Syria, to come together \ntoday to begin the process of working out an international agreement, \nthe terms of which will undoubtedly be uncomfortable for us, but an \nagreement that will bring an end to the civil war. This agreement \nshould provide for the exit of Bashar al-Assad. He has lost all \ncredibility as a global leader, but he remains there.\n  Apart from ending the humanitarian and moral crisis in Syria, that \nconference would allow us to finally align behind an objective that I \nbelieve is shared by pretty much everybody in the region, which is the \ndestruction of ISIS.\n  Until we take this step of coming together around a table that, yes, \nwill involve some unsavory characters, that, yes, will not lead to an \nagreement that we regard as perfect, until we do that, we will simply \nbe managing chaos. And maybe we will manage chaos well, but it will \nstill be managing chaos: hundreds of thousands of refugees and the \ndestabilization that that will cause, more weaponry being introduced, \nmore U.S. taxpayer dollars expended.\n  We can do that. That is what we have been doing. We can do it for \nmore months and more years. Or we can do the obvious thing, which is \nget around a table--and I do call on the President of the United States \nto show American leadership in this--and say we don't leave the room \nuntil this moral tragedy is stopped.\n  This is what it would mean to be a leader in the world. We can bomb. \nWe can send military equipment. We do that a lot. Real leadership will \ninvolve saying we will come together with people we like and people we \ndon't to solve this problem.\n  I call on this House to assist me and others in the effort to make \nsure that\n\n[[Page H6716]]\n\nthis becomes a national priority so we can finally bring this tragedy \nin the Middle East to an end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6716-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate concurs in the House of Representatives amendment to \nthe Senate amendment with an amendment to the bill (H.R. 719) ``An Act \nto require the Transportation Security Administration to conform to \nexisting Federal law and regulations regarding criminal investigator \npositions, and for other purposes.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6716-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

He was proudly known as the ``cow barn \npreacher,'' and he spoke to us every single Sunday growing up. When I \nhear his voice today still, my eyes fill with tears thinking of my dad \nand how much he loved him.\n  In a God-ordained meeting a few years ago, I had the opportunity to \nmeet Bill Vanderbush, his son, on an airplane. They have prayed for me; \nthey have encouraged; they have lifted me up, and they have been \nwonderful friends and prayer partners throughout that.\n  I want to thank him for coming today and opening this House floor \nwith prayer.\n  I ask God to continuously bless him and his ministry. They are \nworking to expand it, not only just to people in the country, but \npeople in the city and people across the world. They carry a burden for \npeople's hearts in their souls, and I appreciate them and ask God to \nrichly bless them and their family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6716-8", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Yoder).

Mr. Speaker, I sit by an American hero, my friend, Sam \nJohnson, to recognize three American heroes in my own hometown: a brave \npolice officer and two sisters, Bre and Kaylie Lasley.\n  Last week, a man broke into their house and began to viciously attack \nthese two sisters with a knife. They defended each other, they \nsupported each other, and they fought for each other's lives.\n  Fortunately, a police officer was in the area and, when he heard \ntheir screams, he ran to the rescue. Just seconds before this intruder \nwas expected to take Bre's life, this heroic police officer entered the \nscene and saved her.\n  Speaking of this officer, Bre said: ``Right when we made eye contact, \nI knew that I was safe. It's a miracle that he had so much composure. \nHe was our angel.''\n  I am proud to serve in a country where police officers put their \nlives on the line every single day to save us. I am proud to serve in a \ncountry where we know that the country isn't great because of the \nactions of the government; it is great because of heroic and courageous \nactions of individuals, which is why I would like to present this \npolice officer with my first Profile of Courage award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6716-10", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6716-H6717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MANUFACTURING DAY\n\n  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, this Friday, October 2, is Manufacturing \nDay, a day to celebrate the American manufacturing industry that has \nmade our country great and to highlight emerging opportunities in the \nfield of advanced manufacturing.\n  My home State of Rhode Island is the birthplace of the American \nindustrial revolution. It was in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, where Samuel \nSlater opened our country's first successful cotton spinning factory \nthat marked the beginning of a new era in American innovation.\n  From the textile mills in Woonsocket to the shipyards in Newport, \ngood-paying manufacturing jobs helped build a thriving middle class in \nRhode Island and all across our country.\n  Today, advanced manufacturing fields like 3-D printing, medical \ndevice production, and renewable energy offer the promise of new \nopportunities to a\n\n[[Page H6717]]\n\nnew generation of Rhode Island and American workers. It is critical \nthat we seize these opportunities to help our country lead the world in \nmanufacturing.\n  Let's honor the great manufacturing history of America by investing \nin policies that create good-paying American jobs. I urge my colleagues \nto stand up for commonsense policies that will enable the American \nmanufacturing industry to lead the world.

It is a time to honor their strength, will, and \nperseverance. It is also a time to honor the memories of their loved \nones.\n  Freedom is not free. There is a cost, and that cost is paid first by \nour veterans and their families. That is why I am glad this week the \nHouse also did something to honor America's Gold Star Fathers with the \nGold Star Fathers Act.

We are unquestionably \nbetter off because of the work to which Mr. Gilliam devoted his life.\n  Mr. Gilliam served our country as a Buffalo Soldier in the U.S. Army. \nAfterwards, he served Delaware in many capacities, from being a \npeacemaker after the assassination of Martin Luther King to the \ndirector of New Castle County's Department of Community Development and \nHousing.\n  I was privileged to work with Mr. Gilliam in New Castle County, and \nsince then, I have often sought and respected Mr. Gilliam's counsel.

In 2013, the \nHoosier State had more meth incidents than any other State in the U.S.\n  Harry and his team, the Citizen Action Committee, are working to curb \nmeth production by partnering with local and State officials and \npharmacies to reduce pseudoephedrine sales, the active ingredient in \nproducing meth. They have taken the initiative in marketing drug abuse \nresistant products to their customers.\n  This is a critical issue for the whole country, but I am grateful for \nHarry's dedication and work to reduce the amount of meth labs in our \ncommunities.\n  Mr. Speaker, once again, join me in honoring Harry Webb for his meth \nlab reduction program and his service to our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6717-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WEAR RED WEDNESDAY\n\n  (Ms. WILSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. WILSON of Florida.

Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare is simply failing rural America. \nA recent report showed that rural residents are left with even higher \nskyrocketing costs and even more barriers to care.\n  A knee replacement in northern California, for example, is $43,000, \nbut the price tag for that same service for a knee replacement in Los \nAngeles is $27,000. In addition, residents in northern California face \na 7 percent increase, or a total of $384 a month or $4,600 a year, \nunder Covered California.\n  Our health industry needs competition, the key to driving costs down \nand increasing options for quality care. Unfortunately, the ACA has \nonly discouraged competition, especially in rural areas where more and \nmore physicians and providers are closing up shop, citing difficulties \nto operate under arbitrary regulations coming out of D.C.\n  Mr. Speaker, rather than hindering small business with red tape, \nlet's work to advance policies that encourage competition and location \nof doctors and nurses coming to rural America; and reward that \ninnovation so we can tackle the issues plaguing rural health care, such \nas the staggering doctor and nurse shortage and increasing premiums and \nbarriers to timely care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6717-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6717-H6718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                CONGRESS NEEDS TO SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE\n\n  (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILMER.

The bad \nnews is that Congress will have the same fight again just before the \nholidays start.\n  Why does this place keep playing the same dysfunctional record over \nand over? In my region, the last shutdown cost furloughs at our \nmilitary installations; Olympic National Park closed its doors, hurting \nlocal employers; tribes and social service providers and others faced \npainful disruptions of funding. I don't want to see that happen again.\n  This place is spending a lot of time and energy obsessing about who \nthe next Speaker will be. That is one job. We should be more concerned \nabout the thousands of jobs we need to grow and keep not just in my \nregion, but all around this country.\n  Congress needs to end the grandstanding and sit down at the table. \nLet's hammer out a budget agreement that finally ends the across-the-\nboard sequestration cuts and focuses on this Nation's economy and its \nlong-term growth.\n\n[[Page H6718]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6718-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n      HONORING CHERYL THIBODEAU WITH THE FRIST HUMANITARIAN AWARD\n\n  (Mr. GUINTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of New \nHampshire's leading citizens, Cheryl Thibodeau of Portsmouth Regional \nHospital. The hospital, serving the seacoast region of my State, \nawarded Cheryl its 2015 Frist Humanitarian Award for her service to the \nlocal community.\n  A nurse in the emergency ward, Cheryl is a consummate teammate to her \ncoworkers, frequently going above and beyond the call of duty.

Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have brought us again to the \nbrink of another government shutdown. Here we are, the last day of the \nfiscal year, and what we have before us today is a temporary, 2-month \nbudget to keep the government open, basically kicking the can down the \nroad, failing to take up the priorities of the American people, failing \nto bring any kind of a jobs plan, any kind of a plan to fix our roads \nand bridges in this country to put Americans back to work.\n  When I go home, I hear one thing over and over again, and I imagine \nother Members do, too. They tell us: Do your job. Do your job. You have \nhad months to bring budgets to this floor. Do your job.\n  It is that simple. We may disagree on what the outcome looks like, \nbut what we can't accept is the fact that the Congress of the United \nStates fails to do the one thing that it is directed to do under this \nConstitution. Do your job.\n  This has gone on far too long. Democrats are ready to sit down and \nnegotiate, to work together to try to come up with solutions to the big \nproblems we face, but we can't do it all by ourselves. We need a \npartner. Do your job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6718-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SPECIAL OPERATIONS APPRECIATION MONTH\n\n  (Mr. ZINKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor October as Special \nOperations Appreciation Month. The significance of October dates back \nto the roots of the first Special Forces service, aka the Devil's \nBrigade. This unit, like others--Scouts and Raiders, Rangers, and Naval \nDemolition Units--is where modern Special Operations Forces draw their \nroots.\n  We should also recognize the sacrifices of the families of these \nwarriors. From my own experience, having served 23 years as a Navy SEAL \nand commander at SEAL Team 6, my wife, Lola, was oftentimes both mom \nand father. At one time during the war in Iraq, my wife, Lola, was at \nhome with our two young boys while her husband, daughter, and son-in-\nlaw were all forward deployed.\n  Special Operations Appreciation Month is just as much about the \nheroes at home as it is the heroes abroad. I ask you today to please \njoin me in supporting and recognizing October as Special Operations \nAppreciation Month. May God bless America and the troops that defend \nher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6718-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DO THE BUSINESS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\n\n  (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, from the moment that House Republicans \ncame to power, the majority has failed to do its job. They have \nconsistently abdicated their responsibility to govern. They have \nconsistently taken the American people on reckless legislative joyrides \nguaranteed to crash and burn. As former New York Knick Michael Ray \nRichardson once famously observed as his team's season was headed in \nthe wrong direction, this ship be sinking.\n  Mr. Speaker, House Republicans need to end their obsession with the \nAffordable Care Act, end their obsession with hurting immigrant \nfamilies, end their obsession with Planned Parenthood. It is time to \nend sequestration, to fully fund the government, and get back to doing \nthe business of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6718-5", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  OUR NATION'S DEBT IS EATING US ALIVE\n\n  (Mr. McCLINTOCK asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, our Nation's debt is eating us alive, \nand without changing our disastrous fiscal course, the CBO warns that \nour interest costs will exceed our entire defense budget in just 8 \nyears.\n  For the first time in a decade, this Congress has adopted a budget to \nrestore fiscal solvency. Having set that course, we now must stay that \ncourse. That is what the appropriations process is all about.\n  For months, Senate Democrats have blocked consideration of any of the \nappropriations bills we have sent them unless we discard the budget and \nput our country back on the road to bankruptcy.\n  Today we have reached the fiscal deadline. A temporary funding bill \nis necessary to keep the government open, and I would support it if the \nHouse and Senate leadership announced a timetable to complete our work \nand pledged to keep to that timetable. Without that announcement, a \nshort-term CR simply continues us on an unsustainable course.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6718-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HUNGER TOUCHES EVERY COMMUNITY\n\n  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, this September Feeding America's national \nnetwork of food banks and hunger advocates took part in Hunger Action \nMonth, yet here in Congress, as September comes to an end, I am not \nsure that Hunger Action Month ever began. Nearly 49 million Americans, \nincluding over 15 million children, live in food-insecure households. \nThat is shameful.\n  Hunger touches every community--every community. In my own Florida \ndistrict in Palm Beach and Broward Counties, about 15 percent of \nhouseholds are food-insecure. That is nearly half a million people who \ndon't know where their next meal will come from.\n  Thankfully, the generosity of our community and the work of groups \nlike Feeding South Florida help keep hungry families fed, but those \nwith the greatest power to end hunger are right here in the United \nStates Congress. As Pope Francis said to this Chamber just last week: \nThe fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly and on \nmany fronts. Let's heed his words.\n  This week I will introduce the Food Security Improvement Act of 2015, \na bill to ensure SNAP benefits reflect the real costs of feeding a \nfamily in need. I invite my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this \nlegislation. Let's mark the end of Hunger Action Month by taking action \nhere in this House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6718-7", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6718-H6719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NATIONAL PEDIATRIC BONE CANCER AWARENESS DAY\n\n  (Mr. FARENTHOLD asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\n[[Page H6719]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD.

Every year countless children are \ndiagnosed with different cancers, altering their lives forever.\n  Fourteen-year-old Kaitlyn Jankovsky of Corpus Christi was diagnosed \nlast year with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although her cancer and \ntreatment have been a challenge, Kaitlyn has shown great tenacity in \nher fight against cancer.\n  Our country should take inspiration from children like Kaitlyn and \nthousands of others living with cancer every day. It is why I have \nintroduced H. Res. 102 to designate a day in September as National \nPediatric Bone Cancer Awareness Day.\n  Today we wish Kaitlyn and all the other children living with \npediatric cancer well. Treatment and survival rates for pediatric bone \ncancer have remained virtually unchanged for a quarter of a century. \nFor Kaitlyn and other children, let's start changing that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6719-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SICKLE CELL ANEMIA\n\n  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a topic near and dear \nto my heart: sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell is an inherited blood \ndisease where red blood cells are abnormally shaped, making it hard to \ndeliver oxygen throughout the body, often causing extreme pain, \ndamaging vital organs, and possible stroke.\n  I have seen these effects firsthand. My sister died from sickle cell \njust 2 weeks before her 27th birthday. I will never forget the many \nnight trips to the emergency room to get care for her, since we didn't \nhave health insurance.\n  Back then we didn't know much about sickle cell disease. Today \nmedical treatment and research for sickle cell has evolved. Thanks to \nthe Affordable Care Act, more people now have health insurance, but we \nmust still support Federal efforts to fund additional research and \ntreatment opportunities.\n  That is why I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 1807, the Sickle Cell \nResearch Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act, which supports \nfunding for advanced medical treatment and research.\n  My colleagues, please join me in recognizing September as Sickle Cell \nAwareness Month by supporting legislation to treat this disease and by \nkeeping our government running so critical sickle cell research and \ntreatment can continue at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6719-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SEQUESTRATION IS HURTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\n\n  (Mr. RUPPERSBERGER asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to how \nsequestration and the current dysfunction in the House is hurting the \nAmerican people, our infrastructure, our education, our national \nsecurity, and our veterans. Sequestration has caused a severe slowdown \nin our job growth in this country, especially as it affects the middle \nclass.\n  We have seen reduction of job growth resulting in the potential loss \nof close to 800,000 American jobs. These are jobs my constituents in \nBaltimore County region desperately need. Just yesterday my staff met \nwith a constituent from Owings Mills, Maryland, who was laid off from a \ndefense contractor due to sequestration cuts.\n  The current fiscal year 2016 transportation and housing appropriation \nbill cuts TIGER grants, which are used to fund critical highway, \ntransit, and important investments, by approximately $400 million. That \nis less than the fiscal year 2015 level and $1.2 billion less than the \nPresident's request. We need this transportation money for jobs. Our \ninfrastructure is failing.\n  We cannot stay competitive without investment. Sequestration is not \nthe answer. Continuing resolutions are not the answer. Passing the buck \nis not the answer. It is time for Congress to stop the nip-and-tuck \ntactics and make tough decisions about our priorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6719-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks on S. 2082.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill, which is sponsored by our Senate colleague, \nSenator Isakson, chairman of the Senate VA Committee, would extend a \nnumber of expiring current authorities and critical programs at both \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Labor. These \ninclude extensions for veterans' health care and homeless programs; \nbenefits for disabled veterans; vocational rehabilitation programs for \nservicemembers and veterans; home loan programs; and a variety of \nadvisory committees, pilot programs, and medical facility projects.\n  Absent passage of this legislation today, these important and \nnoncontroversial authorizations and programs are set to expire at the \nend of this fiscal or calendar year. These are not new programs, and \nthe costs have either been fully offset or have been assumed in the \nbaseline budget for fiscal year 2016. Furthermore, both the majority \nand minority of the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs \nhave worked on this language and agree on the need to extend all of \nthese programs.\n  In addition to the extensions that are included, this bill also \ncontains language that would increase the total authorization for the \nDenver Replacement Medical Center project to $1.675 billion. This is an \nincrease of $625 million above the amounts that have previously been \nauthorized for this project.\n  To ensure that the many egregious mistakes the VA has made in Denver \nare not repeated in the future, this bill would put into place initial \nreforms for managing the most expensive VA construction projects. \nNamely, these reforms include creating a new classification category \ncalled a super construction project.\n  A super construction project would be defined as the construction, \nalteration, or acquisition of a VA medical facility involving the total \nexpenditure of more than $100 million. Each super construction project \nwould be managed not by VA, but instead by a non-Department Federal \nentity, such as the Army Corps of Engineers. Importantly, the bill \nwould classify the Denver project as a super construction project.\n  While I am supportive of the provisions of this bill up to this \npoint, I vehemently oppose and disagree with the Department's proposal \nto cover some of the increased costs of the Denver project. This bill \ncould allow VA to proceed with the Department's proposed plan to use \n$200 million in offsets from the medical services account and through \ndelayed activations for other construction projects.\n  Mr. Speaker, to understand the magnitude of the management \nincompetence of the Department of Veterans Affairs as it relates to \nconstruction, I think a little history is in order.\n  The replacement of the existing Denver VA Medical Center began as a \ndiscussion item back in 1999. The project was first envisioned as a \nshared facility on the former Fitzsimons Army Base in Aurora, Colorado. \nThe initial estimate for a shared facility was $328 million.\n  After undergoing numerous scope changes over a period of several \nyears, VA requested appropriations in 2010 for a stand-alone medical \ncenter replacement with a total estimated cost of $800 million. \nHowever, in December of last year, with less than 50 percent of the \nfacility complete and staring down the $800 million authorization cap, \nthe Civilian Board of Contract Appeals found VA to be in breach of its \ncontract with its general contractor Kiewit-Turner. As a result, VA had \nno choice but to come to Congress and finally admit the severity of the \nmismanagement and the cost and schedule overruns that have come to \ncharacterize the Denver project.\n  In June, following an assessment to determine the probable cost of \ncompleting the project, the Army Corps of Engineers provided the final \ntotal required to finish the Denver project: $1.675 billion.\n  Several weeks ago, VA provided the committee with their plan as to \nwhat budget resources would be made available to fund the remaining \ndollars necessary for this project. This bill assumes that VA's plan is \nan appropriate way to move forward on this project.\n  VA first proposes to use $100 million in offsets derived from the \nhigher than budgeted medical collections VA expects it will receive in \nfiscal year 2015 and 2016. Under law, VA medical care collection funds \nare retained by VA medical facilities to supplement their budgets to \ncare for veterans. Thus, their proposed offset actually reduces VA's \nmedical care budget by $100 million in fiscal year 2016 to partially \nfund the remainder of the Denver project.\n  I would have reservations about reducing VA's medical care budget in \nany year, but I am particularly concerned this year, because just a few \nweeks ago, I am sure the Members will recall, VA sounded the alarm that \nthe funds budgeted for hepatitis C medications and care in the \ncommunity for fiscal year 2016 are short.\n  VA also stated that they would need to shut down the whole hospital \nsystem. The whole hospital system would have to be shut down if \nadditional funds for fiscal year 2015 were not provided. As a result, \nCongress met VA's eleventh hour plea with an additional $3.43 billion \nto ensure that veterans\n\n[[Page H6723]]\n\nwere not denied the care that they had earned.\n  Obviously, VA's proposal to cut medical care funds to complete the \nDenver replacement hospital when the public record clearly reflects \nVA's previous testimony over lack of funding in the medical care \naccount is entirely inconsistent and inappropriate. Frankly, it borders \non an attempt to mislead this Congress.\n  Secondly, VA proposes to use $100 million in offsets derived from \nreductions in construction and leasing activation costs due to schedule \nadjustments associated with several projects. When I asked what VA's \nplan was to address the funding for these adjustments, VA's response \nwas that the Department would ensure that they request sufficient \nactivation funding in future budget years to account for the reductions \nin the other projects.\n  In other words, it is not really an offset. They are going to ask for \nthe money back. So by reducing other projects by $100 million in one \nyear only to ask Congress next year for the funds to be replaced \nstrains credibility once again for the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  This isn't an offset. It is nothing more than a delayed supplemental \nrequest. In other words, VA is expecting the taxpayers to bail them out \nagain. To agree to such a tactic would be akin to taking a child's \nallowance away for misbehavior, only to increase it later to make up \nfor the reduction.\n  Offsetting the biggest construction failure in VA's history by \ncutting money from VA's medical services account and delaying facility \nactivation costs until next year punishes the veterans of this Nation \nand the taxpayers for VA's incompetence.\n  Now, I appreciate the challenge VA has in identifying available money \nand producing a way ahead for this project that is fair to taxpayers \nand veterans alike in a tight fiscal environment. However, VA continues \nto be oblivious to the need to prioritize their spending.\n\n  For example, as I address this House this afternoon, VA officials \nfrom across the country have gathered 40 miles away in Leesburg for a \nleadership conference that is costing the Department $1 million. That \nmay seem like a small amount, but this is in addition to the $33.4 \nmillion that VA reported spending on conferences so far through the end \nof the third quarter of this fiscal year. To repeat, VA has reported \nspending $33.4 million so far through the end of the third quarter, \nwith at least one and, likely, several other costly conferences that \nhave yet to be accounted for.\n  What's more, Monday, the VA inspector general released a report on \nVA's relocation expenses program, which found that senior Veterans \nBenefits Administration officials had misused their positions for their \nown personal and financial benefit. These senior officials engineered \nthe transfers of other senior officials as a way to increase pay for \nthemselves and to other senior executive service employees and work \naround the pay freezes and bans on performance awards for senior \nleaders. One VBA leader alone received almost $300,000 in relocation \nexpenses when she moved from Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia.\n  In total, VBA spent over $1.7 million on reassignment expenses, \nincluding almost $1.3 million on relocation expenses for senior \nexecutives for fiscal years 2013 through 2015.\n  And now yesterday, the VA Office of Inspector General substantiated \nallegations that the St. Louis VA Health Care System mental health \nclinic inappropriately changed the status of mental health consults to \n``complete'' prior to a provider actually completing the appointment \nwith a patient in 60 percent of sampled consults.\n  To make matters worse, the IG substantiated that, in a review of \nfiscal 2013 facility performance pay assessments, eight full-time \noutpatient psychiatrists received an average of nearly $14,000 in \nperformance pay. Seven of the eight psychiatrists met or exceeded the \nproductivity goal, and, as a result, each received an average of around \n$2,900 for what proved to be faulty productivity achievements.\n  This is in keeping with the wanton and abusive VA spending practices \nthat the committee has uncovered at VA facilities across our country.\n  For example, the committee recently found that the VA Palo Alto \nHealth Care System has spent at least $6.3 million on art and \nconsulting services. These projects include an art installation on the \nside of a parking garage that displays quotes by Abraham Lincoln and \nEleanor Roosevelt in--wait for it--Morse code that cost $285,000. It \nactually lights up; also, a large rock sculpture in the courtyard in \nthe middle of the mental health center that cost $1.3 million--for a \nrock; a stainless steel and aluminum sculpture in the aquatic center \nentrance that cost $365,000; another sculpture that I am at a loss to \ndescribe in an exterior lobby that cost $305,000; a sculpture in the \nshape of a half arc that is located inside the mental health center \nthat cost $330,000. As many of these projects are not yet complete, \nthese costs actually could increase.\n  Let me be clear: spending money on conferences and relocation \nexpenses for VA employees and on art installations for VA facilities is \nnot more important than taking care of the veterans of this Nation, \nproviding them the health care that they have earned. It is simply \nbeyond me why VA would choose to pay to complete the Denver project by \ncutting medical services and medical facility dollars, but not the \nexorbitant conference spending, bloated relocation expenses, or art.\n  I remain committed to finding a way forward in Denver, and I am going \nto be supporting the bill today. However, I am equally convinced that \nwe must ensure that the offsets that VA uses in Colorado do not come at \nthe expense of VA's most important mission: providing high-quality \nhealth care for veterans. Unfortunately, VA's plan offers no assurance.\n  I am also frustrated that the Department's plan, which this bill \npresumes is appropriate, offers no measure of accountability for those \nresponsible for allowing this project to balloon out of control. The VA \nsenior executives in charge of the Denver disaster collected massive \nbonuses as projected costs increased and delays stretched on for years. \nThey have all retired with full retirement benefits. It is inexcusable.\n  To allow rewards, bonuses, and full retirement benefits to be \nretained, even when the facts indicate that an employee has not \nperformed at the level expected, is not only wrong, it is a blatant and \nwoeful misuse of taxpayer dollars.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  I have said repeatedly that the great majority of VA employees are \nhardworking public servants who go to work every day and live up to \nPresident Lincoln's words, to provide quality health care and benefits \nto our Nation's veterans.\n  What's more, I believe that the majority of VA employees who are \ndedicated to the mission and purpose of the Department are just as \nfrustrated and demoralized as we are when they see problem employees \nreceiving bonuses or performance awards in spite of poor, unethical, \nand sometimes illegal job performance.\n  I just wish that this legislation could assure those quality \nemployees that the veterans that they serve--that this Congress and \nthis Department are committed to breaking VA's vicious cycle of \nignoring and even rewarding poor performance.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, how much time do we have?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman has 20 minutes remaining. \nThe gentleman from Florida has 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I \nmay consume.\n  I rise in support of S. 2082, the Department of Veterans Affairs \nExpiring Authorities Act of 2015.\n  This bill is an important and necessary bill for us to take up and \npass today and send to the President. Let me repeat that. This bill is \nan important and a necessary bill for us to take up and pass today and \nsend to the President.\n  S. 2082 makes sure that some of the vital programs we have in place \nto take care of our veterans continue past the end of the fiscal year \nand continue to help our veterans. I want to highlight just some of \nthose importance programs.\n  S. 2082 ensures that several programs serving the homeless veterans \ncontinue, including the Homeless Veterans\n\n[[Page H6724]]\n\nand Homeless Veterans With Children Reintegration Programs.\n  S. 2082 ensures that there is adequate authorization levels for much-\nneeded assistance and support service for veterans' caregivers.\n  S. 2082 continues a successful pilot program that counsels newly \nseparated women veterans in retreat settings. This is an important \nprogram.\n  I have a bill, H.R. 1575, that would make this program permanent and \nhas passed the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and I hope it will be \nbrought to the floor soon so that we can vote for it.\n  S. 2082 also extends the authorization of the National Academy of \nSciences to continue its research into the health consequences of Agent \nOrange exposure, providing the necessary link for the VA to make \ndisability presumptions.\n  I am disappointed that the provision mandating the Secretary to make \nthese presumptions is not in the bill, and I know that we will all work \ntogether to make sure that the VA does the right thing for our \nveterans.\n  S. 2082 extends the authorization for the VA to provide \ntransportation grants for highly rural veterans and the ability of the \nVA to provide transportation to and from VA facilities. This is \nimportant to ensure that our veterans have access to care.\n  S. 2082 extends the authorization of the VA to provide rehabilitation \nand vocational benefits for our wounded warriors.\n  And, finally, S. 2082 provides for an increase in the authorization \nlevel for the Denver Regional VA Medical Center. This center will \nprovide specialty care for all VISN 19, which includes Montana, \nWyoming, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, Utah, and Idaho. We need to finish \nthis project and better provide health care for our veterans.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), a distinguished member of the committee.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2082, and I thank \nChairman Miller for his efforts to extend authority for various VA \nhealthcare, benefits, disability, housing, education, job training, and \nother assistance programs.\n  Part of this bill also ensures that Colorado veterans will receive a \ncompleted, state-of-the-art new hospital in Denver.\n  In addition to funding the hospital, though, S. 2082 ensures that the \ntype of construction mismanagement and cost overruns will not happen on \nfuture large-scale VA construction programs.\n  The VA has shown us on multiple projects, Denver being, \nunfortunately, the largest, that they are not properly equipped to \nhandle these large construction projects with their own in-house \ncapabilities.\n  The bill requires that the Army Corps of Engineers or NAVFAC or a \ndifferent construction agency, but not the VA, will take on the task of \nmanaging these large construction programs.\n  We must be good stewards of the taxpayers' money and use that money \nwisely to care for the veterans. This bill is a step in the right \ndirection to get VA construction back on the right path, while \nfulfilling the promise made with the hospital to our Nation's veterans.\n  We have a sacred trust to take care of the men and women who have \ndefended our country.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus).\n  Ms. TITUS. I thank the ranking member for yielding and for her \nleadership on the VA Committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant support of this bill, S. 2082, the \nVA Expiring Authorities Act.\n  As my colleagues have outlined, this legislation will extend the \nauthorization for some very good programs at the VA that provide \nvaluable support and services for our Nation's heroes.\n  I have serious concerns, however, about one provision included in the \nbill. Title V raises the authorization for the Denver medical facility \nby more than $600 million. This facility is already $1 billion over \nbudget and years behind schedule.\n  The bill, however, does not explain how we are going to pay for this \nincrease. That will come later today when the House considers a \ncontinuing resolution to keep the government running for another 10 \nweeks. Buried in the CR is a provision that allows the VA to play a \nshell game within their budget to pay for the Denver project.\n  Now, we all believe that veterans everywhere, including in Denver, \nshould have access to the best health care possible. But the funds for \nthe Denver project should not come at the expense of veterans in Nevada \nand in other parts of the country.\n  Nonetheless, the VA has identified the $600 million to pay for the \nDenver facility and has said that these specific cuts are designed to \n``minimize the impact on veterans.''\n  Well, this couldn't be further from the truth, and it ignores \nreality. It is the epitome of robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  Let me remind you that, in the summer of 2014, we passed an emergency \nCHOICE Act of some $15 billion to help the VA with the healthcare \nbacklog.\n  Then the VA came back to us this summer and said they would have to \nclose hospitals if we didn't allow them to move some money out of the \nCHOICE Act.\n\n  Then the VA came back and said they needed $200 million just to keep \nthe Denver project going for a while. Now the VA is saying: Oh, no \nproblem. We can just move $600 million out of existing programs so we \ncan help Denver without it hurting veterans.\n  How can they possibly do this?\n  The VA, I can tell you, has proposed cutting IT services, despite the \nfact that many of their IT systems are 30 years old and need to be \nreplaced.\n  They want to cut funds for a program that helps recruit and retain \nthe best personnel to serve veterans at a time when they are struggling \nto recruit and retain qualified employees, including specialists and \ndoctors. They want to cut eight construction projects around the \ncountry, from operating rooms to a dialysis center.\n  Now, how can you say these cuts won't hurt veterans?\n  Now, we know a thing or two about sure things in Las Vegas. Well, I \ncan tell you it is a sure thing that, soon enough, the VA will be \ncoming back to Congress, proclaiming yet another doomsday if we don't \nrefill these accounts that they are now robbing.\n  So I say to you Congress needs to do its job and actually pay for \nwhat we have bought. Wars are expensive. We need to recognize that. We \ncan't keep playing budget games and nickel-and-dime the services that \nthe brave men and women who fought in these wars need and deserve when \nthey come home.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Denver (Mr. Coffman), an able co-chair of the committee \nwho has been in the forefront of this entire fight looking at the cost \noverruns, the mismanagement, and trying to keep this project on \nschedule.\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my support for the Veterans \nAffairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2015. This legislation will \ncontinue numerous programs of critical importance to our Nation's \nveterans, including a pilot program to increase women veterans' access \nto health care, nursing home care authorities, and measures to combat \nveteran homelessness.\n  I am proud that this legislation will allow for the completion of the \nVA replacement hospital in Aurora, Colorado, an absolutely critical \nproject which will serve veterans not just in Colorado, but also in \nUtah, Montana, Wyoming and parts of four other States.\n  In spite of the incredible mismanagement of this project by the VA \nand a shocking lack of accountability for those responsible, completing \nthe hospital in Aurora has been my number one legislative priority. We \nmust not punish our Nation's veterans for the sins of incompetent VA \nbureaucrats.\n  Finally, this bill would accomplish a goal that I have worked towards \nfor over a year, getting the VA out of the major construction business \nonce and for all.\n  For decades, the Government Accountability Office has highlighted \nenormous construction management deficiencies by the VA.\n  After the GAO highlighted hundreds of millions in cost overruns in \nApril of 2013, the House passed my legislation, which would have handed \nover the\n\n[[Page H6725]]\n\nworst VA projects to experts at the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  Worse, billions of dollars have been wasted by VA on mismanaged \nconstruction projects which could have gone instead towards veterans' \nhealth care and benefits.\n  I am proud that this bill will finally leave the construction \nmanagement of large projects to the experts, organizations like the \nArmy Corps of Engineers, and allow VA to focus back to its core \ncompetencies, providing health care and benefits to our veterans.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Denver, Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter), who \nreally can give us a little institutional memory on the Denver regional \nhospital and who has been at the forefront of this hospital and this \nregional problem from the beginning.\n  Mr. PERLMUTTER. I thank Ranking Member Brown for yielding me time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the committee for \nbringing S. 2082 to the floor for debate and hearing today.\n  I rise today to support S. 2082, the Department of Veterans Affairs \nExpiring Authorities Act. The legislation before us passed the Senate \nunanimously last week and is important for a number of VA programs our \nveterans rely on day in and day out.\n  In addition to these important VA extensions, this legislation will \nauthorize completion of the VA Medical Center under construction in \nAurora, Colorado. This center is part of a major medical campus that \nincludes the University of Colorado Medical School as well as \nChildren's Hospital of Denver.\n  The professors at the University of Colorado are also many of the \ndoctors at the VA Medical Center. The center will include a full range \nof medical, laboratory, research, and counseling services as well as a \n30-bed spinal cord injury unit serving hundreds of thousands of \nveterans throughout the Rocky Mountain West.\n  As the chairman mentioned, this hospital's genesis began under \nPresident Clinton in 1999 with the Secretary of VA at that time. Under \nGeorge Bush, it went through four Secretaries of the VA and, under \nPresident Obama, now two VA Secretaries.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  It is moving forward and, with this bill, will continue to move \nforward.\n  There is no doubt the VA mismanaged this project from the start; and \nas disappointing and unacceptable as this situation has been, we are \nwhere we are. Under the leadership of Secretary McDonald and Deputy \nSecretary Gibson, the VA has admitted their mistakes on this project, \nand they are both personally involved in completion of this facility.\n  Today, construction continues on the project in earnest. The facility \nis more than 50 percent complete, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nhas been brought in to oversee completion of the medical center. \nBringing in the Army Corps is important so we, as a Congress, can be \ncertain that any additional funds spent on this project are spent \nappropriately and the facility is completed without further delay.\n  The contractor, Kiewit-Turner, and subcontractors have shown \ntremendous commitment to our Nation's veterans by building a world-\nclass facility, and I am confident they will deliver this facility to \nour veterans throughout the Rocky Mountain West.\n  This bill requires the VA to use a non-VA Federal entity, like the \nArmy Corps, to complete major construction projects valued at over $100 \nmillion. This is critically important towards ensuring accountability \nand preventing these large projects from being mismanaged again.\n  I want to thank Chairman Miller and Ranking Member Brown, as well as \nCongressman Charlie Dent and Congressman Bishop, for their work with me \nand the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Coffman), who now represents the \ndistrict.\n  There has been a great deal of anger at the VA recently and much of \nit is well-deserved, but through the help of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee and the Appropriations Committee, Rocky Mountain veterans \nwill eventually see this medical center completed and receive the \nhealth care that they earned by their service to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I thank my friend, the gentlewoman from Florida, for yielding.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Perlmutter) for working so closely with Mr. Coffman, a \ntrue bipartisan effort, to see this project to completion.\n  Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The gentleman from \nFlorida has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Florida has \n9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, might I inquire from Ms. Brown if \nshe would yield 5 minutes of her time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, since I have 9 minutes remaining, \nand I have no further speakers, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Miller).\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Florida yields 5 \nminutes to the gentleman from Florida.\n  Without objection, the gentleman from Florida will control those 5 \nminutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. \nAbraham), a member of the committee that has worked very hard on this \nparticular issue, especially the Expiring Authorities bill, the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand today in support of S. 2082; however, I would \nlike to note that I am also deeply disappointed that we are not voting \non the House bills which would have limited awards and bonuses to VA \nemployees. It is my belief that we have missed an opportunity to bring \nmuch-needed accountability to the VA, and know that I will work \ntirelessly to bring accountability to the VA for the American people.\n  S. 2082, also known as the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring \nAuthorities Act of 2015, includes multiple necessary provisions \nsupporting our Nation's heroes, including veterans who are homeless, \ndisabled, or suffering from PTSD.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial \nAffairs, I introduced a particular provision in S. 2082 to extend \ncontract exams for veterans applying for disability benefits. Extending \ncontract exams is a commonsense measure to cut through the bureaucratic \nred tape and ensure our veterans are getting the care they need when \nthey need it.\n  Many veterans undergo a VA medical examination in support of their \napplication for disability benefits. The problem is that there are not \nenough examiners to perform these evaluations in a timely manner in the \nVA system.\n  Expanding contract exams will make it easier for the VA to arrange \nfor the veterans to get disability examinations by permitting a \nlicensed physician to conduct these examinations anywhere in the United \nStates as long as the doctor is under a VA contract. This is common \nsense, and I urge passage of the bill.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the former chairman of the \nVeterans Affairs Committee, a stalwart supporter of America's veterans.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank my good friend for yielding, and I \nthank the gentlewoman from Florida, Corrine Brown, for her courtesy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I served on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee for a \nquarter of a century, including stints as vice chairman and full \ncommittee chair. I believe that our Nation's veterans are fortunate to \nhave a great champion with the gentleman from Florida, Chairman Miller, \nat the helm.\n  Chairman Miller has led the committee with aggressive oversight and \naccountability of the often-troubled Department. He has shepherded \nnumerous bills into law, including the VA Choice Program, which expands \ntimely and local access to health care for veterans, and, working so \nclosely in a bipartisan way with Ranking Member Brown, ensured that the \nVA has the resources and the authorities to meet\n\n[[Page H6726]]\n\nevolving needs. The chairman always puts veterans and their dependents \nfirst.\n  Chairman Miller has explained the bill. I will just take a brief \nmoment to comment on title III.\n  Title III reauthorizes a number of provisions from a law that I wrote \nback in 2001 known as the Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance \nAct, or Public Law 107-95. That law established the grant programs that \nincluded female veterans, homeless veterans with special needs, \nchildren, serious mental illnesses, and incarcerated veterans. The act \nauthorized dental care. We learned through our hearing process that not \nonly oral health--but overall health as well--is negatively affected \nwith broken and diseased teeth and gums. And you don't get a job with \nbusted teeth. Oral health was critical, so we put that into the bill. \nJob training and expanded domiciliary care programs were also expanded. \nIt also authorized the Advisory Committee on Homeless Veterans and \nlaunched the national goal, which has now been replicated since 2010, \nof attempting to end chronic homelessness among veterans. We also did \nthe Department of Labor's Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program and \nthe HUD-VASH program.\n  In 2001, the estimation from VA was that almost 300,000 veterans were \nhomeless at some time during that year. By fiscal year 2013, that \nnumber had decreased to approximately 140,000 veterans. Of course we \nnow have a different, altered way of calculating, but, unfortunately, \non any given night last year, just under 50,000 veterans were still on \nthe street.\n  This legislation will go far and do much so that no veteran is on the \nstreet and suffering homelessness. We need to bring them back into \nsociety.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Miller for his strong leadership.\n  Thank you, Chairman Miller, for your leadership on this bill and your \nstaff's work to bring it to the floor in a timely manner to ensure that \nthe VA continues to provide the services necessary for veterans to \nsuccessfully transition back to civilian life and live independently.\n  Mr. Speaker, I served on the House Veteran's Affairs Committee for a \nquarter of a century, including stints as vice and full committee chair \nand I believe that our nation's veterans are fortunate to have a great \nchampion with Chairman Miller at the helm. Chairman Miller led the \ncommittee with aggressive oversight and accountability of the often \ntroubled Department. You have shepherded numerous bills into law \nincluding the VA Choice program which expands timely and local access \nto healthcare for veterans and you've ensured that the VA has the \nresources and authorities to meet evolving needs. You have always put \nveterans and their dependents--first.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill we are voting on today will reauthorize over 30 \ncritical programs that provide healthcare, education, and child care \nbenefits to veterans and continue the VA's homeless veterans and \ncaregiver assistance.\n  Since Chairman Miller has explained the bill let me focus for a \nmoment on Title III which extends many provisions first authorized by \nlandmark legislation I authored in 2001 known as the Homeless Veterans \nComprehensive Assistance Act (Public Law 107-95).\n  That law established the grant programs we are reauthorizing today \nthat focused on homeless female veterans; homeless veterans with \nspecial needs, children, serious mental illnesses, and incarcerated \nveterans. The Act authorized dental care--for better oral health and \noverall health--job training and expanded domiciliary care programs. It \nis hard to get a job if your teeth are cracked and deteriorated. It \nauthorized the Advisory Committee on Homeless Veterans and launched the \nnational goal of attempting to end chronic homelessness among veterans \nwithin a decade of the enactment of the Act. And among its many other \nprovisions, it increased funding for two programs that were effective \nbut seriously underfunded.\n  The first was the Department of Labor's Homeless Veterans \nReintegration Program--which helps homeless veterans reenter and stay \nin the labor force. Allowing more veterans access to this program was \ncritical, as a steady job is key to successfully maintaining a \nresidence.\n  The second is the HUD-VASH program, which combines rental assistance \nwith case management and clinical services. After enactment, \nutilization of these services spiked and more veterans received the \nassistance that has led to self-sufficiency and independence.\n  Today, these programs continue to be a highly effective means of \nreducing homelessness among our veterans population.\n  In 2001, it was estimated that almost 300,000 veterans experienced \nhomelessness that year. By fiscal year 2013, that number had decreased \nto approximately 140,000 veterans.\n  The VA and HUD have since changed how they calculate homeless \nveterans to a point-in-time estimate. The latest numbers show that we \nstill have much work to do: on any given night last year, just under \n50,000 veterans were on the street.\n  Of course one homeless veteran is one too many. Yet we are continuing \nto make progress and the numbers demonstrate how these programs, \ncoupled with other recent and successful programs like the Supportive \nServices for Veteran Families (SSVF) Program which we are reauthorizing \ntoday, are tangibly assisting homeless or potentially homeless women \nand men who served in our nation's armed forces. It is estimated that \napproximately 135,000 veterans and their families got assistance \nthrough SSVF in (FY) 2015 including funds to Soldier On and other \ninitiatives in my state.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 2082, \nsending this important bill to the President so that the vital programs \nhelping our veterans will continue past the end of this fiscal year.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller).\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. I thank Ranking Member Brown for her courtesy \nin yielding an additional few minutes for some of our Members who \nwanted to speak.\n  I, too, think it is very important that we pass this piece of \nlegislation today, but our job here is not finished. We must ensure \nthat the appropriators now do their job and make sure that VA doesn't, \nas the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus) said, rob Peter to pay Paul. \nIt is important that we not take necessary dollars away from veteran \nhealth care in order to pay for their massive mismanagement of this \nparticular facility.\n  I urge a positive vote on this Senate bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my good friend from \nFlorida for his work on the VA extenders bill. I appreciate his \npartnership as we continue to fight for our veterans.\n  However, Mr. Speaker, I remain deeply disappointed that this \nextenders bill does not include an extension of the Agent Orange Act.\n  As you know, Congress passed the Agent Orange Act in 1991 to ensure \ncare and compensation to Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. \nBefore this bill, it was up to our veterans to prove their cancer or \nParkinson's was connected to their service in Vietnam and their \nexposure to Agent Orange.\n  The Agent Orange Act changed all of that, shifting the burden of \nproof from the veteran to the VA. Under the Agent Orange Act, the IOM \nwould study Agent Orange and determine which diseases were associated \nwith exposure to Agent Orange. This process removed the burden of proof \nfrom our Vietnam veterans when they applied for disability \ncompensation.\n  Over the years, the IOM has issued reports that have led to the \npresumption of service connection for diseases such as Parkinson's, B-\ncell leukemia and early onset peripheral neuropathy. Without these \nstudies, thousands of Vietnam era veterans would have gone without the \nbenefits they greatly deserve.\n  The Agent Orange Act is set to expire tomorrow, but IOM is still \nworking on their last report.\n  And, despite the good the Agent Orange Act has done for our Vietnam \nveterans, Congress is going to let this bill expire tomorrow.\n  And it's all because it costs too much.\n  Mr. Speaker, it never costs too much to ensure justice for our \nveterans.\n  We should be ashamed that we are letting this bill expire and leaving \nit up to the VA to add new diseases to the presumption list.\n  The Agent Orange Act has worked for our veterans for over a decade, \nand it is irresponsible to let our oversight expire and simply leave it \nup to the VA's discretion.\n  Mr. Speaker, we cannot step away from our responsibilities and hand \nthem over to an agency, simply because we do not like the price tag.\n  Instead, we should do the right thing and find an offset.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to demand Leadership go back and find an \noffset outside of the VA to ensure our veterans get the benefits they \nearned.\n  We have a responsibility to these veterans. They completed their \nmission in Vietnam, now we must complete ours.\n  By finding an offset and passing this extension, we will make certain \nthat when the IOM's final report is published, the VA is obligated to \nreview it and follow their recommendations.\n  We owe these heroes nothing less.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my \nconcerns regarding\n\n[[Page H6727]]\n\ntwo provisions in S. 2082, the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring \nAuthorities Act of 2015: Sec. 501 the increased authorization for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facility project in Denver, \nColorado and Sec. 412 the modification of authorization for the VA \nmedical facility project in Tampa, Florida which is designated as an \nemergency.\n\n\nSec. 501 Increased authorization for the VA medical facility project in \n                            Denver, Colorado\n\n  Originally budgeted to be an $800 million dollar project, the VA is \nnow requesting yet another funding transfer from Congress to bring the \ntotal price tag of this medical facility to an astounding $1.675 \nbillion, more than $800 million dollars over budget. Mismanagement of \nconstruction projects, and the unacceptable waste of taxpayer dollars, \nunfortunately have been an ongoing problem at the VA. It is deplorable \nand should not be tolerated by Congress or the Administration.\n  This project is a perfect example of why the VA is in dire need of \nwholesale reform in addition to continued oversight by Congress to \nensure that the VA is transparent, accountable, and ultimately able to \nbest serve our nation's veterans. I fully support the House Committee \non Veterans' Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller's efforts to directly address \nthe construction problems at the VA and other efforts by his Committee \nto enforce accountability agency-wide, including H.R. 1994, the VA \nAccountability Act of 2015, which passed the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives on July 29, 2015. I also applaud Chairman Miller's \nversion of an increased authorization for the Denver project bill, H.R. \n3595, because it included offsets to help pay for the increase in costs \nat the Denver facility. These offsetting policies in H.R. 3595 are a \nclear indication that the U.S. House of Representatives is no longer \nwilling to tolerate misbehavior and poor performance at the VA and \ninclude the following: limitation on awards and bonuses for VA \nemployees, reduction of benefits for members of the Senior Executive \nService at the VA convicted of certain crimes, and authority for the VA \nSecretary to recoup bonuses or awards paid to employees in the past if \ndeemed appropriate pursuant to regulations. Unfortunately, S. 2082 does \nnot include these offsets and allows the VA to decide which funds to \ntransfer to the Denver project.\n  As Chairman of the House Committee on the Budget, I do not condone \nmismanagement by any Federal agency, especially an agency tasked with \nthe heavy responsibility of taking care of the men and women who have \nserved our country in uniform. Our veterans should not be punished by \nthe lack of competence within the VA bureaucracy, which would be the \neffect of not approving the transfer of additional funds for this \nmedical facility. However, the VA should not take the approval of this \nnewest transfer of funds as an indication of congressional support for \ntheir mismanagement of the Denver facility. Further, the VA is hereby \nplaced on notice that the Budget Committee will work closely with the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee in the months ahead to advance the long \noverdue efforts to reform the department's dysfunctional operations. \nOur veterans who have served this nation with honor and distinction \ndeserve nothing less than Congress' commitment to fix the management \nproblems at the VA.\n\n\n  Sec. 412 Modification of authorization for the VA medical facility \n                       project in Tampa, Florida\n\n  S. 2082 calls for modifying the authorization for the Tampa facility \nfrom ``providing bed tower upgrades,'' which was originally authorized \nand appropriated in the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008 (P.L. \n110-252), to ``constructing a new bed tower'' and designating this new \npurpose of the monies as an emergency requirement. The emergency \ndesignation, which is under the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee, \nis defined for needs that are urgent, unforeseen, and would result in \nimminent loss of life or property if left unmet. I do not believe that \nthe authorization modification in S. 2082 meets these criteria since it \nis occurring seven years after the original emergency designation for \nthis purpose in P.L. 110-252. I think most members of Congress would \nagree that this provision does not qualify as an emergency as defined \nby the Committee's criteria and I am disappointed that this emergency \nprovision is included in S. 2082.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 2082.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and \nnays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call \nup House Resolution 448 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), \nmy\n\n[[Page H6728]]\n\ngood friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nDuring consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the \npurpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, earlier today the Committee on Rules met and \nreported a rule for consideration for both H. Con. Res. 79, directing \nthe Clerk of the House of Representatives to make corrections in the \nenrollment of H.R. 719, and H.R. 719, the Continuing Appropriations Act \n2016.\n  The rule provides for consideration of H. Con. Res. 79 under a closed \nrule with 20 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the \nmajority leader and his designee and the minority leader or her \ndesignee. In addition, the rule makes in order a motion offered by the \nchair of the Committee on Appropriations that the House concur in the \nSenate amendment to H.R. 719, with 60 minutes equally divided and \ncontrolled by the chair and the ranking member of the Committee on \nAppropriations.\n  Mr. Speaker, first, this resolution allows for consideration of H. \nCon. Res. 79, which directs the Clerk of the House to include the text \nof the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 in the enrollment of H.R. \n719. This would allow the House to again state its position in \nopposition to the funding of Planned Parenthood as it has already done \nby passage of both H.R. 3495 and H.R. 3134. In addition, Mr. Speaker, \nthe rule provides for consideration of the short-term continuing \nresolution.\n  As a member of the Committee on Appropriations, I am always \ndisappointed when we are forced to consider continuing resolutions, \nespecially given the work this House has done in the appropriations \nprocess this year.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  For the first time since 2009, the House Appropriations Committee was \nable to complete all 12 appropriations bills, and complete them before \nthe August recess. Unfortunately, just as in years past, Senate \nDemocrats prevented consideration of any appropriations bills on the \nfloor of that body. This leads us to the unfortunate situation of \nhaving to put forward a short-term CR to fund the government through \nDecember 11.\n  This continuing resolution is simple. Most programs will continue \nbeing funded at their FY15 levels; however, it does adjust certain \nspending levels for critical needs, such as providing $700 million for \nwildfire suppression activities in the West, and it extends several \nprograms that would otherwise lapse, like the collection of recreation \nfees for public lands. In addition, it maintains the moratorium on \nState and local jurisdictions' taxation of the Internet.\n  I hope that in the weeks and months ahead the House, the Senate, and \nthe President can come to an agreement on a path forward which ensures \nwe are not in this same place in December.\n  Some of my colleagues have stated publicly that they cannot support \nthis CR because it provides funding for Planned Parenthood. I want to \nassure my colleagues that no funding for Planned Parenthood is included \nin this legislation.\n  First, a majority of Planned Parenthood funding, about 90 percent, \ncomes through Medicaid and is not subject to appropriations. Of the \nremaining 10 percent, the largest portion, roughly $28 million, is \nfunded through title X. These grant programs are competed for every \nyear and are awarded in April, long past the length of this continuing \nresolution.\n  While I share the same disgust over the evidence seen in the \natrocious videos that are so widely known, I want to assure my \ncolleagues that no additional funds are provided for this organization \nin this bill.\n  I am encouraged by the hard work of Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member \nLowey, and, of course, the Speaker, whose leadership has made all this \npossible.\n  One of the preeminent responsibilities we are tasked with as Members \nof Congress is to ensure that the government continues to function. \nWhile a continuing resolution is not the ideal vehicle, the alternative \nof a government shutdown is not what we have all been sent to \nWashington to do.\n  I urge support of the rule and the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, when the House shut down in 2013, I happened to be on \nthe floor at midnight. Why, at this moment, eludes me. But I remember \nwhen the clock struck midnight that I made the comment that the great \ngovernment of the United States of America was closed.\n  That 16-day exercise took $24 billion out of this economy at a time \nwhen we were struggling, really, to get our economy back on track. That \nmoney mostly came from mom-and-pop stores that were in Federal \nbuildings or in the national parks. The inconvenience to Federal \nemployees was enormous. They did get paid, but they were worried to \ndeath whether they would be able to meet their mortgage payments or to \nmeet the college tuition payments. And yet so many people were \ndispossessed, practically. Veterans came to Washington to visit their \nmemorials, only to find them closed.\n  I certainly concur with Mr. Cole. We do not want to see that again. \nIt was foolish then; it would be doubly foolish now. We are now on the \nedge of what we are going to do because we couldn't get anything done.\n  I am obsessed today by what occurred last night on television. I want \nto explain it to you, because I have said on this floor so many times--\nmostly during the 54 times we voted to defund health care--that what \nwas going on here was a gigantic hoax.\n  I said just this morning at the Rules Committee that what we do has \nonly a passing resemblance to what we are supposed to do. And I want to \nread a quote from what was said last night on Fox News by \nRepresentative McCarthy, who is the presumptive new Speaker of the \nHouse. He said:\n\n       What you are going to see is a conservative Speaker, that \n     takes a conservative Congress, that puts a strategy in place \n     to fight and win. And let me give you one example.\n       Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? \n     But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select \n     committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are \n     dropping. No one would have known any of that happened had we \n     not fought and made that happen.\n\n  Sean Hannity responds:\n\n       I agree. I'll give you credit for that.\n\n  I tell you what that means, Mr. Speaker. It means that this was used \nas a hoax. We concerned ourselves with that, and now we are going to \nsee another one of these special committees. The Benghazi Committee has \nalready spent $4.5 million, on top of all the money that was spent in \ncommittees, to point out that there was nothing wrong in Benghazi.\n  And, once again, I was on the floor of the House for the rule talking \nabout setting up special committees for Benghazi, when I got a call \nfrom the mother of one of the former Navy SEALs who had died in that \nawful attack saying that her son had been a Navy SEAL, he knew his \nrisks, and would we please stop bringing this up over and over again.\n  We heard basically the same thing from the Ambassador's family, who \nsaid that he knew the language. He liked to be out with the people. He \ncould not be confined behind a wall.\n  So what are we doing here today? More hoax? More money wasted? \nPerhaps.\n  I told the chairman of the Rules Committee this morning that we would \nbe happy to give them the rule for the CR. We want a clean CR. We were \npleased as all get out when the Senate sent us a clean CR. But no, we \nare not going to do that. We are going to pretend, as part of the CR \nrule, that we are going to defund Planned Parenthood, which Mr. Cole \njust pointed out has no money allocated to it directly in the Federal \nbudget.\n  So what we are going to defund is I don't know what. HHS? Who knows. \nMaybe we will find out, maybe we won't. But they are doing this hoax \nagain simply to fool some of the people on their side who obviously \nknow\n\n[[Page H6729]]\n\nabout it because it has been in every paper and on everybody's lips \nthat I have talked to that we were going to have to probably do that. \nBut putting that on the rule this morning meant that we cannot support \nit. Perhaps you have the votes to do it by hoaxing people, but I don't \nknow.\n  We do know that that most conservative wing has harangued its \nleadership enough to add that vote on the bill even though, as I point \nout, we were very willing to give the votes on our side.\n  Now, the Senate had 78 majority votes to keep the Senate open and \nCongress moving, but we will not do that because we want to try to \nrestrict a woman's access to health care. We do it all the time. We \nhave already had 14 votes. We did two or three this week.\n  What in the world is it that makes this majority want to take health \ncare away from people--54 times to kill health care, 14 times to kill \nchoice, which is constitutionally protected, I must add.\n\n  So across the country, our constituents must be thoroughly surprised \nat what really is going on here. A lot of money is getting spent. It \ntakes $24 million a week to run the House of Representatives. And think \nof the Benghazi Committees. If you recall, at both Armed Services and \nIntelligence, their Republican chairs--and bless them for it--said \nthere is nothing there.\n  But we find out last night that the whole purpose of all of it was \nnever to do anything except to cause eternal grief to the families of \nthe four people who lost their lives and to destroy a Presidential \ncandidate. Could the Congress really stoop that low? I certainly hope \nnot. The facts belie my hope.\n  So we will be back here in December, December 11, actually, when I \nsuspect we will go through the same thing: Are we going to shut down \nthe government or are we going to try to do our job? We do the same \nthing. We will have to put some things in to fool some people all the \ntime so that they will think they are voting for something entirely \ndifferent. Frankly, I am not going to try to explain why this is \nhappening, because the people that it is meant to appease obviously \nknow we are appeasing them. And it won't last, but it sure is \nexpensive.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to, first, point out a couple of areas where my friend and I \ndo disagree. We certainly disagree about the value of the Benghazi \nCommittee. Frankly, I think it has been conducted professionally and \nseriously by Mr. Gowdy. I think we have already learned some things we \nwouldn't have known, including the fact that the former Secretary of \nState had a private server over which only she had access and control, \na very unusual arrangement. So I will just let the committee continue \nits work and see where we end up at the end of the day.\n  I want to disagree with my friend, with all due respect, on Planned \nParenthood. That is just an area where we have a difference of opinion. \nI don't think it is appropriate that they receive Federal funds. There \nare plenty of other ways. We provide $3.5 billion to thousands of \npublic healthcare centers and community healthcare centers around the \nUnited States. Those provide all these same services. That is \nappropriate, and we should do that.\n  But I also want to agree with my friend. I agree very much with her \nsentiments on a government shutdown. She is precisely right, in my \nview, about what happened in the last government shutdown. It should \nnot have occurred. This is a sincere effort to make sure that doesn't \noccur now. The Appropriations Committee is certainly doing everything \nin its power to do that.\n  Obviously, we need the administration, the Senate, and the House \nleadership to sit down and give us a framework. We are trying to buy \nthem that time. I think we are doing it in a very responsible way.\n  So, while my friend and I may have some disagreements in some areas, \non the functioning of the government we have absolutely no disagreement \nwhatsoever. I am pleased to be here working with her in those areas, \nand I am hopeful that the President, the Speaker, the majority leader, \nand the respective minority leaders can indeed come to a larger \nagreement that would allow a normal appropriations process to take \nplace. First, an omnibus bill this year, and, hopefully, next year, an \nactual complete appropriations process such as we haven't seen around \nhere in many, many, many years.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, we find ourselves in a precarious time. At midnight \ntonight, the Government of the United States will close yet once again. \nMr. Cole and I certainly have strong agreement on that, and I am happy \nfor that. He is a true gentleman and a scholar here in Congress. But I \ncontinue to say that it saddens me greatly, because all of us who were \nwanting to vote for a clean CR, because of this rule, we will not have \nan opportunity to do that.\n  I call for a ``no'' vote on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I want to thank my friend again for also emphasizing the areas where \nwe agree, which is on the maintenance of the government. And while we \nmay have a difference over the rule, I would hope that my friend and \nmany of her colleagues on the CR that has been agreed to would look on \nthat favorably and would be able to support the CR, itself, as opposed \nto the rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, passage of the CR is critical to prevent a government \nshutdown and to demonstrate to the American people that Congress can \nactually govern. The CR abides within the budget caps and does not \nprovide any additional funding for Planned Parenthood, as some have \nclaimed. In addition, the rule provides for consideration of an \nenrollment correction bill that would again make the position of the \nHouse clear in opposition to any additional funding for Planned \nParenthood.\n  I want to encourage my colleagues to support this rule and the \nunderlying legislation. And, frankly, I want to encourage those who are \nnow engaged in negotiations to arrive at a framework where the \nappropriations process can actually go forward, where we can sit down \nand seriously consider in a bipartisan way how best to fund the \ngovernment in the coming year, and where, hopefully, we can get an \nagreement large enough that we can have a normal appropriations process \nnext year where we actually bring bills individually to this floor, as \nwe did 6 times, but actually do it for the full 12 that would be in \norder. That is my hope. That is what I am going to be working toward. I \nknow my friend will be working in the same direction.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the resolution.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the motion.\n  The text of the motion is as follows:\n\n       Mr. Rogers of Kentucky moves that the House concur in the \n     Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate \n     amendment to H.R. 719.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 448, the motion \nshall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the \nchair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations.\n  The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers) and the gentlewoman from New \nYork (Mrs. Lowey) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present H.R. 719, a short-term \ncontinuing resolution to keep the government open and operating after \nthe end of the fiscal year on September 30.\n  This necessary measure funds government and services at the current \nrate through December 11 of this year. As in previous years, the CR \nalso includes a small across-the-board reduction to keep within the \nfiscal year 2016 cap level set by the Budget Control Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a responsible measure that prevents a harmful \ngovernment shutdown, while allowing time for a larger budget agreement \nto be reached, and time to complete the full year appropriations work \nfor 2016.\n  It also includes a few responsible provisions to prevent disastrous, \nirreversible damage to government programs or to address current urgent \nneeds. These changes are limited in scope and noncontroversial. For \ninstance, these provisions extend the authority for critical Department \nof Defense activities that fight terrorism, increase funding for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to help address the disability claims \nbacklog, and provide emergency funding to the Forest Service to help \nrespond to the disastrous wildfires that are devastating our Western \nStates.\n  While I firmly believe this legislation is the best path forward at \nthis time, it is also my strong opinion that Congress should do its job \nand enact actual, line-by-line, separate appropriations bills ahead of \nour September 30 deadline. Clearly, this is not an option at this time, \nso we must resort to a temporary measure like this CR.\n  A CR doesn't reflect our most current budgetary needs. It creates \nuncertainty across the whole government and does not adequately address \nour national security obligations, and it causes needless waste when \ntaxpayer dollars are spent inefficiently and ineffectively.\n  So it is to my great dismay, Mr. Speaker, that we have arrived at \nthis point once again requiring a temporary Band-aid to buy us time to \ndo our constitutionally mandated duty.\n  The House this year got off to a great start--beginning our \nappropriations work at the earliest date since 1974--the current Budget \nControl Act's anniversary--and passing six of our 12 bills by July of \nthis year. My committee reported out all 12 bills for the first time \nsince 2009. And yet, the Senate refuses to act, giving us no choice but \nto try a continuing resolution.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  But now, with progress stalled, it is clear that all sides must come \ntogether to find some sort of agreement that addresses our current \nfiscal situation in a comprehensive way. This CR, while not ideal, is \nthe next step toward that end, keeping the government's lights on as we \nwork to find a solution.\n  With current funding set to expire just hours from now, I urge my \ncolleagues to do the responsible and reasonable thing and support this \ncontinuing resolution today.\n\n[[Page H6734]]\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, we may temporarily avert this most recent crisis if we \ncan get this bill to the President tonight, just hours before the \nentire Federal Government shuts down, but it is certainly not a cause \nfor celebration.\n  This very short-term continuing resolution avoids the most immediate \ncrisis. But what is step two? After we enact this stopgap measure, are \nthere any firm plans to begin negotiating the full-year appropriations \nbills we should be passing today? I remain deeply concerned about the \npotential of finding ourselves facing a government shutdown again in \nDecember.\n  The stakes are very high. We have an economy that is genuinely \nrecovering. Unemployment is down. Economic growth is up. But we still \nhave progress to make. The uncertainty and unnecessary tumult of \nplaying games right up to the brink of a government shutdown is not \nhelpful to our fragile economy. The last shutdown cost the economy $24 \nbillion in GDP, according to Standard & Poor's.\n  This continuing resolution buys us 10 weeks and takes care of only a \nhandful of the most pressing Federal responsibilities: Provides \ndesperately needed emergency firefighting funds to address the \ncataclysmic fires raging in the West; provides additional resources for \nprocessing disability claims at the Veterans Administration; increases \nthe authorization in the Small Business Loan Guarantee Program to \nensure new loans can be administered to help small businesses across \nthe country; and extends several expiring authorizations for programs \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Notably, the continuing resolution does not address other key \npriorities that could bolster our economy, such as the expired \nauthority of the Export-Import Bank, which has created or sustained 1.5 \nmillion private sector jobs at no cost to the taxpayer since 2007 and \nsupported billions in American economic activity.\n  By settling on this short-term extension, we fail to provide proposed \nincreases for medical research at the National Institutes of Health and \nthe Nation's aging transportation system and infrastructure. The \nPresident's request for defense funding is shortchanged, which would \nput our national security at risk in a long-term CR.\n  Leaving our Federal agencies on autopilot without the line-by-line, \nyear-by-year adjustments that should come from this committee and this \nCongress is irresponsible and hurts our ability to grow our economy, \ncreate jobs, and give hard-working families the services they need.\n  Yet, with the Republican dysfunction that has driven a change in the \nmajority's leadership on the brink of a government shutdown, the \nprospects for forging a reasonable, responsible solution by December \nare not good.\n  One more indication of the dire outlook is the cynical gimmick--an \n``enrollment correction''--the majority has put forward today to \nsupposedly defund Planned Parenthood. Fortunately, it will have no \npractical effect on the CR for two reasons. First, the Senate will \nignore it. Second, there is no need for a correction since, as my \nfriend Mr. Cole noted this weekend, ``there is no money'' in the CR for \nPlanned Parenthood. PolitiFact even confirmed this claim.\n  I will strongly oppose this attack on women's health today as I \nsupport the temporary continuing resolution and urge all of my \ncolleagues to do the same so we can at least avoid a worst-case \nscenario.\n  But I again implore outgoing and incoming Republican leadership to \nplease engage with the President and House Democrats immediately on an \nagreement to replace the sequester-level caps, avert the next crisis \njust weeks away, stop playing political games with women's health, and \ninvest in American economic growth and security.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), a very valued member \nof my committee who happens also to be the chairman of the Labor HHS \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to begin by congratulating both \nmy chairman and my ranking member for the exceptional job they have \ndone this year in getting all 12 appropriations bills through the full \ncommittee for the first time since 2009. So we really have on the \nAppropriations Committee done our work. Six of those bills have come \nacross the floor.\n  And, frankly, I think we would have had more across the floor if our \nfriends in the Senate, who are blocked by the Democratic minority, had \nan opportunity to bring their bills to the floor. I think we are here, \nin part, because the inaction by the minority in the United States \nSenate has ground the whole process to a halt.\n  But I am very pleased to see both my chairman and my ranking member \nhere making the argument to keep the government funded. I think we all \nknow that shutting down the government is always a mistake. It is a \npolitical mistake, frankly, for people that want to use it to achieve \nsome political tactic.\n  But, more importantly, it is simply the wrong thing to do for the \nAmerican people. They send us here expecting us to get our work done. \nThe fact that some amongst us has kept that from happening is \nregrettable and I think a disservice to all of our constituents.\n  I also believe, in this particular case, that we have an opportunity, \nif we pass this continuing resolution for those that are, as I like to \nsay appropriately, above our pay grade--that is, the President, the \nSpeaker, the majority leader, and the two minority leaders--to have \ntime to negotiate the framework for a larger deal, for a larger \nunderstanding, that would allow us to move ahead and actually have an \nomnibus bill where we actually--not as good as moving it across the \nfloor--but had a large bill where we looked at every line, we made \nconcessions to one another, we made agreements, we moved the ball \nforward, and it could open up a possibility for a normal appropriations \nprocess next year.\n  In that regard, I was very heartened by Majority Leader McConnell's \nrecent remarks that he is interested in a 2-year deal, somewhat similar \nto Ryan-Murray in terms of its duration. Again, that would allow this \nHouse next year to move appropriations bills across the floor one at a \ntime in a give-and-take bipartisan manner. I think that is \nextraordinarily important.\n  If you look at where this committee was at in terms of frozen \nactivity before my good friend, the chairman, became the chairman, he \nand, again, with my good friend, the gentlewoman from New York, have \nbrought us back a long, long way. If we don't finish that journey in \nthe next 2\\1/2\\ months, we have got several things that are going to \nhappen, the worst of which will be a sequester of $40 billion, roughly, \non the American military.\n\n  That is an unacceptable outcome. And, frankly, that is something that \nthe Commander in Chief and the respective leaders on both sides of the \naisle in this body need to make sure doesn't happen.\n  I promise you, if the administration, the Senate, and the House can \nget to a larger agreement, I have no doubt that my chairman and my \nranking member and their counterparts in the United States Senate will \nthen introduce a normal negotiating process and we will get to the \nright place.\n  So we have a moment, an opening, a little bit of bipartisanship here. \nI would expect, when this bill is actually voted on, we will have large \nmajorities on both sides of the aisle that actually support it.\n  So I urge the other Members--again, both Democrat and Republican--to \nseize this opportunity, to not just focus on where there are \ndifferences, but focus here where we have come together, bought the \ntime, and then, frankly, where they can use their influence on both \nsides of the aisle in both Chambers and with the President to make sure \nthat an adequate deal is arrived at and that we spare the country and \ncertainly the men and women in uniform that defend us each and every \nday from the agony of dealing with a second sequester.\n  This is not the time for that to happen. It is a dangerous world. We \nhave not Russia relitigating the borders of Eastern Europe. We have got \nChina building islands in the South China Sea. We have got ISIL having \nestablished a caliphate of sorts in the Middle East. We have a \ndangerous Iran.\n  The worst thing in the world would be to not do this CR and then not \ncarry\n\n[[Page H6735]]\n\nit through to a fuller agreement and undercut our military. So I think \nthe stakes of what we are doing are very, very high here.\n  I want to conclude again by commending my chairman and commending our \nranking member for working together, as they have this entire year, so \nwe could get our bills across, as they are doing now in this process, \nto buy our leaders time, and, frankly, as I know they will do in normal \nnegotiation on an omnibus bill at the end of this process and then, \nhopefully, on a regular appropriations process next year.\n  Again, I urge my fellow Members on both sides of the aisle to pass \nthis very important piece of legislation.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 5 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), a distinguished member of \nthe committee.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed in this bill. We are \nfaced with this continuing resolution in order to avert a government \nshutdown. This is no way to govern. America deserves better than a \nmonth-to-month government, forever on the brink of a shutdown and held \nback by needless budget constraints.\n  Those who call this a clean continuing resolution are mistaken. In \nfact, it puts in place yet more indiscriminate cuts. It cuts .2 percent \nacross the board for most discretionary programs. Apparently, we have \nnot learned our lesson about mindless austerity.\n  Instead of fighting over women's health care, we should use the next \nmonth to negotiate a budget agreement that addresses the single biggest \neconomic issue that we face in this country. Today working men and \nwomen in the United States are in jobs that don't pay them enough \nmoney. Real wages have been stagnant for 30 years.\n  We need to stop spending hundreds of billions of dollars every year \non tax loopholes for the wealthy and for big corporations. We need to \ninvest once more in education and job training and health and all the \nother priorities that American families hold dear.\n  Right now we cannot meet their needs. Poor children are struggling. \nTheir vocabularies are, on average, one-third those of their middle \nincome peers. But since 2010, we have cut over $1 billion in real terms \nfrom education.\n  Workers need help learning the right skills, finding work in a tough \neconomy, so that they can support their families, but we have cut more \nthan $1 billion from job training programs.\n  Millions of Americans depend upon lifesaving medical research to cure \ndisease and to improve the quality of life. I stand here as a survivor \nof ovarian cancer. I am here because of the grace of God and biomedical \nresearch. Yet, we will continue to cut biomedical research. We have cut \nmore than $3.5 billion from the National Institutes of Health.\n  The list of failures goes on and on. We are failing our workers. We \nare failing working families. We are failing students and medical \nresearchers and first responders and veterans and families and millions \nof others.\n  Our job in this body is to provide opportunity for people. During \nthis economic struggle that we have, we ought to be focused like a \nlaser on the issues that work to better the economic situation of \nworking families in this country.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  What we do here is to continue to hold a cap on what we need to move \nforward, and, more importantly than that, what we do from the other \nside of the aisle is to threaten the government shutdown over the issue \nof women's health.\n  Who are we? What are we about? Where are the great values of this \nNation that helped to provide an opportunity so that families could \njoin the middle class of this country and continue to make it strong?\n  That is what our job is today to do, not to be involved in these \nmindless exercises that the other side of the aisle continues to move \nforward on.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent), a hardworking member of the \nAppropriations Committee, the chairman of the Military Construction, \nVeterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, and, coincidently, \nthe chairman of the House Ethics Committee.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of passing a clean \ncontinuing resolution, the one the Senate sent over to us. We should do \nthat immediately.\n  It would be utterly reckless to let the government shut down for any \nreason, regardless of one's feelings about Planned Parenthood. Whether \nyou like them or not isn't the point. We should never shut the \ngovernment down over that or, frankly, any other issue at this time.\n  It is imperative that we pass this CR so that it will give us the \ntime and space we need to enter into a broader budget agreement, \nhopefully, for this fiscal year and the next and so that we can then, \nalso, pass the appropriations bills.\n  As our very fine Chairman Rogers mentioned, I am the chair of the \nSubcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related \nAgencies. This CR is essential to making sure that veterans' services \ngo uninterrupted. It also makes sure that we can continue moving \nforward on many of the projects that are ongoing within the VA system \nthrough the anomalies. Nevertheless, we need to move forward on this \nfor that reason.\n  Also, I want to make a point that we need to stop lurching from one \nbudget crisis to the next. The events of the last few weeks have been \nvery dismaying to me, personally. That said, we are not going to have a \ngovernment shutdown, and that is good news, but we need to get on with \nthe business of this budget agreement.\n  Also, I wanted to point out--I heard my friend and colleague from \nConnecticut made a comment about biomedical research--in the bill that \nwe had passed out of the Labor, Health, and Human Services \nSubcommittee, we actually did increase funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health by $1.1 billion. I do hope that, in the event that \nwe do come to a budget agreement and move the appropriations bills, we \nwill be able to see an increase in funding for the NIH. We will be able \nto provide for our veterans and, in my case, also the military \nconstruction projects.\n  Also, our friends who are serving overseas, our men and women serving \noverseas in the Armed Forces, are very much depending on us to do the \nright thing, to pass appropriations bills, a long-term continuing \nresolution, not the one we are voting on today. If we are to do one \nafter December 11, it would have real impacts on our force readiness \nand the ability for our troops and our men and women overseas to do the \njobs that we have asked them to do.\n  So for all these reasons, I am urging people to vote for this CR \ntoday, keep the government functioning, do our duty, and then set up a \nprocess where we can complete the appropriations process in December \nand take care of the responsibilities that have been entrusted to us.\n  I want to thank Chairman Rogers and, also, Ranking Member Lowey for \ntheir strong leadership on the Appropriations Committee. They are doing \nall that they are doing to try to help us work together and make sure \nthat Congress maintains its power of the purse and does exactly what we \npromised the American people we would do, and that would be to govern.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Israel).\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend and colleague \nfrom New York, Ranking Member Lowey.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have a tremendous amount of respect for the chairman, \nthe gentleman from Kentucky. I have great personal admiration for him \nand his leadership, and I thank him for his earnest, hard work; but \nwhat we are doing today is a disappointment to the American people, and \nit is a disappointment to those of us who are on the Appropriations \nCommittee. Success can't be defined as avoid catastrophe, and all we \nare doing today is avoiding catastrophe. The majority's triumph today \nis not shutting down the government.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is not a small-business owner anywhere in America \nwho would say ``had a good day because I am not shutting down,'' ``had \na good day because I am not throwing my employees out of work,'' ``had \na good day\n\n[[Page H6736]]\n\nbecause I am not telling my customers they can't come for services.'' \nThat is not success. That is failure. That is, by itself, a \ncatastrophe.\n  Mr. Speaker, the managers of those small businesses are judged by \ntheir performance and success. The managers of this Congress, the \nmajority, are judged in the same way. They are judged by their ability, \nas the majority, to produce bills, to pass budgets, to do the work of \nthe American people.\n  It is time for them to do their jobs, to stop the gimmicks, to pass a \nlong-term budget that invests in the education of our children, that \nsupports job skills for people and careers, that protects our veterans \nand our national security. It is time to do their jobs, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMinnesota (Ms. McCollum), a distinguished member of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, this Republican majority has driven the \nexpectations of the American people so low that the very act of funding \ngovernment operations has become a significant achievement. \nUnfortunately, the cost extraction by the Republican extremists for \nthis 3-month clean CR was the resignation of Speaker Boehner, a good \nman who has served this House honorably.\n  Passing this CR, however, will keep the government working, which is \ncritical to American families, their economy, and the safety and \nsecurity of our Nation, and it continues to protect by providing \nhealthcare coverage for women.\n  In 2013, when the Republicans shut down the government for 16 days, \nthe U.S. economy lost $24 billion, and more than 100,000 Americans lost \ntheir jobs. The American people cannot afford another Republican \nshutdown. Passing this 3-month CR is the first step toward responsibly \nmeeting the needs of the American people.\n  As a ranking Democrat on the Interior, Environment and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Subcommittee, I am pleased that this bill \nincludes $700 million in emergency funds for Forest Service to fight \nwildland fires in Western States. This is critical funding.\n  The CR will keep our national parks open to the public, keep Native \nAmerican healthcare and education programs operating, and prevent the \nfurloughing of tens of thousands of Federal employees in the Department \nof the Interior and EPA.\n\n  I am going to vote to pass this continuing resolution, and I applaud \nall the Democrats and Republicans who will vote to pass the CR, but we \nneed to work to find a bipartisan path forward to fund the government \nfor the coming year. Our job is to serve the American people. The \nAmerican people expect Congress to do their job. Today, I hope all \nMembers will do their job and vote to pass this CR.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  I have no further requests for time. I am prepared to close if the \ngentlewoman is prepared.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I was thinking about that, except, I believe, we have some \ndistinguished members of our committee who are running a little late.\n  So I would just like to say, Mr. Speaker, that I am very pleased that \nwe are here today, and I do hope that there will be strong bipartisan \nsupport for the continuing resolution.\n  This has been a difficult year. I know how hard our distinguished \nchairman has worked, trying to put together a bipartisan appropriations \nbill. Although I am very pleased that we are passing a continuing \nresolution today, it is really amazing that we should be celebrating in \nthe United States of America, the most distinguished country, \nsupposedly representative of our great democracy, that we are keeping \nthe government open.\n  I feel very confident, Mr. Speaker, that if members of the \nAppropriations Committee, both Democrats and Republicans, would sit \ndown very seriously, we could work out an arrangement whereby we would \nlift the sequester, just as we did with Ryan-Murray.\n  I was on that committee with some distinguished members of the party, \nand we had some good discussions. We had some differences of opinion; \nwe had some lively debates; but at the end of the day, we came up with \na product that we could be proud of.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, I do hope that after this continuing resolution has \npassed--and I think you have another speaker who would like to speak \nwhile we are waiting for our speaker.\n  In closing, I would just like to say that I am cautiously optimistic \nthat, after the CR is passed, we can really do our work and come up \nwith a good, strong omnibus bill that reflects our values.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our \ndistinguished leader.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I \nthank her for her leadership, as well as that of our distinguished \nchairman, Mr. Rogers, to bring us to the floor today where we can vote \nin a bipartisan way to keep government open without doing harm to \nwomen's health in our country.\n  To shut government down is a really bad decision for this Congress to \nmake. The last time we did that, we lost $24 billion. The last time \nthis Congress voted to shut down government, we lost $24 billion to our \neconomy, 120,000 jobs in our workforce. Our Federal workforce, which \ncontains more than 30 percent of veterans in its composition, was \nfurloughed or worse. The American people deserve better.\n  So as we go forward from this continuing resolution, which is a good \noutcome of the conversations that have gone back and forth--a strong \nbipartisan vote in the Senate, and I hope a strong bipartisan vote in \nthe House--let us take heed of the words of Pope Francis, who just, not \neven 1 week ago, spoke to us in this Chamber.\n  Pope Francis asked us to work together for the common good of the \npeople. He urged and said a good leader would have a spirit of openness \nand pragmatism, again, to get the job done for the American people.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  As we go forward, we will have some difficult choices to make. We all \nshare the values of strengthening our national security, investing in \nour children's future, reducing the deficit as we go forward, but as we \ndo so, there are some important differences that we share.\n  Let's hope that we recognize a good idea, wherever it springs from. \nLet us also recognize what our responsibilities are to the American \npeople first and foremost.\n  I consider this a very positive action we are taking today. I wish \nthat we were finished with all of our appropriations work. As an \nappropriator, I know that that is always the goal of our chairman and \nranking member.\n  I thank our ranking member, Congresswoman Lowey, for her leadership, \nbut also for the optimism she just expressed, that, as we go forward, \nwe will do so in a timely fashion, maybe long before December 11, so we \nwill have removed all doubt in the public's mind that government will \nwork, that it will function, as the Pope had asked us, for the good of \nthe American people.\n  There are important decisions ahead, though, in terms of what our \npriorities are in a budget. A budget should be a statement of our \nnational values, and what is important to us should be reflected on how \nwe allocate those resources. We have the omnibus bill to deal with.\n  We also have investments in the infrastructure of our country and our \ntransportation. That will be an important bill that we will be debating \nat the same time, but has a relationship in terms of how we offset, how \nwe pay for that.\n  We have the issue of the Ex-Im Bank, a great job creator for our \ncountry and, yet, still unauthorized, long overdue for us to authorize \nit.\n  Before Thanksgiving probably we will have the issue of a vote on \nhonoring the full faith and credit of the United States of America. The \nlast time that was put into doubt, it was unfortunate because it \nlowered our credit rating, even though we didn't follow through with \nit. Even though the full faith and credit ended up being honored, just \nthe threat, the suspicion, that it could be undermined lowered our \ncredit rating.\n  We have really important work to do for the good of the people. \nAgain, let us\n\n[[Page H6737]]\n\nhonor our responsibilities in the beautiful spirit of Saint--Pope \nFrancis. I say Saint Francis because that is the patron saint of my \ncity, of San Francisco, and the namesake also of Pope Francis.\n  But Pope Francis instructed us as to what good leaders do, and good \nleaders have a sense of humility to respect the views of other people \nand not be condescending in terms of our views are the only ones that \nmatter.\n  In that spirit, I look forward to working with you, Mr. Chairman, \nwith the Speaker, with others, and certainly under the leadership of \nour distinguished ranking member, Congresswoman Lowey.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Jolly), a member of our \ncommittee.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, my compliments to the chairman and to the \nranking member for shepherding us thus far into this year.\n  I often say the first job of Congress is to govern, and that means \nkeeping the government open. I think what we are doing today is \nhonoring the responsibility we have, our article I responsibilities to \nkeep the government open.\n  We talk a lot about Congress having the power of the purse, but with \nthe power also comes responsibility. So as we have hard conversations \nas a country and as a Congress about whether we fund certain programs, \nwhether we fund certain entities, that is an appropriate conversation \nto have, and I think we have handled that appropriately thus far.\n  You sometimes would not know that based on comments on the other side \nof the aisle because they continue to try to score political points and \nuse political capital to suggest we are on the brink of a shutdown. The \nsimple fact is we are not.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have acknowledged today \nthat they intend to vote for what is a responsible continuing \nresolution that will ensure that our government remains funded.\n  The irony of some of the criticisms that often come--and this comes \nfrom colleagues on our committee--is that, to finally reach a deal, to \nfinally have responsible governance, it takes a willing partner on the \nother side of the aisle and it takes intellectual honesty on both sides \nof the aisle of every member of our committee.\n  I would respectfully point out to those on the other side of the \naisle who serve on the committee that we had a debate over and over and \nover with each markup about the Budget Control Act and the caps that \nare in place by statute. There were very good suggestions from both \nsides of the aisle about where taxpayer dollars should be invested, \nwhich programs they should be invested in, from defense to \ntransportation, to education, to healthcare research, and so forth.\n  The irony is that, for each good idea on the other side of the aisle \nabout where to invest money, there was a willful ignorance of the fact \nthat any additional investment must come with an offset under the \nBudget Control Act. There were good amendments in the committee, and, \nfrankly, many of them would have passed if they had included \nresponsible offsets. But there were no offsets.\n  I point that out only for this, not to relitigate all the markups we \nhad in committee, but to suggest that somehow it is the Republicans' \nissue that somehow we have to resolve this. We have not had a willing \npartner throughout the markup of all of these bills.\n  Just as the spirit of cooperation is here on the floor--and \nrightfully so--and we are going to pass the CR that funds the \ngovernment and keeps it open--that highway of goodwill has to go both \nways. Rather than just talk about what is not funded, let's talk about \nhow we are going to operate under what is a statute, what is the law of \nthe land that was signed by this President and, frankly, recommended by \nthis President.\n  As we talk about where spending comes between now and December 11, we \nhave to recognize and be honest with the American people that we \noperate under a budget agreement that has statutory caps signed by this \nPresident. There are great ideas on both sides of the aisle about where \nto spend money, but if we ignore the fact that they are required to be \noffset, then we have not advanced this conversation one day.\n  It is important that we keep the government open. I am glad that my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle and enough colleagues on this \nside of the aisle are saying: Yes, we have to keep the government open. \nWe have to keep the Department of Defense funded. Our men and women in \nuniform who carry the flag for us every day, we have to ensure that \nthey are funded. Our first responders, DHS, coastguardsmen, \ncoastguardswomen, our transportation programs, education, critical \nhealthcare research is all that we will continue to fund through this \nresponsible continuing resolution.\n  We all wish we had a full-year bill that we were considering today, \nbut we do not have that. The responsible action by this body is to pass \nthis bill with sufficient numbers on both sides of the aisle. I would \ncharge those on my side of the aisle who care deeply about certain \nextraneous issues involved in the debate this week, we have responsible \nways to continue to address how we provide critical nonabortion-related \nwomen's healthcare service in underserved communities, while we still \nact today to keep the government open. It is a responsible path \nforward.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank you for bringing this forward.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I just want to reiterate again to my \ncolleagues that I look forward to working in a bipartisan way with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Committee on Appropriations to move the \nprocess forward.\n  I particularly think, because it was just mentioned by the previous \nspeaker, that for us not to increase the appropriations to the National \nInstitutes of Health--this is just one area of the bill that came \nthrough the committee in the committee process. This means research for \na whole range of illnesses, whether it is autism or diabetes or heart.\n  We have a responsibility to lift these caps, negotiate a really good \nbill, and provide adequate funding for the American people. This is \nimportant for their health, for their work life. We have to be sure we \nare investing so we are creating jobs and keep the economy moving. I \nlook forward to that process.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume. I shall be brief.\n  I appreciate the work of my colleague, Mrs. Lowey, ranking member on \nthe committee, and all of the people on her side of the aisle and, of \ncourse, on our side of the aisle as well. This is a good bill. It is a \nresponsible bill. It does not do anything controversial.\n  It does do one important thing, and that is keep the government \noperating. We can't afford to abandon our soldiers, particularly those \noverseas in harm's way. We can't abandon the people that depend upon \nthe programs that our Federal Government provides.\n  I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on this bill. It is a good bill, and \nit keeps the government operating.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nthis continuing resolution, which will allow us to avoid another \ncompletely unnecessary and potentially devastating government shutdown. \nMy vote in favor of the CR does not mean I support the irresponsible \nsequestration-level budget resolution that has made it impossible to \npass FY 2016 appropriations bills, much less the reckless manner in \nwhich the majority continues to manage the budget process.\n  The Republican budget announced this spring made no room for the \ncritical investments in infrastructure, housing, research, health care, \nand education that our country needs to thrive. In fact, it made deeply \ndamaging reductions.\n  Defense appropriators were able to avoid sequestration levels only by \nusing the so-called OCO gimmick, amounting to a $38 billion sleight of \nhand.\n  It was evident from the beginning that we would have to negotiate new \nbudget numbers--if not a comprehensive agreement of the sort that \nbalanced the budget in the 1990s, then at least a more modest deal like \nthe Ryan-Murray agreement of the last two\n\n[[Page H6738]]\n\nyears--in order to pass our appropriations bills. I and other \nDemocratic colleagues took to the floor again and again to decry these \nunacceptable budget numbers that simply set us up for failure. Our \nleaders have been offering to negotiate for months, knowing full well \nthat President Obama would be forced to veto any appropriations bills \npassed under the Republican budget. Will it take a government shutdown, \nwe asked, to make us do our job?\n  Apparently the answer is ``yes''. The Senate couldn't pass a single \nappropriations bill. The House passed a few with Republican votes \nalone, and then the process collapsed under the weight of the \nConfederate battle flag debate. That was a particularly disgraceful \nepisode, but the process was already on life support. It was never \ngoing to work, and Republican leaders have known that all year.\n  Despite the failure of the appropriations process, as represented by \nthis short-term CR, all hope is not lost. We can still salvage the hard \nbipartisan work of my and other appropriations subcommittees, if, when \nthis CR expires, we can stitch together an omnibus appropriations bill \nfor the balance of the year.\n  The Appropriations Committee still avoids some of the ideological \nbattles that divide this body, and I have been able to work closely \nwith Chairman Diaz-Balart to negotiate a framework for transportation \nand housing funding. I know that many of the other subcommittee Chairs \nand Ranking Members have made similar progress. Given realistic funding \nlevels, these bills can relatively quickly be converted into acceptable \nappropriations legislation.\n  So I once again join my colleagues in urging Speaker Boehner to \nresume bipartisan budget negotiations and produce reasonable, \nresponsible funding levels that can allow the appropriations process to \nmove forward. Today, we're buying ourselves a couple of months. Instead \nof lurching toward another crisis in December, let's actually come to a \nconsensus on the kind of investments in our future that a great country \nmust make.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks, and to \ninclude extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 79.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Alabama?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 79, a concurrent \nresolution directing the Clerk of the House of Representatives to make \ncorrections in the enrollment of H.R. 719. This resolution directs the \nClerk of the House of Representatives to make several corrections in \nthe enrollment of H.R. 719, the Continuing Appropriations Act 2016, \nincluding by adding at the end of the text of the House-passed version, \nH.R. 3134, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015.\n  The House passed H.R. 3134 by a vote of 241-187 on September 18. The \nbill precludes any Federal funds from being authorized or appropriated \nfor 1 year for any purpose to Planned Parenthood Federation of America \nor any affiliate or clinic of that organization unless entities certify \nthat affiliates and clinics will not perform and will not provide any \nfunds to any other entity that performs elective abortions during such \nperiod. The bill also redirected funding from Planned Parenthood \nfacilities to federally qualified health centers to provide women's \nhealth services.\n  This resolution and the related enrollment process sends a signal \nabout\n\n[[Page H6739]]\n\nthis House's commitment to bar funding for Planned Parenthood and gives \nthe Senate the opportunity to limit funding in the continuing \nresolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is actually the exact same language in the Defund \nPlanned Parenthood Act sponsored by my friend, the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Black), which the House passed earlier this month. Mrs. \nBlack is a tireless defender of the unborn, and I have been privileged \nto work with her on several pro-life measures, including a very similar \ndefund correction to the spending bill back in 2011.\n  So why this correction? My colleagues might be wondering if I just \nsaw what happened in the Senate. Why take up this bill when the votes \njust aren't there in the Senate? The answer is simple. Because I \nbelieve, as long as there is an opportunity before us to defund Planned \nParenthood, we should take it because, when it comes to this fight, I \nwant to leave it all on the field.\n  I understand that, so far, we have lacked the votes in the Senate to \ninclude defund language in the continuing resolution, and I realize \nthis is a last-ditch effort to do this and that the chances of this \ncorrection maneuver succeeding in the Senate are low. But I believe, \nMr. Speaker, I believe that we have to fight until the very end.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  I have always been up front with those I represent about the low \nlikelihood of defunding Planned Parenthood, especially in a stopgap \nspending bill. Pro-life advocates in my State and around this country \nunderstand the math; and while they hope that Senate Democrats will \nchange their hearts, they don't really expect them to. What they do \nexpect is for us to try, to fight to the very end, and to exhaust every \npossible option in our effort to stop tax dollars from flowing to this \norganization.\n  That is why, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House and in \nthe Senate to support this defund correction and to join me to fight \nuntil the very end to defund Planned Parenthood.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  This ``enrollment correction'' is yet another procedural maneuver. It \nis designed to destroy health care for millions of American women. It \nis unacceptable, and we will not stand for it.\n  The disgraceful rightwing assault on reproductive freedom has become \nan all-out war on the health and the well-being of millions of low-\nincome American women. Each year, Planned Parenthood provides 2.7 \nmillion people, men and women, with lifesaving services.\n  I would hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would \nopen their hearts--open their hearts--to healthcare services for women \nwho don't have the wherewithal to go to the same kinds of private \ndoctors that the men and women of the United States House of \nRepresentatives have the opportunity to do. Open your hearts, because \nfor many, Planned Parenthood is their only way of receiving these \nhealthcare services.\n  The president of the American Congress of OB-GYNs has warned that, \nwithout Planned Parenthood, many patients will be left without a \ndoctor; and that is what these attacks are designed to achieve. The \nrightwing does not want poor women to have health care, period. It is \nspiteful, it is cruel, and it is wrong.\n  We know what happens when funding is taken away from Planned \nParenthood. In Scott County, Indiana, a full-scale HIV epidemic was \ntriggered that has been declared a public healthcare emergency. Do we \nwant more people to die? Are we really prepared to see that picture \nrepeated across the country?\n  The American people have made it clear that they will not accept any \nbill that cuts funding for women's health care or compromises \nreproductive freedoms. Let us in this body respect and trust the \nhealthcare decisions that women make.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The time of the \ngentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. I yield myself an additional 10 seconds.\n  Let's respect and trust the healthcare decisions that women make. We \nmust respect their wishes. I urge my colleagues to vote against this \ndisgraceful bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. ROBY. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. \nLowey), someone who has spent her entire career working at issues that \nhelp working families with their health care, and particularly women.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, this resolution is more political theater: \nall sound and fury, signifying nothing and going nowhere. We are \nproceeding to debate this resolution even though there is no money--\nzero money--in the CR for Planned Parenthood and even though we all \nunderstand that if the Senate also adopts this resolution, it will \neffectively shut down the government, slowing economic growth and job \ncreation.\n  Planned Parenthood provides essential preventive health services, \nincluding birth control, lifesaving cancer screenings, well-women \nexams, and advice on family planning to nearly 3 million women each \nyear.\n  Community health centers are not an alternative to Planned \nParenthood. The California Primary Care Association noted: \n``Eliminating Planned Parenthood from our State's comprehensive network \nof care would put untenable stress on remaining providers. We do not \nhave the capacity for such an increase in care.''\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the resolution.\n  Mrs. ROBY. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Adams)\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a woman who is angry. These \nattacks on Planned Parenthood aren't about some deceptive videos. It is \nabout a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. Women's \nreproductive rights are decisions she should make. It should be between \na woman, her doctor, and her family, not a male-dominated Congress.\n  So let's be clear. Attacking Planned Parenthood is part of a ploy to \nroll back women's rights. What hypocrisy. I wish my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle cared this much about the millions of women and \nchildren who go hungry every day or the educational inequities that \nexist in our most vulnerable communities.\n  I stand with Planned Parenthood for the services they provide. Last \nyear, they served more than 2.7 million across our Nation, and more \nthan 31,000 in North Carolina just through nine centers. More than \n21,000 patients received safe contraception; more than 18,000 STI tests \nwere conducted, and more than 3,500 Pap tests and more than 2,500 \nbreast exams. Real women getting real preventive care.\n  I will continue to advocate for women's comprehensive health care and \ntheir right to control their own body. The war on women must stop.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. I would inquire as to how much time is remaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Connecticut has 5 \nminutes remaining.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lee).\n  Ms. LEE. First, I want to thank Congresswoman DeLauro for yielding \nand for her tremendous leadership on so many issues important to women \nand the entire country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Con. Res. 79, which \nonce again attempts to defund Planned Parenthood for 1 year. This \ncallous action would leave millions of women across the country without \naccess to critical healthcare services. This shameful resolution is the \n15th anti women's health vote this year.\n  We know that Planned Parenthood centers are essential to the health \nand well-being of women and their families. They serve as primary care \nfacilities for women seeking birth control, comprehensive family \nplanning services, and cancer and STI screenings.\n  According to the Guttmacher Institute, in 21 percent of counties \nwhere Planned Parenthood operates health centers, it is the county's \nonly family planning provider. Mr. Speaker, for these communities, \nthere are no other options. Defunding Planned Parenthood would hurt the \ncommunities that need help the most: low-income women and women of \ncolor.\n  Politicians have no business interfering with a woman's personal \nhealth\n\n[[Page H6740]]\n\ndecisions that are best for her and her family, and she needs family \nplanning centers to exercise all of her options as it relates to her \nhealth care.\n  This resolution is deceitful and it is wrong. It is past time to end \nthis war on women, and it is past time for Republicans to listen to the \nAmerican people, develop a responsible budget, and stop their attacks \non women's health.\n\n  Vote ``no'' on this very backward, egregious resolution. It is going \nto harm women. It is going to hurt women. It does not protect the \nhealth and safety of women.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from \nthe District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).\n  Ms. NORTON. I thank my good friend for her incredibly excellent work \non this bill.\n  A threat to shut down the government over funding Planned \nParenthood's contraceptive and preventative care measures looms again \nin 3 months, although 73 percent of the public is against forcing a \nshutdown over Planned Parenthood.\n  I am grateful for the high-quality coverage Planned Parenthood gives \nwomen's health across the board, including abortion services, not \nfunded by the Federal Government. The District of Columbia is the only \njurisdiction Congress denies the full reach of Roe v. Wade to low-\nincome women, by denying the local government the right to spend its \nown local funds on abortion services for poor women.\n  For the Nation, to cut government funds for Medicaid, family \nplanning, and preventative care would cut off our collective noses to \nspite our faces. Every public dollar spent on family planning services \nalone saves $7 in undesired births and other preventative care.\n  For all the heat generated by Republicans, Planned Parenthood is \nregarded more favorably now than it was before the current fight began. \nThe reason is, for nearly a century, Planned Parenthood's incredibly \neffective work for women's health has won it a strong following across \nour country from both parties.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. \nJackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut for \nher kindness. As well, let me thank the chair and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee, because we know the work that they have done.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me just simply say that I am very disappointed that \nwe are now settling for a CR that continues to have a sequester that \ncuts across and denies Border Patrol agents, Customs and Border \nProtection, Secret Service, and leaves the American people vulnerable.\n  So, the first order of business is that we are not doing what we are \nsupposed to do in providing for the American people. Now we move to \nanother unseemly legislative initiative that is attacking women's \nhealth. And what does that mean? We use it under the guise of Planned \nParenthood.\n  Planned Parenthood has any number of clinics in almost 50 States that \ndeal with women's health, contraception, sexually transmitted disease; \nplaces where women who are impoverished can go when they cannot go \nanywhere else.\n  In a hearing yesterday, someone was debating why they don't do \nmammograms. Women know that when we go to any doctor, the doctor refers \nmammograms.\n  So this is a bad bill. It is against women's health. The sequester is \nbad. Vote down both bills.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Con. Res. 79.\n  We are here again wasting valuable time on measures we know are \nhaving no real chance of survival beyond these debates.\n  I strongly oppose this continued effort to drag women's health issues \nand women's rights through this political circus.\n  At what point will the Majority step back and get regal about \nsubstantive and genuine legislation.\n  The amount of legislative time we have wasted on these offensive \nmessaging bills is ridiculous and must end.\n  Our constituents deserve better.\n  Our legislative and public service roles demand more.\n  And as we approach yet another deadline for piecemeal fiscal fixes, \nwe should be focused on passing a comprehensive and cost-savings \nbudget.\n  Yet, we are here today debating another measure that threatens \nmillions of Americans' access to preventative care and could end up \ncosting taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  However, we know H. Con. Res. 79 is not a serious attempt at passing \nreal legislation.\n  As such, it is simply being offered here today as a shameless \npolitical decoy to attack the legal rights of women.\n  Politicians are continuing to try to sneak around the Constitution \nand four decades of Supreme Court precedent with sham laws that do \nnothing to improve women's health care and only make it more difficult, \nif not impossible, to obtain safe and legal abortion.\n   Restricting all access to reproductive and women's health services \nonly exacerbates a woman's risk of an unintended pregnancy and fails to \naccomplish any meaningful overthrow of Roe v. Wade.\n  In recent years, state policymakers have passed hundreds of \nrestrictions on abortion care under the guise of protecting women's \nhealth and safety.\n  Fights here in Congress have been no different.\n  In my state of Texas a law that would have cut off access to 75 \npercent of reproductive healthcare clinics in the state was challenged \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014 and 2015.\n  On October 2, 2014, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional \na Texas law that required that all reproductive healthcare clinics that \nprovided the full range of services would be required to have a \nhospital-style surgery center building and staffing requirements.\n  This requirement meant that only 7 clinics would be allowed to \ncontinue to provide a full spectrum of reproductive healthcare to \nwomen.\n  Any woman facing an unintended pregnancy needs to be able to make her \nown decisions and weigh all her options--and these laws take those \noptions away.\n  Texas has 268,580 square miles only second in size to the state of \nAlaska.\n  The impact of the law in implementation would have ended access to \nreproductive services for millions of women in my state.\n  In 2015, the State of Texas once again threatened women's access to \nreproductive health care when it attempted to shutter all but 10 \nhealthcare providers in the state of Texas.\n  The Supreme Court once again intervened on the behalf of Texas women \nto block the move to close clinics in my state.\n  It seems every month we are faced with a new attack on women's access \nto reproductive health care, often couched in deceptive terms and \nconcern for women's health and safety.\n  And in fact we are here today supposedly to talk about the safety of \nwomen--but we know that's not really the case.\n  If my colleagues were so concerned about women's health and safety, \nthey would be promoting any one of the number of evidence-based \nproactive policies that improve women's health and well-being.\n  Instead, they are proposing yet another attempt to ban abortion.\n  That is their number one priority. This is certainly not about \nprotecting women's health, it's about politics.\n  We must separate the personal views of abortion from the legal issues \nand fundamental constitutional rights.\n  Undisputable, every woman has the constitutional right to make \npersonal health care decisions so basic that it must be equally \nprotected for all.\n  Restricting access to women's reproductive health care providers \nmakes it increasingly difficult--and sometimes impossible--for women \nwho have decided to end a pregnancy to get the safe, legal, high-\nquality care they need.\n  The result is not the elimination of abortions, but higher costs, \nlonger delays, and extra steps for women seeking abortion care, and in \nthe process punish women for their decision to exercise their \nconstitutional right to end a pregnancy.\n  History tells us that unsafe and late-term abortions did not cease to \nexist without adequate access to clinical service. Rather, the exact \nopposite--as we know limited and restricted access only leads to unsafe \nand dangerous practices.\n  Today, countless women in states like Texas and Mississippi, \nWisconsin, Alabama, Tennessee, and Louisiana--where state laws are \nalready gravely impacting women's access to health care providers--\nwomen are being forced to travel upwards of hundreds of miles or cross \nstate lines to access their constitutional right to an abortion.\n  These restrictions create sharp disparities in access to care that \nare troublingly reminiscent of the time before Roe v. Wade, when access \ndepended on a woman's social status, where she lived or her ability to \ntravel to another state.\n  In an effort to undermine what they could not otherwise overturn, \npoliticians are attempting to ``turn back the clock'' to the pre-Roe \nera\n\n[[Page H6741]]\n\nby shuttering reproductive health care clinics and cutting off women's \naccess to safe and legal abortion care.\n  Yet, far too many women who cannot afford to travel elsewhere will \nface an impossible choice between carrying an unintended pregnancy to \nterm or seeking drastic options outside the law.\n  A right that only exists on paper is no right at all.\n  Simply, restricting a women's right and access to legal abortion \nservices discriminately endangers the lives of women.\n  Congress should be doing everything it can to ensure that women have \naccess to preventive care, not eliminating it.\n  This is a legislative assault on all progressive health care, \nservice, and advocacy organizations who aim to provide vital care and \nservices to women and men across this country.\n  Hundreds of thousands have already spoken up, including leading \ngroups and communities such as the growing voice of our millennial \ngeneration.\n  For instance, the nearly 60,000 OB-GYN physicians and partners in \nwomen's health warn that this bill would scare providers away from \nproviding comprehensive, compassionate care to women, in a time where \nAmerica desperately needs more ob-gyns participating in Medicaid \nprograms.\n  Physicians and experts in the field have long argued that these \ndamaging measures serve no medical purpose, interfere in the doctor/\npatient relationship, and do nothing to promote women's health.\n  My colleagues should not be closing the door to health care services.\n  Rather, my colleagues should be doing more to connect our youth and \nwomen to services that help them reduce their risk of unintended \npregnancies and STD's, and improve their overall health through \npreventative screenings, education and planning, and not restricting \ntheir access to lawfully entitled family planning and private health \nservices.\n  I urge all Members to vote against the continued attack on women's \nhealth and rights.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings) for \nthe purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Mr. HASTINGS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. DeLAURO. May I inquire as to how much time is remaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Connecticut has 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  What we are facing here today and what this is about, this so-called \nenrollment correction, is a procedural maneuver because the United \nStates Senate sent over a continuing resolution that continues to fund \nPlanned Parenthood. Because the majority is interested in defunding the \nopportunity for healthcare services for women, they have asked for this \nprocedural maneuver to defund Planned Parenthood.\n  It is simply about taking funds away from American women. Think about \nit. Think about shutting the government down because of women's health. \nThe lack of care and concern, first and foremost, about the 2.7 million \nmen and women that Planned Parenthood serves every year is a grave \nconsequence. But in addition, shutting down the Federal Government the \nlast time cost $24 billion to American taxpayers, held up disability \nchecks for veterans, and, in fact, held back people's IRS rebates.\n  Their preoccupation with denying women's health is cruel, it is \nspiteful, it is wrong, and it does great harm to this great Nation. \nVote against this bad piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, not everyone, I recognize, in this country is pro-life, \nlike I am. But those who are should not be forced to have their tax \ndollars fund an organization that aborts more than 350,000 unborn \nbabies every year.\n  Federal law has long prohibited public funds from being used to \nactually perform abortions. However, Planned Parenthood gets millions \nin grants and reimbursements for other services that they provide, like \npregnancy tests, birth control, Pap smears, STD tests, and other \nvarious treatments.\n  Of course, low-income women should have access to these critical \nservices. But why is it necessary--why is it necessary--for those \nservices to be funded at the Nation's largest abortion provider?\n  It isn't actually, but the abortion industry and its supporters--it \nis what they want you to think it is. And they talk about women's \nhealth because they don't want to talk about abortion.\n  They don't want to talk about how ugly it is and how painful it is \nnot just to the mother having to make the decision, but to the unborn \nbaby who doesn't have a voice, who doesn't have a say.\n  When it comes to funding, they like to pretend, Mr. Speaker, that \nabortion doesn't exist and that Planned Parenthood is the only place \nwhere low-income women can get health care.\n  Taking away Federal funding from Planned Parenthood means attacking \nwomen's health, they say. That is not true.\n  The truth is that there are more than 13,000 federally qualified and \nrural health centers throughout this country that offer low-cost health \ncare to women. In fact, these centers outnumber Planned Parenthood \nclinics 20-1.\n  If those who defend Federal funding of Planned Parenthood truly just \nwanted to make sure that low-income women have access to health care \nand not abortion, then why not simply support these noncontroversial \ncommunity health centers instead?\n  If this argument is really about making sure women have access to \nhealth care, then we would all agree right here, right now, to support \nthese community health centers.\n  But you see, Mr. Speaker, that is not what this is about. You see, \nwhile federally qualified and rural health centers provide a wide range \nof medical services, they don't perform abortions. That is what they \nreally want. They want to preserve the pipeline of funding to the \nNation's largest abortion provider.\n  This talk of women's health is nothing but a charade, a false \npretense, that I believe more and more Americans are realizing is \nphony.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this concurrent \nresolution.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 448, the previous question is ordered.\n  The question is on the concurrent resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

However, instead of being commended, Sergeant Martland was \npunished for his actions and was taken out of the region, despite being \na soldier that was critical to the mission.\n  As someone who has worked to protect children and keep them safe from \nsexual exploitation, it is disheartening to see the military look the \nother way when children are being assaulted by our allied forces. This \nhas to change. Steps must be taken to ensure that our military uphold \nAmerican values while overseas.\n  Mr. Speaker, our military should not be looking the other way when \nour allies are engaging in wrongful acts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6743-7", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6743-H6744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SEPTEMBER IS NATIONAL PREPAREDNESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1\n\n[[Page H6744]]\n\nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAYNE.

General Assembly today confirmed \nit and showed that he is a self-serving autocrat who is more interested \nin delegitimizing Israel, the Jewish state, than in building up a \nfuture Palestinian state.\n  Abu Mazen's message was clear. He intends to scuttle any prospects \nfor peace, pursue Israel at the International Criminal Court, and \ncontinue his ploy for achieving unilateral statehood at the U.N.\n  President Obama must immediately suspend all assistance to the \nPalestinian Authority.\n  If the Palestinians do move to join additional international \nconventions and organizations, the U.S. law is unambiguous. We must \nsuspend all funding to any of these bodies that accept a nonexistent \nstate of Palestine to its membership.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President has been seeking ways to circumvent and \nwaive these provisions for years, but we must see to it that the \nPresident implements the full intent and letter of the law.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Reed) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, before I begin this evening, I ask unanimous \nconsent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise \nand extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic \nof this Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, joined this evening with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, to celebrate the upcoming \nOctober 2 National Manufacturing Day.\n  Manufacturing in the U.S. is something that I support fully. U.S. \nmanufacturing is something that, I think, shares bipartisan support \nacross the country, coast to coast, north to south, east to west, \nbecause it is about real, family-sustaining jobs where we build things \nin America, where we can actually manufacture our products here to sell \nnot only to the American economy, but to the world economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I co-chair the U.S. Manufacturing Caucus here in \nCongress, I wanted to ask my colleague on the U.S. Manufacturing Caucus \nto rise and open us up on this Special Order this evening to celebrate \nU.S. manufacturing.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan), a good friend and my \nco-chair on the Manufacturing Caucus.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York. \nThis is a great opportunity for us to share, I think, as Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  My friend from New York represents upstate New York, and that area of \nour country and the State of New York have a long history of \nmanufacturing. I represent northeast Ohio, which also has a long \nhistory of manufacturing.\n  I think we recognize the importance of manufacturing jobs and how to \ncreate policies that will further allow for investment in manufacturing \nand for workforce development within the context of manufacturing.\n  Also, I think we recognize, as we have seen the transition over the \nlast 20 or 30 years in our country, how much we miss these \nmanufacturing jobs. They pay a higher wage, more of a solid pension for \nmost manufacturers, better benefits, and are where people can learn a \ncraft, learn a skill, get into a good company, and make a good, honest \nliving; and that is what we are celebrating here today.\n  Through our Manufacturing Caucus, Congressman Reed and I try to \nstimulate some conversations and bring real people from our \ncongressional districts to help educate us on what the best process, \nwhat the best issues, what the best approaches would be for the United \nStates Congress to try to\n\n[[Page H6745]]\n\nincentivize manufacturing here in the United States.\n  I know I will be doing an event on Friday back in Youngstown, Ohio, \nand further celebrating in my community. I know you will, as well.\n  So I just want to say thank you to my friend. I look forward to us \ncontinuing--not just the old-line manufacturing that we know a lot \nabout and have lost of lot of those jobs, not just the advanced \nmanufacturing either--to work on the issue of making sure that we \ncreate more of these institutes to try to nurture new ways of \nmanufacturing, but also the additive manufacturing piece, which is \nhappening in Youngstown, Ohio, at America Makes, where the 3-D printing \nmovement, the Maker Movement is happening and burgeoning in an old \nwarehouse in downtown Youngstown. I mean, it doesn't get better than \nthat, to have millions of dollars of equipment in the downtown of an \niconic city that is really leading our community forward in this new \nline of manufacturing.\n  I want to thank you for your leadership. I appreciate your \nfriendship, and I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words here \ntonight.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio. He truly is a \nfriend, and he is just as committed to U.S. manufacturing as I am. I \nhave seen it firsthand. I have seen him in his district in action \nsupporting U.S. manufacturers.\n  The 3-D printing hub, the advanced manufacturing center that you \nreference and that we are so supportive of--working with Joe Kennedy \nhere in the House and Roy Blunt and Sherrod Brown on a bipartisan, \nbicameral basis, getting that legislation signed, which was a priority \nof the administration--and having that type of advanced manufacturing \ncenter in Ohio, in your home State, obviously has demonstrated his \ncommitment and his belief in U.S. manufacturing.\n  As the gentlemen indicated, it is not just advanced manufacturing. It \nis the traditional manufacturing. It is the manufacturing that we \nbelieve in where the American spirit is alive and well, where the \nAmerican Dream can be reached and obtained.\n  I mean, as my good friend from Ohio indicated, these are good, solid, \nfamily-sustaining, middle class jobs to a large extent that put food on \nthe table for our fellow Americans and put roofs over their heads and \nallow families to maybe pass on to the next generation a little bit \nbetter lifestyle or a little bit better American Dream than they \nenjoyed by having a little bit of money to invest in a college \neducation for their kids and to try to enjoy and live that American \nDream that I know my friend from Ohio believes in.\n  So I applaud my friend, and I appreciate my friend for all the work \nyou do on U.S. manufacturing. This is what gives me continued optimism \nhere in the United States Congress that we can get things done, because \nwe have come across the aisle and we have joined together to promote \nU.S. manufacturing.\n  I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. It is hard not to get a little bit nostalgic. I \nthink a lot of times those of us who advocate for manufacturing spend a \nlittle too much time in the nostalgia phase and not enough time, I \nthink, working in the space where we are trying to enhance, grow, and \ncreate new opportunities in manufacturing.\n  And I am not going to get political, but to go back to all of the \nelections, whether Republicans won or Democrats won, if you go back \n2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, I think the economic insecurity, in \nmy analysis, was at the heart of each of those elections.\n  As we have seen the decline in manufacturing, we have seen the \nincrease in anxiety for families to be able to make ends meet. So I am \nthankful that we can try to promote this together and try to find an \nissue like manufacturing that garners 60 to 70 percent support from \nregions, demographics all over the United States.\n  I think there is an inherent understanding of making something. I \nstart it, and then I pass it to your company. You add value to it, and \nthen you pass it to someone else. They add value to it, and it goes \nthrough that supply chain, tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3, and everybody \nbenefits.\n  Back in the day, you know, we had a manufacturing facility for \nGeneral Motors that had 15,000 or 16,000 people that now has 3,000 or \n4,000. We had a supplier to General Motors, Packard Electric and then \nDelphi, that had 13,000 employees, and now it is down to 2,000 or \n3,000. Those were all solid, middle class jobs. I know you could \nprobably give similar examples in Corning and other places.\n\n  So I think, if we have an industrial policy, if we continue through \nthe Tax Code and other ways to make sure that we incentivize investment \nin these areas, that we can help regrow those new-age manufacturing \njobs that everybody, I think, is looking for, as you said, to make a \ngood living, have a solid retirement, have good benefits, and not have \nto work so hard that you miss the soccer match, you miss the baseball \ngame, or you can't go on a vacation. We can help regrow those middle \nclass jobs where you can still have time with your family, which \nultimately is the most important thing anyway.\n  So I appreciate the opportunity to be here and continue to work with \nyou.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman points out, you know, what \nmanufacturing represents is opportunity, an opportunity to so many \nAmericans, so many people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know my colleague from Ohio will agree with me that \nU.S. manufacturing is positioned on a precipice of rebirth here in \nAmerica.\n  Now, my friend points out some areas that we need to continue to work \non to make U.S. manufacturing even more competitive than what we are \nfinding today.\n  When we see the energy rebirth here in America with the shale \nrevolution for oil and natural gas coming online and the feedstock and \nthe utility costs going down and going lower and lower, it is \npositioning U.S. manufacturing to be in a competitive position on the \nworld economic stage. To me, that is such a hopeful, optimistic \nposition of time for the United States of America to be in.\n  I can tell you story after story, Mr. Speaker. When I talk to U.S. \nmanufacturers, they talk about the lessons that they have learned over \nthe years of maybe chasing that cheap labor dollar, maybe chasing that \noverseas market, the whole issue of outsourcing.\n  What I hear from U.S. manufacturers today is that they want to come \nback to America, because in America we have the best workforce and we \nhave the best work ethic across the world.\n  What we have in America, also, is the rule of law. So many of these \nmanufacturers that have looked overseas and relocated overseas, they \nare finding that their intellectual property is disregarded. Those \ninnovative ideas, those new ideas, those inventions that are going to \nspur that next product growth of tomorrow, they just get ripped off.\n  They have no recourse to enforce what we in America, as the \ncornerstone of our philosophy, respect, and that is property rights and \nthat is the rule of law and saying that, if you invent it, you own it. \nThat is something that is critical for us as we go forward is to \nrecognize the opportunity--and I know my good friend shares this--that \nU.S. manufacturing has right now with the competitive nature of the \nAmerican marketplace.\n  There are some things we can do. Serving on the Ways and Means \nCommittee here in the House of Representatives, in charge of tax \npolicy, trade policy, and health care, to a large degree, one of the \nthings I think we have a shared commitment to is fixing our broken Tax \nCode. I don't know of anyone across America that will stand up and take \nthat 70,000 pages of Tax Code and say this is working and this is \nputting our manufacturers in a competitive position on the world stage.\n  I hear it time and time again that we need to fix that Tax Code. \nBecause if we do that, that is another piece to advance U.S. \nmanufacturing to that rebirth, that renaissance that I know--and I know \nmy good friend from Ohio shares--can happen and will happen, because \nthis is America where that opportunity can rise again.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, we all know that there are the larger \nmanufacturers who can hire accountants and all the rest to figure it \nout, but it is the small- and medium-sized tier 3, tier 4 suppliers, \nyou know, that maybe have 50 or 100 people and it is a family business \nand people aren't making a ton of dough, and to have to deal with the \nincreased complexity of a Tax Code\n\n[[Page H6746]]\n\nfor the small business, I think it is appropriate for us to try to \nsimplify that and make it a little bit easier for them.\n  I am glad you mentioned natural gas. Especially in our region, in \nwestern New York, western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, it is a huge \nopportunity for us. We should all be beating on the doors of the \nEuropean companies to try to say, you know, move your manufacturing \nbase into our region because of what the opportunities are going to be \ninto the future.\n  We have talked about this, and I think we have had a hearing about it \nthrough our caucus, is how do we get young people and their parents to \nrecognize and see manufacturing as a real opportunity for them. A lot \nof people think, parents think: Well, I don't want my kids going into \nmanufacturing. You know, they picture the steel mill in Youngstown \nwhere there were 20,000 people coming out dirty, in hard hats with a \nmetal lunch bucket. Now, today, you walk into a manufacturing facility, \nit is about metrology and it is about precision manufacturing. You \ncould eat off the floor because it is so clean. It is a whole different \nidea of what manufacturing is.\n  We have got to figure out how to work with guidance counselors and \nteachers in the STEM areas about how to get kids engaged in this area \nearlier, because kids are naturally inclined--I think of my 12-year-old \nson, Mason. He is always building, creating, trying to use his hands \nthe best he can, or even if he is on the computer, how he is \norganizing, you know, his troop alignments in some of the war games \nthat he plays. But it is all about constructing something and putting \nsomething together, building things, and how do you create that.\n  These young kids just naturally gravitate toward that. So the more we \ncan get them engaged at a very, very young age about designing and \nbuilding, the more we are going to unleash the creative potential of \nthat generation to further build out the manufacturing base here in the \nUnited States.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Mr. REED. Reclaiming my time, I couldn't have said it better. I know \nthe gentleman has shared stories that I have experienced myself.\n  When we look at the present state of U.S. manufacturing, these are \nnot the days of smoke-filled rooms where safety wasn't a concern and \nthat it was a dirty, drudgery type of environment that they existed in. \nThis is cutting-edge. This is a safe workplace. This is where safety is \nparamount and where skills are so necessary.\n  One of the things that I still see today that we have to fight--and I \nthink the gentleman will share this position with me--is I do a lot of \nwork back in the district going to local high schools, standing in \nfront of juniors and seniors and having conversations with those kids \nabout what they want to be when they get older.\n  I remember vividly one story. It was the first time when I asked the \nquestion, ``What do you want to be when you get older?'' The kids' \nhands went up. You have got the lawyers. You have got the doctors. You \nhave got the people that want to be like the Al Rokers. They want to be \nthe weatherman or on the broadcast TV, that type of thing.\n  I said, ``That is all fine and good. That is great.'' Then one young \nman, who was a senior, said, ``Congressman, I am going to be a \nwelder.'' I went over the Moon with that young man.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. You are going to have a job.\n  Mr. REED. I said, ``Do you understand''--to the rest of his class--\n``I just left a steel facility in this district where they are going to \nstart welders at $60,000 a year starting pay?''\n  I said, ``This young man is going to be able to have a career. This \nis a career. He is going to be able to have a little extra money in his \npocket. He is going to be able to maybe get married and raise a \nfamily.'' He got it, as a senior. I was so excited.\n  As I walked out of that room and I was walking and exiting the \nbuilding, I had one of the school officials, a guidance counselor, say, \n``Oh, Congressman, that was great. You made that young man's day. There \nis no doubt about it. He is going to remember that day for the rest of \nhis life.'' ``But,'' she said, ``we really don't try to promote those \ntypes of careers, though.''\n  I went almost through the roof, Mr. Speaker. I said, ``That is the \nproblem. We have to change that concept, that stigma, that \nmanufacturing historically carries with it.'' I know we are doing it. I \nknow the gentleman from Ohio is working with us, Mr. Speaker, to get \nthat done.\n  What I see is, when you explain the opportunities to that next \ngeneration, when you talk to mothers and fathers and say this is really \nwhat is out there, their eyes light up. The burden is lifted from their \nshoulders to see that their kids are choosing to go into a career that \nthey want to and that they recognize is rewarding, safe, and \nproductive.\n  I will tell you I am going to continue the efforts to promote U.S. \nmanufacturing because it is not just the manufacturers. As my good \nfriend from Ohio indicated, it is all those supply chains, all those \nmom-and-pops, those small businesses, that are not only supplying the \npieces or the raw material to the manufacturers, but you think about \nthe restaurants, you think about the service folks that are cleaning \nthe facilities, you think about all that it takes to put that together. \nThat is a vibrant, growing economy, Mr. Speaker.\n  That is what we are promoting here with U.S. manufacturing. That is \nwhy I am so glad that October 2 is National Manufacturing Day, so that \nwe, as a nation, could maybe take a moment on Friday and say, ``You \nknow what. We are going to believe in American manufacturing again. We \nare going to make it here to sell it around the world, make it with our \nhands, create wealth, create something.'' I know that my friend from \nOhio shares that passion.\n  One of the things that I am so committed to when we talk about this \nis the STEM, the science, technology, engineering, mathematics need of \neducation policy going forward. That is what our advanced manufacturing \nbill with Joe Kennedy was all about.\n  And working with the Senate in a bicameral and getting it signed into \nlaw was to take these public-private partnerships, to take our schools, \nour universities, our colleges, work with our manufacturers to develop \nthose skills that are necessary to do this manufacturing.\n  Because, as my good friend who has been in many of the manufacturing \nfacilities, just as I have--when you go and you look at these machines, \nyou look at how these operations and assembly lines occur, you need \nhigh education. This is highly skilled stuff. You can just see the \npride in the workers when they explain to me how they learned that \ncomputer program or they learned how to do that assembly line work. I \nwill tell you, it is inspiring.\n  I yield to the gentleman if he has got any stories.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Yes. It is not like it is a 4-year degree either. \nIt is something that can be learned in a year or two because you are \nfocused on exactly where you are going to be.\n  And you talk about a welder maybe starting at $60,000-plus. You think \nabout, if you could do that, start making $60,000 a year at 20--it \ntakes a lot of people, schoolteachers, for example--how long does it \ntake in Corning, New York, or Youngstown, Ohio, to get to $60,000? It \nis a little while.\n  So that is money you can begin to save, invest, put in your \nretirement, whatever, your kids' college. I mean, you have that money \nnot starting at $30,000, but starting at $60,000 or $70,000. And that \ncan go vertical, too.\n  The more skills you get and if you are in the right position in the \nright company, you can start making upwards of $100,000 as a welder. \nThat is a lot of money that, if you plan your finances properly, you \ncan have a lot of savings.\n  To that point as well, I was at Stark State Community College, which \nis just outside of Canton, a few weeks ago, and there were kids there \nfrom Barberton High School and Norton High School, about 10 or 15 of \nthem. They just started a program where these kids in high school were \nearning credits for the welding certificate.\n  With this program, those kids can earn 13 credit hours for a 30-hour \ncertificate. So by the time you graduate from high school, if you get \nin as a junior and you do it your junior and senior year, you will have \n13 of 30 credits. So you don't need much longer. You are over a third \nof the way to your certificate, and you just graduated from high \nschool.\n\n[[Page H6747]]\n\n  Those are the kind of innovative things I think we need to continue \nto figure out how to incentivize and create. Part of it is the \nawareness that we were talking about, that it is okay for your kid to \nbe a welder because of what we have already talked about.\n  But how do we create incentives to streamline the education process, \nto get kids on a track so, when they are 18, 19, 20 years old, they \nhave a job and they are not sleeping in our basements?\n  Mr. REED. Reclaiming my time, yeah, think about this. As we see the \ncost of colleges and your college degree, kids coming out of school--I \ncame out of law school at the end of the day owing over $110,000. I was \nraised by a single mother. I am the youngest of 12. I have 8 older \nsisters and 3 older brothers. To start life after school with a \n$110,000 mortgage on my head was a very difficult thing.\n\n  You talk to these young men and women who are going into these \nprograms--it is not just welding. It is manufacturing. It is HVAC. It \nis plumbing. It is all of the things that go into U.S. manufacturing--\nand they are getting through school with these guaranteed programs or \nthese community college programs.\n  We have got a couple manufacturers in the district that have a \ncertification process system that they put together where they \nguarantee 100 percent hiring at the end of the certificate program for \nthese kids after--I think it is 24 weeks, if I remember correctly.\n  They are getting into that job, making that type of salary, and have \nno debt to pay for that college degree. That is a win-win-win. And they \nenjoy it. And they enjoy it. I am sure the gentleman knows these \nstories and has seen those people firsthand.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. This has been great. Let's keep it rolling and \nfigure out what we can do moving forward in a bipartisan way like you \nand Congressman Kennedy did.\n  I think that is essential with growing the ecosystem around different \nkinds of manufacturing in auto and additive and all the rest. We stand \nready to work with you on the Democratic side to make that happen.\n  Mr. REED. From this side of the aisle, on behalf of the people that \nwe represent in western New York, you have that commitment, that I will \ncontinue to fight with you, stand with you to fight for U.S. \nmanufacturing. I will not fight against you, but fight together so that \nwe can advance U.S. manufacturing.\n  It has been a pleasure to call you a friend. It has been a pleasure \nto be part of this caucus. Our caucus is strong, Mr. Speaker. We have \nbipartisan representation across the country.\n  As we started this conversation tonight, in celebrating National \nManufacturing Day this Friday, this is not a partisan issue. I go \nacross the entire country, and people always tell me they appreciate \nthe work we do in the caucus, in the Congress, when it comes to U.S. \nmanufacturing.\n  I again commit to you that we will continue to make this a priority \nso that we can make it here to sell it around the world again, bring \nthose jobs back to American soil and create these middle class jobs to \na large extent so that families, men and women, sons and daughters, can \nenjoy the American Dream. I appreciate the gentleman for joining us \nthis evening.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Thank you, sir.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I just want to summarize some of \nthe numbers that are associated with U.S. manufacturing.\n  Manufacturing supports an estimated 17.6 million jobs in the United \nStates. That is about 1 in 6 private sector jobs. More than 12 million \nAmericans are employed directly in manufacturing. They earn almost \n$15,000 more annually than the average worker.\n  This is what U.S. manufacturing is all about. It is about creating \nwealth. It is about creating opportunity for generations to come.\n  I will tell you, as we continue our career here in Washington, D.C., \nI will be a voice for U.S. manufacturing every day. We will break down \nbarriers across the world so that we can have an even playing field, so \nthat we can make those products, build those products here, access \nthose markets where 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside of \nAmerica's borders so that we have a vibrant economy not only servicing \nthe American demand, but the world demand.\n  I think, if we get our policies right here, if we get that trade \npolicy done correctly, if we get that tax policy done where we have a \nTax Code that is simple, fair, and is competitive for the 21st \ncentury--I am very confident, Mr. Speaker, that what we will create is \nan opportunity not just for U.S. manufacturing, but all American \ncitizens, but, in particular, U.S. manufacturing to prosper and grow \nfor generations to come.\n  I am excited to be here this evening, Mr. Speaker. I am excited to \nshare with such a good man from the State of Ohio a passion and \ncommitment to a priority issue of U.S. manufacturing.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just ask all of my fellow American citizens to take a \nmoment this Friday, October 2, and celebrate National Manufacturing \nDay. Let's come together to have a great opportunity for the future \ngenerations of America to come.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6747-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Culberson (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on account \nof illness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/house-section/article/H6747-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Karen L.
