Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the \ndistinct honor of presenting to you His Excellency Narendra Modi, Prime \nMinister of the Republic of India.\n  (Applause, the Members rising.)\n  Prime Minister MODI. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, distinguished \nMembers of the U.S. Congress, ladies and gentlemen, I am deeply honored \nby the invitation to address this joint meeting of the U.S. Congress.\n  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for opening the door of this magnificent \nCapitol. This temple of democracy has encouraged and empowered other \ndemocracies the world over.\n  It manifests the spirit of this great Nation which, in Abraham \nLincoln's words, ``was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the \nproposition that all men are created equal.''\n  In granting me this opportunity, you have honored the world's largest \ndemocracy and its 1.25 billion people. As a representative of the \nworld's largest democracy, it is, indeed, a privilege to speak to the \nleaders of its oldest.\n  Mr. Speaker, 2 days ago I began my visit by going to the Arlington \nNational Cemetery, the final resting place of many brave soldiers of \nthis great land. I honored their courage and sacrifice for the ideals \nof freedom and democracy.\n  It was also the 72nd anniversary of the D-day. On that day, thousands \nfrom this great country fought to protect the torch of liberty. They \nsacrificed their lives so that the world lives in freedom. I applaud, \nIndia applauds the great sacrifices of the men and women from the land \nof the free and the home of the brave in service of mankind.\n  India knows what this means because our soldiers have fallen in \ndistant battlefields for the same ideals. That is why the threads of \nfreedom and liberty form a strong bond between our two democracies.\n  Mr. Speaker, our nations may have been shaped by differing histories, \ncultures, and faiths. Yet, our belief in democracy for our nations and \nliberty for our countrymen is common.\n  The idea that all citizens are created equal is a central pillar of \nthe American Constitution. Our founding fathers, too, shared the same \nbelief and sought individual liberty for every citizen of India. There \nwere many who doubted India when, as a newly independent nation, we \nreposed our faith in democracy. Indeed, wagers were made on our \nfailure. But the people of India did not waver.\n  Our founders created a modern nation with freedom, democracy, and\n\n[[Page H3507]]\n\nequality as the essence of its soul. And, in doing so, they ensured \nthat we continued to celebrate our age-old diversity.\n  Today, across its individuals and institutions, in its villages and \ncities, in its streets and states, anchored in equal respect for all \nfaiths, and in the melody of hundreds of its languages and dialects, \nIndia lives as one; India grows as one; India celebrates as one.\n  Mr. Speaker, modern India is in its 70th year. For my government, the \nconstitution is its real holy book. And, in that holy book, freedom of \nfaith, speech and franchise, and equality of all citizens, regardless \nof background, are enshrined as fundamental rights. Eight hundred \nmillion of my countrymen may exercise the freedom of franchise once \nevery 5 years. But all the 1.25 billion of our citizens have freedom \nfrom fear, a freedom they exercise every moment of their lives.\n  Distinguished Members, engagement between our two democracies has \nbeen visible in the manner in which our thinkers impacted one another \nand shaped the course of our societies. Thoreau's idea of civil \ndisobedience influenced our political thoughts. And, similarly, the \ncall by the great sage of India, Swami Vivekananda, to embrace humanity \nwas most famously delivered in Chicago.\n  Gandhi's nonviolence inspired the heroism of Martin Luther King. \nToday, a mere distance of 3 miles separates the Martin Luther King \nMemorial at the Tidal Basin from the statue of Gandhi at Massachusetts \nAvenue. This proximity of their memorials in Washington mirrors the \ncloseness of ideals and values they believed in.\n  The genius of Dr. Bhimrao ``Babasaheb'' Ambedkar was nurtured in the \nyears he spent at the Colombia University a century ago. The impact of \nthe U.S. Constitution on him was reflected in his drafting of the \nIndian constitution some three decades later.\n  Our independence was ignited by the same idealism that fueled your \nstruggle for freedom. No wonder, then, that former Prime Minister of \nIndia, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, called India and the U.S. ``natural \nallies.'' No wonder that the shared ideals and common philosophy of \nfreedom shaped the bedrock of our ties. No wonder, then, that President \nObama has called our ties the defining partnership of the 21st century.\n  Mr. Speaker, more than 15 years ago, Prime Minister Vajpayee stood \nhere and gave a call to step out of the ``shadow of hesitation'' of the \npast. The pages of our friendship since then tell a remarkable story.\n  Today, our relationship has overcome the hesitations of history. \nComfort, candor, and convergence define our conversations. Through the \ncycle of elections and transitions of administrations, the intensity of \nour engagements has only grown. And, in this exciting journey, the U.S. \nCongress has acted as its compass. You helped us turn barriers into \nbridges of partnership.\n  In the fall of 2008, when the Congress passed the India-U.S. Civil \nNuclear Cooperation Agreement, it changed the very colors of leaves of \nour relationship. We thank you for being there when the partnership \nneeded you the most.\n  You have also stood by us in times of sorrow. India will never forget \nthe solidarity shown by the U.S. Congress when terrorists from across \nour border attacked Mumbai in November of 2008. And for this, we are \ngrateful.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am informed that the working of the U.S. Congress is \nharmonious. I am also told that you are well known for your \nbipartisanship. Well, you are not alone. Time and again, I have also \nwitnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament, especially in our \nupper House. So, as you can see, we have many shared practices.\n  Mr. Speaker, as this country knows well, every journey has its \npioneers. Very early on, they shaped a development partnership, even \nwhen the meeting ground was more limited. The genius of Norman Borlaug \nbrought the Green Revolution and food security to my country. The \nexcellence of the American universities nurtured institutions of \ntechnology and management in India. And I could go on, but fast forward \nto the present.\n  The embrace of our partnership extends to the totality of human \nendeavor, from the depths of the oceans to the vastness of the space. \nOur science and technology collaboration continues to help us in \ncracking the age-old problems in the fields of public health, \neducation, food, and agriculture.\n  Ties of commerce and investment are flourishing. We trade more with \nthe U.S. than with any other nation. And the flow of goods, services, \nand capital between us generates jobs in both our societies.\n  As in trade, so in defense. India exercises with the United States \nmore than we do with any other partner. Defense purchases have moved \nfrom almost zero to $10 billion in less than a decade. Our cooperation \nalso secures our cities and citizens from terrorists, and protects our \ncritical infrastructure from cyber threats. Civil nuclear cooperation, \nas I told President Obama yesterday, is a reality.\n  Mr. Speaker, our people-to-people links are strong, and there is a \nclose cultural connect between our societies.\n  Siri--you are familiar with the Siri. Siri tells us that India's \nancient heritage of yoga has over 30 million practitioners in the U.S. \nIt is estimated that more Americans bend for yoga than to throw a curve \nball.\n  And, no, Mr. Speaker, we have not yet claimed intellectual property \nright on yoga.\n  Connecting our two nations is also a unique and dynamic bridge of 3 \nmillion Indian Americans. Today, they are among your best CEOs, \nacademics, astronauts, scientists, economists, doctors, even spelling \nbee champions.\n  They are your strength. They are also the pride of India. They \nsymbolize the best of both of our societies.\n  Mr. Speaker, my understanding of your great country began long before \nI entered public office. Long before assuming office, I traveled coast \nto coast, covering more than 25 States of America.\n  I realized then that the real strength of the U.S. was in the dreams \nof its people and the boldness of their ambitions.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, a similar spirit animates India. Our 800 million \nyouth are especially impatient. India is undergoing a profound social \nand economic change.\n  A billion of its citizens are already politically empowered. My dream \nis to economically empower them through many social and economic \ntransformations and do so by 2022, the 75th anniversary of India's \nindependence.\n  My to-do list is long and ambitious but, you will understand, it \nincludes: a vibrant rural economy with a robust farm sector; a roof \nover each head and electricity for all households; to skill millions of \nour youth; build 100 smart cities; have broadband for a billion, and \nconnect our villages to the digital world; and create a 21st century \nrail, road, and port infrastructure.\n  These are not just aspirations: they are goals to be reached in a \nfinite time frame, and to be achieved with a light carbon footprint, \nwith greater emphasis on renewables.\n  Mr. Speaker, in every sector of India's forward march, I see the U.S. \nas an indispensable partner. Many of you also believe that a stronger \nand prosperous India is in America's strategic interest.\n  Let us work together to convert shared ideals into practical \ncooperation. There can be no doubt that, in advancing this \nrelationship, both nations stand to gain.\n  As the U.S. businesses search for new areas of economic growth, \nmarkets for their goods, a pool of skilled resources, and a global \nlocation to produce and manufacture, India could be their ideal \npartner.\n  India's strong economy and growth rate of 7.6 percent per annum is \ncreating a new opportunity for our mutual prosperity.\n  Transformative American technologies in India and growing investment \nby Indian companies in the United States both have a positive impact on \nthe lives of our citizens. Today, for their global research and \ndevelopment centers, India is the destination of choice for the U.S. \ncompanies.\n  Looking eastward from India, across the Pacific, the innovation \nstrength of our two countries comes together in California. Here, the \ninnovative genius of America and India's intellectual creativity are \nworking to shape new industries of the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, the 21st century has brought with it great \nopportunities, but it has also come with its own set of challenges.\n  While some parts of the world are islands of growing economic \nprosperity,\n\n[[Page H3508]]\n\nothers are mired in conflicts. In Asia, the absence of an agreed \nsecurity architecture creates uncertainty. Threats of terror are \nexpanding, and new challenges are emerging in cyber and outer space.\n  And global institutions conceived in the 20th century seem unable to \ncope with new challenges or take on new responsibilities. In this world \nfull of multiple transitions and economic opportunities, growing \nuncertainties and political complexities, existing threats and new \nchallenges, our engagement can make a difference by promoting: \ncooperation, not dominance; connectivity, not isolation; inclusive, not \nexclusive, mechanisms; respect for global commons; and, above all, \nadherence to international rules and norms.\n  India is already assuming her responsibilities in securing the Indian \nOcean region. A strong India-U.S. partnership can anchor peace, \nprosperity, and stability from Asia to Africa and from the Indian Ocean \nto the Pacific. It can also help ensure security of the sea lanes of \ncommerce and freedom of navigation on the seas. But the effectiveness \nof our cooperation would increase if international institutions, framed \nwith the mind-set of the 20th century, were to reflect the realities of \ntoday.\n  Mr. Speaker, before arriving in Washington, D.C., I had visited \nHerat, in western Afghanistan, to inaugurate the Afghan-India \nFriendship Dam, built with Indian assistance. I was also there on \nChristmas Day last year to dedicate to that proud nation its \nParliament, a testimony to our democratic ties.\n  Afghans naturally recognize that the sacrifices of Americans have \nhelped create a better life, but your contribution in keeping the \nregion safe and secure is deeply appreciated even beyond.\n  India, too, has made an enormous contribution and sacrifices to \nsupport our friendship with the Afghan people. A commitment to rebuild \na peaceful, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan is our shared objective.\n  Yet, distinguished Members, not just in Afghanistan, but elsewhere in \nsouth Asia and globally, terrorism remains the biggest threat. In the \nterritory stretching from west of India's border to Africa, it may go \nby different names, from Lashkar-e-Taiba, to Taliban, to ISIS, but its \nphilosophy is common: of hate, murder, and violence. Although, its \nshadow is spreading across the world, it is incubated in India's \nneighborhood.\n  I commend the Members of the U.S. Congress for sending a clear \nmessage to those who preach and practice terrorism for political gains. \nRefusing to reward them is the first step towards holding them \naccountable for their actions.\n  The fight against terrorism has to be fought at many levels, and the \ntraditional tools of military, intelligence, or diplomacy alone would \nnot be able to win this fight.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have both lost civilians and soldiers in combating \nterrorism. The need of the hour is for us to deepen our security \ncooperation and base it on a policy that isolates those who harbor, \nsupport, and sponsor terrorists; that does not distinguish between \n``good'' and ``bad'' terrorists; and that delinks religion from \nterrorism.\n  Also, for us to succeed, those who believe in humanity must come \ntogether to fight for it as one, and speak against this menace in one \nvoice. Terrorism must be delegitimized.\n  Mr. Speaker, the benefits of our partnership extend not just to the \nnations and regions that need it most. On our own, and by combining our \ncapacities, we are also responding to other global challenges, \nincluding when disaster strikes and where humanitarian relief is \nneeded. Far from our shores, we evacuated thousands from Yemen--\nIndians, Americans, and others. Nearer home, we were the first \nresponders during Nepal's earthquake, in the Maldives water crisis, \nand, most recently, during the landslide in Sri Lanka.\n  We are also one of the largest contributors of troops to U.N. \npeacekeeping operations. Often, India and the U.S. have combined their \nstrengths in science, technology, and innovation to help fight hunger, \npoverty, diseases, and illiteracy in different parts of the world. The \nsuccess of our partnership is also opening up new opportunities for \nlearning, security, and development from Asia to Africa.\n  And the protection of the environment and caring for the planet is \ncentral to our shared vision of a just world. For us in India, to live \nin harmony with Mother Earth is part of our ancient belief, and to take \nfrom nature only what is most essential is part of our Indian culture.\n  Our partnership, therefore, aims to balance responsibilities with \ncapabilities, and it also focuses on new ways to increase the \navailability and use of renewable energy.\n  A strong U.S. support for our initiative to form an International \nSolar Alliance is one such effort. We are working together not just for \na better future for ourselves, but for the whole world. This has also \nbeen the goal of our efforts in G20, East Asia Summit, and climate \nchange summits.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we deepen our partnership, there would be times when \nwe would have differing perspectives; but since our interests and \nconcerns converge, the autonomy in decisionmaking and diversity in our \nperspectives can only add value to our partnership.\n  So, as we embark on a new journey and seek new goals, let us focus \nnot just on matters routine, but also transformational ideas, ideas \nwhich can focus not just on creating wealth, but also creating value \nfor our societies; not just on immediate gains, but also long-term \nbenefits; not just on sharing best practices, but also shaping \npartnerships; and not just on building a bright future for our peoples, \nbut in being a bridge to a more united, humane, and prosperous world.\n  And important for the success of this journey would be a need to view \nit with new eyes and new sensitivities. When we do this, we will \nrealize the full promise of this extraordinary relationship.\n  Mr. Speaker, in my final thoughts and words, let me emphasize that \nour relationship is primed for a momentous future. The constraints of \nthe past are behind us, and foundations of the future are firmly in \nplace.\n  In the lines of Walt Whitman: ``The orchestra have sufficiently tuned \ntheir instruments; the baton has given the signal.'' And to that, if I \nmight add, there is a new symphony in play.\n  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, and distinguished \nMembers, for this honor.\n  Thank you very much.\n  (Applause, the Members rising.)\n  At 12 o'clock and 11 minutes p.m., His Excellency Narendra Modi, \nPrime Minister of the Republic of India, accompanied by the committee \nof escort, retired from the Hall of the House of Representatives.\n  The Assistant to the Sergeant at Arms escorted the invited guests \nfrom the Chamber in the following order:\n  The members of the President's Cabinet;\n  The Acting Dean of the Diplomatic Corps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/house-section/article/H3508-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        JOINT MEETING DISSOLVED\n\n  The SPEAKER.

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I \ncall up House Resolution 767 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 767\n\n       Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this \n     resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule \n     XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the \n     Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of \n     the bill (H.R. 4775) to facilitate efficient State \n     implementation of ground-level ozone standards, and for other \n     purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed \n     with. All points of order against consideration of the bill \n     are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and \n     shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by \n     the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     Energy and Commerce. After general debate the bill shall be \n     considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. It shall \n     be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose \n     of amendment under the five-minute rule the amendment in the \n     nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Energy \n     and Commerce now printed in the bill. The committee amendment \n     in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. \n     All points of order against the committee amendment in the \n     nature of a substitute are waived. No amendment to the \n     committee amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in \n     order except those printed in the report of the Committee on \n     Rules accompanying this resolution. Each such amendment may \n     be offered only in the order printed in the report, may be \n     offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be \n     considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified \n     in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent \n     and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall \n     not be subject to a demand for division of the question in \n     the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of \n     order against such amendments are waived. At the conclusion \n     of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee \n     shall rise and report the bill to the House with such \n     amendments as may have been adopted. Any Member may demand a \n     separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the \n     Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the committee \n     amendment in the nature of a substitute.

The concurrent resolutions referred to in section \n     2 of this resolution are as follows:\n       (1) The concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 89) expressing \n     the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental \n     to the United States economy.\n       (2) The concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 112) expressing \n     the sense of Congress opposing the President's proposed $10 \n     tax on every barrel of oil.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for \n1 hour.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), my \ngood friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nDuring consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the \npurpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 767 provides a structured \nrule for the consideration of three bills. You heard the reading Clerk \nread them, but I will read them again: H.R. 4775, Ozone Standards \nImplementation Act; H. Con. Res. 89, Expressing the Sense of Congress \nthat a Carbon Tax would be Detrimental to the United States Economy; \nand, H. Con. Res. 112, Expressing the Sense of Congress Opposing the \nPresident's Proposed $10 Tax on Every Barrel of Oil.\n  It is a little unusual that we put three different bills into a \nsingle rule, but today has been a bit of an unusual day. It has been a \nbit of an unusual day.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is no surprise to you, standing not 3 feet from where \nyou were just 30 minutes ago was the leader of a democracy of 1.3 \nbillion people. That is 1.3 billion people. In the midst of his \nremarks, he commented on the reputation of the United States Congress, \nknown far and wide around the globe. He commented on the comity--that \nis with an i-t-y, not an e-d-y--that we have been known for. And I hope \nthis rule will be no exception, Mr. Speaker.\n  We are not going to agree on all the underlying bills, all the \nunderlying policy, but what we can agree on is that this Congress needs \nto have its voice heard.\n  If we approve this rule today--and I recommend to all of my \ncolleagues that we do approve this rule today--we will be able to get \nto the underlying debate. And in the underlying debate, Mr. Speaker, we \nhave two senses of Congress and a piece of legislation--a piece of \nlegislation for which amendments were submitted to the Rules Committee \nto say that we have ideas as Members of this body about how we can \nimprove the underlying bill.\n  One of them came from my friend from Colorado. I don't particularly \nsupport the idea that he is pushing, but I support his right to have \nthe idea heard on the floor of the House. This rule makes the Polis \namendment in order, along with every other non-duplicative amendment \nsubmitted. I add non-duplicative because virtually the same amendment \nwas submitted by two different Members and we decided to debate it once \ninstead of twice, as is customary.\n  We are going to disagree, but we are going to have the debate over \nthose disagreements. And my great hope is that the work product we \nproduce will be a stronger work product because we have had an \nopportunity to discuss it here on the floor. My great hope is that, \nafter we have had a chance to perfect that work product, we will send \nit on to the Senate with a big bipartisan vote from both parties.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is easy to talk about taxes as if they don't come \nfrom someone. When we have an academic conversation about tax policy, \nwhat is the saying? Don't tax him, don't tax me, tax the man behind \nthat tree.\n  I have heard folks say: You are always trying to put the tax burden \non somebody else.\n  What the President proposed was $10 a barrel on every barrel of oil \nconsumed in America. Now, historically, we have had some low oil prices \nof late. That $10 a barrel tax would have amounted to almost a 50 \npercent increase in the cost of a barrel of oil. Today it is going to \nbe closer to a 20 percent increase in the cost of a barrel of oil.\n  This tax is implemented in the name of what, Mr. Speaker?\n  It is in the name of improving our failing infrastructure because we \ndo need to improve our failing infrastructure. We do have to have a \nconversation about user fees in this country and how it is we are going \nto build the best logistical system the world has ever known. But that \nis not what this tax would do.\n  This is a tax that is part of what has been a long campaign against \nthe consumption of any fossil fuels whatsoever. My great frustration, \nMr. Speaker, is that if your goal is to reduce the consumption of \nfossil fuels, we have a lot of ways we can do that. We have a lot of \nvery reasonable ways we can do that. And this proposal makes no effort \nto try to find the most efficient way to make that happen. It is a \nblanket $10 a barrel tax across the board.\n  If you are using that barrel of oil to generate space-age plastics, \nMr. Speaker, and you are going to use those\n\n[[Page H3510]]\n\nspace-age plastics to build the most efficient photovoltaic cell array \nthe world has ever known, such as is going on in my district, there is \nno special dispensation for you.\n  In the name of trying to create a better environment, we will tax the \nvery inputs that we are encouraging folks to use in order to create a \nbetter environment. It doesn't make sense, Mr. Speaker. Folks use it as \na bumper sticker line. It is a campaign year.\n  That uncertainty has an impact on job creation. That uncertainty has \nan impact on where these funds around the globe go toward trying to \ncreate a better environment for us all--where those funds land, where \nthose jobs are created.\n  Today this House takes a stand. Today this House makes it clear, even \nin an election year, even in the uncertainty of a political season, \neven in this time of conflict on policy, that we can provide some \ncertainty out there for not just the American business community, but \nthe international business community.\n  There is one thing I think that we can all agree on, Mr. Speaker, and \nthat is that America has the most productive workforce the world has \never known. If given a level playing field, there is not a single \nopportunity that we cannot succeed in. If we commit ourselves to it, we \ncan succeed.\n  Lower-paying jobs, cheaper finger jobs are always going to go \noverseas, but the higher-paying jobs, the higher-skilled jobs, the \nenergy-intensive jobs, those jobs can come here.\n  We have an extraordinary disadvantage in this country in that we have \nthe single worst Tax Code in the world. The single worst. If you want \nto create a business, if you want to grow jobs, don't come to America \nis the tag line that the Tax Code suggests. No one punishes \nproductivity more than we do in America. It is nonsense. We can \nabsolutely fix it. The Speaker and our Ways and Means Committee \nchairman, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), are working incredibly \nhard to make that happen.\n  If we go from worst to first in terms of a competitive job code, we \nbring more jobs to this country. But number two, we have an advantage \nthat no one else does, in that we have gone from being worried during \nthe Carter administration that we would exhaust all of our energy \nreserves to having the largest energy reserves this Nation has ever \nknown.\n  If you need to produce a product that requires high energy inputs, I \nchallenge you to find a better location than the United States of \nAmerica. Those jobs are coming here. We have an advantage for job \ncreators here. And what the President would do in his budget is to give \nthat advantage away. And for what? Not because of a coherent energy \npolicy designed to make the world a better place, make the environment \na better environment, and the health of American citizens better, but \nin the name of pursuing an agenda of no fossil fuels--nowhere, nohow.\n\n  I am glad we are down here having this conversation today, Mr. \nSpeaker. It is one that needs to be had. It is one that has been a long \ntime coming. But we have an opportunity today to speak with one voice \nin this body. I hope we will speak with one voice in supporting this \nrule and speak with one voice in supporting the three underlying \nresolutions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am excited to be here today discussing one of these \nresolutions because it really means something when Members of Congress \nsee fit--and I am talking about the Scalise resolution, H. Con. Res. \n89, to say they are against a particular proposal.\n  Quite honestly, this is the first sign of momentum for a carbon tax \ncut. And you will hear me referring to it as a ``carbon tax cut'' \nbecause that is essentially what it is. It is using carbon tax revenues \nto cut taxes for the American people, for American businesses.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  You don't see these kinds of resolutions if a concept and an idea \ndon't have momentum.\n  For instance, my good friend from Georgia (Mr. Woodall) has long been \na champion of a proposal to create a sales tax here in our country, a \nnational sales tax of 19, 20 percent, and he is welcome to talk about \nit on his own time.\n  But I think the gentleman will acknowledge, much to his frustration, \nthat that idea does not seem to be advancing. Now, were it advancing, \nyou might very well see this kind of resolution saying it is not a good \nidea.\n  There are other Republicans who have ideas to raise the tax rates on \nlow-income Americans or Americans that are so low-income they might not \neven be paying a Federal income tax yet. Again, those ideas don't \ngenerally have momentum, so you don't see this kind of resolution \ncoming forward to try to stop it.\n  This is the first real chance that Congress has had to vote, in many \nways, on the merits of a carbon tax cut and, frankly, I think that this \ndiscussion moves us forward, because I fully expect there will be \nbipartisan opposition to this resolution which opposes, presumably, any \nand all carbon tax cuts, because what you see is, the oil and gas lobby \nor, I should say, some segments of the oil and gas lobby because, quite \nfrankly, many international oil and gas industry players actually \nsupport a carbon tax cut as a way of their, therefore, getting around \nthis kind of regulatory uncertainty that they see, like, in fact, the \nozone rules itself. They see it better to simply establish a price for \ncarbon.\n  But let's say, of course, there are also those in the oil and gas \nindustry who oppose this carbon tax cut. They are trying to run a \nstrategy to try to lock people down, where, yes, maybe, 10, 5, 12 \nRepublicans will vote for this, whatever it is; but they want to be \nable to go back and remind Republicans who vote for this now that, in \nthe future, when we are actually moving forward with the carbon tax cut \nproposal, that they were already on the Record in a particular way.\n  That means they are worried, frankly. That is what that means in \n``inside the Beltway speak'' and ``Washington speak.''\n  What does that mean? It means I am excited because I ran for \nCongress, in part, to pass a carbon tax cut.\n  Let me quote some of the many prominent conservatives that have \ncaused this resolution to come forward in many ways because of the \ngreat momentum that a carbon tax cut has.\n  Former Secretary of State George Shultz, Secretary of State under \nRonald Reagan, said: ``A carbon tax, starting small and escalating to a \nsignificant level on a legislated schedule, would do the trick. I would \nmake it revenue-neutral, returning all net funds generated to \ntaxpayers.''\n  That is Former Secretary of State George Shultz.\n  Jerry Taylor, of the Niskanen Center, formerly of the Cato Institute, \nsaid: ``A carbon tax at the levels presently discussed in Washington \nwould not unduly burden the economy, and that's particularly true once \nwe consider the non-climate environmental benefits that would follow \nfrom the tax as well as the benefits of any offsetting tax cuts.''\n  So in a moment you will hear me talk about the many benefits of this \ncarbon tax cut concept. But what Jerry Taylor at the Niskanen Center \nhas rightfully latched onto is the economic stimulus that can actually \nbe generated by lowering taxes on American businesses, on job creators, \non middle-income families as an offset from the carbon tax cut.\n  Peter Van Doren of the Cato Institute says: ``The obvious lesson from \neconomics is to increase fossil fuel prices enough through taxation to \naccount for these effects.''\n  My good friend, and a personal mentor of mine, Dr. Arthur Laffer, \nformer Economic Adviser under President Reagan, said: ``When you add \nthe national security concerns, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels \nbecomes a no-brainer.'' And he has spoken out in support of, again, a \ncarbon tax cut.\n  Greg Mankiw, the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers \nto George Bush, said: ``I will tell the American people that a higher \ntax on gasoline is better at encouraging conservation than are heavy-\nhanded CAFE regulations,'' and ``I will advocate a carbon tax as the \nbest way to control global warming.''\n  So, I mean, what you have is many conservatives, free market \nconservatives lining up to say yes, let's cut\n\n[[Page H3511]]\n\ntaxes and let's do it by passing a carbon tax cut.\n  I have a letter, Mr. Speaker, that I will include in the Record, \nsigned by Niskanen Center, Republican, American Enterprise Institute, R \nStreet Institute, Evangelical Environmental Network in opposition to \nthis resolution by Representative Scalise.\n  In fact, in part, this letter says, which will be available in the \nRecord: ``The least burdensome, most straightforward, and most market-\nfriendly means of addressing climate change is to price the risks \nimposed by greenhouse gas emissions via a tax.''\n\n                                                     June 7, 2016.\n       Dear Representative, Later this week Congress will take up \n     a resolution sponsored by Congressman Scalise (R-LA1) that \n     expresses the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be \n     detrimental to the economy of the United States. We are \n     concerned that this resolution offers a limited perspective \n     on carbon taxes and is blind to the potential benefits of \n     market-based climate policy. Legislation that incorporates a \n     carbon tax could include regulatory and tax reforms to make \n     the United States economy more competitive, innovative, and \n     robust, benefiting both present and future generations.\n       We recognize that a carbon tax, like any tax, will impose \n     economic costs. But climate change is also imposing economic \n     costs. This resolution falls short by recognizing the cost of \n     action without considering the cost of staying on our present \n     policy course. There are, of course, uncertainties about the \n     future cost of climate change and, likewise, the cost \n     associated with a carbon tax (much would depend on program \n     design and the pace and nature of technological progress). \n     The need for action, however, is clear. A recent survey of \n     economists who publish in leading peer-reviewed journals on \n     these matters found that 93% believe that a meaningful policy \n     response to climate change is warranted.\n       The least burdensome, most straightforward, and most \n     market-friendly means of addressing climate change is to \n     price the risks imposed by greenhouse gas emissions via a \n     tax. This would harness price signals, rather than \n     regulations, to guide market response. That is why carbon \n     pricing has the support of free market economists, a majority \n     of the global business community, and a large number of the \n     largest multinational private oil and gas companies in the \n     world (the corporate entities among the most directly \n     affected by climate policy).\n       In reaching a conclusion, this resolution neglects the fact \n     that the United States already has a multiplicity of carbon \n     taxes. They are imposed, however, via dozens of federal and \n     state regulations, are invisible to consumers, unevenly \n     imposed across industrial sectors, unnecessarily costly, and \n     growing in size and scope. The policy choice is not if we \n     should price carbon emissions, but how.\n       Unfortunately, this resolution also fails to differentiate \n     between proposals that would impose carbon taxes on top of \n     existing regulations (chiefly the Obama Administration's \n     Clean Power Plan), and proposals that would impose carbon \n     taxes in place of those existing regulations. Conservatives \n     and free market advocates should embrace the latter, \n     regardless of how they view climate risks.\n       An economy-wide carbon tax that replaces existing \n     regulatory interventions could reduce the cost of climate \n     policy and deregulate the economy. It could also provide \n     revenue to support pro-growth tax reform, including corporate \n     income or payroll tax cuts, which could dramatically reduce \n     overall costs on the economy. Revenues could be applied to \n     compensate those who suffer the most from higher energy \n     costs; the poor, the elderly, and individuals and families \n     living on fixed incomes.\n       Unfortunately, none of those options are presently \n     available because Members of Congress have neglected \n     opportunities to design and debate market-friendly climate \n     policies in legislation. Instead, they have yielded authority \n     in climate policy design to the Executive Branch. By \n     discouraging a long-overdue discussion about sensible carbon \n     pricing, this resolution frustrates the development of better \n     policy.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jerry Taylor,\n       President, Niskanen Center.\n     Bob Inglis,\n       Executive Director, RepublicEn.\n     Aparna Mathur,\n       Resident Scholar, American Enterprise Institute.\n     Eli Lehrer,\n       President, R Street Institute.\n     The Rev. Mitchell C. Hescox,\n       President, Evangelical Environmental Network.\n     Alan Viard,\n       Resident Scholar, American Enterprise Institute.\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Now, let's take this back to basic economics. The Supreme \nCourt itself said something along the lines of: power to tax is the \npower to destroy. That is from an early 19th century case.\n  Whatever you tax, you discourage in the economy. Whatever you don't \ntax, you encourage. So you have to look at what you tax. It's \nimportant.\n  Let's take an example from corporations. We tax corporate profits. \nWell, it turns out corporate profits are a good thing. We tax \nindividual income. It turns out individual income is a good thing.\n  As policymakers, we shouldn't seek to discourage activities that help \npeople earn money or help companies earn money. That is exactly what we \nwant people to do. That is exactly what we want companies to do on \nbehalf of their shareholders and their stakeholders.\n  So why not take something that, regardless of what with you think of \nthe science on climate change--and that is not central to this debate \non a carbon tax cut. So let's even start from the assumption that you \ndon't want to look at the science. You have turned a blind eye to it. \nYou are not at all concerned about climate change, or you don't think \nit is manmade.\n  Let's look, again, at carbon usage in our economy and the negative \nconsequences of it: pollution, meaning air quality--not talking climate \nchange--air quality, increased asthma, increased cancer risk.\n  National security's concerns, reliant on importing it from foreign \ncompanies or, if we are producing it domestically, utilizing a resource \nthat we know will return out in the very best-case scenario. It is a \nperishable resource. Once you take it out of the ground, it is gone.\n  So if we can find a way to say, you know what? We would rather have \nincome. We would rather have Americans of all income levels--whether \nthey are earning $1 million a year, or $20,000 a year--we would rather \nhave them keep more of their hard-earned money. We would rather have \ncompanies keep more of their money to re-invest in job growth here, \nrather than seek elaborate tax shelters overseas, or inversions, where \nthey move their corporate headquarters overseas because we have one of \nthe highest corporate tax rates in the world.\n  The carbon tax cut presents us with the opportunity for pro-growth \neconomic policies that make America more competitive and lets Americans \nkeep more of their hard-earned money.\n  That is what excites so many free-market conservatives and centrists \nabout the concept of a free market, of a carbon tax cut. That is, \nfrankly, why this great momentum, coming from the American Enterprise \nInstitute, from Cato, from R Street, all of this intellectual fuel, \nintellectual fuel for a carbon tax cut, that is why, sensing that, some \nRepublicans--in this case, Mr. Scalise and his cosponsors--have brought \nforward as a response. This kind of thing only happens in Washington \nwhen an idea has momentum.\n  I couldn't have been more excited when I was back home recently to \ntalk to several of my constituents who are strongly dedicated to a \nbipartisan solution on climate change.\n  Former Representative Bob Inglis actually came to my district and met \nwith me, met with some of the leadership folks in my district about how \nwe can do something to act on climate from a Republican perspective. \nAnd I am firmly of the belief that any action has to be bipartisan.\n  Just looking at the way our country is balanced, I mean, certainly, \nif the Democrats were in a position where we had 60 seats in the \nSenate, where we had a majority in the House, where we had the \nPresident, I would certainly encourage us to move forward and implement \nsome kind of carbon tax cut; but, frankly, that is an unlikely \nscenario.\n  It is more likely that a solution will require support from both \nsides of the aisle, so we should be talking about what it takes to get \nthat kind of support. That is the discussion, the national discussion \nthat former Representative Bob Inglis has dedicated himself to and, \nfrankly, it is the fear of that kind of discussion that has led this \nbody to consider this resolution in opposition to a carbon tax cut \nthat, I am proud to say, will likely have bipartisan opposition; \nmeaning, there will be some Republicans, I hope, I expect, who will \nstand up and say, wait a minute. I don't want to go on the\n\n[[Page H3512]]\n\nRecord saying I am against any kind of carbon tax cut because of the \ngreat benefit that this can provide to the American economy.\n  As articulated by Arthur Laffer, as articulated by R Street \nInstitute, we have the ability, with some of that revenue, to really \npass pro-growth tax cuts to offset the income and the revenue from the \ncarbon tax cut.\n  So the carbon tax cut can reduce the income tax for American families \nof all income levels. I should point out, Democrats care that lower-\nincome families spend a higher percentage of their income on fuel, on \nenergy. And we have, in many of the bipartisan concept proposals that \nare out there, tracked tax credits and tax refunds for low-income \nfamilies to make sure that anything we do is not regressive. I think \nthat is a given.\n  I think, obviously, in the same week that the Speaker of the House \nput out his agenda on poverty, I am sure that he, and many others--the \nlast thing they would want to do is burden lower-income Americans with \nany kind of additional tax. So of course we want to take care of that.\n  The good news is that is only a small fraction of the windfall from \nthe carbon tax cut. It also provides sufficient revenue to reduce \ncorporate tax rates currently among the highest in the world. Of all \nthe developed countries, a 35 percent corporate tax rate. The developed \ncountry average is somewhere in the 18, 20 percent range last time I \nchecked. It is one of the reasons that corporations are moving \noverseas. They are not repatriating their earnings because they don't \nwant to pay that American income tax.\n  In a global economy, you have to be competitive. It doesn't mean we \nhave to be the lowest. That is not the value proposition of our \ncountry. We have the rule of law. We have a highly educated workforce, \nbut we have to be competitive.\n  So if we can find a way to reduce that corporate tax rate to 25 \npercent or 20 percent--I applaud the work of Dave Camp, the former Ways \nand Means chair last session, who boldly proposed a 25 percent income \ntax rate. The President of the United States, Barack Obama, has \nproposed a 28 percent corporate income tax rate. So in that range. And \nthat is, by the way, without a carbon tax cut.\n  With a carbon tax cut you can go lower on the corporate income tax. \nYou could run the numbers. You could probably get down to 20 percent. \nMaybe you could get down to 15 percent. It depends how you allocated \nit. But that is one of the things that excites many of the strong free \nmarket advocates of the carbon tax cut.\n  You could also reduce the individual tax burden for families across \nall income levels, after we make darn sure that low-income families are \nnot in any way disproportionately hit. And in no way is this \nregressive. In fact, Democrats' preference would prefer this to be \naccretive for low-income families, and maybe that is something we can \ncome together around. Certainly something that Democrats and \nRepublicans care about are those who live in poverty and making sure \nthat they, too, see the benefits of the windfall from the carbon tax \ncut.\n\n  But, of course, we are also very open--I am, and my Democratic \ncolleagues--to sharing the benefits of the carbon tax cut across the \nentire spectrum of income earners, with a focus, we hope, on the middle \nclass, with a focus, we hope, on those in poverty.\n  But it does provide an opportunity for Republicans who come to the \ntable around climate, around carbon tax cut to say, you know what? Our \npriorities include job creators and others which, of course, we all \ncare about job creators, we all about care about S Corps, we all care \nabout all those things.\n  It is simply a matter of priorities. You have to get the revenues to \nrun the government from somewhere. And, separately, we have the \ndiscussion about what those appropriation levels are, how much we \nspend; we have that discussion.\n  Then we have to, somehow, get so much in taxes. It is a question of \nwhere it is from. And I believe it should be from things that, \nregardless of what you believe on climate, we want to discourage, \nrather than things that we want to encourage.\n  So if we can stop discouraging people from earning money and income, \nstop discouraging corporations from domiciling their earnings here, \nfrom growing, from expanding and, instead, discourage something that, \neven if you throw out the science on climate, is polluting, and runs \nout, and is a national security danger because it forces us to rely on \nother countries, that is something that we should discourage in our \neconomy.\n  So, look, I join George Shultz, Jerry Taylor, Peter Van Doren, Dr. \nArthur Laffer, Greg Mankiw, the American Enterprise Institute, and so \nmany others, in saying: the time is now to have this discussion.\n  I applaud Representative Scalise for initiating this discussion. This \nis the first sign of momentum that this bill has. And the day that this \nbody considers a bill condemning my friend from Georgia's national \nsales tax proposal, I will actually start worrying about it. I will \nactually start saying wait a minute.\n  I have had many discussions with him, and I have to say it does have \nits merits. My issues and concerns with it have been around whether or \nnot we can make it progressive rather than regressive and, of course, \nthe potential for black market transactions when you have that level of \ntaxation. It's a hypothetical discussion at this point.\n  But the day that a resolution comes forth like H.R. 89 around the \nnational sales tax, I will know that that discussion has become a \nserious one. And I couldn't be more proud and excited that the \ndiscussion around a national carbon tax cut has now become a serious \none, a bipartisan one, an inevitable one, one that we will see through \nwith the next President of the United States into law.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, with that level of agreement, I am prepared \nto tell my friend I don't have any speakers remaining, and if he is \nprepared to close, we will get right to the underlying bill and \nexercise that enthusiasm.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I don't have any other speakers, so I will be \nhappy to close.\n  I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am going to address some of the issues in this rule \nand in this bill. This rule, which I oppose, and I also oppose all \nthree underlying bills, contain a number of concepts that aren't going \nto move forward into law, that are put there for political reasons and, \nagain, very excitingly, the first real discussion of a national carbon \ntax cut, because that idea has so much bipartisan momentum from the \nleft and the right.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Many of these ideas are simply recycling old ideas, the same ideas \nthat we have discussed before, that they have complained about before \nthat if somehow they were to make it out of the Senate, the President \nwould veto them, particularly, obviously, one that undoes what the \nPresident wants to do, so we are simply going through the motions on a \nlot of these bills. The most notable one is truly the resolution on a \ncarbon tax cut because what this means is that idea has scared enough \npeople, presumably, who oppose it that it is moving forward in some \nform and some discussion, which is exciting.\n  So let's start with discussing the proposed $10-per-barrel fee on \noil. Now, this is, again, kind of a reaction to something that isn't \nhappening. It is not going to change any current policy. There is no \n$10-per-barrel fee on oil. This is simply about a Chamber saying that \nthey disapprove of something that Obama has said and wants to do.\n  We all agree our country has serious problems with transportation and \ninfrastructure funding. There are many different ways that we can meet \nthe needs to fund those. If people don't like a per-barrel fee on oil, \nthere are plenty of other ways to do it.\n  The real discussion should be about how do we fund transportation?\n  I am a fan of our bipartisan proposal to allow a repatriation window \nfor funds that corporations have income overseas which they have not \nbrought back to our country because they effectively face another tax \nwith that and a one-time window for doing that. We can create a \nnational infrastructure bank to fund infrastructure.\n\n[[Page H3513]]\n\n  There are a lot of great ideas. It is clear--and this will probably \npass--the Republicans don't like a $10-per-barrel tax on oil, and that \nis fine.\n  If you don't like it, what do you like? How do we want to fund \ninfrastructure?\n  This proposal and this concept came from the administration's 2017 \nbudget. Frankly, there are probably a lot of things in the President's \nbudget that my Republican friends don't like. They could probably run a \nresolution every week, they could probably run 10 resolutions every \nweek about things that they don't like in the President's budget, but \nthat is not really a productive use of this Chamber's time. That budget \ndidn't pass. As far as I know, I don't think that budget got a single \nvote.\n  It wasn't put up this year because Republicans haven't even put up \nany budgets for our body. They haven't offered a budget. The last time \nthe Republicans put budgets forward--and I believe the last budget, if \nI am not mistaken, did not contain the $10-per-barrel tax on oil. That \nwas in the President's budget for fiscal year 2017, but the prior one \ndid not receive any votes from Democrats or Republicans.\n  So this vote, at best, is repetitive because already this body has \nrejected the President's last budget. Were the Republicans to bring \nforward the President's budget for 2017, they would likely--again, as \nhas traditionally occurred, as far as I know, throughout history--\noverwhelmingly reject that budget.\n  So, in part, let me be clear, that is because we believe, I believe \nas a Member of Congress, that the budget is a legislative prerogative. \nI don't think there has been a Presidential budget that has been \npassed. In fact, I and, I think, most, if not all, of my Democratic \ncolleagues joined in opposing the President's budget because we had our \nown congressional Democrats' budget. Not only one, there were two or \nthree congressional Democratic budgets, and there were several \nRepublican budgets, but that is a matter of legislative prerogative. \nWe, of course, want to hear ideas from the chief executive, whoever she \nis, but we also want to implement our own budget because it is our \nprerogative as the United States Congress with the power of the purse \nto do that.\n  But considering the fact that Big Oil and Gas get huge tax subsidies \nevery year, I personally believe that this kind of modest oil fee is a \nreasonable way to look at and have in the mix when talking about how to \nfund infrastructure.\n  If there are other ideas--people have talked about vehicle miles \ndriven, people have talked about a number of different ways. There is \nno Republican or Democratic road. We all drive on roads. We all need \nroads. We all need bridges. I know the Republicans in good faith, along \nwith Democrats, know we need to fund our national infrastructure. And \nif you don't like a particular way of doing that, by all means, put \nother ideas on the table. But it isn't productive, and it doesn't move \nanything forward just to take one item from a President's budget that \nyou didn't even allow to have a vote and that very few people support \nand say: We don't like that.\n  I think we knew that before you had the vote. I think we knew you \ndidn't like the President's budget overall. You are welcome to have the \nvote. It isn't going anywhere. It won't pass the Senate. It isn't a \nmatter for actual consideration.\n  Next, we have the sense of Congress on the carbon tax cut. Again, I \ncouldn't be more excited. I have been feeling from my friends on the \nright that there has been more interest in this concept of a carbon tax \ncut. I really see that coming to fruition that it is actually serious \nenough and mainstream enough that those who don't like the concept are \nputting up some kind of proactive defense. So I really think it is a \nmatter of time. I think it is going to be great for our economy that we \ncan cut taxes for American businesses, for job creators, and for middle \nincome. We can make sure it is progressive and doesn't additionally \nburden many of those in poverty. It can be a net benefit to incomes of \nindividuals below the poverty line. I couldn't be more excited about \nthis concept of a carbon tax cut.\n  Frankly, it is the first discussion on the floor of that concept, I \nbelieve, since Republicans have taken control of this body, and I think \nit is a harbinger of many things to come on something that can be great \nand, frankly, supported from across the ideological spectrum to make \nour country more competitive.\n  Finally, I want to move to what is being called the Ozone Standards \nImplementation. Now, this also feels like we have been here before and \ndone that before. It feels a little bit like deja vu because this bill \nessentially repackages a bunch of bills attacking Ozone Standards and \nthe Clean Air Act that we have seen here and voted on over the last \nseveral years.\n  Again, this bill won't pass the Senate. It certainly wouldn't be \nsigned by the President. It is not clear why we are doing it. It seems \nto be filling our time, but I would hope that we have more important \nissues to work on on behalf of the American people. Like, for instance, \nthe public health threat of the Zika virus is one.\n  How about bringing up a bipartisan constitutional amendment that will \nhelp us move towards a balanced budget? How about improving our \nentitlement programs to make sure they are there for the next \ngeneration of Americans? How about passing comprehensive immigration \nreform to restore the order of law and allow 10 million people to come \nout of the shadows and work legally and abide by their responsibilities \nunder American law that we can enforce going forward?\n  I am glad that one of my amendments to the ozone bill was made in \norder. My colleague from Georgia mentioned that. He said he may not \npersonally be supportive of it. I will certainly be making the case for \nmy fourth time and hoping to gain his support, because what my \namendment does is it would close an oil and gas industry loophole to \nthe Clean Air Act's aggregation requirement, which I will be talking \nmore about today.\n\n  Currently, under current law, the oil and gas industry doesn't have \nto aggregate its small air pollution sources, even though cumulatively \nthey release large amounts of air pollutants. Again, what that means in \na district like mine where there are many fracking pads, there is, of \ncourse, an emission profile to each of these, but because they are \nsmall sites, they are not aggregated. We happen to have a county, Weld \nCounty, Colorado, with over 20,000 operating wells. When you get up to \nthat kind of number, you can no longer round down to zero. In the \naggregate, those wells look a lot more like a number of large, \nindustrial plants that otherwise would fall under the Clean Air Act \nthan simply small sites that can be rounded down to zero.\n  I couldn't be more excited to have the opportunity to finally bring \nup my amendment and hopefully adopt it so we can improve the Clean Air \nAct instead of many of the other provisions of the bill which would \neviscerate the Clean Air Act.\n  This is a serious issue. Between 1980 and 2014, emissions of six air \npollutants controlled by the Clean Air Act have dropped by 63 percent. \nThat is good news. We should be doing more, not less, to encourage \nclean air with the long-term savings of the health of the American \npeople as well as a reduction of costly diseases like asthma.\n  A recent peer-reviewed study estimates that the Clean Air Act will \nsave more than 230,000 lives and will prevent millions of cases of \nrespiratory problems. But instead of strengthening that act, the \nprovisions of the bill will delay the implementation of the updated \n2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards by States, a position \nthat is opposed by a broad coalition of scientists and many other \ngroups that care about public health.\n  The connection between air quality and asthma, of which our country \nhas 25 million sufferers, is well established. Clean air is integral to \nquality of life, and the last thing we should do is tear down the \nprotections that allow kids to play outside, and that allow adults to \nrecreate outside and enjoy themselves while continuing to breathe clean \nair.\n  Again, I am not worried about this bill becoming law. It won't pass \nthe Senate, and, obviously, since it undoes some of President Obama's \nactions somehow were it to reach his desk, I am confident that it would \nbe vetoed.\n  The problems go on and on with this bill. I do hope that my amendment \npasses. It is the first opportunity that I have had to bring forward my \nBREATHE Act, which has over 50 cosponsors to actually bring it forward\n\n[[Page H3514]]\n\nfor a vote and a discussion. We haven't been able to get that floor \ntime until now.\n  So, all in all, I think this is an encouraging week. On the one hand, \nwe finally get to discuss a carbon tax cut--how exciting--and also, we \nfinally realize that people are actually worried enough about this \nhappening that they are running some kind of proactive strategy to try \nto lock people down. Wow. This is happening. We are going to have a \ncarbon tax cut sometime in the next few years. This is great.\n  Second, I finally get the BREATHE Act, for it is an amendment to \nclose a loophole for oil and gas in the Clean Air Act. Again, I don't \nexpect that to pass. I hope to have good support, and, of course, I \ncall upon my friends to reject the underlying bills.\n  Instead of continuing the climate-denying work of the majority that \nthese three bills kind of double down on, we should be focusing on \ncreating jobs, tax reform, which, again, a carbon tax cut would allow \nus a foray into cutting taxes for corporations, cutting taxes for \nindividuals. And yet again, instead of focusing on the needs of middle \nclass Americans, instead of focusing on shrinking the deficit, instead \nof focusing on reducing subsidies for oil and gas companies, we are \nfurthering our reliance on legacy, dirty energy systems to power what \nwe hope is an economy of the future. It is the wrong way to go.\n  I encourage Members to look in the mirror, think about the health of \nthemselves, of their children, of their parents, the elderly, and those \nmost at risk and ask about how those bills would impact them. The \nanswer is obvious, and I think that, hopefully, the answer that this \nbody gives to these bills will also be obvious.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up legislation that fully funds the \nadministration's effort to mount a robust and long-term response to the \ngrowing Zika crisis.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and \ndefeat the previous question so we can focus this body on Zika and the \npublic health risk to the American people, to vote ``no'' on the rule, \nto vote ``no'' on the underlying bills, but, frankly, to move forward \nwith the door having been opened for this discussion and this coalition \nbetween left and right on a carbon tax cut proposal. Let's take \nadvantage of that door being opened a crack, and let this be the start \nof something really great and the start of something really special \nthat can help launch the next decade and more of stronger, pro-growth \neconomic policies letting American families keep more of their hard-\nearned income and encouraging American companies to stay put rather \nthan move overseas.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, when you turn on the television, when you open up a \nnewspaper here in the election season, it seems like folks are pretty \nangry. I enjoy coming down to the floor on rules to work with my friend \nfrom Colorado because I genuinely enjoy him. If we are going to get \nanything done across the aisle, I have no doubt that he is going to be \na part of that solution. As you listen to his words down here today, \nyou heard that. Time and time again, there are things we can do \ntogether, there are ways we can be better together. Let's find some \ncommonsense alternatives.\n  Sadly, in an election year like this, oftentimes that is as far as \nthe conversation goes. If you can't fit it on a bumper sticker, you \ndon't have that conversation. You heard the gentleman say--for example, \nwith respect to my own tax bill, H.R. 25, the FairTax, the most widely \ncosponsored fundamental tax reform bill in the entire United States \nCongress, he had favorable things to say. But if you look at any \nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee-run advertisement, they \nskewer the men and women who take a chance on growing the economy with \nthe FairTax. They skewer the men and women who take a chance on \nrepealing the taxes, the most burdensome tax on the 80 percent of \nAmerican working families who have to pay it. In the name of politics, \nfolks don't get past the bumper sticker to the real substance.\n  I listen to my friend from Colorado. He gives me hope. He gives me \nhope that we are going to be able to get over that line, Mr. Speaker. \nBut the truth is, we have to get past the bumper sticker slogan. My \nfriend from Colorado is going to be part of whatever fundamental tax \nreform change is made here. But we ought to be able to agree that just \nadding more taxes to an already broken system--as the President \nproposes--can't possibly be the right answer.\n  My friend is absolutely right that we need to fund American \ninfrastructure, and I would argue the user-fee system is the way to do \nit. Not repatriation, which takes completely unconnected dollars, but \nuser fees which say that, if you are on the roads, you should pay for \nthe roads. But that is a discussion we will have to have.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  This is the right place to have that discussion. We will have that \ndiscussion, and I hope that we will come to a conclusion.\n  My friend says that job creation is job one, but supports complete \nre-regulation of industries which is destroying jobs across this \ncountry. I will give you an example, Mr. Speaker, and it is what is so \nfrustrating to folks back home.\n  Again, Prime Minister Modi stood where you are standing. He spoke for \n1.3 billion people. I only speak for about 700,000. But those 700,000 \nopen up the newspaper when they get into their office on a Monday \nmorning, trying to comply with the National Ambient Air Quality \nStandards, the ozone standards.\n  Those standards, released in 2008, finally got around to having the \nregulations for how to comply with them finalized in March of 2015. I \nwill say that again. This crisis of human health that my friend has \ndescribed, we identified in 2008, and the administration got around to \ntelling folks what the rules were by March of 2015.\n  So all the job creators across the country began to scramble to \ncomply with those rules, Mr. Speaker. And then in October of 2015, the \nadministration says: Oh, no, wait. We have a much better idea. Now \nlet's do ozone compliance, part two.\n  In 2008, we decided we had an issue we wanted to address. In March of \n2015, the administration finally got around to addressing it. As soon \nas folks began to spend the money and the intellectual effort to comply \nwith those rules, by October of that same year, the administration \nsays: Oh, no. We have got a better idea. Scrap that.\n  When my friend reads from all of the conservative economists, the \nlibertarian economists, the folks who care about making sure our \nlimited resources do the most good for the American people and those \nfolks support a carbon tax, they don't support a carbon tax in addition \nto the nonsensical regulatory structure that I have just described. \nThey support a carbon tax instead of that structure.\n  If we monetize harms in this country, we don't have to have a \nbureaucracy that guesses at what the issues are; we don't have to have \na bureaucracy that moves not in a day or a week or a month, but takes \nyears, almost decades, to move in the marketplace. We move quickly, and \nwe maximize. For every dollar that compliance costs, for every dollar \nthat environmental stewardship costs, for every dollar that NG \nexploration costs, we get the maximum return for every American family.\n  I think there is a pathway there. I think there is a pathway there. \nBut understand, more of the same won't get us there. The power to tax \nis the power to destroy. Stop destroying job creation. The power to tax \nis the power to destroy. Stop destroying American corporations and \nmoving them overseas.\n  Golly, we have got opportunity to come together. I believe these \nthree provisions before us, Mr. Speaker, are going to move us in that \ndirection.\n  Make no mistake; our ozone bill that we have before us today makes \nevery amendment from this body in order--\n\n[[Page H3515]]\n\nsave one that was virtually exactly the same as another, and we didn't \nwant to be duplicative here of the Members' time--made every discussion \nin order, including the one from the gentleman from Colorado.\n  The sense of Congress today says we don't need to tax fossil fuels as \nan answer to anything, that taxes are just taxes; and in the absence of \na coherent environmental policy, in the absence of a coherent \nstewardship policy, in the absence of men and women on the ground who \nare balancing the needs of jobs and the needs of community, it is just \na bumper sticker slogan.\n  Let's reject bumper sticker slogans today. Let's take advantage of \nthe serious men and women that serve in this institution, like the \ngentleman from Colorado. Let's get together and do the heavy lifting.\n  Mr. Speaker, if it were easy, they would have done it already. The \nreason you are here, the reason my friend from Colorado is here, and \nthe reason I am here is not to do the easy things; it is to do the hard \nthings.\n  What I have come to know in my 5\\1/2\\ years in this institution is I \nhave not met a man or a woman who is serious about making a difference \nfor the country who wouldn't take their voting card and turn it in \ntomorrow if they could make that kind of lasting difference that would \nserve not just this generation, but generations to come. We have that \nopportunity, Mr. Speaker. It is an election year, but let's not \nsquander it. We can make these next 8 months count for the American \npeople.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support for the rule. I urge support for \nthe underlying resolutions as well, but I urge strong support for the \nrule that will begin this discussion.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n            An Amendment to H. Res. 767 Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     5044) making supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2016 \n     to respond to Zika virus. The first reading of the bill shall \n     be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration \n     of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to \n     the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among \n     and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of \n     the Committee on Appropriations and the chair and ranking \n     minority member of the Committee on the Budget. After general \n     debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the \n     five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in \n     the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of \n     the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report \n     the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been \n     adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without \n     intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or \n     without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and \n     reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then \n     on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately \n     after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of \n     rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 5044.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be \nfollowed by 5-minute votes on adoption of the resolution, if ordered; \nthe motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 3826;

Hice of Georgia in \nthe chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Tonko) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield).\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton), the chairman of the Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, jobs, the economy, and public health all are \nvery critical priorities for the American people. It is possible, in \nfact, to pursue policies that simultaneously protect all three of them. \nToday we have a balanced approach in the Ozone Standards Implementation \nAct, and it does exactly that.\n  Addressing ozone levels has been one of the major successes of the \n1970 Clean Air Act. Across the country, ozone levels, in fact, have \ndeclined dramatically, having declined nearly one-third since 1980. The \nEPA's 2008 ozone standard would have continued that success by setting \nout a program to achieve further reductions for many years to come.\n  But the EPA failed to finalize the implementing regs and guidance for \nthe 2008 rule until just last year, and as a result, States are \ncurrently still in the process of implementing the rule. Although EPA \nhad difficulty finalizing the 2008 regs, the Agency had no such \nproblems coming up with a new ozone standard so unworkable for certain \nareas of the country that even the Agency itself concedes the \ntechnologies to fully implement and to comply still don't exist. And \nnow, States are stuck with the impossible task of applying both \nstandards concurrently.\n  In my district in southwest Michigan, in Allegan County, you could, \nin fact, remove every piece of human activity--roads, barbecues, jobs, \nmove everybody out--and the region still would be in nonattainment \nbecause of the ozone that is generated from Chicago, Milwaukee, and \nGary, Indiana. The new standard would result in potentially hundreds of \ncounties across the Midwest--certainly a good number of them in \nMichigan--that would be designated as nonattainment, resulting in fewer \nnew businesses or expansions of existing ones, and even fewer major \nconstruction and other infrastructure projects.\n  The threat of future nonattainment designation has a chilling effect \nand encourages employers to move someplace else, even out of the United \nStates to relocate abroad. So it is essentially often a kiss of death \nfor economic growth, and it comes at a time when our fragile economy \ncan least afford it.\n  This thoughtful solution, this bill, retains the 2008 standard--yes, \nit does--but it provides additional time for States to comply with the \nnew standard until after the current one has been fully implemented. It \nis common sense. Under this bill, we will have in place a more \nstreamlined and effective schedule to ensure continued improvements in \nair quality in the years ahead.\n  The bill also has a number of sensible provisions to address \npractical implementation challenges that States face under the National \nAmbient Air Quality Standards program. It extends the mandatory review \nprocess from 5 years to a more workable 10, while allowing the EPA \nAdministrator the discretion to review and revise standards earlier if \ncircumstances warrant. It requires that EPA's implementing regs and \nguidance come out along with a new standard so that States and affected \nentities will have the direction that they need to comply.\n  The good news is, under this bill, ozone levels continue their long-\nterm downward trend, and we can accomplish that goal without \njeopardizing jobs.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, here we go again. We should be addressing our failing \ninfrastructure, funding the National Institutes of Health or the \nCenters for Disease Control to control Zika, helping the people of \nFlint who were exposed to lead in the drinking water, investing in \nclean energy, mitigating the risks of climate change, and fulfilling \nour constitutional responsibility to fund our government. Instead of \nattending to the many important challenges we face, we are here to \nconsider yet another bill that will undermine our Clean Air Act.\n  Consideration of this bill is a waste of time. No wonder people \nacross the country are frustrated and disappointed with Washington. We \nare not doing the things that will create opportunities to inspire our \nyoung people and fully employ everyone who wants and needs to work. \nInstead of doing something to improve public health and our \nenvironment, we are trying to undermine those dynamics.\n  H.R. 4775 is a bill that will do nothing to further improve our air \nquality. It offers no assistance to State and local governments. It \noffers no assistance to businesses that want to do the right thing and \nfind ways to improve our environmental and social performance of their \noperations.\n  This bill creates new loopholes through which polluters will add \ntoxic substances to our air and erode the substantial gains we have \nmade in public health under the Clean Air Act.\n  H.R. 4775 has taken many approaches to undermining the Clean Air Act: \nit doubles the NAAQS review cycle from 5 to 10 years, which will \nprevent standards from being set using the most up-to-date science; it \ndelays the implementation of the 2015 ozone NAAQS up to 8 years; and it \nalters the criteria for establishing a NAAQS from one based solely on \nprotecting public health to one that would include considerations of \naffordability and current technical feasibility. These are just a few \namong many harmful changes in this bill.\n  That is why this bill has inspired such opposition. We have received \nletters of opposition signed by more than 130 environmental and public \nhealth organizations as well as a veto threat from the President's \nadministration.\n  There is nothing new here. Once again, we hear the false choice \npresented: jobs or clean air. But that is not the choice, and we have \ndecades of experience with local and Federal policy to regulate air \npollution as proof that we do not have to choose between being employed \nand being healthy.\n\n  This false choice is even more absurd when you consider that there is \none choice we must make every day about 20,000 times to stay alive: the \nchoice to breathe. That is the average number of breaths that each \nadult takes every day of his or her life. Children, whose lungs are \nsmaller average more breaths than that; and if you are exercising, that \nnumber will understandably be higher as well. That is a lot of \nexposure. So it is vitally important that the air we take in some \n20,000 times per day is as clean as possible.\n  Ozone is extremely harmful. We have known this for about 70 years. We \ndid not know the precise chemical nature of ozone back in 1947 when the \nLos Angeles County Board of Supervisors established the Nation's first \nair pollution control program. Back then it was called smog. In the \nmiddle of a heat wave, the smog that formed over L.A. caused people's \neyes to burn and a scraping sensation in their throats. It literally \nbecame painful to breathe.\n  Although Los Angeles has long been recognized as a location with \nspecial challenges in air pollution due to geography and prevailing \nweather patterns, it is not the only city that experienced these \nproblems. They were reported in other industrial cities as well.\n  We have come a long way since that time, but we did not clean up the \nair significantly until we created an enforceable regulatory structure \nthat applied a set of standards to both businesses and individuals.\n  H.R. 4775 undermines the single most important criteria in the Clean \nAir Act: the mandate to set a standard that will allow every one of our \ncitizens, no matter their age or location, to take 20,000 breaths of \nclean, safe air every day. We can certainly afford clean air. In fact, \nwe must afford clean air. We have demonstrated time and time again that \nwe can develop and deploy technologies that will achieve those ends.\n  H.R. 4775 is a dangerous and unnecessary bill, and I oppose the bill. \nI urge my colleagues to reject this latest assault on public health and \nto support the further improvements of air quality for our \nconstituents.\n\n[[Page H3519]]\n\n  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record, for the sake of this dialogue, \nthe over 130 letters of opposition we have received.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n                                                     May 10, 2016.\n       Dear Representative: Clean air is fundamental for good \n     health, and the Clean Air Act promises all Americans air that \n     is safe to breathe. The undersigned public health and medical \n     organizations urge you to oppose H.R. 4775, the so-called \n     ``Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2016.'' Despite the \n     clear scientific evidence of the need for greater protection \n     from ozone pollution, and the Clean Air Act's balanced \n     implementation timeline that provides states clear authority \n     and plenty of time to plan and then work to reduce pollution \n     to meet the updated standard, H.R. 4775 imposes additional \n     delays and sweeping changes that will threaten health, \n     particularly the health of children, seniors and people with \n     chronic disease.\n       In contrast to what the bill's title implies, H.R. 4775 \n     reaches far beyond implementation of the current ozone \n     standards. It also permanently weakens the Clean Air Act and \n     future air pollution health standards for all criteria \n     pollutants. Specifically, H.R. 4775 weakens implementation \n     and enforcement of all lifesaving air pollution health \n     standards including those for carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen \n     dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide. It \n     would also permanently undermine the Clean Air Act as a \n     public health law.\n       The Clean Air Act requires that the Environmental \n     Protection Agency review the science on the health impacts of \n     carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate \n     matter, and sulfur dioxide air pollutants every five years \n     and update these national ambient air quality standards \n     according to the current science. H.R. 4775 would lengthen \n     the review period of the air pollution health standards from \n     once every five years to once every ten years for all \n     criteria pollutants. As the science continues to evolve, EPA \n     and states should have the best and most current data inform \n     air pollution cleanup.\n       New research shows additional impacts that air pollution \n     has on human health. For example, on March 29, 2016, a new \n     study, Particulate Matter Exposure and Preterm Birth: \n     Estimates of U.S. Attributable Burden and Economic Costs, was \n     published that shows particulate air pollution is linked to \n     nearly 16,000 preterm births per year. Under H.R. 4775, EPA \n     would have to wait as much as a decade to consider new \n     evidence when setting standards. Ten years is far too long to \n     wait to protect public health from levels of pollution that \n     the science shows are dangerous or for EPA to consider new \n     information.\n       In the 2015 review of the ozone standard, EPA examined an \n     extensive body of scientific evidence demonstrating that \n     ozone inflames the lungs, causing asthma attacks, resulting \n     in emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and premature \n     deaths. A growing body of research indicates that ozone may \n     also lead to central nervous system harm and may harm \n     developing fetuses. In response to the evidence, EPA updated \n     the ozone standards. While many of our organizations called \n     for a more protective level, there is no doubt that the new \n     70 parts per billion standard provides greater health \n     protections compared to the previous standard.\n       H.R. 4775 would delay implementation of these more \n     protective air pollution standards for at least eight years. \n     This means eight years of illnesses and premature deaths that \n     could have been avoided. Parents will not be told the truth \n     about pollution in their community and states and EPA will \n     not work to curb pollution to meet the new standards. The \n     public has a fundamental right to know when pollution in the \n     air they breathe or the water they drink threatens health, \n     and Congress must not add eight years of delay to health \n     protections and cleanup.\n       H.R. 4775 would also permanently weaken implementation of \n     the 2015 and future ozone standards. It would reduce \n     requirements for areas with the most dangerous levels of \n     ozone. Areas classified as being in ``extreme nonattainment'' \n     of the standard would no longer need to build plans that \n     include additional contingency measures if their initial \n     plans fail to provide the expected pollution reductions. The \n     Clean Air Act prioritizes reducing air pollution to protect \n     the public's health, but H.R. 4775 opens a new opportunity \n     for communities to avoid cleaning up, irrespective of the \n     health impacts.\n       Further, the bill would greatly expand the definition of an \n     exceptional event. Under the Clean Air Act, communities can \n     demonstrate to EPA that an exceptional event--such as a \n     wildfire--should not ``count'' in determining whether their \n     air quality meets the national standards. This bill would \n     recklessly expand the definition of exceptional events to \n     include high pollution days when the air is simply stagnant--\n     the precise air pollution episodes the Clean Air Act was \n     designed to combat--and declare those bad air days as \n     ``exceptional.'' Changing the accounting rules will undermine \n     health protection and avoid pollution cleanup.\n       Additionally, the bill would permanently weaken the Clean \n     Air Act. The Clean Air Act is one of our nation's premier \n     public health laws because it puts health first. The Act has \n     a two-step process: first, EPA considers scientific evidence \n     to decide how much air pollution is safe to breathe and sets \n     the standard that is requisite to protect public health with \n     an adequate margin of safety. Then, states work with EPA to \n     develop a plan to clean up air pollution to meet the \n     standard. Cost and feasibility are fully considered in the \n     second phase during implementation of the standard.\n       This bill states that if EPA finds that ``a range of \n     levels'' of an air pollutant protect public health with an \n     adequate margin of safety, then EPA may consider \n     technological feasibility in choosing a limit within that \n     range. Further, the bill would interject implementation \n     considerations including adverse economic and energy effects \n     into the standard setting process. These changes will \n     permanently weaken the core health-based premise of the Clean \n     Air Act--protecting the public from known health effects of \n     air pollution with a margin of safety.\n       H.R. 4775 is a sweeping attack on lifesaving standards that \n     protect public health from air pollution. This bill is an \n     extreme attempt to undermine our nation's clean air health \n     protections. Not only does it delay the long-overdue updated \n     ozone standards and weaken their implementation and \n     enforcement, it also permanently weakens the health \n     protections against many dangerous air pollutants and the \n     scientific basis of Clean Air Act standards.\n       Please prioritize the health of your constituents and vote \n     NO on H.R. 4775.\n           Sincerely,\n         Allergy & Asthma Network, Alliance of Nurses for Healthy \n           Environments, American Academy of Pediatrics, American \n           College of Preventive Medicine, American Lung \n           Association, American Public Health Association, \n           American Thoracic Society, Asthma and Allergy \n           Foundation of America, Children's Environmental Health \n           Network, Health Care Without Harm, March of Dimes, \n           National Association of County & City Health Officials, \n           National Environmental Health Association, Physicians \n           for Social Responsibility, Public Health Institute, \n           Trust for America's Health.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                         League of\n\n\n                                          Conservation Voters,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2016.\n     Re: Oppose H.R. 4775--Extreme Attack on Smog Protections & \n         the Clean Air Act.\n\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members, \n     the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) works to turn \n     environmental values into national priorities. Each year, LCV \n     publishes the National Environmental Scorecard, which details \n     the voting records of members of Congress on environmental \n     legislation. The Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, \n     concerned voters nationwide, and the media.\n       LCV urges you to vote NO on H.R. 4775, the ``Ozone \n     Standards Implementation Act,'' a radical bill that \n     jeopardizes the health of the American people by undermining \n     the EPA's recently-updated standards for ozone pollution \n     (a.k.a. smog) and eviscerating a central pillar of the Clean \n     Air Act.\n       The Clean Air Act was enacted with strong bipartisan \n     support and is based on the central premise that clean air \n     protections for dangerous pollutants like smog, soot, carbon \n     monoxide, sulfur dioxide and lead be based solely on the \n     best-available health science. The law's drafters structured \n     the law in this manner because Americans deserve to know if \n     their air is safe to breathe or not. For the first time ever, \n     H.R. 4775 would allow the EPA to consider factors unrelated \n     to health, like technical feasibility in the initial standard \n     setting process. States consider feasibility and cost when \n     they implement the standards. This system has worked \n     extremely well since 1970 as air quality has improved \n     dramatically while the economy has grown.\n       The bill would also gut EPA's ozone standards, which were \n     updated last fall. H.R. 4775 would delay these vital health \n     protections by at least ten years and double the law's \n     current five-year review periods for updating ozone and all \n     national air quality standards allowing unhealthy air to \n     persist even longer. High ozone levels pose a significant \n     threat to our health, and are especially dangerous for \n     children, the elderly, and asthmatics.\n       We urge you to REJECT H.R. 4775 and will strongly consider \n     including votes on this bill in the 2016 Scorecard. If you \n     need more information, please call my office and ask to speak \n     with a member of our Government Relations team.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gene Karpinski,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 7, 2016.\n       Dear Senator/Representative: On behalf of our millions of \n     members, the undersigned 118 organizations urge you to oppose \n     the ``Ozone Standards Implementation Act'' (H.R. 4775, S. \n     2882). The innocuous-sounding name is misleading: this \n     legislation would actually systematically weaken the Clean \n     Air Act without a single improvement, undermine Americans' \n     46-year right to healthy air based on medical science, and \n     delay life-saving health standards already years overdue.\n       This bill's vision of ``Ozone Standards Implementation'' \n     eliminates health benefits and the right to truly safe air \n     that Americans enjoy under today's law. First, the \n     legislation would delay for ten years the right\n\n[[Page H3520]]\n\n     to safer air quality, and even the simple right to know if \n     the air is safe to breathe. Corporations applying for air \n     pollution permits would be free to ignore new ground-level \n     ozone (aka smog) health standards during these additional ten \n     years. For the first time the largest sources of air \n     pollution would be allowed to exceed health standards. The \n     bill would also outright excuse the parts of the country \n     suffering the worst smog pollution from having backup plans \n     if they do not reduce pollution. The most polluted parts of \n     the country should not stop doing everything they can to \n     protect their citizens' health and environment by cleaning up \n     smog pollution.\n       This bill is not content to merely weaken and delay \n     reductions in smog pollution. It also strikes at our core \n     right to clean air based on health and medical science. The \n     medically-based health standards that the law has been \n     founded on for 46 years instead could become a political \n     football weakened by polluter compliance costs. This could \n     well result in communities being exposed to unhealthy levels \n     of smog and soot and sulfur dioxide and even toxic lead \n     pollution. The bill would also double the law's five-year \n     review periods for recognizing the latest science and \n     updating health standards, which are already frequently years \n     late; this means in practice that unhealthy air would persist \n     for longer than ten years.\n       The legislation also weakens implementation of current \n     clean air health standards. The bill expands exemptions for \n     ``exceptional events'' that are not counted towards \n     compliance with health standards for air quality, even when \n     air pollution levels are unsafe. This will mean more unsafe \n     air more often, with no responsibility to clean it up. \n     Requirements meant to ensure progress toward reducing smog \n     and soot pollution would shift from focusing on public health \n     and achievability to economic costs. Despite the bland name \n     ``Ozone Standards Implementation Act,'' this bill represents \n     an extreme attack on the most fundamental safeguards and \n     rights in the Clean Air Act.\n       Since 1970, the Federal Clean Air Act has been organized \n     around one governing principle--that the EPA must set health \n     standards based on medical science for dangerous air \n     pollution, including smog, soot and lead, that protect all \n     Americans, with ``an adequate margin of safety'' for \n     vulnerable populations like children, the elderly and \n     asthmatics. This legislation eviscerates that principle and \n     protection. We urge you to oppose H.R. 4775 and S. 2882, to \n     protect our families and Americans' rights to clean air.\n           Sincerely,\n       350KC; 350 Loudoun; Alaska Community Action on Toxics; \n     Alton Area Cluster UCM (United Congregations of Metro-East); \n     Brentwood House California Latino Business Institute; Center \n     for Biological Diversity; Chesapeake Physicians for Social \n     Responsibility; Chicago Physicians for Social Responsibility; \n     Citizens for Clean Air; Clean Air Watch; Clean Water Action; \n     Cleveland Environmental Action Network; Climate Action \n     Alliance of the Valley; Connecticut League of Conservation \n     Voters; Conservation Voters for Idaho; Conservation Voters of \n     South Carolina; Dakota Resource Council; Earth Day Network; \n     Earthjustice.\n       Earthworks; Environment Iowa; Environment America; \n     Environment Arizona; Environment California; Environment \n     Colorado; Environment Connecticut; Environment Florida; \n     Environment Georgia; Environment Illinois; Environment Maine; \n     Environment Maryland; Environment Massachusetts; Environment \n     Michigan; Environment Minnesota; Environment Missouri; \n     Environment Montana; Environment Nevada; Environment New \n     Hampshire; Environment New Jersey.\n       Environment New Mexico; Environment North Carolina; \n     Environment Ohio; Environment Oregon; Environment Rhode \n     Island; Environment Texas; Environment Virginia; Environment \n     Washington; Environmental Defense Action Fund; Environmental \n     Entrepreneurs (E2); Environmental Law & Policy Center; \n     Ethical Society of St. Louis; Faith Alliance for Climate \n     Solutions; Florida Conservation Voters; Fort Collins \n     Sustainability Group; GreenLatinos; Health Care Without Harm; \n     Iowa Interfaith Power & Light; Jean-Michel Cousteau's Ocean \n     Futures Society; KyotoUSA.\n       Labadie Environmental Organization (LEO); Latino Donor \n     Collaborative; League of Conservation Voters; League of Women \n     Voters; Maine Conservation Voters; Maryland League of \n     Conservation Voters; Michigan League of Conservation Voters; \n     Moms Clean Air Force; Montana Conservation Voters Education \n     Fund; Montana Environmental Information Center; National \n     Parks Conservation Association; Natural Resources Defense \n     Council; NC League of Conservation Voters; Nevada \n     Conservation League; New Mexico Environmental Law Center; New \n     York League of Conservation Voters; Northern Plains Resource \n     Council; OEC Action Fund; Ohio Organizing Collaborative, \n     Communities United for Responsible Energy; Oregon League of \n     Conservation Voters.\n       Partnership for Policy Integrity; PennEnvironment; People \n     Demanding Action, Tucson Chapter; Physicians for Social \n     Responsibility; Physicians for Social Responsibility, Maine \n     Chapter; Physicians for Social Responsibility, Los Angeles \n     Chapter; Physicians for Social Responsibility, Arizona \n     Chapter; Physicians for Social Responsibility, SF Bay Area \n     Chapter; Physicians for Social Responsibility, Tennessee \n     Chapter; Physicians for Social Responsibility, Wisconsin \n     Chapter; Powder River Basin Resource Council; Public Citizen; \n     Public Citizen's Texas Office; RVA Interfaith Climate Justice \n     Team; Safe Climate Campaign; San Juan Citizens Alliance; \n     Sierra Club; Southern Environmental Law Center; Sustainable \n     Energy & Economic Development (SEED) Coalition; Texas \n     Campaign for the Environment.\n       Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services; Texas League \n     of Conservation Voters; The Environmental Justice Center at \n     Chestnut Hills United Church; Trust for America's Health; \n     Union of Concerned Scientists; Utah Physicians for a Healthy \n     Environment; Valley Watch; Virginia Organizing; Virginia \n     Interfaith Power & Light; Voces Verdes; Voices for Progress; \n     Washington Conservation Voters; Western Colorado Congress; \n     Western Organization of Resource Councils; Wisconsin \n     Environmental Health Network; Wisconsin League of \n     Conservation Voters; Wisconsin Environment; Wyoming Outdoor \n     Council.\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Olson), the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and \nPower.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chairman, every time I talk about this bipartisan \nbill, I make sure to emphasize one point: I want clean air.\n  I remember Houston in the 1970s. We could not see the downtown \nthrough the smog. We have made a lot of progress since then. The whole \ncountry has made a lot of progress since then. I want that progress to \ncontinue.\n  Despite what some would have you believe, Mr. Chairman, this \nbipartisan bill is not about fundamentally changing the Clean Air Act. \nNothing in this bipartisan bill changes any air quality standard or \nregulation. Nothing in this bipartisan bill puts cost before science \nwhen EPA sets a new standard.\n  This bipartisan bill is about carefully thought-out, commonsense \nreforms. It is about listening to State regulators who actually had to \nmake EPA's rules work for the people.\n  The people I work for back home are full of common sense. Common \nsense says that EPA should put out guidance to follow a new rule at the \nsame time they put out the rule.\n  Folks in Texas 22 and across America are puzzled. What is wrong with \nEPA putting out a complete package of rules and regulations together \ninstead of a rule first followed by regulations 7 years later? That is \nnot common sense. That is a road to failure, a road we are going down \nright now.\n  As Dr. Bryan Shaw, the top regulator for air quality in my home State \nof Texas, said, provisions in this bipartisan bill will ``allow States \nto focus their limited resources'' to implement EPA's previous ozone \nrule. We can continue to improve Texas air--and the air of every \nState--if we let our regulators do their jobs.\n  I carefully wrote this bipartisan bill to include more common sense. \nLet EPA consider achievability when issuing a new rule. This is not a \nmandate.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  I ask my opponents to read this bipartisan bill. Read the language. \nIt clearly says the EPA may consider achievability when they set a new \nstandard. This provision will never allow EPA to set an unhealthy \nstandard. They can't use cost to ignore science.\n  Let's bring common sense to the EPA and work together to help States \nimprove air quality. Vote for this bill.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Castor).\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his \nleadership on energy and clean air policy for all of America.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4775. The Republican \nbill is a radical attempt to gut the Clean Air Act.\n  The Clean Air Act has been one of our bedrock environmental laws for \nAmerica since the 1970s. So for 50 years it has worked well to ensure \nthat it protects our health while businesses thrive. It has made such a \ndifference in our lives.\n  I heard my good friend from Houston say he has seen the air cleaned \nup. The same is true in the Sunshine State of Florida. I remember those \nsmoggy days in the late sixties and early seventies. I watched the \nimpact of the Clean Air Act make it healthier for us to breathe, to \ngrow up, to live healthy lives. All you have to do is look across the \nglobe at China and India and the struggles they have with their economy \nbecause they are not able to control their pollution.\n\n[[Page H3521]]\n\n  The great thing about the Clean Air Act is that it is based on \nscience. It requires the EPA every 5 years to bring scientists together \nand do a health check, do a check on the air quality standards all \nacross America. Then they can--they are not required to--say: we are \ngoing to improve the air quality standards. And then they leave it up \nto States and stakeholders at home to determine how best to control air \npollution. It has been extraordinarily effective at cleaning the air.\n  EPA has set air quality standards for six different pollutants: \nozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, lead, and \nparticulate matter. Between 1980 and 2014, emissions of these six air \npollutants dropped by 63 percent. During the same period, the Nation's \ngross domestic product increased by 147 percent, vehicle miles traveled \nincreased by 97 percent, energy consumption increased by 26 percent, \nand the U.S. population increased by 41 percent. These emissions \nreductions have generated dramatic health effects. There is a balance \nin the law already.\n  A recent peer-reviewed study says the Clean Air Act will save more \nthan 230,000 lives and will prevent millions of cases of respiratory \nproblems like asthma and other problems in 2020 alone. It will also \nenhance our national productivity by preventing 17 million lost \nworkdays. These public health benefits translate into $2 trillion in \nmonetized benefits to the economy.\n  Again, from the Sunshine State's perspective, we have a booming \ntourist economy largely because we have clean water and clear air. \nEveryone wants to come to Florida. They are very discerning with their \ntourist dollars and where they are going to take a vacation. They look \nacross the world, and one of the reasons people travel to America or \nyou travel to the Sunshine State is because it is healthy and clean; \nand it is largely because of the Clean Air Act that we have been able \nto do that.\n  So this bill is irresponsible because it will take us backwards. And \nlet's talk a few specifics. The bill dramatically delays implementation \nof the 2015 ozone air quality standards by up to 8 years. It says to \nAmerica: we are going to ignore the science, we are going to ignore the \nnew standards that have been developed with thousands and thousands of \ncomments, and we are going to ignore the fact that these improved \nstandards will net benefits of up to $4.6 billion in 2025 alone.\n  Second, the bill doubles the air quality standard review period for \nall criteria air pollutants to every 10 years. Currently, the Clean Air \nAct says: EPA, every 5 years, look at the best science. Now, this bill \nsays to ignore the science. Again, we will wait 10 years.\n  That is not smart and that is not helpful to our communities and our \nneighbors back home.\n  The bill also gives new and expanded facilities amnesty from new air \nquality standards. And this is where I think my Republican friends are \ngoing to invite a lot of litigation.\n  Before I came to Congress, I did a little bit of environmental law. \nCurrent existing industrial users and businesses will have to bear the \nburden because the new polluters will get a break--they will get \namnesty--while our existing businesses will have to make up the \ndifference. That is not smart, and I think that is going to create a \nlot of lawsuits.\n  Prime Minister Narendra Modi from India was here today. One of his \nmessages, besides what a great democracy America is and what a great \ndemocracy India is, is that we have to think about the future. And we \ncan tap the American ingenuity and what we have already done to clean \nair and grow business at the same time.\n  Other nations are realizing now what we have learned long ago: \nunregulated emission of dangerous air pollutants is unsustainable. The \nClean Air Act has helped us make dramatic improvements in air quality \nover the past decades. Our economy has grown at the same time.\n  So I would urge my colleagues, do not gut the Clean Air Act. Vote \n``no'' on H.R. 4775.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding and for his efforts on this very important legislation.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 4775, the Ozone Standards \nImplementation Act of 2016, so States will have the flexibility and \ntools to reasonably and effectively meet the new EPA ozone standards.\n  Since the proposal of EPA's 2008 ozone standards, States have \ncontinually worked to implement air quality standards to comply with \nEPA's clean air requirements. However, EPA's implementation regulations \nfor the 2008 standards were not published until March 6, 2015, and then \nthe revised ozone standards were issued in October of 2015.\n  States now face the prospect of simultaneously implementing two ozone \nstandards at the same time. H.R. 4775 remedies this problem by creating \na phase-in approach to the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards, extending the \nfinal designations under the 2015 standards to 2025.\n  It would also make reforms to the National Ambient Air Quality \nStandards to provide flexibility and structure to actions taken to \nimplementing and revising these standards. States should be given the \nflexibility to implement air quality standards in a way that is cost \neffective and efficient.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson) for introducing \nthis bill. I also encourage my colleagues to support this legislation \nto ensure States are able to implement EPA ozone standards without \nharming their overall economy.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chair, H.R. 4775 would fundamentally and permanently weaken the \nClean Air Act as well as future air pollution health standards for all \ncriteria pollutants.\n\n  Mr. Chair, H.R. 4775 would unacceptably delay implementation of the \nEPA's 2015 ozone standards for another 8 years, even though these \nstandards haven't been updated since the Bush administration last did \nso in the year 2008.\n  Additionally, Mr. Chair, this bill would also mandate that the EPA \nwait a decade before considering any new evidence regarding the health \nimplications from ozone and other harmful pollutants, despite what the \nscience may say in the interval.\n  This drastic change to the Clean Air Act would prohibit the EPA from \nrelying on the most current health-based scientific data when \ndetermining air pollutant standards.\n  Mr. Chair, H.R. 4775 would also fundamentally change provisions of \nthe Clean Air Act by imposing cost and technological feasibility \nconsiderations on the standard-setting process, even though the Clean \nAir Act clearly states that only medical and public health data should \nbe used when setting clean air health standards.\n  Mr. Chair, this radical change to the Nation's most historically \nimportant environmental law will lead to adverse consequences for both \nthe public health and the resourcefulness of American companies and \ninnovators.\n  As the EPA's Acting Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and \nRadiation, Janet McCabe, noted in her recent testimony to the Energy \nand Power Subcommittee at a hearing entitled ``H.R. 4775, Ozone \nStandards Implementation Act'' just earlier this year in April: \n``Despite repeated assertions that achieving clean air was just not \nfeasible, American ingenuity has consistently risen to the challenge \nand made our country the leader in both clean air and clean air \ntechnology.\n  ``That approach,'' she went on to say, ``has been very successful for \nboth the health of Americans and our economy.''\n  Mr. Chair, what is missing in the arguments made by the majority \nagainst the Clean Air Act, as well as most other environmental \nprotection laws, is the fact that these regulations have been \nextraordinarily beneficial not only to the American health, but also to \nthe American economy.\n  In almost every instance, Mr. Chair, whenever a new environmental \nregulation has been proposed, we have heard opponents label them as job \nkillers, overly burdensome, harmful to the economy, the end of the \nAmerican way of life as we know it. In practically every instance, \nthose dire predictions have been proven to be unequivocally wrong, as \nthese laws, Mr. Chair, have served to protect the public health as\n\n[[Page H3522]]\n\nwell as to spur new advances in technology and in services that we can \nthen export overseas.\n  Mr. Chairman, undoubtedly, today's fight over the new ozone standard \nwill follow this very same pattern. Instead of trying to stall the 2015 \nozone standards and prohibit the EPA from regularly updating the \nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards, as H.R. 4775 would do, we in \nthis Congress should be heeding the warnings of doctors and scientists \nof not acting quickly enough to protect the public health.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this awful bill, and I urge all of my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta), who is a member of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee, a cosponsor of this legislation, and a gentleman \nfocused on energy issues.\n  Mr. LATTA. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 4775, the Ozone \nStandards Implementation Act, of which I am a proud sponsor.\n  I would like to focus, in particular, on what this bill really does \nfor the timeline of implementing ozone standards. H.R. 4775 focuses on \nefficient implementation of ozone and other air quality requirements by \nmaking commonsense adjustments to facilitate how air quality standards \nare implemented, based on practical experience.\n  Our legislation provides States with additional time to implement the \n2015 standards which is needed to fully implement the 2008 ozone \nstandards, since EPA only issued the implementing regulations in 2015.\n  Further, H.R. 4775 allows EPA time to develop the new implementing \nregulations and guidance needed for the 2015 standards, and also allows \nEPA to clear its existing backlog of hundreds of implementation plans \nrelating to other existing standards.\n  Clean air remains our priority, and this legislation does not change \nthe recent new ozone standard of 70 parts per billion. It does not \nchange of the standards set by the agency for any other criteria \npollutants.\n  Instead, it ensures that hundreds of counties are not unnecessarily \nsubjected to additional regulatory burdens, paperwork requirements, and \nrestrictions.\n  EPA projects that, based on 2012-2014 data, over 240 counties with \nozone monitors would violate the 2015 standards, but they are already \non track to meet those standards by 2025. It makes no sense to sweep \nthese counties into unnecessarily burdensome ``nonattainment'' \nregulatory regimes.\n  EPA has estimated compliance costs for 2008 beginning in 2020 of $7.6 \nbillion to $8.8 billion annually. On top of these costs, EPA estimates \ncompliance costs for the 2015 standards beginning in 2025, of $2 \nbillion annually, including $1.4 billion outside California, and $800 \nmillion in California.\n  However, EPA's own estimate may be too low, since they have admitted \nthat in some places, most of or even all of the technology that will be \nneeded to meet this rule has yet to be invented.\n  What this legislation postpones is the diversion of State resources \nfrom the most pressing challenges to meet a standard that EPA projects \nwill be met anyway through measures already on the books.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge support of H.R. 4775.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time is remaining on \nboth sides?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky has 20 minutes remaining. The \ngentleman from Illinois has 13\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores), who is a member of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee and, I believe, a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Whitfield for allowing me \nto speak on behalf of this bill.\n  As a coauthor of H.R. 4775, I rise to strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bipartisan Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2016.\n  Since 1980, our economy has more than tripled in growth, while ozone \nlevels have gone down by 33 percent. The EPA predicts that ozone levels \nwill continue to improve, particularly as the 75 parts per billion \nstandard is fully implemented.\n  Most importantly, the EPA states: ``The vast majority of U.S. \ncounties will meet the 70 parts per billion standard by 2025 just with \nthe rules and programs now in place or underway.''\n  In March of 2015, the EPA released its implementation regulations on \nthe delayed 2008 ozone standard of 75 percent per billion. Last \nOctober, just 7 months later, the EPA moved the goal posts with a new \nozone standard of 70 parts per billion.\n  Our States and communities now face the burden of spending scarce \ntaxpayer resources to implement two different ozone standards at the \nsame time.\n  So what does this mean? It means that even though the EPA admits that \nair quality will improve, our States and counties now face a premature \nnonattainment designation, significantly limiting new job creation \nopportunities.\n  Additional bureaucratic processes and unnecessary red tape will do \nnothing to protect public health; however, they will export jobs to \ncountries like China with fewer regulations, while those countries send \nus their ozone emissions in return.\n  H.R. 4775 includes a key harmonization provision from H.R. 4000, the \nbipartisan legislation I introduced last November.\n  Section 2 of today's bill gives communities the needed time to meet \nthe 70 parts per billion standard through 2025. It protects these areas \nfrom being subjected to unnecessary additional regulatory burdens and \nred tape, as these areas are already on track for compliance with both \nstandards.\n  We have also heard from our State regulators that the current 5-year \nreview cycle timeline for National Ambient Air Quality Standards is \noverly ambitious and not attainable. This is proven by the fact that, \nsince 1971, the EPA has taken an average of 10\\1/2\\ years to review the \nstandard for ozone, not 5, as is currently in effect.\n  Another provision I authored, section 3(a), modernizes the Clean Air \nAct by matching the mandatory review cycle with the actual timeline of \nprevious EPA reviews; in other words, 10 years between reviews. This is \na reasonable timeline in light of the Nation's dramatically improved \nair quality over the last three decades.\n  Protecting both public health and the economy are bipartisan goals we \nall share, and the two are not mutually exclusive.\n  I would like to thank Mr. Olson, Mr. Cuellar, Mr. Latta, Whip \nScalise, and Leader McCarthy for their work on this important issue. I \nwould also like to thank Chairman Upton and Chairman Whitfield for \ntheir efforts in shepherding this bill through the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. Chairman, I strongly disagree with my friend from Texas.\n  The proposed changes to the NAAQS review cycle would put lives at \nrisk by permanently delaying updates to limits on not just ozone, but \non every dangerous criteria air pollutant: carbon monoxide, lead, \nnitrogen oxides, ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review the \nscience every 5 years and to update the standards when necessary to \nprotect the public health.\n  It is important to note that the EPA isn't required to update the \nNAAQS every 5 years, but to just review the science.\n  The 2015 ozone standard, Mr. Chairman, reflects strong scientific \nevidence regarding the harmful effects of ozone on human health and the \nenvironment; including more than 1,000 new studies.\n  Scientists, Mr. Chairman, are constantly researching the impacts that \nair pollution have on human health, and have consistently discovered \nthat ozone, particle pollutants, and other types of air pollution \ncovered by the Clean Air Act are, indeed, harmful in more ways and at \nlower concentration than previously understood.\n  Mr. Chairman, this bill would ignore all this scientific work and \nevidence by\n\n[[Page H3523]]\n\ndoubling the review period from 5 years to 10 years, delaying the \nreview of science and potentially necessary updates to the standard.\n  Mr. Chairman, 10 years is too long to wait to protect public health \nfrom levels of ozone, particle pollution, and other pollutants that the \nscience shows are, indeed, very, very, very dangerous.\n  Delaying the EPA's review of the best medical science won't make \noutdated air pollution levels safe.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Hultgren). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself another 15 seconds.\n  Delaying EPA's review of the best medical science won't make outdated \nair pollution levels safe, it will just lead to more Americans \nsuffering from unhealthy air for longer periods of time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber).\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. \n4775, the Ozone Standards Implementation Act, which I have cosponsored. \nI want to thank Congressman Olson, my good friend and fellow Texan, for \nintroducing this important legislation.\n  Last year, Mr. Chairman, the EPA finalized a costly new regulation to \nreduce ozone levels, even as States are only now beginning to implement \nthe 2008 ozone standard. States will now have to deal with two \nregulations with overlapping implementation schedules. This is Federal \nbureaucracy at its finest, Mr. Chairman.\n  Now that the EPA is moving full steam ahead on its regulatory freight \ntrain, in order to get States back on track, Congress must act to give \nthem certainty. H.R. 4775 will phase in implementation of those ozone \nstandards over a reasonable timeline.\n  As ozone continues to fall to levels that reflect naturally occurring \nand even foreign-source ozone, we must also insist that the EPA report \non how foreign pollution affects compliance with its overburdensome \nregulations. This legislation will do just that, Mr. Chairman.\n  There is no denying that the EPA's regulations will be costly for the \nStates and costly, in turn, for our economy. The lower ozone levels are \nmandated, the harder it is for economic development to occur. That's \njust the way it is, as Ted Poe would say.\n  Communities across the country will be harmed, and low-income \nfamilies, Mr. Chairman, are going to be harmed the most from this \noverburdensome regulation.\n  It is perfectly reasonable for Congress to insist that this \nregulatory boondoggle is reined in. I urge all Members to support this \nimportant legislation. It is the right thing to do. You know I am \nright.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is left?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois has 10\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Kentucky has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 7 minutes to an extraordinary \ngentleman from the great State of New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), our fine \nleader on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the ranking member of our \nsubcommittee for his kind remarks.\n  Once again, the House is considering a bill to undermine one of our \nmost successful public health and environmental laws, the Clean Air \nAct. And clean air isn't a luxury, it is a necessity.\n  Before the Clean Air Act became law 43 years ago, thousands of \nAmericans experienced the consequences of unhealthy air, respiratory \ndisease, severe asthma attacks, and premature deaths. This landmark \nlegislation, for the first time, ensured that hazardous air pollution \nwould be controlled.\n  But in spite of the overwhelming evidence of the success of this law \nand its many vital public health benefits, the Clean Air Act continues \nto be a favorite target for my Republican colleagues. This bill, H.R. \n4775, is, unfortunately, the latest in an ongoing attempt to undermine \nthe progress we have made on cleaning the air and protecting public \nhealth.\n  The bill's sponsors claim their goal is to help States to implement \nthe National Ambient Air Quality Standards set by the EPA, yet this \nbill fails to provide the one thing that would be most helpful to \nStates in their efforts to implement air quality standards, and that is \nadditional resources.\n  In fact, Chairman Whitfield will be offering an amendment to the bill \nto ensure that EPA receives no additional funding to implement the \nprovisions of this legislation, or any of the requirements under \nexisting law.\n  H.R. 4775 is not a package of minor changes to minor provisions of \nthe Clean Air Act. These changes are radical revisions intended to roll \nback the progress we have made in public health. This bill alters the \nfundamental premise of the act, that standards should be set to ensure \nthe air is safe and healthy to breathe.\n  H.R. 4775 would bring economic costs, technological feasibility, and \nother non-risk factors into the standard-setting process.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  These things are important, to be sure, and that is why they are \nalready considered when the States develop their plans to achieve the \nhealth-based standards set by EPA, and that is appropriate. They \nshould, however, never come into play in setting these standards.\n  Let's just use technology as an example. Technology is always \nevolving. What is technologically feasible today does not define what \nis possible tomorrow. For example, air pollution from automobile \nemissions was recognized as a serious problem in southern California as \nearly as 1959. At that time, there were no pollution-control devices \nfor cars. Auto manufacturers said that it couldn't be done, the \ntechnology was impossible, and that even if it were possible, it would \nbe far too expensive. But California passed laws requiring pollution \ncontrol anyway.\n  We all know the rest of the story: it was not impossible or \nprohibitively expensive. People still bought cars. And we have cleaner, \nmore efficient cars today because regulation pushed technology forward. \nThe only reason to make technological feasibility a factor in setting \nthe standard is to avoid setting the standard, and that is the goal of \nthe supporters of this legislation.\n  The history of the Clean Air Act is one of great success: the economy \nhas continued to grow; the air has gotten cleaner; and most \nimportantly, public health has improved.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, my Republican colleagues refuse to accept the fact \nthat we can continue to improve the air, have a vibrant economy, and \ngive everyone the opportunity for a long and healthy life. So I urge my \ncolleagues to reject the false choice between jobs and clean air. The \nfact is that we can have both.\n  H.R. 4775 is a dangerous bill, and I would urge my colleagues to vote \n``no'' on increased ozone pollution.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, we have no further speakers on our side \nof the aisle except for myself, and I think I have the right to close. \nI don't know if the gentleman from Illinois has additional speakers or \nif he would like to go at this time.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, supporters of this bill claim that EPA doesn't issue \nimplementation rules and guidance quickly enough after updating a \nnational ambient air quality standard. So this awful piece of \nlegislation concludes that the solution is to sacrifice Americans' \nhealth--sacrifice our public health--by allowing facilities to ignore \nnew air quality standards. But, Mr. Chairman, this would only allow \nthese same facilities to pollute more while doing nothing to facilitate \nfaster implementation of new NAAQS.\n  The bill says that EPA must release implementing rules and guidance \nconcurrently with a new standard, meaning, if EPA updates a national \nambient air quality standard, that standard does not apply to new or \nexpanding facilities unless and until EPA has issued implementation \nrules and guidance for the new standard.\n  Mr. Chairman, witnesses have testified that concurrent guidance isn't \nalways practical or even necessary. This provision presumes a problem \nthat does not even exist. The Agency provides a wealth of tools \nalready, Mr. Chairman, to assist States with air permits, and in many \ncases, States are fully capable of issuing permits without any new\n\n[[Page H3524]]\n\nguidance from EPA. Mr. Chairman, they have been doing this same thing \nfor decades now.\n  Most guidance evolves after a standard takes effect as States and \nindustry raise questions that require EPA clarification. It is unclear, \nMr. Chairman, how the Agency could provide guidance on solving problems \nbefore they even know what those problems are.\n  Mr. Chairman, you are talking about a catch-22, and this creates an \nepic catch-22 for the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  On the one hand, the EPA could hurry to issue guidance before hearing \nquestions from States and industry. That guidance would necessarily be \nincomplete, as it won't even address issues that only emerge during the \nimplementation process. An industry group, Mr. Chairman, that wanted to \ndelay implementation of the new air quality standard could file a \nlawsuit saying that EPA's guidance wasn't sufficient.\n  On the other hand, EPA could wait to issue more robust and helpful \nguidance, but in the meantime, facilities would be able to obtain \npermits under the old air quality standard. A company, Mr. Chairman, \ncould build a facility that is allowed to pollute more than it would \nunder current law.\n  In both scenarios, Mr. Chairman, who wins? Not the American people. \nWho wins? The polluter wins, and our public health loses.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank our fellow legislators from the other \nside of the aisle for working with us on this legislation. One of the \ngreat things about the House of Representatives is we have the \nopportunity to come and talk on different sides of the issues. We can \nhave different opinions, we can talk about it, disagree, and then try \nto move forward.\n  Now, some of the speakers today, when we discussed this legislation, \nH.R. 4775, have described it as irresponsible, as a radical action to \ngut the Clean Air Act, to fundamentally weaken the Clean Air Act, and \nto undermine the Clean Air Act. I would say that that absolutely is not \nour intent.\n  I think all of us living in America understand that we do, in this \ncountry, more than any other country in the world, work to ensure clean \nair for our constituents and our citizens. We don't have to take a \nbackseat to anyone to make that statement.\n  I might say that the criteria of pollutants, the six of them, the \nemissions have been reduced by a total of 63 percent--making up the \nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards has been reduced by 63 percent, \nthose emissions--since 1980.\n  So we are committed to clean air. But many people do not realize \nthat, today, 24 States, counties in 24 States and the District of \nColumbia do not even meet the requirement of the 2008 Ambient Air \nQuality Standards, which is 75 parts per billion. And we know that even \nthough that standard was set in 2008, EPA did not come forth with the \nguidelines to help the States meet that standard until 2015--7 years \nlater.\n  Now they have come out with a new standard in 2015 saying that States \nmust meet that in 2017. This legislation is brought to the floor in \nresponse to concerns by entities and individuals responsible in the \nStates for implementing the Federal standards set by the Federal EPA, \nso that is why we are here.\n  So what are we doing in this legislation? Let me just point out that \nI mentioned the 24 States, counties in 24 States and the District of \nColumbia are in noncompliance with the 2008 standard. Los Angeles is \nnever going to be in compliance. San Joaquin Valley is probably never \ngoing to be in compliance, and many parts of the West are never going \nto be in compliance because of their geographical location and because \nof foreign emissions coming in from other countries.\n  If you are in noncompliance, it has a drastic impact on your ability \nto create jobs and to bring in new industry because it is much more \ndifficult to get a permit. So these over 270 counties in these 24 \nStates at a time when our job growth is stagnant are going to find it \neven more difficult to create jobs.\n  Poverty also has a tremendous impact on people's health. Yes, we want \nclean air, but we want jobs so people can provide health care for their \nfamilies and their children. So we need a balancing act here, and that \nis what this legislation is designed to do.\n  Under existing law, EPA at the Federal level must, they are mandated \nto review the national air quality standard every 5 years. They can do \nit in 2 if they want to, or 3, but they must do it in 5. So, because we \nare now trying to implement the 2008 and the 2015 all at the same time \nin certain areas, all we are saying is, instead of mandating EPA to do \nit every 5, we mandate them to do it every 10. They can do it in 4 if \nthey want to, or 3 or 2, but they must do it in 10. So is that \nirresponsible? Is that trying to gut the Clean Air Act?\n  What are some other things we are doing here? We are also saying that \nwe are authorizing--we are not mandating, but we are authorizing--the \nEPA Administrator to consider that technology is available to meet the \nnew standard--not that it is required to, but it is authorized to. Is \nthat unreasonable? Is that trying to gut the Clean Air Act?\n  Then we are also saying, before EPA revises its National Ambient Air \nQuality Standards, that they must get the advice of the Agency's \nindependent scientific advisory committee. Now they do that, but we are \nsaying we also want you to do it to look at potential adverse effects \nrelating to implementing a new standard as required by section 109 of \nthe Clean Air Act.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  So you have got this advisory body already there. We want you to talk \nto them and at least consider any adverse effects that may come from \nthe new standard.\n  And we also are saying--we have talked about this a lot already--if \nyou issue a new standard, at the same time give the States the \nimplementation and guidance so they know what to do to meet the new \nstandard instead of being 7 years late, as they were on the 2008 \nstandard.\n  And then we want to ensure that for certain ozone and particulate \nmatter nonattainment areas--and I have already talked about the \nnonattainment areas of the 2008--that we do not require the States to \ninclude an economically infeasible measure to meet it. In other words, \nif it is going to be self-defeating, if it is going to be economically \ninfeasible, you are in a nonattainment area, you don't have to do that.\n  And then we want to ensure that States may seek relief with respect \nto certain exceptional events. For example, there are some areas of the \ncountry that are having their worst drought since the early 1800s, \nhundred-year droughts, and yet they can't get relief from EPA because \nof these exceptional events; and because of that, they are going to \nsuffer in trying to bring in new jobs that create economic growth.\n  And then, finally--and this makes a lot of sense to me--I want to \nquote a statement that was made by a regulator from Utah. He said that \ninternational emissions and transports, dirty pollution and air coming \nfrom outside America can, at times, account for up to 85 percent of the \n8-hour ambient ozone concentration in many Western States.\n  Many areas in the West have little chance of identifying sufficient \ncontrols to achieve attainment because they are not causing it. So we \nare simply saying to EPA: Do a study so that we know what is being \ncaused by other countries. That is what this bill is all about.\n  I might say that we are doing this after we had four forums on the \nClean Air Act, we had four hearings on the National Ambient Air Quality \nStandards and ozone. These suggestions were made not by Republican \nlegislators per se, but by regulators responsible for meeting EPA \nstandards back in their States. They came and said: Would you help us \nwith this?\n  So that is what we are attempting to do.\n  It is not our intent to gut the Clean Air Act. We recognize how \nimportant it is. The importance of health care and clean air is a part \nof what America is all about.\n  I urge our Members to pass this legislation. It is a commonsense \napproach to address concerns raised by people with the responsibility \nof meeting the standards required by the Federal EPA.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H3525]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to \nH.R. 4775, the Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2016.\n  Protecting our air from dirty pollution should not be a partisan \nissue. We all want to breathe clean air. We all want our children to be \nable to play outside without risking an asthma attack due to high ozone \nlevels.\n  Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized new ozone \nrules designed to protect the health of all Americans, particularly \nthose communities which are at higher risk for smog. H.R. 4775 would \ndelay this rule and critically undermine the Clean Air Act, \njeopardizing Americans' health.\n  In my home state of California, smog used to be so bad that people \nwere not allowed to go outside. We have made a lot of progress since \nthen, and the last smog alert in California occurred in 1997. H.R. 4775 \nrepresents a step backward in our nation's fight for cleaner air, and I \nurge my colleagues to vote.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, the Ozone issue is extremely \ncomplicated.\n  Many of our Members are probably not very familiar with the National \nAmbient Air Quality Standard, let alone the potential impact.\n  In 1993, the Environmental Protection Agency faced a choice similar \nto that of 2016.\n  After missing the 1988 and 1992 Ozone NAAQS review deadlines, the EPA \nsettled a court decree that required a decision on whether the Agency \nwould promulgate a new Ozone standard.\n  The EPA stated the following:\n  ``Based on applicable statutory requirements and the volume of \nmaterial requiring careful evaluation, the EPA estimates that it would \ntake 2 to 3 years to incorporate over a 1,000 new health studies into \ncriteria documents.\n  Given various legal constraints and the fact that EPA already missed \ndeadlines for completion of Ozone review cycles, the Administrator \nconcluded that the best course of action is to complete the current \nreview based on the existing air standard and proceed as rapidly as \npossible with the next review.''\n  In 2015, the Administrator stated at the Energy and Power \nsubcommittee hearing, ``EPA examined thousands of scientific studies, \nincluding more than 1,000 new studies published since EPA last revised \nthe standard.''\n  Further, EPA, in the Ozone NAAQS proposal concluded, ``there are \nsignificant uncertainties regarding some of the studies the EPA did \ninclude regarding lowering the standard.''\n  EPA acknowledged there are issues with the proposed standard stating, \n``Given alternative views of the currently available evidence and \ninformation expressed by some commenters, the EPA is taking comment on \nboth the Administrator's proposed decision to revise the current \nprimary O3 standard and the option of retaining that standard.''\n  EPA must address the challenges and opportunities for improving our \nair quality and protecting human health. The process must remain \nhealth-based but cannot be set aside when it is politically convenient.\n  Our industries are capable of meeting the requirements of Ozone NAAQS \nbut not when the rules are changed or not enforced due to unknown \ncriteria.\n  I support the EPA's determination but I do think there is opportunity \nto address some of the challenges faced by both the Agency and other \nstakeholders.\n  While I do not support the bill today, I look for opportunities to \nimprove the process to promote the economy and public health.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose \nof amendment under the 5-minute rule the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute recommended by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, printed \nin the bill.

Each such amendment may be offered only in the order \nprinted in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be \nconsidered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the \nreport, equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an \nopponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject \nto a demand for division of the question.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Whitfield\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 \nprinted in House Report 114-607.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 5. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.\n\n       No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to \n     carry out the requirements of this Act and the amendments \n     made by this Act. Such requirements shall be carried out \n     using amounts otherwise authorized.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 4775, as I said, requires the EPA \nto develop two studies and reports to submit to Congress. I talked \nabout that in my closing statement. My amendment is relating to those \nstudies.\n  The first is a study of the impacts of foreign emissions on the \nability of States in America to meet new ozone standards. The second \nstudy relates to ozone formation and the effective control strategies \nfor that.\n  These studies will assist EPA and State regulators in better \nunderstanding background ozone and implementing ozone standards. In its \nestimate for H.R. 4775--as you know, we must always consider cost--the \nCongressional Budget Office estimated a cost of $2 million associated \nwith the development of these studies.\n  My amendment would clarify that no additional funds are authorized by \nthis legislation. Developing the studies required by this bill is part \nof EPA's job and can be covered by the Agency's existing budget.\n  I might point out that the President's clean energy plan, which was \nimplemented by EPA, never passed the House of Representatives, never \npassed the U.S. Senate, and was never even considered by the United \nStates Congress. Yet, EPA issued that clean energy plan without any \nadditional appropriations. I can tell you, it cost millions of dollars \nto do it.\n  This small amount to come up to reprogram funding within EPA to \nrequire these studies I do not believe is much of a burden on EPA. \nEPA's budget for regulatory activity is over $2 billion annually. These \nare analyses EPA should have already been undertaking as part of its \nexisting responsibilities.\n  This amendment simply says we are not appropriating additional money. \nEPA can reprogram some of the $2 billion that it already has to develop\n\n[[Page H3527]]\n\nthese studies and provide useful information to the States and other \nagencies.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, the Congressional Budget Office identified an \nadditional $2 million that will be needed to conduct the duplicative \nstudy required by this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, that is the reason we are actually seeing this \namendment. It is a Republican classic trick. It is a trick, Mr. \nChairman. My colleague from Kentucky--who I respect and honor \ntremendously--knows that although this bill will require additional \nresources to implement, this amendment ensures that no new resources \nwill be provided. It is a trick, Mr. Chairman.\n  My Republican colleagues have voted time and time again to cut the \nEPA's budget, but that just places greater burdens on States since \nabout one-third of EPA's budget is distributed to the States in grants \nand other types of assistance. They will say on the other side that the \ngoal is efficiency and that EPA must learn to do more with less. But, \nMr. Chairman--another part of the trick--their real goal is to have EPA \ndo less, rather than more with less. They just want them to do even \nless.\n  Well, Mr. Chairman, that just removes the environmental cop from the \nbeat. Polluters benefit, but our constituents don't benefit. And, \nultimately, Mr. Chairman, all of us Americans will pay the enormous \nprice.\n  Much of the permitting and much of the preparation of implementation \nplans done under the Clean Air Act is done by the States. One of the \ncomplaints that we have heard is that EPA is not providing sufficient \nguidance early enough in the process to assist States in meeting their \nobligations under the law, and that States want and need assistance.\n  Well, Mr. Chairman, this amendment doesn't do anything to address \nthat concern. In fact, it will only make a dire situation even more \ndire. The public expects EPA to protect their health and the \nenvironment. Resources, Mr. Chairman, are required to fulfill that \nexpectation and that mandate.\n  Public health is worth paying for. It is much more cost effective to \nprevent health problems than it is to cure those very same problems. \nAnd make no mistake, the Clean Air Act is, indeed, a public health law. \nWe save billions and billions of dollars in medical expenses due to \nasthma-related emergency room visits and other respiratory and cardiac \nillness. We save billions and billions in lost sick time at work, \nschool, and other productive activities. And, most important, Mr. \nChairman, let us not forget that the Clean Air Act saves lives. We \nenable people to be healthier and more productive.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson).\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment. It is real simple. \nThis says to the EPA: Do your job. Do your job.\n  EPA admits half of the ozone in America comes from ``uncontrolled \nsources,'' ``uncontrolled sources.'' That means sources we can't \ncontrol. Sources like ozone from China, like ozone in my home State \nfrom Mexico, like ozone coming from annual crop burnings, like ozone \ncoming across the Atlantic from Sub-Saharan Africa sandstorms, like \nozone coming from all over the world.\n  This past Christmas, my wife and I went to the Grand Canyon--\nbeautiful. It has an ozone problem. They have a sign there that says:\n\n       Most of the Grand Canyon air pollutants come from distant \n     sources ignoring human boundaries.\n\n  All this amendment says is: EPA, do your job. Do the research to find \nout where this is coming from and don't penalize Americans for \nsomething they can't control.\n  I support this amendment.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kentucky \nwill be postponed.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Rush\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in House Report 114-607.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 7, lines 24 and 25, strike ``If the Administrator \n     fails'' and insert the following:\n       ``(A) Standard not applicable.--Except as provided in \n     subparagraph (B), if the Administrator fails\n       Page 8, after line 8, add the following:\n       ``(B) Standard applicable.--Subparagraph (A) shall not \n     apply with respect to review and disposition of a \n     preconstruction permit application by a Federal, State, \n     local, or tribal permitting authority if such authority \n     determines that application of such subparagraph is likely \n     to--\n       ``(i) increase air pollution that harms human health and \n     the environment;\n       ``(ii) slow issuance of final preconstruction permits;\n       ``(iii) increase regulatory uncertainty;\n       ``(iv) foster additional litigation;\n       ``(v) shift the burden of pollution control from new \n     sources to existing sources of pollution, including small \n     businesses; or\n       ``(vi) increase the overall cost of achieving the new or \n     revised national ambient air quality standard in the \n     applicable area.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the gentleman \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Rush) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chair, my list of concerns with H.R. 4775 are many, but \none of the main issues I have with this legislation is that it would \npermanently weaken the Clean Air Act as well as future air pollution \nhealth standards for all criteria pollutants.\n  In fact, Mr. Chair, in addition to delaying scientifically based \nhealth standards and harming the public interest, this bill may also \nhave unintended consequences for the very industries that the majority \nis trying to help. If enacted, this bill may actually slow down the \nissuance of preconstruction permits, increase regulatory uncertainty, \nlead to additional lawsuits, and shift the burden of pollution control \nfrom new sources to existing ones, potentially hurting small \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. Chair, section 3(d) requires the EPA to issue rules and guidance \nfor implementing new or revised National Ambient Air Quality Standards \n``concurrently'' when issuing the new standard. Otherwise, under this \nlegislation, expanding facilities would only have to comply with the \noutdated standards, allowing some facilities to pollute more than their \nfair share. This bill, Mr. Chair, would also unfairly shift the burden \nand the cost of cleaning up pollution to existing facilities, and it \nwould only serve to slow down the preconstruction permitting process.\n  My amendment, Mr. Chair, seeks to address many of the problems that \nmay result from this bill, both intentionally and unintentionally. The \nRush amendment would strike the section that exempts preconstruction \npermit applications from complying with new or revised National Ambient \nAir Quality Standards if guidelines are not published concurrently with \nthose regulations.\n  Specifically, the amendment simply states that section 3(d) shall not \napply with respect to the review and disposition of a preconstruction \npermit application by a Federal, State, local, or tribal permitting \nauthority if such authority determines that the application of such \nsubparagraph is likely to increase air pollution that harms human \nhealth and the environment; to slow the issuance of final \npreconstruction permits; to increase regulatory uncertainty; to foster \nadditional litigation; to shift the burden of pollution control from \nnew sources to existing sources of pollution, including small \nbusinesses; or to increase the\n\n[[Page H3528]]\n\noverall cost of achieving the new or revised National Ambient Air \nQuality Standard in the applicable area.\n  Mr. Chair, the new standard that the EPA recently issued already \nrepresents a measured approach that seeks to balance both public health \nimpacts as well as the rule's overall cost benefit, even though this is \nnot a requirement of the Clean Air Act. On the other hand, Mr. Chair, \nH.R. 4775 represents the exact opposite of a measured approach as it \nseeks to tip the scales in favor of industry over public health.\n  Mr. Chair, this amendment will help to prevent some of the adverse \nconsequences of this bill from going into effect whether they be \nintended or unintended, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chair, the intent of this bill is to end the nightmare \nscenario we are going through right now by which the EPA issues \nregulations 7 years after it announces a new rule, and it piles on a \nnew regulation 6 months later. But don't take my word with regard to \nthe problems that it causes in America; listen to the States.\n  Teresa Marks, Arkansas' Department of Environmental Quality, July 31, \n2012:\n\n       Five years may not allow enough time for new technology or \n     science to be fully developed. With more time between review \n     processes, the States could have adequate time to develop \n     proper SIPs and meet Federal deadlines.\n\n  Martha Rudolph, Colorado's Department of Public Health and \nEnvironment, July 23, 2012:\n\n       This ambitious schedule for evaluating and promulgating \n     NAAQS revisions every 5 years has created an inefficient \n     planning process.\n\n  I saved the best for last.\n  Michael Krancer, Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental \nProtection, November 29, 2012:\n\n       The development of the NAAQS on an interval of 5 years, \n     section 109(d)(1), has created significant resource burdens \n     for both the EPA and the States. Furthermore, the cascading \n     standards can create confusion for the public actions \n     because, as the State's EPA continues to work on SIP \n     revisions and the determination of attainment for one \n     standard with the ozone, the air quality index is based on \n     another. NAAQS review intervals should be lengthened to 10 \n     years.\n\n  Section 3(d) of this bill provides that a new rule or a revised \nstandard shall not apply to pending permit applications until the \nAgency has published regulations and guidance about how to implement \nthe new standards in the permitting process.\n  If a State, local, or tribal permitting authority wants to impose \nmore stringent standards with respect to a particular preconstruction \npermit application, nothing in H.R. 4775 prevents it from doing so. \nThis amendment allows the EPA to escape its responsibility for issuing \ntimely guidance. We should ensure the EPA has to take timely action. I \nurge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Pallone\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in House Report 114-607.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 6, strike lines 9 through 20, strike subsection (b) \n     (relating to consideration of technological feasiblity) and \n     redesignate the subsequent subsections accordingly.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, my amendment is straightforward, and it fixes \none of the most egregious provisions in the bill: the consideration of \ntechnological feasibility in the NAAQS-setting process. The bill's \napproach would make feasibility a factor in the scientific decision \nabout how much pollution is safe for a child to breathe without \nexperiencing an asthma attack.\n  Requiring the EPA to consider technological feasibility when setting \nan air quality standard is a dangerous precedent that ignores the \nhistory of the Clean Air Act. Frankly, it is not even necessary. Since \n1970, the Clean Air Act has had several key features that have helped \nmake it one of the most successful environmental laws in our country. \nThe law's science-based, health-protective standards keep our eye on \nthe prize, which is healthy air for everyone. Cooperative federalism \nallows the EPA to set the clean air goals and States to then decide how \nbest to achieve them.\n  The Clean Air Act uses regulatory standards, like the National \nAmbient Air Quality Standards, to drive technological innovation in \npollution controls. The act recognizes that it is usually less costly \nto simply dump pollution rather than to clean it up, so businesses \ngenerally don't control pollution absent regulatory requirements.\n  We know from decades of experience that the Clean Air Act drives \ninnovations in pollution controls that then become the industry \nstandard. Once an air pollution standard is in place, industry gets to \nwork to meet it, and, along the way, we develop more effective and less \nexpensive pollution control technologies. Not only is our air cleaner, \nbut we also export tens of millions of dollars of pollution control \nequipment all over the world. We have seen that happen over and over \nagain.\n  Mr. Chair, section 3(b) ignores this fact and rejects an approach \nthat has been successful for over four decades; so my amendment would \nrestore current law, preserving the NAAQS as purely health-based \nstandards and leaving the consideration of costs and feasibility to the \nStates. If you truly believe that this bill is not an attack on the \nClean Air Act and its critical public health protection, then \nsupporting my amendment should not be a problem.\n  In closing, almost every time the EPA proposes a significant new \nrequirement, opponents tell us it can't be done, that it is going to \ncost too much, or that it will destroy our economy. The Republicans are \nonce again raising the false specter of job losses and high economic \ncosts to try to block the implementation of stronger ozone standards. \nThese doomsday claims about the costs of clean air are nothing new. The \nhistory of the Clean Air Act is a history of exaggerated claims by \nindustry that have never come true.\n  Section 3(b) is just the latest in a string of reckless legislative \nattacks on these purely health-based air quality standards, which could \nunravel the entire framework of the Clean Air Act. It ignores decades \nof experience in cleaning up air pollution, and it is an extreme and, \nin my opinion, irresponsible proposal that would put the health of all \nAmericans at risk. I urge the adoption of my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chair, for the Members who are thinking about voting \nfor this amendment, I will simply say: Read the bill.\n  Section 3(b) states that, if the EPA Administrator, in consultation \nwith the EPA's independent scientific advisory committee, finds a range \nof levels of air quality that protect public health with an adequate \nmargin of safety, then--and only then--``the Administrator may consider \nas secondary consideration likely technological feasibility in \nestablishing and revising the national primary ambient air quality \nstandard for this pollutant.''\n  It reads ``may,'' not ``must,'' not ``shall''--but ``may.''\n  H.R. 4775 does not change the Clean Air Act's requirement that \nstandards be based on public health. This is a clarification for future \nadministrations that Congress considers technical feasibility to be a \nreasonable part of the decisionmaking process when policy\n\n[[Page H3529]]\n\nchoices must be made among a range of scientifically valid options.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I have listened to what the gentleman has said. It seems to me that \nhe is essentially making an argument as to why we don't need this \nchange. If he is saying that the underlying bill--the current law, the \ncurrent statute--allows for the consideration of technological \nfeasibility and if we know that the Clean Air Act has essentially \nworked in protecting the environment and in putting health as a \npriority with these other issues as simply being something that can be \nconsidered and, as I said, is considered when the States actually \ndecide how to carry out the law, then I do not understand why he finds \nit necessary to change the law, say, with regard to this issue.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  It seems to me that the argument you are making, which is that this \nis already something that can be considered but is not a priority--\nhealth being the priority--would negate the very need for the \nlegislation and support the amendment that I am putting forward.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 \nprinted in House Report 114-607.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 13, line 1, after ``rural areas,'' insert ``including \n     during wildfires,''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense \namendment that will ensure that the study on ozone formation in the \nunderlying bill analyzes the relative contribution from wildfires.\n  The National Interagency Coordination Center reported this year that \nwe set a new record in terms of total acreage burned from wildfires \nwith more than 10.1 million acres going up in smoke. This significant \nincrease is not the result of more wildfires, as the nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service reported last month that ``the number of \nwildfires has stayed about the same over the last 30 years, but the \nnumber of acres burned annually has increased by nearly double the \nacreage burned in the 1990s.''\n  Timber removal is down 80 percent over the last 30 years and acreage \nhas burned up. There is a direct correlation between thinning our \nforest and overall forest health. As a medical professional for over 25 \nyears, I know firsthand that preventive care is a much cheaper and \neffective treatment as opposed to dealing with an illness or disease \nafter it has already been diagnosed. Let's not forget the old adage \nthat an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Government has failed to employ such a \nstrategy when it comes to our Nation's forests and continues to spend \nbillions of dollars on the back end of suppression activities.\n  The CRS reports that the top 5 years with the largest wildfire \nacreage burned since 1960 all occurred between 2006 and 2015. In \nArizona, we have seen the tragic results of this agency's \nmisprioritization firsthand, as the five largest fires in Arizona's \nhistory occurred between 2002 and 2011.\n  Data released from NASA a few years ago concluded that one \ncatastrophic wildfire can emit more carbon emissions in a few days than \ntotal vehicle emissions in an entire State over the course of a year.\n  My commonsense amendment simply seeks to determine the overall \ncontribution to ozone formation from wildfires. We should all want to \nhave this information and know the extent to which ozone formation from \nwildfire emissions occurs.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the underlying bill and applaud \nRepresentative Olson, Chairman Upton, and my other colleagues who are \nactively involved with moving this much-needed legislation forward.\n  Most States are just beginning to adopt the 2008 ozone standards as \nthe EPA didn't announce the implementation guidance and a final rule \nuntil March 6, 2015. Rather than allowing time for those standards to \nbe implemented, the EPA moved the goalposts and is seeking to \nunilaterally implement a regulation that has been projected to be the \nmost expensive mandate in our Nation's history.\n  The Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry recently reported that \n``the EPA's new ozone standard of 70 parts per billion will be \nvirtually impossible for Arizona to meet due to Arizona's high levels \nof background, limited local sources, and unique geography'' and that \n``implementation of the current rule in Arizona is not reasonable, \nbased in sound science, or achievable.''\n  Again, my amendment simply ensures that the study on ozone formation \nin the underlying bill analyzes the relative contribution from \nwildfires. Chairman Upton supports my amendment, and I wholeheartedly \nsupport the underlying bill.\n  I ask my colleagues to do the same and support my amendment and H.R. \n4775.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, on its face, Mr. Gosar's amendment seems \ninnocuous enough, having EPA also consider the contribution of \nwildfires in the bill's required study on ozone formation, wintertime \nozone formation, and control strategies. But in reality, this study is \na wolf in sheep's clothing. So adding further criteria, as this \namendment would do, only makes it worse.\n  First, many of the aspects of this proposed study are already covered \nby EPA's integrated science assessment. Integrated science assessments \nare reports that represent concise evaluations and synthesis of the \nmost policy-relevant science for reviewing National Ambient Air Quality \nStandards. Essentially, these assessments form the scientific \nfoundation for the review of the NAAQ Standards. All integrated science \nassessments are vetted through a rigorous peer-review process, \nincluding review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee and \npublic comment periods.\n  Furthermore, the EPA is already doing a comprehensive review of \nwildfires and ozone, so additional study of this issue is not \nnecessary, in my opinion.\n  But this study is more than a duplication of work already being done, \nMr. Chairman. The bill would inject costs into this scientific review \nprocess by requiring the assessment of cost-effective control \nstrategies to reduce ozone. While this is certainly worthy as an issue \nto review, EPA's scientific assessments are the wrong venue for such a \ndiscussion.\n  Requiring EPA to do additional assessments of cost-effective control \nstrategies would, of course, pull the Agency's limited staff and \nresources away from the public health priorities of implementing and \nreviewing the NAAQ Standards in a timely manner outlined in the Clean \nAir Act. When viewed in connection with the other provisions of this \nbill, like the requirement that implementing regulations and guidance \nmust be issued concurrently with an air quality standard for \npreconstruction permits, expanding this study would only serve to \nfurther delay implementation of the 2015 ozone standard.\n  The 2015 ozone NAAQS update is long overdue, and the bill before us \ndoesn't need any further procedural hoops for\n\n[[Page H3530]]\n\nEPA to jump through before a more protective ozone standard can be put \ninto effect.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, once again, this three-word amendment simply \nensures that the study on ozone formation in the underlying bill \nanalyzes the relative contribution from wildfires. Just simply that.\n  This is something that I would hope would be analyzed anyway under \nthe language in the underlying bill, but I felt the need to clarify so \nas to ensure such analysis occurs.\n  Data released from NASA a few years ago concluded that one \ncatastrophic wildfire can emit more carbon emissions in a few days than \ntotal vehicle emissions in an entire State over the course of a year. \nWe should all want to have this information and know the extent to \nwhich ozone formation from wildfire emissions occurs. The science is \nscience, the whole science, nothing less, nothing more.\n  I ask everybody to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in House Report 114-607.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       After section 3, insert the following sections:\n\n     SEC. 4. REPEAL OF EXEMPTION FOR AGGREGATION OF EMISSIONS FROM \n                   OIL AND GAS SOURCES.\n\n       Section 112(n) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(n)) is \n     amended by striking paragraph (4).\n\n     SEC. 5. HYDROGEN SULFIDE AS A HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANT.\n\n       The Administrator shall--\n       (1) not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, issue a final rule adding hydrogen sulfide to the \n     list of hazardous air pollutants under section 112(b) of the \n     Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(b)); and\n       (2) not later than 365 days after a final rule under \n     paragraph (1) is issued, revise the list under section 112(c) \n     of such Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(c)) to include categories and \n     subcategories of major sources and area sources of hydrogen \n     sulfide, including oil and gas wells.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Polis) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, since this bill is supposed to be about \nmaking the Clean Air Act work better, I have offered an amendment--that \nis identical to a bill with 64 cosponsors that I coauthored--to close a \nvery glaring loophole in the law that frankly harms the air in my \nState, across the Mountain West, and indeed across the country.\n  My amendment, which is based off legislation I first introduced in \n2011 and have introduced three times, including this Congress, is \ncalled the BREATHE Act. Essentially it is very simple. It would close \nthe oil and gas industry's loophole to the Clean Air Act's aggregation \nrequirement. Currently, oil and gas operators are exempt from the \naggregation requirements in the Clean Air Act.\n  What the aggregation requirement does, it is small air pollution \nsources that cumulatively release as much air pollution as a major \nsource, are supposed to be required to curb pollution by installing the \nmaximum achievable control technology. But oil and gas is exempt, not \nfor any policy reason, but simply because oil and gas has a lot of \ninfluence here in Washington, D.C.\n  This directly affects the air quality in my district. Take a county \nlike Weld County, Colorado. There are over 20,000 operating fracking \nwells. Any one of those has a very small emissions profile. But in the \naggregate, when you start talking about 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, it looks \na lot more like multiple emissions-spewing factories or other highly \npollutive activity. And yet they are completely exempt from being \naggregated.\n  So essentially, they are rounded to down to zero, each one of them, \nwhich is fine if there is one or three or five of them. But if you have \n20,000 of them, it is a gross abuse of the intent of the Clean Air Act \nto round it down to zero.\n  My amendment would also add hydrogen sulfide to the Clean Air Act's \nFederal list of hazardous air pollutants. It was originally on the \nlist. Unfortunately, it was later removed.\n  The Clean Air Act currently exempts hydrogen sulfide from the Federal \nlist of hazardous air pollutants, even though it is well-documented \nthat hydrogen sulfide has been associated with a wide range of health \nissues, such as nausea, vomiting, headaches, irritation of eyes, nose, \nthroat, and asthma.\n  Often, it is released from wellheads, pumps, and piping during the \nseparation process, from storage tanks, and from flaring. In fact, 15 \npercent to 25 percent of the natural gas wells in the U.S. emit \nhydrogen sulfide, even though, I would point out, control technologies \nare inexpensive and readily available to curb hydrogen sulfide \nemissions. All we ask is that those are looked at as part of that.\n  My amendment has broad support with 64 Members that have added their \nnames as cosponsors. I am grateful this was allowed under the bill.\n  My amendment will simply hold oil and gas operators accountable for \ntheir impact on our Nation's air quality, as every industry should be. \nThey shouldn't play by special rules. They should play by the same \nrules under the Clean Air Act as every industry.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman, we all have a great deal of respect for \nthe gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis) and know that he focuses on \nthese particular issues and is quite familiar with them.\n  The reason that we are opposing this amendment is that his amendment \nwould make changes to section 112 of the Clean Air Act by adding, \nspecifically, hydrogen sulfide as a hazardous air pollutant.\n  Now, there is a well-established regulatory process for listing new \nhazardous air pollutants set forth in the Clean Air Act, section 112.\n  The underlying legislation, H.R. 4775, really is dealing only with \nsections 107 to 110 and part C and D of title I of the Clean Air Act. \nAnd we are not doing anything with section 112, nor have we had any \nhearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee on adding hydrogen \nsulfide as a hazardous air pollutant. On the other hand, we have had \nfour hearings about ambient air quality standards. We have had four \nforums on the Clear Air Act relating to ambient air quality standards.\n  So for that reason, the fact that there is an established way to add, \nwe would respectfully oppose this amendment and ask the other Members \nto oppose it at this time. We would welcome the opportunity to work \nwith Mr. Polis in letting the Energy and Commerce Committee do it in a \nregular manner.\n  I oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pallone).\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I urge support for the Polis amendment. It \nis common sense, and it certainly improves the bill in the way that Mr. \nPolis set forth.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  So again, with great respect to the gentleman from Kentucky, this is \nthe first opportunity we have had since I first introduced the bill in \n2011 where the Clean Air Act has been brought to the floor and opened \nand allowed to have this amendment and discussion. I personally would \nhave been thrilled if we would have been able to have a hearing in the \nintervening years. Of course, should this not prevail, I would be happy \nto continue to work to pursue a hearing in this area.\n  Because frankly, again, when you have 20,000 wells in a limited area, \nyou can't round each one down to zero. Separately, we have the issue of \nhydrogen sulfide. Both are very important issues.\n\n[[Page H3531]]\n\nOf course, we want to further the discussion.\n  I personally am thrilled again on behalf of the 64 Members that are \nalready cosponsors of this bill that at least we have the time to \ndebate this on the floor in a way that it is germane to a bill that we \nare considering in opening up the Clean Air Act.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Certainly I am appreciative of the process the committee has in \nplace. Again, should this not prevail, I would be happy to continue to \nwork with the committee to help deal with these small-site aggregations \nin a way where they are no longer rounded down to zero if, in fact, \nthey are found scientifically to have a tangible cumulative effect, \njust like we have the aggregation of every other type of industrial \nactivity except for those that are particular to oil and gas.\n  I would encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill to simply \nmake sure that oil and gas operators play by the same rules with regard \nto their impact on air quality as any other industry, as well as adding \nhydrogen sulfide to the list of hazardous air pollutants and listing, \nof course, oil and gas wells as one of the major sources of hydrogen \nsulfide, as they certainly are in my neck of the woods.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 6 Offered by Ms. Norton\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in House Report 114-607.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 5. LIMITATION.\n\n       If the Administrator, in consultation with the Clean Air \n     Scientific Advisory Committee, finds that application of any \n     provision of this Act could harm human health or the \n     environment, this Act and the amendments made thereby shall \n     cease to apply.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the gentlewoman \nfrom the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) and a Member opposed each \nwill control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment to the Ozone Standards \nImplementation Act of 2016 that would ensure that the environment and \nhuman health aspects are protected. The amendment states that if the \nEPA Administrator, in consultation with the Clean Air Scientific \nAdvisory Committee, finds that application of any provision of this act \ncould harm human health or the environment, the Ozone Standards \nImplementation Act shall cease to apply.\n  The Ozone Standards Implementation Act puts our children, \ncommunities, and environment at extreme risk simply to benefit private \ncorporations rather than to look at what the act could do to people. It \nweakens implementation and enforcement of the Clean Air Act's essential \nair pollution health standards, further delays reductions in smog \npollution, and expands the very definition of ``exceptional events'' to \ninclude high pollution days when communities exclude certain extreme \nevents, like wildfires, in determining whether their air quality meets \nnational standards. The bill also takes health and medical science out \nof the process.\n  My amendment ensures that we will fulfill the purpose of the Clean \nAir Act and continue the progress we have made over the past 46 years. \nOne fact pointed out by the Statement of Administration Policy is that \nthe ``emissions of key pollutants have decreased by nearly 70 percent \nwhile the economy has tripled in size.'' This proves that we can both \nimprove the environment and still grow our domestic economy.\n  Right now, just to cite my own district as an example, 17,000 \nchildren in the District of Columbia have pediatric asthma and over \n115,000 children and teens in the District are at risk of health \nimplications from smog. Our health and future depend on the Clean Air \nAct, but the Ozone Standards Implementation Act will put us right back \nwhere we were before 1970.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chairman, since 1980, ozone levels have decreased by \n33 percent, and EPA projects air quality ``will continue to improve \nover the next decade as additional reductions in ozone precursors from \npower plants, motor vehicles, and other sources are realized.''\n  Nothing in this bill changes any existing air quality standards or \nprevents these improvements to air quality from being realized.\n  This amendment, however, would allow the EPA, in consultation with \nCASAC, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, to invalidate the \nentire bill. Why we would give CASAC this power is beyond me because \nthey haven't done a good job with ozone.\n  Under the Clean Air Act, CASAC is required to provide advice to the \nAgency about the potential adverse effects of implementing new air \nquality standards. Section 109(d)(2)(C)(iv) expressly requires CASAC to \n``advise the Administrator of any adverse public health, welfare, \nsocial, economic, or energy effects which may result from various \nstrategies for attainment and maintenance of such national ambient air \nquality standards.'' Despite this provision, CASAC has not provided \nthat advice.\n  In May of 2015, the Government Accountability Office issued a report \nindicating that CASAC has never provided that advice because EPA has \nnever requested that advice, and that EPA has no plans to ask CASAC to \nprovide advice on potential adverse effects. In a recent survey, 80 \npercent of State air agencies said that such advice would be helpful to \ntheir agency.\n  H.R. 4775 will ensure that such advice is provided and also ensure \nthat States have the time and regulatory tools they need to comply with \nnew ozone rules and other air quality standards.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, part of the problem is, perhaps, that EPA \nhas never requested this particular advice from CASAC. My amendment \nwould make it clear that Congress wants the EPA to do so. Yes, I made \nclear that there had been improvements in air quality, despite the fact \nthat our own industry, our own economic growth has tripled. Would \nanybody say that we are now where we want to be?\n  We do not want, at this point of progress, to countermand the \nprogress we have made. We should be building on that progress. No one, \nI think, in the world today--and certainly in the United States--would \nsay we have finally reached where we want to be. The improvements are \nnot nearly enough. We need to go much more rapidly. We certainly don't \nneed to be retrograde at this point in history when the whole world now \nis looking at this very issue and seeking to improve.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chairman, I will offer a quote from the San Joaquin \nValley Air Pollution Control District executive director. He said these \nwords before our committee: ``H.R. 4775, in my opinion, provides for \nmuch-needed streamlining of the implementation of the Clean Air Act. It \ndoes not roll back anything that is already in the Clean Air Act in the \nform of protections for public health, safeguarding public health, and \nit does nothing to roll back any of the progress that has been made, \nand it will not impede or slow down our progress as we move forward to \nreduce air pollution and improve public health.''\n  This amendment trashes that statement.\n\n[[Page H3532]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, we should all be grateful to the authors of \nthe Clean Air Act for the progress we have achieved. The way to express \nour gratitude is to use an occasion like this to expand, not to \nretract, that act.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from the \nDistrict of Columbia will be postponed.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings \nwill now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 114-607 on \nwhich further proceedings were postponed, in the following order:\n  Amendment No. 1 by Mr. Whitfield of Kentucky.\n  Amendment No. 2 by Mr. Rush of Illinois.\n  Amendment No. 3 by Mr. Pallone of New Jersey.\n  Amendment No. 5 by Mr. Polis of Colorado.\n  Amendment No. 6 by Ms. Norton of the District of Columbia.\n  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any \nelectronic vote after the first vote in this series.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Whitfield\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a \nrecorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kentucky \n(Mr. Whitfield) on which further proceedings were postponed and on \nwhich the ayes prevailed by voice vote.\n  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

There is 1 minute remaining.\n\n                              {time}  1647\n\n  So the amendment was rejected.\n  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the committee amendment in the \nnature of a substitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nWomack) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hultgren, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4775) to \nfacilitate efficient State implementation of ground-level ozone \nstandards, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution \n767, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted \nin the Committee of the Whole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment \nreported from the Committee of the Whole?\n  If not, the question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. RUSH. I am opposed in its current form.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order against the motion \nto recommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Rush moves to recommit the bill H.R. 4775 to the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce with instructions to report \n     the same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendment:\n       Page 5, after line 11, insert the following:\n       (c) Limitation.--If the Administrator, in consultation with \n     the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, finds that \n     application of subsection (a) could increase the incidence of \n     asthma attacks, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, \n     stroke, heart attacks, babies born with low birth weight and \n     impaired fetal growth, neurological damage, premature \n     mortality, or other serious harms to human health, especially \n     for vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, children, \n     the elderly, outdoor workers, and low income communities, \n     then this section shall cease to apply.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which \nwill not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the \nbill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, it appears that the Republican Party has truly fallen in \nline behind its standard-bearer, Donald Trump, and is content to put \nindustry profits over the public interest. Mr. Speaker, the art of the \ndeal should not mean putting corporate welfare over the public well-\nbeing.\n  Mr. Speaker, our agreement is nonnegotiable. Protecting the public \nhealth is absolutely why we are here in this Congress today.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4775 is a disastrous bill that will put our most \nvulnerable citizens, including the elderly, the young, pregnant women, \nand low-income communities, at substantial risk.\n  This bill unacceptably delays implementation of EPA's 2015 ozone \nstandards for another 8 years, while also delaying any new evidence \nregarding the health implications from ozone and other harmful \npollutants for at least a decade, despite what the science may say in \nthe interval.\n  In fact, under this legislation, not only will States be exempt from \ncomplying with the 2015 standards until 2016, but parents--our \nparents--and our loved ones, Mr. Speaker, will not even be informed if \ntheir communities were in violation of clean air standards until the \nyear 2025.\n  Mr. Speaker, I can think of no benefit to the public interest of \ndenying citizens information directly tied to their health and to their \nwell-being.\n  The research, Mr. Speaker, informs us that breathing in dirty \npollutants\n\n[[Page H3536]]\n\nsuch as ozone, carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, and \nother dirty pollutants can lead to a host of problems, including \nasthma, inflammation of the lungs, respiratory disease, and even \npremature death.\n  Yet, Mr. Speaker, despite all of the scientific research, this bill \nwill stall the new ozone standards, permanently weaken the Clean Air \nAct, and hamstring EPA's ability to regulate these harmful \ncontaminants, both now and in the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, in order to address some of the deficiencies found in \nthis bill, I am offering an amendment that would nullify sections from \ntaking effect if they may result in adverse public health impacts.\n  This amendment simply states that section 2(a) would cease to apply \nif the EPA Administrator, in consultation with the Clean Air Scientific \nAdvisory Committee, finds that it could increase health problems, \nincluding asthma attacks, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, \nstroke, heart attacks, babies with low birth weight and impaired fetal \ngrowth, neurological damage, premature mortality, or other serious \nharms to human health, especially for America's most vulnerable \npopulations such as pregnant women, children, the elderly, outdoor \nworkers, and low-income communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense and compassionate amendment that \nseeks to put the interests of the public health above the profits of \nindustry, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of \norder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of the point of order is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I want healthy air. Everyone here in this \nChamber wants healthy air. Every American wants healthy air.\n  Where I live in the greater Houston area, we have struggled with air \nquality, but we are making great progress. In fact, communities all \nacross America have cut ozone levels by one-third in the last few \ndecades. That progress must continue, and that is why this bill is not \nabout blocking the path forward on clean air.\n  As a top air official in California said about H.R. 4775: ``It does \nnot roll back anything that is already in the Clean Air Act in the form \nof protections for public health . . . it will not slow down our \nprogress as we move forward to reduce air pollution and improve public \nhealth.''\n  There has never been a regulator in this country who wants to drag \ntheir feet on clean air. Our States have said for years that they face \nreal challenges under current law. Addressing those real challenges is \nwhat this bill is all about.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  That is why we need H.R. 4775. It gives our local officials the tools \nthey need to make the Clean Air Act work. It tackles the challenges of \nStates being asked to implement overlapping regulations.\n  H.R. 4775 will let EPA consider whether its rules are achievable, but \nnever putting cost ahead of public health when setting a new standard.\n  H.R. 4775 will make sure that clean air rules are implemented fairly, \nand that communities like mine and yours aren't penalized for emissions \nthey can't control.\n  In 2008, the Bush administration put out lower ozone standards. In \n2015, the Obama administration finally put out rules for 2008 \nstandards. America lost 7 years of cleaner air. And then, in late 2015, \nthe Obama administration put out even lower standards.\n  Are we going to lose 7 more years of cleaner air?\n  Albert Einstein said that the definition of insanity is doing the \nsame thing over and over again and expecting different results. Let's \nnot repeat the last 7 years of ozone insanity.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit. Give \nour local communities the ozone sanity they crave and deserve. Vote \n``yes'' for final passage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

DOC. NO. 114-140)\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following veto \nmessage from the President of the United States:\n\nTo the House of Representatives:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval H.J. Res. 88, a \nresolution that would nullify the Department of Labor's final conflict \nof interest rule. This rule is critical to protecting Americans' hard-\nearned savings and preserving their retirement security.\n\n[[Page H3538]]\n\n  The outdated regulations in place before this rulemaking did not \nensure that financial advisers act in their clients, best interests \nwhen giving retirement investment advice. Instead, some firms have \nincentivized advisers to steer clients into products that have higher \nfees and lower returns--costing America's families an estimated $17 \nbillion a year.\n  The Department of Labor's final rule will ensure that American \nworkers and retirees receive retirement advice that is in their best \ninterest, better enabling them to protect and grow their savings. The \nfinal rule reflects extensive feedback from industry, advocates, and \nMembers of Congress, and has been streamlined to reduce the compliance \nburden and ensure continued access to advice, while maintaining an \nenforceable best interest standard that protects consumers. It is \nessential that these critical protections go into effect. Because this \nresolution seeks to block the progress represented by this rule and \ndeny retirement savers investment advice in their best interest, I \ncannot support it. I am therefore vetoing this resolution.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \n                                         The White House, June 8, 2016.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The objections of the President will be \nspread at large upon the Journal, and the veto message and the joint \nresolution will be printed as a House document.\n  Pursuant to the order of the House of today, further consideration of \nthe veto message and the bill are postponed until the legislative day \nof Wednesday, June 22, 2016, and that on that legislative day, the \nHouse shall proceed to the constitutional question of reconsideration \nand dispose of such question without intervening motion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/house-section/article/H3538-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the Chair for the time to express my support for the \nProtecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of \n2016. This is the PIPES Act of 2016.\n  The United States has the largest network of energy pipelines in the \nworld--over 2.6 million miles of pipe. Pipelines are a critical part of \nour energy infrastructure, with over 64 percent of our energy being \ntransported by our pipes within this country. The sustained oversight \nof the Department of Transportation's pipeline safety programs is \ncritical for pipelines to continue to safely transport our energy \nproducts.\n  This bill was developed in a bipartisan manner over the past several \nyears. My subcommittee held a number of hearings and roundtables to \nhear from stakeholders on the need for reauthorization. On April 20, \nthe Transportation and Infrastructure Committee unanimously approved \nour bill. Similarly, the Energy and Commerce Committee, with which we \nshare jurisdiction, passed its version on April 27. Since then, both \nHouse committees have worked on a bipartisan basis to meld this version \nwith the Senate's version, which passed last December. This \ncollaborative, constructive process has resulted in the bill we are \nconsidering today, which we believe is a solid safety improvement.\n  First, we require PHMSA to set minimum Federal standards for \nunderground natural gas storage facilities--a critical issue for my \nhome State of California after the Aliso Canyon leak.\n  We make sure PHMSA is focused on finishing outstanding issues from \nthe last reauthorization by requiring PHMSA to update Congress every 90 \ndays on its progress.\n  The bill also authorizes emergency order authority for the pipeline \nsector but with important preorder requirements to make sure, if the \nDOT uses such authority, it does it right.\n  This legislation promotes the better use of data and technology to \nimprove safety, including studying the latest innovations in pipeline \nmaterials and corrosion prevention.\n  Ultimately, our goal is to make sure that we have the safest pipeline \nnetwork in the world.\n  We have worked in a bipartisan, bicameral manner to develop this \nbill. I believe that this bill will improve the safety of our pipeline \ninfrastructure.\n  I thank Messrs. Capuano, Shuster, and DeFazio for their work on this \nbill. I also thank Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Upton, who \nhas worked tirelessly on this with Ranking Member Pallone. Lastly, I \nthank the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, & Transportation for \nits hard work. Together, we have made a great bill that will create a \nsafer infrastructure for our pipelines.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As you have just heard, this is a great piece of legislation. This is \nexactly the way that Congress is supposed to work. We had our \ndifferences, but we worked them out because everybody gave a little bit \nto get to the middle--to get something good for America. This is the \nkind of bill that, on an average day, will not get any of us elected or \nunelected, but it is something that is good for the safety of America \non pipelines and hazardous materials.\n  I would like to point out just a few items that, I think, are \nparticularly important:\n  For the first time, we have added an emergency order authority so \nthat our regulators, when there is a problem, can quickly address it as \nopposed to having to wait around and let it burn out on its own;\n  We added some provisions in there to boost funding to the States and \nthe localities so that they can train their own people on how to deal \nwith these things, because they are, after all, the first responders;\n  We added some information relative to oil spill response plans. For \nme, I thought it was very important that we added a section that makes \nsure that there are no conflicts of interest on the studies done by \nPHMSA, on which we rely.\n  There are many other provisions in this bill that are deserving of \nour support--as always, like with any bill. Any one of us can point out \nthings that we don't like or that we wanted more on, but that is what \ncompromise is all about. I am proud to be here again with another bill \nthat comes out of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure \nand for the traditional way that we have worked for many, many years in \na bipartisan way.\n  I thank Messrs. Denham, Shuster, and DeFazio, all of the members of \nthe Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the members of the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee.\n  This particular bill is more difficult than usual because there were \ntwo committees involved. It makes four different sides and eight \ndifferent sides on the House, plus the Senate; yet we did it in a \nreasonable fashion and in a relatively quick way. It proves the system \ncan work when you have people at the table who want it to work.\n\n[[Page H3545]]\n\n  I thank everybody who has been involved with this, and I look forward \nto the passage of the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Walden).\n\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to support this \nlegislation today and to commend the committees for their work on \npipeline safety and pipeline safety improvement. I also have to take \nthis opportunity, because the committee has done very good work on the \nFAST Act, to talk about rail safety.\n  This rail accident occurred over the weekend just 7 miles from my \nhome in the national scenic area of the Columbia River Gorge. I was \nthere not long after it happened. I met with the incident commanders. I \nmet with the fire chief. I met with city officials and county \nofficials. Let me just say that, while you are protecting pipelines--\nand that is really important--we need to continue to make progress on \nrail safety and to make sure that the new cars that were ordered by \nthis Congress get put into service, especially in these critical \nwaterway areas, as soon as possible. We need to make sure that track \nimprovements are required--that new fasteners are used to deal with \nissues where, in this case, perhaps, it is a track separation issue. We \nneed to make sure that our first responders get all of the training and \nthat the Department of Transportation finishes its work on its rule for \nspill response and for safety.\n  This is a critically important issue for the people I represent on \nboth the Oregon and Washington sides of the Columbia River because \nthese trains are going through, and we are having these kinds of \nsituations. We need to make sure we have the most up-to-date safety, \nthe most up-to-date training, and the safest cars and tracks possible. \nWe are going to stay on this until that happens.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I thank my friend from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to echo what Mr. Capuano said about the \nbipartisan nature of this bill and in our working together between the \ntwo committees to achieve success.\n  The vast network of energy pipelines in this country is essentially \nout of sight, out of mind for most Americans, but when something goes \nwrong, these facilities can make themselves known in devastating and \nsometimes deadly ways.\n  This is something that both Representative Capps and Representative \nSherman, unfortunately, have experienced since the start of this \nCongress. My own district experienced the devastation of a pipeline \nfailure in 1994 when a pipeline exploded in Edison, New Jersey, and \ndestroyed about 300 homes. Ever since then, I have sought to make our \nNation's pipelines safer by making the law and its regulator stronger.\n  The legislation before us, while not the bill that maybe we would \nhave written, as Mr. Capuano said, is a good proposal that moves the \nball forward on safety. It is the result of a number of weeks of \nbipartisan, bicameral negotiations. While some compromises were made, \nthis is a product that in many ways is greater than the sum of its \nparts. I am particularly pleased that it includes versions of important \nprovisions that were authored by a number of Energy and Power \nSubcommittee members, including Mrs. Capps, Messrs. Green, Engel, \nMcNerney, and Welch, and Ranking Member Bobby Rush.\n  In particular, the House amendment gives the Secretary of \nTransportation, for the first time ever, emergency order authority to \naddress the threats to public health, safety, and the environment that \nare posed by dangerous pipelines on a comprehensive, industrywide \nbasis. It also changes the existing pipeline safety information grant \nprogram, which helps ensure adequate funding of pipeline safety \ntechnical assistance grants to communities and nonprofit organizations. \nI am pleased that the legislation improves the protection of coastal \nbeaches and marine coastal waters--areas that are vital to my district \nand to the districts of many others--by explicitly designating them as \nareas that are unusually sensitive to the environmental damage that is \ncaused by pipeline failures. It also contains a provision that \nestablishes a program for regulating underground natural gas storage \nfacilities.\n  I urge the passage of the bill.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Upton), the full committee chair of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, pipeline safety is especially personal for \nme. Back in 2010, we experienced a bad spill just outside of my \ndistrict in southwest Michigan that impacted the Kalamazoo River. Ask \nanyone who was directly affected. Seeing the aftermath firsthand smacks \nthe senses and leaves a lasting impression. While a spill can happen in \nan instant, the damage can take decades and, in fact, more than $1 \nbillion to fix. Underscoring the need for strong safety laws is what \nthis bill does.\n  Congress asked the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and \nHazardous Materials Safety Administration--that is PHMSA for short--to \ndevelop and enforce pipeline safety regulations. PHMSA doesn't do the \njob by itself. It relies heavily on partnerships with States and local \ngovernments to inspect the pipelines and, yes, to enforce the law; but \nthe reality is that more can be done to prevent accidents from \noccurring and to mitigate spills when the unthinkable happens.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  The amendment to the Senate bill before us today, this bill, \nincorporates texts from two House bills, which were both approved \nunanimously in committee: H.R. 5050, the Pipeline Safety Act, which \npassed the Committee on Energy and Commerce; and H.R. 4937, the PIPES \nAct of 2016, which passed the Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee.\n  This important legislation will reauthorize PHMSA's pipeline safety \nthrough 2019, press PHMSA to complete overdue safety regs, and impose \nadditional new safety requirements for pipeline operators.\n  I have often said that pipelines should be subject to greater \nscrutiny and more frequent inspections, and those that cross the \nStraits of Mackinac are a perfect example. The Straits of Mackinac is a \nnarrow waterway that separates Michigan's two peninsulas. It connects \nLake Michigan and Lake Huron. The exceptionally strong and complex \ncurrents hundreds of feet deep make this area tremendously sensitive. \nIf a spill were to occur, the consequences would be unthinkable.\n  Our solution improves protections for the Great Lakes and other areas \naround the country where the threat of a spill poses the greatest risk \nto public safety and the environment. It also requires pipeline \noperators to consider a worst-case discharge into icy waters and \nconduct more frequent and transparent and, in some cases, annual \ninspections of deep underwater crossings. This bill does that.\n  We also update and improve PHMSA's pipeline safety program in a \nnumber of other ways by closing the gaps in Federal standards for \nunderground natural gas storage and liquefied natural gas facilities. \nIt promotes better use of data and technology and improves \ncommunication with pipeline operators to incorporate the lessons \nlearned from past incidents.\n  We promised action, and today that is what this bill does. I am proud \nof the bipartisan agreement that will make a real difference. I am \nproud of the relationship that our committee has with Chairman Shuster \nand the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and all the \ngood work that everyone has done--Mr. Pallone, Mr. Rush, and our \ncolleagues in the Senate. This is a bipartisan bill. Let's get 'er \ndone.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. DeFazio), the ranking member of the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Protecting our \nInfrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act, the PIPES bill.\n  I thank the chairmen of the subcommittee, the full committee, and \nalso the members of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Representative \nMike Capuano, and members of the Energy and Commerce Committee on our\n\n[[Page H3546]]\n\nside. This is a good bipartisan product, something that is pretty rare \naround here these days.\n  It reauthorizes the Department of Transportation's pipeline safety \nprogram for 4 years and includes a number of important measures that \nwill better protect our communities, ensuring that pipelines are a safe \nmeans to transport natural gas, hazardous liquids, and crude oil.\n  Most importantly, this bill gives the Secretary of Transportation new \nemergency order authority to impose certain emergency restrictions and \nsafety measures on pipeline operators to address an imminent hazard \nresulting from an incident or an unsafe practice, which is authority \nthat doesn't currently exist.\n  Here is a good example. Fairly recently, we had a defective pipeline \nfrom China. We shouldn't be buying pipeline from China. But anyway, we \nhad some defective, junky Chinese product pipeline, and there was an \nincident. But the administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Safety \nMaterials Agency does not have the authority to order a nationwide \ninspection or removal of an imminent hazard, i.e., defective Chinese \npipeline. All they could do was voluntary guidance.\n  Now, we will have emergency order authority. Some were concerned that \nthey would use this as a way to end-run the regulatory process on other \nmatters that are not an imminent hazard to health and safety, and there \nare provisions in the bill that would prevent that.\n  We are also pushing them to complete the mandates of the last bill, \n2011, a bipartisan bill, where they have 16 mandates that Congress \nrequired that we felt were needed and prudent. And they are not through \nthe regulatory process as yet. So we are moving them forward on that, \nand hopefully, the trolls down at the Office of Management and Budget \nwho hold these things up--hello, do you live near a pipeline--that they \nwill get the message and they will get these vital provisions that have \nbeen too long delayed.\n  It gives Federal, State, and emergency local responders MSDS sheets, \nsafety sheets, so we know what the oil is. We have had past spills \nwhere we couldn't figure out what they were dealing with for days, and \nthat is not acceptable.\n  It gives the agency the authority to have standards for underground \nnatural gas storage facilities, but it allows States like Oregon, which \nhas seven of these, to go above those standards so that the States can \nbetter protect their citizens.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Oregon an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, it would put a small fee on operators of \nunderground storage tanks that would help to support the safety \nprograms.\n  I would say with respect to funding, the bill is funded at current \nbaseline levels. We should have provided them additional funds to carry \nout their numerous pipeline safety missions, but unfortunately, we \ncouldn't reach bipartisan agreement on providing additional resources.\n  This bill does, however, increase grants to States to help them carry \nout their intrastate pipeline safety programs. It reauthorizes funding \nfor pipeline safety information grants to communities, which are \nimportant to my constituents.\n  There are pipelines in places that no one is aware. There is one that \nruns down the middle of the Willamette Valley, all the way down, that \nsupplies the Eugene Airport and a storage facility down in Eugene. A \nnumber of years ago, there was a news story, like: what pipeline? There \nare new developments going in. The signs are buried under blackberry \nbushes, and people aren't aware of these things. So we have to make \ncertain those pipelines are safe.\n\n  The new provisions for coastal areas are absolutely critical to make \nsure those are maintained at the highest standard and built to the \nhighest standard in other critical resource areas.\n  All in all, I congratulate my colleagues and recommend this bill.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the PIPES Act. I \nwant to commend Chairman Denham, Ranking Member Capuano, and Ranking \nMember DeFazio for all the work they have put into this bill. I also \nwant to thank Chairman Fred Upton from the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee for the great relationship we have been able to develop. In \nthese bills, we share jurisdiction, so we have been able to work and \nincorporate provisions from both the committees.\n  I also want to thank my colleagues on the Senate Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation Committee who have worked with us over the past \nmonth to produce the legislation we are considering today.\n  Pipelines are vital for getting energy products to markets and users. \nIt is one of the safest modes of transportation, if not the safest. I \nbelieve this bill will build on the safety advances that we have been \nmaking.\n  Congress last authorized the pipeline safety bill in 2011, and that \nbipartisan act charged DOT with updating regulations and procedures \nacross a host of issues. But DOT needs to finish out those provisions, \nand this bill includes strong transparency and reporting requirements \nto keep pressure to finish the 2011 work.\n  Another major provision in this act provides PHMSA with emergency \norder authority for pipelines. Most other Department of Transportation \nmodal administrations have EO authority, which allows regulators to act \nquickly when they identify an industrywide safety issue that poses an \nimminent hazard to the public.\n  As we crafted this language, we took great care to balance a variety \nof concerns. This bill maintains the Transportation Committee language \nthat requires PHMSA to consult with industry stakeholders and other \nregulators prior to issuing an EO so that PHMSA understands the \npotential impact on the economy, end users, and safety.\n  We also included extensive due process procedures on the back end so \nthat if the agency makes a wrong call, affected parties will have \nredress, both administratively and judicially.\n  PHMSA is also required to issue regulations to carry out this \nauthority, including requiring administrative law judge procedures that \nmirror similar requirements in the hazmat EO authority.\n  This is a good bill. It builds on the work that we did in 2011. It is \ndeveloped in a bipartisan, bicameral manner.\n  Again, I thank Mr. Capuano, Mr. Denham, Mr. DeFazio, Mr. Upton, Mr. \nPallone, and the Senate for their work and their leadership on this \nbill.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rush), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Energy \nand Power--which, of course, I love that name--from the Energy and \nCommerce Committee.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge some of my \ncolleagues who worked together diligently with my office to draft this \nbipartisan PIPES Act that will help to modernize and secure our \nNation's vast network of energy pipeline infrastructure.\n  Specifically, Mr. Speaker, I recognize my colleagues from the Energy \nand Commerce Committee, including Chairman Upton and Ranking Member \nPallone, as well as Energy and Power Subcommittee Chairman Ed \nWhitfield.\n  Additionally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge my colleagues \nfrom the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, including \nChairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio, as well as Railroads, \nPipelines, and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee Chairman Denham and \nRanking Member Capuano, the fine gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan piece of legislation improves safety by \nclosing gaps in Federal standards and improving protection of coastal \nareas, including the Great Lakes.\n  Additionally, this bill will enhance the quality and timeliness of \nPipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration rulemakings, \npromote better use of data and technology to improve pipeline safety, \nand leverage Federal and State pipeline safety resources to assist \nState and local communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a fine piece of bipartisan legislation, and I am \nhonored\n\n[[Page H3547]]\n\nand privileged to stand before the House and ask all of my colleagues \nto support this outstanding bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMichigan (Mrs. Miller).\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I certainly rise in strong support of this legislation, \nwhich really includes some critical protections for one of our Nation's \nmost precious assets. And that, of course, is the Great Lakes, which \nhas 20 percent of our Nation's freshwater drinking supply, as well as \nit provides hundreds of jobs and billions of dollars of economic \nactivity.\n  Today, there are millions of gallons per day of hazardous liquids \nwhich are transported through a number of lines in the Great Lakes. Mr. \nSpeaker, we absolutely need energy in all transparency. We need the \nenergy, but we need to make sure that we are transiting in a very safe \nand environmentally secure way because there is zero room for error in \nthe Great Lakes.\n  There is a 62-year-old pipeline that is called line 5 that runs under \nthe Straits of Mackinac, which is right in between Lake Huron and Lake \nMichigan. Any rupture there would be very, very difficult, if not \nimpossible, to contain. This bill has a number of provisions in regards \nto line 5, for instance, that would conduct internal integrity \nassessments at least once a year.\n  This bill also designates the Great Lakes as a USA ecological \nresource, which is very important.\n  As well, it also makes sure that we have emergency spill response \nplans if, in the case of ice coverage, which really considers the \nunique environment of the Great Lakes.\n  In regards to Enbridge, there is also a line 6B which runs under the \nSaint Clair River, which is in my district. A number of years ago--and \nChairman Upton was talking about this particular line that had a spill \njust outside of his district--but this part of 6B runs under something \ncalled the Saint Clair River, again, a very environmentally sensitive \nartery for the Great Lakes.\n  We talked to Enbridge. And long story short, they came to the right \nconclusion there. They actually completely replaced almost 3,600 feet \nof this pipeline under the Saint Clair River. So they did the right \nthing there. They had been reluctant to address that.\n  Again, we need the energy, Mr. Speaker, but we need to make sure that \nwe are transiting energy in a very safe way and in an environmentally \nsensitive way. I think this bill today goes a long way to address many \nof the concerns that we have had in the Great Lakes.\n  I thank Chairman Denham again for yielding the time and for taking \nthese issues into consideration.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Gene Green), my friend who serves on the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues from the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee for letting us Energy and \nCommerce folks have some time.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the United States \nhas more than 2.9 million miles of pipelines in our vast network. \nAccording to the Texas Pipeline Association, Texas has more than \n320,000 miles of intrastate pipelines.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  As a lifelong Houstonian, there has never been a time in my life when \nI haven't lived along a pipeline easement. Needless to say, in Texas, \nwe know pipelines, but we also know about the importance of safety.\n  Every day, industry moves millions of gallons or cubic feet of \ndomestically produced and refined product without any problems. Since \n2005, the United States has seen a general decline in the number of \npipeline releases or accidents that result in environmental damage or \npersonal injury.\n  We understand that the compounds moved via pipeline pose a risk, and \nwe must effectively manage and mitigate that risk to protect our \ncitizens and the environment. Today I think we are taking another step \nin the right direction.\n  The bill before the House today is a good bill that attempts to lay \ndown concrete rules of the road for the next 5 years. For the sake of \nour constituencies, we need to pass this bipartisan bill in a \nbipartisan way. I would like to voice my support for this bill and ask \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.\n  Four years ago we gave PHMSA a job to do. While some of their work \nhas been completed, there is still work to do. That is why this bill \ndirects PHMSA to prioritize rulemaking and complete the work before \nthem. We should not continue to add requirements on their plate. We \nshould allow PHMSA the time and, most importantly, give them the \nresources required to finish this important job. I would like to \nexpress support for the PHMSA workforce management language.\n  We need inspectors in the field working closely with their industry \npartners to avoid another emergency situation. In my opinion, robust \ninspection is the best option available for everyone involved. If we \nreach the enforcement stage, that means something has gone wrong and we \nare too late. Industry, PHMSA, and the workers support this provision.\n  The second provision I would like to support is the emergency \nauthority for PHMSA. While this provision may not be perfect, it \nrepresents a strong balance between enforcement and review. It is \nimportant to keep in mind that this is emergency authority. \nUnfortunately, when there is an incident involving a pipeline, we need \nto act with speed, efficiency, and resolve.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentleman.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want our executive agencies \non the scene ensuring we are protecting the people and the environment. \nWe must ensure that people have confidence in the pipeline system, and \neffective crisis management will help build that belief.\n  I appreciate the hard work that went into crafting this provision. \nCompromise is not easy, so I want to thank both sides for drafting \nthese provisions. I know there is more work ahead, but I look forward \nto supporting the current bill.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Knight).\n  Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, on October 23, a gas leak was discovered at \none of the 115 wells at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility \nlocated in my district near Porter Ranch, California. I want to thank \nCongressman Brad Sherman, who lives in Porter Ranch and was a great \npartner in this terrible tragedy, making sure that people were taken \ncare of and we could move past this and move quickly to getting this \ntaken care of.\n  This leak persisted for 118 days and was recognized as one of the \nlargest disasters of 2015. During this time, residents of the \nsurrounding neighborhoods suffered. Some temporarily relocated their \nfamilies. Two schools were permanently relocated, at least for that \nsemester, and many businesses were put on hold.\n  As the Representative for Porter Ranch, my immediate priority was to \nprotect my constituents who live there and then ensure that this \nsituation was resolved as quickly as possible. At the same time, I \nwanted to make sure that a crisis like this can never happen in our \ncommunities again. Today we take a giant step forward in doing just \nthat.\n  In February, I introduced the Natural Gas Leak Prevention Act, which \nwould require the Secretary of Transportation to issue adequate safety \nstandards for natural gas storage facilities like Aliso Canyon in \nPorter Ranch and another very large facility, Honor Rancho in Valencia, \nwhich is also in my district.\n  The SAFE PIPES Act contains the language from the Natural Gas Leak \nPrevention Act as well as provisions to create an Aliso Canyon task \nforce that would investigate the causes of the leak and recommend \nfurther actions to prevent such disasters in the future.\n  This is the type of swift and effective action that we need in order \nto prevent our communities and our families from tragedies like the \nPorter Ranch gas leak.\n  I want to thank many people who were involved in this situation. A \nspecial thanks to Paula Cracium and the\n\n[[Page H3548]]\n\nentire neighborhood council for providing support to the community in \nits time of need. I would also like to thank my colleague, \nRepresentative Jeff Denham, for his efforts to move this measure \nforward, including flying down to my district in March to tour the \nfacility with the people involved.\n  I would like to thank, as well, Senator Deb Fischer and Chairman Bill \nShuster for their immense support and the many staff members who worked \ntirelessly on this legislation.\n\n  This terrible tragedy had real impacts on the lives of thousands of \npeople I represent. We cannot undo the damage that was done in Porter \nRanch, but we can and must make sure every effort to mitigate the \nimpacts on their day-to-day lives and assist in the recovery process.\n  It is time to move forward on comprehensive legislation to prevent \nanother incident from happening in our communities ever again. I would \nlike to say that this would never, ever happen again; but without \naction, without us moving forward, without people working together and \nCongress working together, this can happen. So this type of legislation \nis needed, and the people who are affected appreciate this; and the \npeople who have worked on this, I appreciate very much.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Sherman).\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, as my colleague from California pointed \nout, we in Porter Ranch experienced the largest natural gas leak in \nhistory. Seven thousand families were evacuated for months, and yet, as \nI speak, there are no Federal regulations for underground natural gas \nstorage facilities, and the State regulations are surprisingly minimal, \neven in famously green California. Why? Because the natural gas \nindustry and regulators believed that natural gas was only a problem if \nyou were within a few hundred feet.\n  What we have experienced with this multibillion-cubic-foot leak is \n7,000 families evacuated from an area in a 5-mile radius because the \nvolatile organic compounds and the mercaptan in that natural gas caused \nenormous health problems. That is why I went to the President of the \nUnited States and the Vice President at the caucus that we attended and \ngot a public commitment that we would get regulations probably this \nyear.\n  This legislation is important because it makes it clear that, while \nPHMSA has the regulatory authority to act, if they don't act, they are \nrequired to act within 2 years under this legislation.\n  I am pleased to say that the legislation includes a provision that I \nthink is very important and which I have championed from the beginning, \nand that is to clarify that a State can adopt tougher standards than \nwhatever the Federal Government adopts.\n  The legislation also officially establishes the Department of \nEnergy's Aliso Canyon natural gas task force. That task force is \nalready up and running. We are working with it. It is the brainchild of \nSenators Boxer and Feinstein, and I think formally establishing it in \nthis regulation makes sense.\n  We need to adopt tough natural gas storage safety regulations for \nthis entire country because Aliso Canyon, the storage facility next to \nPorter Ranch, was only the fifth largest natural gas storage field. \nThere could be others. It could be in your district. That is why we \nneed tough standards, and if we don't get them from PHMSA this year, we \nwill have legislation requiring them within 2 years after the enactment \nof this legislation.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I would just like to close out by simply repeating what I said \nearlier. I am very happy, very proud to have worked on this bill. I am \nvery happy and very satisfied with the way we worked cooperatively. I \nwant to thank the staff on our side who worked on it, Jennifer Esposito \nHomendy and Steve Carlson on my staff. I want to thank all the staff on \nthe Republican side.\n  I know that America has this view that we hate each other and we \nnever talk to each other and we do nothing but call each other names. I \nhave done that in private, of course, but the truth is this is exactly \nthe way it is supposed to work. Absent not getting a few things I \nwanted, this was actually a pleasure to work on. I am very proud of the \nwork product. I am very proud of the work environment that we have. I \nthink this is a bill that the American people can be proud of. I think \nit is a bill that the Congress can be proud of.\n  Again, I want to thank everyone who worked with us on this. I look \nforward to the President's signature.\n  Again, I want to thank the staff. Let's be honest, we take all the \ncredit. We do the big speeches and all that kind of stuff, but without \nthe staff, we couldn't get this done. I want to thank everybody \ninvolved with it for their professionalism, for their enthusiasm, for \ntheir long nights and difficult time. I look forward to doing this \nagain in 4 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. Capuano has been a \ngreat partner in this. This has been going on for many years now, many \nmonths of roundtables, many months of hearings, and it has been a true \npleasure working together in a bipartisan way to address our \ndifferences, but most importantly, to actually address the safety of \nthe American public.\n  This is a big bill: 2.6 million miles of pipeline, 64 percent of our \nNation's energy. We didn't take it lightly. We wanted to hear from the \npublic. We wanted to hear from stakeholders across the country, and we \nwanted to hear from Members across the country representing their \ndistricts. It was truly a bipartisan effort.\n  We appreciate the support and work of the ranking member and full \ncommittee chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce as well as \nthe ranking member and the committee chairman of the Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure.\n  Specifically, I want to thank Mr. Knight for his leadership on this \nissue. You never expect to have an emergency in the middle of \ndeliberating on a bill. In this case, we did. He showed real leadership \nin coming to the table and inviting us out to his district to see it \nfirsthand so that we could actually address safety concerns in this \nbill as well. It is a great bill to improve the safety of the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the final \npassage of this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the House Amendment to \nS. 2276.\n  Millions of miles of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines \ncrisscross our country and touch countless communities. While these \npipelines are an essential part of our nation's energy infrastructure, \nwe all know--many from first-hand experience--that our reliance on \nthese pipelines is inherently risky. Too often we hear of a pipeline \nfailure, just like the Plains pipeline spill in my congressional \ndistrict last year, which harms the health of local communities, the \nregional economy, and the environment. And we know that it really isn't \na question of if there will be another spill in another community, but \nwhen.\n  With that is mind it is clear that we must do all we can to prevent \nthe next spill from occurring and mitigate the damage when it does. We \nneed to make the oil and gas industries that rely on these vulnerable \nmethods of transportation more transparent and safer. We need to ensure \nthat the federal regulator, the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety \nAdministration (PHMSA), has the tools it needs to ensure the safe \noperation of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines under federal \njurisdiction. And we owe it to the communities who are still picking up \nthe pieces from these incidents to do all we can to learn from these \ntragedies to protect others in the future.\n  The bill before us today is an important step to do just that. This \nbill would provide PHMSA with the emergency order authority to \nappropriately respond to systemic pipeline issues. And it would ensure \nthat important, long overdue rules are finalized and implemented, \nincluding the rules for automatic shutoff valves and leak detection. \nThis technology is critical to minimizing the damage when a spill does \noccur.\n  This bill also includes specific provisions that apply the lessons \nlearned from the Plains spill. Specifically, this legislation would \nmandate a study on the causes of corrosion including risks associated \nwith insulated pipelines--the underlying cause of the Plains failure--\nand the best methods to prevent corrosion from occurring in this \ninfrastructure. This legislation would also improve protection of\n\n[[Page H3549]]\n\ncoastal areas, including coastal beaches, marine coastal waters, and \nthe Great Lakes, by explicitly designating them as ``unusually \nsensitive areas.'' This will bring more stringent safety requirements \nto these particularly vulnerable areas like my community. Finally, this \nlegislation would require a report examining ways to improve hazardous \nliquid pipeline safety through integrity management actions, including \nan analysis of risk factors that may warrant more frequent inspections.\n  While nothing can take us back to prevent the Plains spill, this bill \nas a whole is an important, bipartisan effort to protect my and other \ncommunities going forward. And that is why I support it. We must \nembrace this opportunity for the sake of the health and safety of our \nconstituents and the environment.\n  I would like to thank Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Upton \nand Ranking Member Pallone as well as subcommittee Ranking Member Rush \nfor working with me to craft a bill that addresses the failures that \nled to the Plains spill. I would also like to commend staff from both \nthe Energy and Commerce Committee and the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee for working in a bipartisan and bicameral way \nto get to this final product.\n  Our constituents are relying on us. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation, and I hope we are able to send S. 2276 to \nthe President for his signature in the very near future.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Denham) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 2276, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/house-section/article/H3549-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATIONS TO DuBOIS AREA MIDDLE SCHOOL ON BEING NAMED A ``SCHOOL \n                               TO WATCH''\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, one of the great joys of representing \nLouisville in the House of Representatives is that I get to constantly \nclaim that I represent Muhammad Ali and the home of Muhammad Ali. It \nhas always been a source of pride not just to me, but to all of my \nfellow Louisvillians that we could say that the Louisville Lip, the \ngreatest of all time, called Louisville home.\n  Now one of the brightest lights in the world has extinguished. \nMuhammad Ali passed away last Friday after a long and courageous battle \nwith Parkinson's disease, and the world has experienced a collective \ngrief period. The joy of his accomplishments, the recognition of his \ncommitment to peace, to tolerance, to respect, to love, all of those \nthings, have come from all over the world.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  So tonight, some of my colleagues and I have come to the floor to \ntalk about Muhammad Ali, his life, his legacy, personal stories, the \nimpact that he has had on our lives and on this country's life and on \nthe world. He will be laid to rest this Friday in Louisville. Former \nPresident Clinton will eulogize him, and many leaders from around the \nworld will be there to pay their respects.\n  But I go back many, many years. When I was 16 years old, living in \nLouisville, having watched him--then, Cassius Clay, an 8-to-1 \nunderdog--upset the great, terrifying Sonny Liston in Miami, and then \ngoing to the airport the next day to welcome him home.\n  I stood outside the airport. There weren't a lot of people there that \nday. And as Cassius Clay emerged from that terminal and looked around \nand drew himself up, I said I had never seen a more beautiful human \nspecimen in my life.\n  So when he called himself not just the greatest of all time, but the \nprettiest of all time, I was not going to argue with him. Of course, I \nwasn't going to argue with him about much.\n  That was my first personal exposure to Muhammad Ali. He was a man who \ngained fame in a violent game, but he earned his immortality as a kind, \ngentle, and caring soul. In the later years, when I got to know him \nbetter and spent more time around him, that is the one thing that \nalways came through: his wonderful soul.\n  I don't know that I have ever known a person or seen a person who got \nmore joy out of making a child smile as Muhammad Ali. And there was \nnever a time when he was in the presence of children where he didn't \nmake an effort to stop, joke with them, play with them. That was a \nsource of incredible joy for him.\n  So, as we remember Muhammad Ali tonight, we remember not just his \nboxing prowess. We remember the courage he showed outside the ring.\n  He came to age in a very, very turbulent period in American history: \nduring the civil rights demonstrations, when America was experiencing a \nconvulsion over how to deal with the issue of race. And then the \nVietnam war--a war whose opposition Ali paid a dear price for in 1967--\nrefusing to be drafted into the armed services, knowing that it would \ncost him his boxing career, understanding that he might well go to jail \nand never fight again, but willing to stand for principles. And in \ndoing that, I think he turned the country around and made them view the \nVietnam war in a different light. It wouldn't have happened, but for \nMuhammad Ali. He was not the only one, of course, but he was the most \nprominent one.\n  Later, who can forget lighting that torch in the Atlanta Olympics in \n1996, shaking from the Parkinson's disease that he had, but inspiring \nmillions. And, again, making a statement about disabilities that meant \nso much to so many.\n  So tonight, as we hear from various Members about Muhammad Ali, I \nthink what will come through is not just, again, his skills as an \nathlete, but his contributions as a citizen of the world and someone \nwho has left a lasting legacy, not just on people's lives individually, \nbut on the civilization as a whole.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).\n  Mr. COHEN. I want to thank Mr. Yarmuth for putting together this \nhour. I think it is important that we recognize icons in our society \nand people who have contributed so much, as you well expressed, to \nAmerican culture and to the thinking in our country about war, about \nrace, and about people with disabilities. Those are three very, very \nmajor areas that Muhammad Ali had a great impact on.\n  You related back to when you were 16 years old. I was not quite 15 \nyears old. At that time, my family had moved to Coral Gables, Florida. \nWe lived there\n\n[[Page H3550]]\n\nfrom 1961 to 1964. During that period, Muhammad Ali's second home was \nMiami Beach and the 5th Street Gym.\n  During that period is when Ali, as Cassius Clay, had won the Olympic \ngold medal--and I remember him winning the Olympic gold medal in 1960, \nin Rome--and when his professional career started. He probably started \nin Louisville, but he was quickly in Miami Beach fighting.\n  So he was on the news all the time in Miami Beach and on the sports \nshows and whatever else, but always on TV and a personality in Miami \nBeach.\n  My granddad gave me $20, which was a lot of money, on February 25, \n1964, if I remember--and I went to that fight. I was sitting probably \nin the highest seat in the Miami Beach Convention Center and watching \nthat fighting by myself. My dad wasn't so much into it, but my \ngrandfather gave me that $20 and I went to it.\n  I have got my docket. It's a great looking Clay-Liston ticket, in \ngood shape, and a couple of programs from that event, which I am proud \nto have. I have been a fan of his, and I know how much of an impact he \nhad on our world.\n  I was also a boxing fan of Floyd Patterson. Floyd Patterson was a \nprevious champion. The first time that Floyd fought Muhammad Ali, I \nhave to admit that I was cheering for Floyd. Floyd didn't do too well. \nHe hurt his back and was taunted by Ali. He wanted him to say his name. \nAnd he punished him pretty good through 12 rounds.\n  But the second time they fought, which was in the early seventies, \nPatterson did a lot better. They stopped the fight at the end of the \nsixth or the beginning of the seventh. And it was closer to even. After \nthe fight, as I understand it, Ali told the referee not to stop the \nfight because Patterson is fighting so well and he should be able to \ncontinue fighting and it wasn't fair to stop it.\n  I saw an interview with then-Cassius Clay with Steve Allen from 1963 \nthat is on the Internet. In that interview, they said something about \nFloyd Patterson. First, Clay made a joke and he said that Liston \nknocked him out twice in one round. And Floyd's jaw was somewhat \nchallenged. He said his leg should sue his body for lack of support. \nAnd then he kind of stopped and laughed and chuckled and said: I \nshouldn't say that; I like Floyd. Of course, that was before. Floyd \ndidn't recognize his new name.\n\n  Louisville was the home of Cassius Clay/Muhammad Ali. One of the \ngreat attractions in Louisville is the Muhammad Ali Center, which I \nhave had the opportunity to visit and go through. You can sit and watch \nall of Ali's fights, any one of them. Sit in a chair and push a button \nand there it is. And just watch any fight. I watched that second \nPatterson-Ali fight. Floyd was doing pretty good through those six \nrounds.\n  It is more than for boxing. It is a center. And it is about what he \ndid for children and there are a lot of displays about what he did for \nchildren and what he did for peace and his efforts around the world. I \nthink that is the great thing about Muhammad Ali. They didn't build a \nboxing museum. They built a center about all of his desires for freedom \nand for helping people around the globe and showing we are all one.\n  As he said back in I think January of this year, his religion of \nIslam was not about San Bernardino and Brussels or Paris or any other \nplace there have been attacks. Islam was a religion of love, and it \nshould be that way. And it was not the religion he knew. Anybody who \nthought it was that way and wanted to discriminate against people based \non their religion were wrong, because it wasn't that type of religion.\n  So he was still, up until this year, taking positions of conscience \nto try to steer people in the right direction.\n  I keep under my glass on my office desk a quote from Muhammad Ali. It \nis on a postcard that I got at the Muhammad Ali Center. It shows \nMuhammad Ali in the ring kind of dancing around. And it says: ``The \nfight is won or lost away from witnesses--behind the lines, in the gym, \nand out there on the road, long before I dance under those lights.''\n  And it made me think about what we do in politics. Our elections are \ngenerally not won--if you are serious about your job and your \nconstituents--right before elections. It is done during your term of \noffice and what you do for your constituents and how you vote and what \nyou do for folks, which is the same thing as a fighter being out there \nin the gym and on the road doing roadwork, hitting the bag, and \ntraining.\n  So Ali is what I look at when I sit down. It is right underneath my \ndesk. And I see that and he kind of guides me--and he guides \neverybody--in that way, if you think about that. That is what life is \nabout: preparation and having a plan and taking action to implement the \nplan.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut \n(Mr. Larson).\n  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. I thank the gentleman from Louisville for \norganizing this Special Order this evening.\n  I can't think of an athlete who more impacted my life and certainly \nthe lives of people in our generation.\n  The gentleman from Louisville started in 1960--or maybe it started \nwhen you were 16--but watching then-Cassius Marcellus Clay in the 1960 \nOlympics in Rome--a legendary Olympics that produced so many highlights \nof American athleticism, from Bob Hayes to Rafer Johnson and, of \ncourse, this young, boyish-looking, but eloquent and masterful heavy-\nweight that moved like nothing else I had ever seen or would ever see \nsince.\n  My father worked three jobs. About the only time he was home on a \nFriday night, we would watch the Gillette Sports Hour, which was the \nboxing matches that would occur.\n  My dad loved to follow boxing. He was a big Joe Louis and Rocky \nMarciano fan. Of course, my dad's generation, when Cassius Marcellus \nClay came along, were not happy with his poetry and braggadocio manner. \nAs a kid, we thought it was the coolest thing. And I would always \nremind my dad that he never made a boast that his fists couldn't back \nup.\n  And the poetry. He was ahead of his time in terms of rap, but he also \nwas ahead of his time in terms of what he brought to the sport.\n  As the distinguished gentleman from Louisville pointed out, when he \nstepped into the ring with Sonny Liston, we all feared for his life. \nBut as it turned out, he had that speed and that endurance and his \nincredible skills. He did everything that a boxer shouldn't do, but he \nwas able to do it because of the exceptional ability.\n  How do I know this? We are fortunate to have in this Chamber somebody \nwho was in the ring with Muhammad Ali. He was in the ring with him, \nSonny Liston, and Joe Frazier. Bob Brady of Philadelphia was a sparring \npartner and used in the ring.\n  As you all know, Bob Brady is a pretty big guy. And he also can move. \nHe maybe doesn't look so nowadays, but he still looks pretty fierce. I \nwouldn't want to get in the ring with Bob Brady.\n  But I asked him once to explain what that might have been like. And \nhe was dear friends with Joe Frazier. He said: But you wouldn't get in \na ring with Sonny Liston unless you had a lot of people around you. He \nsaid he was the meanest person he ever met or got in the ring with in \nhis life.\n  And I said: What about Muhammad Ali? He said: There is nothing like \nhim. He said he was a freak. I said: What do you mean, a freak? He \nsaid: A freak of nature, because of what he was able to do with his \nspeed, with his grace, and the simplistic thing of just being able to \nmove away, from skills that, when you watch these films today, you are \nin awe of them.\n  I can remember coming in and talking about the Ali shuffle when we \nsaw him do that against Cooper in England. No one had ever seen \nanything like that. And when he came back and he got in the ring and he \nwould dance, you just knew that he was going to win--the confidence \nthat he always exuded.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  Then, as John Yarmuth pointed out, he became so much bigger than the \nsport itself because of his conviction, and he did it during a \ntumultuous time.\n  The sixties will probably go down and forever be remembered as a \ngreat crucible for the history of this country when, converging at the \nsame time were the civil rights movement, an education movement that \nwas spawned by the launching of Sputnik, the civil rights movement that \nalso spawned the antiwar movement, that spawned the\n\n[[Page H3551]]\n\nwoman's movement, that spawned the ecological movement--all came about \nduring this tumultuous time.\n  And who was one of the leaders? One of the most recognized faces in \nAmerica, beyond perhaps John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, was \nMuhammad Ali, and he brought so much more because of his conviction.\n  I remember my experience of meeting him for the first time in East \nHartford, Connecticut, working at Woodland Auto Body, putting tire \nblack on cars. If you ever had this luxurious duty, you would not \nappreciate it.\n  All of a sudden, this gold Toronado pulled into Woodland Auto Body. \nNow, most of the people who worked at Woodland Auto Body were of \nAfrican American lineage. I saw this Toronado pull in--and if you know \nanything about a Toronado, it has one long window--and when they rolled \ndown the window, there was Bundini Brown. He said: Do you know how to \nget to WINF radio station?\n  I said: Well, yes, sir. It's just up the street here.\n  I looked in the back, and there was Muhammad Ali, and I said: The \nchamp.\n  I said: Wait right here. And I went inside because I knew my \ncoworkers, who certainly enjoyed seeing me have to put tire black on \ncars--I came running in and I said: Muhammad Ali is out here. The champ \nis here.\n  And they looked at me and said: Yeah, right, and Santa Claus is \ncoming also.\n  But they came out. And emerging from this gold Toronado was this \nunbelievably gracious human being, of course, at 6 foot 3, certainly \ntowering above me, and even among some of the brothers who were out \nthere talking. But we couldn't believe that he was actually there in \nour midst.\n  If you believe there is a certain aura that people have around them, \nhe had it. He was given a gift, and he used it.\n  That picture that appeared in The New York Times, with so many \nathletes of the period, the legendary Jim Brown and Bill Russell all \nsitting at that table, understanding what this youthful but spiritual \nindividual had done not just for Black America, but what he did for the \nworld in terms of speaking truth to power.\n  I will always remember that grace and elegance and rooting for him, \nand even being scared to death, in the Rumble in the Jungle, that \nGeorge Foreman might do him harm, and said, ``Oh, my God. What is he \ndoing, hanging on the ropes?'' which later became famous for rope-a-\ndope.\n  But he was the most unique athlete that I have ever observed in my \nlife. And beyond that unique talent that he brought to the ring, and \nthose skills that he brought to bear with unprecedented grace and \nability, he also made the world a better place, as the gentleman from \nLouisville pointed out, and distinguished himself far beyond what he \naccomplished in the ring by his simple pleas to America.\n  I was so happy to see him, in his later years, atone for some of the \ncruel things he had said during his life to Joe Frazier and to other \npeople and some of the taunts that he did. It just showed the depth and \nthe character of someone we so admired.\n  I thank the gentleman so much for allowing me the opportunity to \nshare that reminiscence about The Greatest.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentleman, and since he referenced the \npoetry and the facts that Muhammad Ali is sometimes actually considered \nthe godfather of rap, I would like to read one thing that he wrote. \nThis is right after the Olympics in 1960:\n\n     To make America the greatest is my goal,\n     So I beat the Russian and I beat the Pole,\n     And for the USA won the medal of gold,\n     Italians said, you're greater than the Cassius of old.\n     We like your name, we like your game,\n     So make Rome your home if you will.\n     I said, I appreciate the hospitality,\n     But the USA is my country still,\n     Because they're waiting to welcome me in Louisville.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).\n  Mrs. BEATTY. I thank my colleague, Congressman Yarmuth.\n  Mr. Speaker, to the rest of my colleagues, it is indeed an honor for \nme to come tonight to share in the life and the legacy of The Greatest, \nof the champ, of Muhammad Ali.\n  Like my colleagues, I followed his career and was mesmerized by his \nwit, his poetry, and, more specifically, his boxing skill.\n  But for me tonight, it was a special honor when I became a Member of \nthis United States Congress. It was during the 113th Congress and the \n44th Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative \nConference. During that conference, each member of the Congressional \nBlack Caucus can submit the name of someone they think has made a \ndifference in the lives of others, whether it was for health care, \nwhether it was for civil rights, or making a difference through \nphilanthropy.\n  As I thought about all of the individuals that I could submit, I was \nvery proud that I submitted the name Muhammad Ali. It was even a \ngreater honor when he received the most votes from my colleagues, and \nhe received one of our Phoenix Awards, named after Ralph Metcalfe.\n  So when I stood on that stage before thousands and thousands of \nindividuals, including the President of these United States, President \nBarack Obama, and watched the video that his family sent because he \nwasn't able to attend that dinner, I sat there, honored and \nproud because this Black man made a difference in the lives of so many \nyoung children, so many adults. And today, we come here and we salute \nand we honor a great legacy.\n\n  So I want to thank you, Congressman Yarmuth, for letting me make this \nsmall contribution.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks).\n  Mr. MEEKS. I thank the gentleman from Louisville.\n  Mr. Speaker, when I heard of the greatest of all time's passing, my \nheart was filled and heavy because he was very significant in my life. \nWhen you just think of him--and I got to meet him first as a young boy. \nI was about 10 years old.\n  My dad was a professional boxer. He is one of 49, one of 49 \nindividuals to get knocked out by Rocky Marciano. But that also brought \nhim into the area where he got to know many of the boxers in training, \net cetera. He would train in the same gym in New York where Sugar Ray \nRobinson was, and where Bundini and Youngblood were, who were always in \nAli's corner. So I got to see Ali, this Cassius Clay train at an early \nage, and fell in love with him immediately.\n  Number one what you could do when you saw Muhammad Ali, at that time \nyou saw a young man who was confident. And yes, as I hear my colleagues \ntalking about his athletic ability and skills, he had all of that.\n  But what I would like to talk about briefly tonight, what was the \nhighest of esteem for Muhammad Ali was his brain. There is nothing that \nAli did that he didn't think about. Everything that he did, there was a \nreason for it.\n  When he first saw this wrestler and how people hated him, this George \nguy, but he saw how all the people were coming to watch and paying all \nof their money because they were talking, he was talking. He said \nhere's a good way to promote myself and to make sure that he could make \nsome money, and so he did that.\n  Then he thought about calling and naming the round that he was \ncalling people in and all of that. And so he did all of those things, \nbut there was a reason for it. He was a promoter. He knew what it took. \nPeople at that time, many of them wanted to go see the Louisville Lip \nshut up, but each time he would win.\n  What I just want to say about Ali, though, his brain and his heart, \nhis brain and his heart. Because throughout my lifetime, I had several \ntimes to be with him and to get to know him a little bit. I will just, \nfor brevity of time, talk about one real quick.\n  I can recall I used to drive him at times when he was in New York. So \nI would get in the car, and he would get in the car. Of course, he is \nthe funniest guy in the world. He would be telling jokes and doing \neverything else. So we were driving down the street in Brooklyn, New \nYork. I remember it like it was yesterday. I stopped at a light. All of \na sudden, Muhammad is looking around, and he jumps out of the car. He \njumps. There were some kids on the corner. He jumps out, and he goes \nand starts shadowboxing with them. The kids are saying: Oh, the champ, \nthe champ is here, the champ is here.\n  He would just talk to them. He was encouraging them to go to school \nand\n\n[[Page H3552]]\n\nencouraging them to do good things. I know because when you listened to \nall of the stories afterwards, individuals were giving personal \nstories. Never would you see an individual as popular and well known as \nAli where an individual could actually talk about a personal story, \nbecause Ali wasn't one that was hidden behind bodyguards or this one or \nthat one. He was one that always wanted to be the man on the street \ninvolved with people to make a difference in their life. He set an \nexample for individuals.\n  So I think of the example, too, because of the size of Ali, I heard \nsomebody talking about the rumble in the jungle. I used to go up to the \ncamp and watch them train in Deer Lake. I was there when he was \ntraining for George Foreman. I was there, stayed up there for about a \nweek. There, again, talk about consciousness, he had these huge rocks, \ntalking about all of the great African American fighters before him \nbecause he never forgot who he was or where he came from, but he had \nthese rocks there, and he was in the gym training.\n  I can remember he would get up on the ropes. He put his hands up, and \nAngelo Dundee would say: Get off the ropes, champ. Get off the ropes. \nGet off the ropes, champ. You are going to get killed on those ropes.\n  About the second round of training, he went over, and he said to \nAngelo: Shut up. I know what I am doing.\n  Nobody knew what he was doing, but he knew what he was doing. He \nalways outthought everyone. He outthought them. That was the key to \nthis thing, the greatest of all time.\n  So, Ali, I say this--I say this because I remember you saying this \none time to someone:\n\n     If you want some gin, I'll get you in 10.\n     If you like wine, it will be round number nine.\n     If you think you're great, you'll fall in eight.\n     If you want to go to heaven, it will be round number seven.\n     But if you want to mix, I'll get you in six.\n     Talk that jive, you'll fall in five.\n     If you want to go like old Moore, I'll get you in four.\n     Mess with me, I'll reduce you to three.\n     If that won't do, you'll fall in two.\n     If the crowd wants some fun, you'll fall in one.\n     Why?\n     Because I float like a butterfly, and I sting like a bee. \n           That's why nobody mess with Muhammad Ali.\n\n  Ali, we love you. We thank you for your contribution not only to \nLouisville, not only to the United States of America, not only to \nAfrican Americans and to Africa, but to everyplace on this planet. You \nare, indeed, God's gift to this great planet. We thank God for your \nlife and times. You will live on forever as the greatest of all time--\nand the prettiest.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. \nButterfield).\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky \n(Mr. Yarmuth) for yielding this evening.\n  I am absolutely embarrassed to come after my friend, Congressman Greg \nMeeks.\n  Why in the world would the gentleman put me on the schedule to come \nto the podium at this very moment?\n  But I thank the gentleman, in any event, for his friendship, and I \nthank the gentleman for his extraordinary leadership. I was in the \ngentleman's hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, a few weeks ago and \nabsolutely enjoyed going to church with him and meeting many of his \nfriends there in Louisville. The gentleman is a great Member of this \nbody, and I thank the gentleman so very much.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, I stand with Congressman Meeks and Congressman \nCohen and all of my colleagues today to recognize and to remember a \ngreat American, a true American hero. We honor and we remember this \nextraordinary life and the accomplishments and the countless \ncontributions of Muhammad Ali.\n  Born just 5 years before me in 1942 in Louisville, Kentucky, Cassius \nMarcellus Clay, Jr., was born to Cassius Marcellus Clay and Mrs. Odessa \nLee Grady Clay. Those were his parents. On March 6, 1964, when I was a \njunior in high school, after joining the Nation of Islam, Cassius Clay \nbecame known as Muhammad Ali.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  Mr. Cohen, I remember it like it was yesterday.\n  His interest in boxing began at the age of 12 after he reported a \nstolen bicycle to a local police officer named Joe Martin, who was also \na boxing trainer. In 1959, Muhammad Ali was the National Golden Gloves \nLight Heavyweight Champion and National Amateur Athletic Union \nchampion. After winning his first 19 fights--and that was absolutely \nincredible, winning his first 19 fights--including 15 knockouts, \nMuhammad Ali defeated Sonny Liston on February 25, 1964, to become the \nWorld Heavyweight Champion.\n  Muhammad Ali would then become the World Heavyweight Champion in \n1964, 1974, and 1978, making him the first fighter to capture the \nheavyweight title on three separate occasions. In 1981, Muhammad Ali \nretired from professional boxing and dedicated his life to promoting \nworld peace, fighting for civil rights, hunger relief, and just basic \nhuman values.\n  His humanitarian work included helping secure the release of 15 U.S. \nhostages. Many of my colleagues may have forgotten about that, but \nMuhammad Ali helped to release 15 U.S. hostages held in Iraq during the \nfirst Gulf War, four hostages held in Lebanon, and conducted goodwill \nmissions to Afghanistan and to Cuba. Muhammad Ali even had the distinct \nhonor of traveling to South Africa to meet Nelson Mandela following \nPresident Mandela's release from prison.\n\n  Ali received numerous awards in his life following his boxing career, \nincluding being inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame, \nreceiving the Arthur Ashe Courage Award by ESPN, the Essence Living \nLegend Award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 by then-\nPresident George W. Bush. The footage of that ceremony has been all \nover the news for the last few days, and I would encourage all of my \ncolleagues to look at it if you haven't. He was given the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom in 2005 by President George W. Bush and the Otto Hahn \nPeace Medal for his work with the U.S. civil rights movement and the \nUnited Nations.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have used enough time this evening. I will simply \nclose. I cannot close like my friend, Congressman Greg Meeks, did a \nmoment ago. That was a masterpiece, and I cannot wait to see the video \nof his closing on another day. It was extraordinary.\n  But I will conclude by saying that Muhammad Ali, the greatest of all \ntime, was not only a champion in the boxing ring, but a champion of \nhuman rights and civil rights, who, during a difficult time in our \nNation's history, stood on principle to end racism and bigotry in this \ncountry.\n  Muhammad Ali, we love you. May God bless you, and may God bless your \nfamily.\n  To the fans of Muhammad Ali all across the world, I thank you for \nsupporting this great American, and I thank you for allowing us to come \ninto your homes and be a part of this tribute this evening.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina \n(Mr. Butterfield).\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush).\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank both of my colleagues for \nallowing me to come before this body to speak on behalf of the people \nof the city of Chicago, the people of the First Congressional District.\n  Mr. Speaker, I must say that although Muhammad Ali was and is a \nnative of Louisville--that is his birthplace--I must also claim that \nChicago is his adoptive city. He spent many, many years in Chicago. He \nbought a home on South Kenwood Avenue in my district.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a young man, a young civil rights activist myself, I \ncan't even express the pride that I had when I would travel down the \nstreet and point out to my young sons and anybody else who was with me \nthat that is where Muhammad Ali lives. He was a man of the \nneighborhoods in Chicago. He touched many people--young people, old \npeople, and people who didn't necessarily share his same political or \nreligious ideas, but he touched them anyhow.\n  Mr. Speaker, Muhammad Ali was a man for all seasons. Yes, he achieved \nprominence in the boxing arena, in the sweet science of boxing, but he\n\n[[Page H3553]]\n\nachieved greatness because of the life that he led both inside of \nboxing and outside of boxing.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Saturday afternoons, many of us who had few heroes \nwould gather around television sets and watch Muhammad Ali fight in the \nheavyweight division against other fighters and other boxers. One of \nhis predictions came true when he defeated and knocked out his \nopposition in the time that he said he would, and there was a \ncollective cheer that you could hear throughout the neighborhoods of \nChicago.\n  He meant something to me. He meant something to others. Muhammad Ali \nnot only achieved, worked hard, and sacrificed for excellence, but he \nalso inspired excellence in others.\n  Muhammad Ali would walk down some of the main thoroughfares in \nChicago: 47th Street, 79th Street, and Madison Avenue. He would walk \ndown those streets, and the crowds would just gather around him and \nfollow him. His beam in his eyes, the halo and the charisma that he had \njust made for an exciting time, a grand time for all of us.\n  Mr. Speaker, Muhammad Ali not only was a great boxer, but he was \nindeed a man for all times. Look at his following not just in \nLouisville, not just on the south and west sides of Chicago, but all \nacross the Nation, all across the world, foreign countries, African \ncountries specifically. The same kind of enthusiasm that he inspired, \nthe same kind of reverence that he inspired to the young men and young \nwomen in Chicago, you could see the same kind of inspiration ran up in \nthe Congo, in Nigeria, in Zaire, and in other places all across the \nworld.\n  Mr. Speaker, when he retired, I remember as a freshman here in \nCongress when we had a session and we honored the 50 greatest athletes \nof the century. Here were some great athletes, but the one who I wanted \nto be with, the one who I was most excited about, the one who I wanted \nto be photographed with was only Muhammad Ali. Bart Starr, Kareem \nAbdul-Jabbar, and many, many others were here; but Muhammad Ali was \nhere, and he kind of sucked the air out of the room.\n  Later, Mr. Speaker, when I chaired the Annual Legislative Conference, \nfor the dinner, the gala--I chaired the gala--I was so honored that he \ncame to me to accept an award from the Congressional Black Caucus with \nhis lovely wife, Lonnie; another great time, another great memory.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, the greatest honor, the greatest moment of \ninspiration, my most profound memory of Muhammad Ali was when he \nrefused to go to fight in the Vietnam war. I think, in my humble \nopinion, had he just been a great champion--we have had other great \nchampions who are African American: Jack Johnson, Sugar Ray Robinson, \nand many others, many, many others who are great champions. But \nMuhammad Ali wasn't just a boxer. He didn't just inspire others to take \nup boxing.\n  I was a political activist in the sixties, and Muhammad Ali spoke to \nthe quintessential aspect of all my activism when he said: Hell no, I \nwon't go. Hell no, I won't go. No Vietnamese have ever called me the N \nword.\n  And he said it. I don't want to say it on the floor, but he said it.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Mr. Speaker, from that moment on, he solidified his appeal, his \nessence, his relationships; he solidified himself with all of the \nstruggling people of the Nation, of the world.\n  Let me just say this: I thought about Muhammad Ali when I heard of \nhis death, and I thought of trying to recapture some of my memories of \nhim--how he walked, his gait, how he talked. I remember his size. I \nremember the face that was also a beautiful face. He was proud of how \nhe looked.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, I guess what inspired me most about Muhammad Ali \nwas how he did not surrender his faith, surrender his belief, surrender \nhis core values to the U.S. Selective Service which drafted him.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't remember the names of the men who were on that \nSelective Service committee. I don't remember anything about them. They \nthought that they were destroying The People's Champion, but they could \nnot destroy The People's Champion. He rose even above all of those \npeople who were officially appointed to bring him down. Nobody could \nknock out Muhammad Ali, in a real sense.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. \nJackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for \nyielding, and I thank all of my friends.\n  We are friends when we come to celebrate someone as potent and \npowerful and, certainly, symbolic. But we should really recognize that \nThe Greatest, Muhammad Ali, who had many homes--many of us can claim \nhaving had the privilege of him walking through many of our streets--\nwas a husband, father, grandfather, and son to all of his family \nmembers that loved him.\n  Today I offer my deepest sympathy to his beautiful wife who worked so \nhard to create the Muhammad Ali Center, all of his children who gained \nhis magnificent talents in many different forms and capacities, to be \nable to now not only suffer this loss, but mourn someone who probably \nin their life created such a space for so many years.\n  I rise today to join in celebrating--for that is what I would like to \ndo--The People's Champion. He was truly the voice of a generation, \nadvocating for the ending of inequality regarding African Americans, \nbut as well, I believe he stood for opposing injustices all around the \nworld.\n  The three-time world heavyweight boxing champion helped define the \nturbulent times in which he reigned as the most charismatic and \ncontroversial sports figure of the 20th century. We all know that he \nwas born Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr.\n  Over the past 30 years, he had his own boxing battle. I believe that \ntime after time he knocked out Parkinson's disease because he lived \nwith it, he let others know that they could live with it, and he worked \nevery day to support the advocacy groups who were trying to battle \nParkinson's.\n  I am reminded of a gold medal at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome and \nbeing crowned the World Heavyweight Champion so many times. As I had \nwatched him over these past years, the admiration and affection and \nrespect grew much more looking at him as the iconic figure, the real \nspirit of can-do, the best of America, a man whose faith was very \nspecial to him, so much so that he was a conscience objective which was \nnot understood. That Selective Service committee was right in Houston, \nTexas. He walked those streets, his case was tried there, and victory \ncame because he refused to yield on his principles.\n  As one of his noteworthy opponents, Floyd Patterson, told author \nDavid Remnick some years ago: ``I came to see that I was a fighter and \nhe was history.''\n  Ali traded banter with United States presidents and world leaders \nalike, verbally sparring with musical greats--The Beatles--and shaking \nhands with Mother Teresa.\n  His greatest triumph lies in his legacy as a champion, leader, social \nactivist, and humanitarian, but also a mentor by distance of so many \nboys and girls, particularly our young men.\n  In my own hometown, a young boxer by the name of Eric Carr, first met \nhim with one of our great sports figures, Lloyd Wells, down at the \nHyatt Regency. He said that when the champ met him, the champ treated \nhim like a longtime friend. He played around with him, maybe boxed with \nhim. I may be adding something to it. But Eric Carr, as the day went \non--it was in the boxing beginnings of his life--told him he wanted to \nbe a champ just like him. Eric Carr went on to win boxing \nchampionships, but he will always remember how real Muhammad Ali was.\n  Let me say that as he fought for the future, he envisioned that we \nall would enjoy. I love to hear the bantering because it was wisdom of \na philosopher.\n  His greatest triumph, as I indicated, was a humanitarian. At the apex \nof his career, lauded for his unparalleled physique and mesmerizing \nmoves--I wish I could do a few of those right now--but he is more than \na sum total of his athletic gifts.\n  His agile mind, buoyant personality, brash self-confidence, wouldn't \nyou love him?\n  I often remember some of those words that he said:\n\n     Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. His hands can't hit \n           what his eyes can't see.\n\n[[Page H3554]]\n\n           Now you see, now you don't. George thinks he will, but \n           I know he won't.\n     Don't count the days; make the days count.\n     I'm young; I'm handsome; I'm fast. I can't possibly be beat.\n\n  But then he said:\n\n       Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on \n     Earth.\n\n  And so his inspiration continues.\n  I would often say that as he lived his life, we took joy.\n  As I close, Mr. Speaker, let me offer you these words, and let me \nthank him for the life that he has lived. Let me borrow from \nShakespeare and say of Muhammad Ali:\n\n       He was a man. Take him for all in all. We shall not look \n     upon his like again.\n\n  May The Greatest rest in peace.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding to me. I still see \nthat ``float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.''\n  Muhammad Ali, again, rest in peace.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of boxing legend \nand social activist Mr. Muhammad Ali, whose words floated like a \nbutterfly and punches stung like a bee, who died Friday at the age of \n74.\n  The people's champion, was truly the voice of a generation, \nadvocating for the African Americans battling racial inequality.\n  The three-time world heavyweight boxing champion helped define the \nturbulent times in which he reigned as the most charismatic and \ncontroversial sports figure of the 20th century.\n  The man who would come to be known as the ``Greatest of All Time,'' \nwas born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on Jan. 17, 1942 in Louisville, \nKentucky.\n  Despite baffling Parkinson's disease for 30 years Muhammad Ali would \nlive a full and consequential life, winning the Gold Medal at the 1960 \nOlympic Games in Rome and being crowned the world Heavyweight champion \nan unsurpassed three times.\n  As one of his noteworthy opponents, Floyd Patterson, told author \nDavid Remnick some years ago, ``I came to see that I was a fighter, \nwhile he was history.''\n  Ali traded banter with United States presidents and world leaders \nalike, verbally sparring with musical greats the Beatles, shaking hands \nwith Mother Teresa.\n  His greatest triumph lies in his legacy as a champion, leader, social \nactivist and humanitarian.\n  At the apex of his career, lauded for his unparalleled physique and \nmesmerizing moves.\n  He carried into the ring a physically lyrical, unorthodox boxing \nstyle fusing speed, agility and power more seamlessly than any boxer \nbefore him or since.\n  But, he was more than the sum total of his athletic gifts; he was a \nman of uncompromising principles.\n  His agile mind, buoyant personality, brash self-confidence and \nevolving set of personal convictions fostered a magnetism that the ring \nalone could not contain.\n  A masterful entertainer, Ali captivated audiences as much with his \nmouth as with his fists, narrating his life with a patter of inventive \ndoggerel.\n  He was targeted by his country when, in 1966, he exercised his First \nAmendment right voicing political dissension and concern for \nhumanitarian observation.\n  Ali was a purposeful fighter, and even more so, a principled human \nbeing, once reminding us all that he would, ``Fight for the prestige, \nnot for [himself], but to uplift [his] little brothers who are sleeping \non concrete floors today in America . . . living on welfare, . . . who \ncan't eat, . . . who don't [have] knowledge of themselves, . . . [and \ncannot see a] future.''\n  Ali fought for the future he envisioned and that we all enjoy today.\n  As a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War, he refused to be \ninducted into drafting leading him to be banned from the sport he loved \nat the height of his career.\n  His inspiring courage and anti-war stance helped spearhead the \ngrowing anti-war movement of the 1960s.\n  The press called him the Louisville Lip. He called himself the \nGreatest.\n  Ali was the most important political-cultural figure to survive the \ndeadly tumult of the 1960s and flourish during the 1970s.\n  Ali reawakened the American consciousness stating, ``Champions are \nmade from something they have deep inside them--a desire, a dream, a \nvision.''\n  He eventually retired for good in 1981 and after being diagnosed with \nParkinson's disease in 1984 as the only fighter to be heavyweight \nchampion three times.\n  In 2005 Muhammad Ali was presented with the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom by President George W. Bush.\n  Ali received the President's Award from the NAACP soon after Obama's \ninauguration in 2009.\n  In 1996, he was trembling and nearly mute as he lit the Olympic \ncaldron in Atlanta, but his smile induced a thunderous roar in what was \none of the most celebrated Olympics moments ever.\n  His post-boxing humanitarian endeavors include putting his name to \nmany initiatives for peace and humanitarian aid as well as anonymous \ndonations of millions of dollars to a variety of individuals and \norganizations surpassing race and class barriers.\n  Despite battling with Parkinson's disease for three decades, he has \ninspired millions of people.\n  His work as a humanitarian has been immortalized in the Muhammad Ali \nCentre.\n  Explaining his resolve later in life, Ali said that, ``All my life, \ngrowing up as a little boy, I always said that if I got famous I'd do \nthings for my people that other people wouldn't do.''\n  ``I am an ordinary man who worked hard to develop the talent I was \ngiven,'' he said.\n  He was truly a legend--a statesman of the people.\n  Muhammad Ali was a product of America but a citizen of the world, at \nfirst hated and misunderstood but eventually beloved for the way he \ncarried himself in dignified decline.\n  He will remain one of the most well-known and respected sports \nfigures of all time--may his legacy be revered.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me borrow from Shakespeare and say of \nthe Muhammad Ali:\n  ``He was a man.\n  Take him for all in all.\n  We shall not look upon his like again.''\n  May the ``The Greatest'' rest in peace.\n\n         The Sayings of Muhammad Ali--The Greatest of All Time\n\n       Muhammad Ali, considered to be the greatest heavyweight \n     boxer, died June 3, 2016 in a Phoenix-area hospital.\n       He was 74 years old.\n       Here is a list of some of his best quotes (in no particular \n     order):\n       1. ``Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. His hands \n     can't hit what his eyes can't see. Now you see me, now you \n     don't. George thinks he will, but I know he won't.''\n       2. ``Service to others is the rent you pay for your room \n     here on earth.''\n       3. ``I'm young; I'm handsome; I'm fast. I can't possibly be \n     beat.''\n       4. ``Don't count the days; make the days count.''\n       5. ``If my mind can conceive it, and my heart can believe \n     it--then I can achieve it.'' Jesse Jackson said this as early \n     as 1983, according to the Associated Press, and Ali used it \n     in his 2004 book.\n       6. ``It's hard to be humble when you're as great as I am.''\n       7. ``It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you \n     out; it's the pebble in your shoe.''\n       8. ``If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up \n     and apologize.''\n       9. ``Braggin' is when a person says something and can't do \n     it. I do what I say.''\n       10. ``I am the greatest, I said that even before I knew I \n     was.''\n       11. ``Only a man who knows what it is like to be defeated \n     can reach down to the bottom of his soul and come up with the \n     extra ounce of power it takes to win when the match is \n     even.''\n       12. ``I'm so mean, I make medicine sick.''\n       13. ``I should be a postage stamp. That's the only way I'll \n     ever get licked.''\n       14.``Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small \n     men who find it easier to live in the world they've been \n     given than to explore the power they have to change it. \n     Impossible is not a fact. It's an opinion. Impossible is not \n     a declaration. It's a dare. Impossible is potential. \n     Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing.''\n       15. ``He who is not courageous enough to take risks will \n     accomplish nothing in life.''\n       16. ``A man who views the world the same at 50 as he did at \n     20 has wasted 30 years of his life.''\n       17. ``If they can make penicillin out of moldy bread, they \n     can sure make something out of you.''\n       18. ``I shook up the world. Me! Whee!''\n       19. ``I hated every minute of training, but I said, `Don't \n     quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a \n     champion.' ''\n       20. ``At home I am a nice guy: but I don't want the world \n     to know. Humble people, I've found, don't get very far.''\n       21. ``A man who has no imagination has no wings.''\n       22. ``He's (Sonny Liston) too ugly to be the world champ. \n     The world champ should be pretty like me!''\n       23. ``I am the astronaut of boxing. Joe Louis and Dempsey \n     were just jet pilots. I'm in a world of my own.''\n       24. ``I've wrestled with alligators. I've tussled with a \n     whale. I done handcuffed lightning. And throw thunder in \n     jail.''\n       25. ``Hating people because of their color is wrong. And it \n     doesn't matter which color does the hating. It's just plain \n     wrong.''\n       26. ``It's not bragging if you can back it up.''\n       27. ``I'm the most recognized and loved man that ever lived \n     cuz there weren't no satellites when Jesus and Moses were \n     around, so people far away in the villages didn't know about \n     them.''\n       28. ``It's just a job. Grass grows, birds fly, waves pound \n     the sand. I beat people up.''\n       29. ``I'm not the greatest, I'm the double greatest.''\n       30. ``Live everyday as if it were your last because someday \n     you're going to be right.''\n\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.\n  I yield once again to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).\n\n[[Page H3555]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, there is so much that has been said \nappropriately about Muhammad Ali that people in this era might not \nrealize that when he was fighting, all of America really looked forward \nto his fights and watched them. The eyes of the Nation were glued to \nthe television to see him fight and to see afterwards Howard Cosell \nspeaking the sports talk to him and reviewing those fights.\n  He was a lot about Louisville. There is a street in Louisville named \nafter him, Muhammad Ali Boulevard, and the Muhammad Ali Center.\n  Nobody carries on and will carry on Muhammad Ali's love of Louisville \nmore than you, Mr. Yarmuth. I appreciate you having this hour. He was \nto Louisville in such a great way, and he was a great man to America. I \nthank you for putting this hour together.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine \nWaters).\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Yarmuth for \nhosting this hour.\n  Muhammad Ali was a good friend. He was someone that I had known that \nI had worked on some projects with. But more than that, my husband was \none of those athletes. My husband was then the linebacker for the \nCleveland Browns when Bill Russell and my husband, Sidney Williams, and \nJim Brown all got together to support Muhammad Ali when, of course, he \nwas not allowed to be a conscientious objector and was threatened with \nprison.\n  I got to know him sometime after that. We used his home for a very \nspecial event. I got to know his former wife, Veronica, and his \nchildren. One of his children worked in one of my programs.\n  This comes at a very difficult time for all of us. I loved him \nbecause he had courage. He had the courage to give up his career, had \nthe courage to threaten to be imprisoned, and had the courage to fight. \nThe Nation of Islam stood with him, and these athletes all stood with \nhim. He was a great man. When he said he was The Greatest, he really \nwas, because he was an unusual extraordinaire.\n  I will be at the funeral on Friday. I will be there with the family \nand the rest of the athletes that are still living that are going to be \nthere to honor him.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.\n  I yield again to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for a \nquick comment.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank Mr. Yarmuth and say that I \ncouldn't leave the mic without acknowledging that George Foreman is in \nHouston, and Evander Holyfield, only to say that the people that he \nfought became his dear friends. I know they would want me to say that.\n  Thank you so very much for allowing us to pay tribute to The \nGreatest.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, as we wrap up this tribute to the life of \nMuhammad Ali, I just want to express what I know all of my colleagues \nwould feel, and that is our outpouring of love and support for Lonnie, \nhis wife of 25 years, his many children, and his extended family. \nLonnie's love and dedication inspired and energized Ali, even when his \nbody was failing him. I know that the hearts of this body as well as \nthe world go out to her and the rest of Muhammad Ali's family.\n  May he rest in peace. I thank him on behalf of everyone for his great \ncontributions to humanity.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of a man who was a \nthree-time heavyweight champion of the world, a victor at the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, and one of the most remarkable men of the \n20th Century--a man who truly earned his title: The Greatest.\n  Muhammad Ali was born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. in Louisville, \nKentucky on January, 17, 1942. By age 18, he was the Light Heavyweight \nGold Medalist at the 1960 Olympics. In 1964, he won the heavyweight \nworld title. He would go on to hold that title--off-and-on--for another \n15 years.\n  But Muhammad Ali was not merely one of the greatest fighters in \nhistory--he was also a champion of justice in a country struggling to \nfind its way. Like Detroit's own great champion, Joe Louis, he was a \nlightning rod for controversy. His success angered those who disagreed \nwith the simple principle that a person's worth was never lessened by \nthe color of their skin. He showed courage when he stood up for civil \nrights at a time when it was dangerous to do so. He never backed down, \nnever allowed his voice to be silenced because of his faith or his \nrace. He was an example for countless men, women, and children who \nneeded one.\n  Beyond his work in the ring and as part of the civil rights movement, \nMuhammad Ali was also an advocate for peace. He grew into his faith in \na way that shows that Islam is a religion of peace and America is a \nplace of tolerance when--at great personal cost--he spoke out against \nthe Vietnam War. As a conscientious objector, he was stripped of his \ntitle and unable to fight for three years during his prime.\n  Convicted of refusing to report for military service, he appealed to \nthe United States Supreme Court, where he won a unanimous (8-0) opinion \nreversing his conviction.\n  A champion boxer, a champion for civil rights, and a champion of \npeace--it is not possible to overstate Muhammad Ali's achievements. He \nwas quite simply, The Greatest.\n  We will mourn his memory going forward, and we will remember him for \nhis work. Most of all, we will continue to draw strength and \ninspiration from a man who knew the true meaning of being a Champion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/house-section/article/H3555-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3555-H3557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             STOP THE FRANK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Costello of Pennsylvania). Under the \nSpeaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Woodall) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of \nthe majority leader.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I am slow to come to the floor because you \ncan't compete with a Muhammad Ali commemorative Special Order. That is \ntoo much passion to follow. I just have little old legislative business \non my mind. I am not talking about changing the world. I am just \ntalking about changing our little part of the world.\n  I don't know if you remember, Mr. Speaker, when you first got here, \nyou had to go downstairs and sign your name so that we could use that \ninstead of a postage stamp on every piece of mail that you sent out the \ndoor. It is called the franking privilege.\n  I have a bill--it is H.R. 1873--that Tammy Duckworth and I introduced \ntogether to abolish that franking privilege. It is not going to take a \nlot to get that done. It is something that is within the complete \ncontrol of us here in this institution, but it has been a challenge \nthat is hundreds of years in the making.\n  I put mine on here, Mr. Speaker. This is my signature there on the \nfront of every envelope I send out. If you want to know how to forge a \ncheck in my name, all you need to do is look at any envelope I send out \nthe door.\n  Back in the day, had we been here in 1817, it might have been hard to \nfind a postage stamp. In the name of getting congressional business \ndone, the law of the land, carried over from England, was that you \ncould sign your name on all of your government documents in order to \nget that important government business done. You couldn't just walk \ndown to the local grocery store and buy stamps. You had to have a \nmechanism for getting your constitutional responsibilities \naccomplished.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  We do that still here today. In these cynical times, Mr. Speaker, I \nwould tell you that I hear most often from folks that they think one of \ntwo things is going on with the franking privilege: one, that we are \ninvolved in some sort of incumbent protection plan--self-promotion here \nin this institution, self-glorification--by sending our names out on \nthe front of all of the mail that goes out the door. If not that, I \nhear the second criticism, which is, Rob, why do Members of Congress \nget free mail? The Postal Service is in dire straits--free mail for all \nMembers of Congress.\n  It is not free mail. For every letter that goes out the door that \nreads ``Rob Woodall'' up at the top, I get a bill. I get a bill from \nthe United States Postal Service for what a stamp would have cost had I \nput it on that letter. For every piece of mail that goes out the door \nwith ``Rob Woodall'' written up at the top, I get a bill from the \nPostal Service for whatever the bulk rate would have been for the large \namounts of mail that I send out the door. It is not free mail for \nMembers of Congress. I want to dispel that myth.\n\n[[Page H3556]]\n\n  I get all of the emails that I know so many of my colleagues do, \nwhich read: ``Go and serve one term in Congress, and get your pension \nfor life.'' Nonsense. Not true. I do get the emails that come in and \nthat talk about the special health care privileges that Congress has \nand that nobody else can have access to. Come on down, and join the \nObamaCare exchange. You can have the same health care privileges that I \nhave. Of all of the myths that go on out there, the myth of free mail \ncontinues still today. It is not free mail. We just don't put a stamp \non it. Why don't we end this confusion once and for all?\n  I would like to tell you that this was my brilliant idea--a small \nidea but my brilliant idea. Not true. We, actually, went down this road \nin the 1800s. I hold here--Mr. Speaker, you can't read it--an article \nfrom The New York Times on March 3, 1875.\n  It reads:\n\n       By a vote of 113-65, the House has concurred in the Senate \n     amendment to the postal appropriations bill partially \n     restoring the franking privilege. The precise extent of this \n     restoration is an allowance of free transmission through the \n     mail on a Congressional frank of the Congressional Record, \n     agricultural reports and seeds, and all public documents now \n     printed or authorized to be printed.\n\n  The New York Times, as it is still known for today, goes on to \neditorialize just a bit:\n\n       So far, as our observation goes, there has never been any \n     demand for the restoration of the franking nuisance except on \n     the part of Congressmen. The new men, especially, long for a \n     taste of the sweets of privilege.\n\n  This the New York Times in 1875. The ``sweets of privilege'' is how \nthey described the signing of one's name to a constituent's response so \nyou can tell your constituents how it is that you feel about the war in \nIraq, so you can tell folks how you feel about the FCC's new \nregulations, so that you can respond to that young Eagle Scout \napplicant who wants to get the Citizenship in the Nation merit badge.\n  We knew in the 1800s that something just didn't seem right about not \nusing stamps like everybody else did. We knew that something didn't \nfeel quite right. For several years, we abolished the franking \nprivilege, and then we brought it back.\n  I don't have any problem finding stamps, Mr. Speaker. If anybody in \nthis institution has problems finding stamps, I have several local \nlocations that are here by the Capitol. You can send a staffer down to \npick up stamps in bulk. For me, I am in the Longworth House Office \nBuilding, up on the seventh floor, so I have got to go all the way down \nto the basement in order to buy my stamps. It is about seven floors \naway.\n  They don't do that anywhere else in Washington, D.C. They don't do \nthat. If you are at the IRS and if you need to send out a tax form, you \ndon't sign your name at the top of the letter. If you work over at the \nDepartment of Agriculture and if you need to send out a newsletter, you \ndon't sign your name at the top, because everybody else in government \nuses what is called ``penalty mail.'' It is the same stamp up at the \ntop of a corner that any businessperson would use, that any bulk mail \nhouse would use. It is section 3202. It is called ``penalty mail.''\n  It reads:\n\n       Subject to limitations imposed by sections 3204 and 3207 of \n     this title, there may be transmitted as penalty mail official \n     mail of officers of the Government of the United States, the \n     Smithsonian Institution, the Pan-American Union, the Pan-\n     American Sanitary Bureau, the United States Employment \n     Service, and the system of employment offices operated by it \n     in conformity with the provisions of section 4949(c).\n\n  Understand that we have a special section in the United States Code \nthat deals with how mail gets out the door, because it is very \ndifficult. We have only been doing it for a couple of hundred years. It \nrequires some special attention from the United States Code, so we have \na special section of the Code that allows officers of the Government of \nthe United States, of the Smithsonian Institution, of the Pan-American \nUnion, of the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau, and of the United States \nEmployment Service some special dispensation so they can get mail out \nthe door.\n  But was that good enough for Congress? The answer is ``no.'' Congress \nhas yet another special exception beyond the special exception, as is \nhighlighted in section A, ``officers of the Government of the United \nStates other than Members of Congress,'' because what we have is our \nspecial signature program.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have got big things we have got to solve in this \ncountry--big things we have got to solve. You can't solve those big \nthings when folks believe that you are not telling them the truth about \nthe little things. You have got to build trust with one another. You \nhave got to build trust with one another not just here in this \ninstitution but with our constituencies back home; but when people see \nwhat they think is free mail that is going out the door, it undermines \nthat trust.\n\n  I refer now to the House Manual, Mr. Speaker:\n\n       Postal expenses incurred only when the frank is \n     insufficient, such as certified, registered, insured, \n     express, foreign mail, and stamped, self-addressed envelopes \n     related to the recovery of official items, are reimbursable. \n     Postage may not be used in lieu of the frank.\n\n  I got to Capitol Hill, Mr. Speaker, and I thought: Do you know what? \nI know what it is like not to be on Capitol Hill. I am going to go get \na bulk mail permit.\n  They said, No, Rob. You can't get a bulk mail permit to send out mail \non Capitol Hill.\n  I said, Most of what I do isn't bulk mail. I will go buy stamps to \nsend that out.\n  They said, No, Rob. You can't buy stamps to send out mail. You have \nto sign your card. You have to put your signature on it. We have to \nhave a special congressional mail privilege for you.\n  Tammy Duckworth and I--one Republican, one Democrat--say we can do \nbetter than that. It is an election year. Do you know what happens in \nan election year? The law of the land is: you can't send out mail \nanymore. If I have a town hall meeting that is going on next week, I \ncouldn't have sent out an invitation last month to have invited you to \ncome meet your Congressman. I couldn't have sent out a newsletter last \nmonth to have told you what we were doing with the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. I couldn't have sent out a newsletter last month to \nhave told you about an employment and jobs fair program that was going \non, because the law of the land so recognizes this privilege as \nsomething that incumbents use to boost their election prospects that it \nis banned in the 90 days before any election.\n  So I ask you: If this practice is so offensive that we ban it within \n90 days before any election, why don't we just do away with it \naltogether? If it is so offensive that it must be banned for 180 days \nout of the year, why don't we do away with it for the other 180 days, \ntoo?\n  I don't need my name on the front of every letter that goes out the \ndoor, and I don't need someone to protect me from the challenges of \nbuying stamps; but I have rules in place that prevent postage from \nbeing used in lieu of the frank.\n  I serve on the Budget Committee, Mr. Speaker. I want to balance the \nFederal budget. We are not going to do it with this bill. I am the lead \nsponsor of the FairTax. It is the most fundamental reconstruction of \nour Tax Code that has happened since the income tax came into being in \nthe early 1900s. It is the most prominently cosponsored piece of \nfundamental tax reform legislation in this body. Those are serious \npieces of legislation. This is something minor--this is around the \nedges--but the National Taxpayers Union has seen fit to say that \nrepealing the so-called ``franking privilege'' is a simple reform to \nintroduce pay-as-you-go budgeting. It is absolutely right. Public \nCitizen hardly supports the Woodall-Duckworth legislation to rein in \nthe abuse of taxpayer-funded franked mail.\n  I want to do the big things together, and I want to do the things \nthat matter together. When silly things like this undermine the sacred \ntrust that we have with our constituents, they need to go. Our \ncolleagues who served in this body in the 1870s knew it. They abolished \nit, but they just couldn't let it go, and they brought it back. Even \nThe New York Times asked: Where was the outcry for free congressional \nmail? Why was it brought back yet again?\n  I tried to get this done on my own. I say to my colleagues that I \ndidn't want to waste your time in this way. I tried\n\n[[Page H3557]]\n\nto go to the Chief Administrative Office to see if I could just get an \nexception so I didn't have to send out this mail. I tried to go through \nthe House Administration Committee to see if there was some sort of \ndispensation so that I could opt out of this system. I tried to go \nthrough the Office of the Speaker to see if my MRA could be spent in a \ndifferent way so I didn't have to perpetuate this. Again, it is a \npractice that is, apparently, so hideous it is outlawed for 180 days \nout of the year; but I couldn't get any of those things done.\n  Now it has come down to us to pass that simple line of code. It is a \nbipartisan bill--Rob Woodall, Tammy Duckworth, a host of other \ncosponsors. I invite you to join me to abolish the franking privilege. \nYou are welcome to use our hashtag of ``Stop the Frank'' any time you \nfeel like you can move that forward. We are not going to reestablish \ntrust overnight, but with one little accountability action at a time, \nwe can do it. Let's do this little one today. Let's show up again and \ndo another one and tomorrow and do another one and the next day and do \nanother one and the next day and do another one. Then we are going to \nwake up a year from now or a month from now or a week from now, and we \nare going to find out that we have really made a difference together.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. \nFoxx), my friend from the Rules Committee.\n\n\n                               Skills Gap\n\n  Ms. FOXX. I thank my colleague from Georgia.\n  Mr. Speaker, I frequently hear from employers who are struggling to \nfind employees with the right experience and technical skills to meet \nworkforce needs.\n  The passage of the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity \nAct was an important step for the millions of Americans who are looking \nfor work and for the employers who have 5 million-plus job \nopportunities that remain unfilled due to the skills gap. However, \ngreat jobs are still going unfilled. Americans are still missing out on \nrewarding careers, and many businesses are still suffering.\n  For example, in the AED Foundation's 2016 Workforce Survey Report, \nmore than 50 percent of equipment distributors indicated that the \nskills gap hindered company growth and increased costs and \ninefficiencies while nearly 75 percent said the lack of skilled \ntechnicians made it difficult to meet customer demand.\n  It is imperative that the Department of Labor finalizes regulations \nfor WIOA and that Congress strengthens the Carl D. Perkins Career and \nTechnical Education Act.\n  I appreciate very much my friend from Georgia and my colleague on the \nRules Committee for yielding to me in order to discuss this important \nissue to so many of us.\n  Mr. WOODALL. If my colleagues don't know, one is used to seeing the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina leading on the Education and the \nWorkforce Committee. All day today, she has been leading on the Rules \nCommittee--chairing those actions that are going on up there. I hoped \nshe was here to file a rule to tell us that that process had been moved \nright along, but we will have to wait for that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/house-section/article/H3557-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3557-H3562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1915\n                     FLOODING IN THE STATE OF TEXAS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al \nGreen) for 30 minutes.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on the subject of my Special \nOrder. That subject, Mr. Speaker, will be flooding in the State of \nTexas.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I and a good many of my \ncolleagues will speak tonight about circumstances that are occurring in \nTexas more often than we would care to see. In a sense, Mr. Speaker, \nthis is a continuation of a mission of mercy that we embarked upon \nearlier this year when we were having flooding in Houston, Texas.\n  These floods that we are having across the length and breadth of our \nState are causing great property damage, and that is worthy of a lot of \nconsideration and it is worthy of being addressed on the floor of the \nHouse of Representatives. But we also have a good many lives that have \nbeen lost across the length and breadth of our State, and these, of \ncourse, are of paramount importance to us. So while we may make some \nreferences to the property damages and there will be some things said \nabout possible solutions, I believe that we will say a good deal about \nthe lives that have been lost.\n  At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas' 27th \nCongressional District (Mr. Farenthold) to give his comments.\n  Mr. Farenthold has experienced some flooding, and I am honored to \nhave him appear and tell us about what is happening to his constituents \nin the 27th Congressional District.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to be \nhere.\n  A little over a year ago, there were some horrible floods just \noutside the district I represent in Wimberley, Texas, that took the \nlives of several constituents vacationing there in Corpus Christi, \nTexas. In fact, some of the bodies of the young children who perished \nin that horrible flood have yet to be recovered. My family's prayers \nand the prayers of the Nation go to those grieving families and the \nsurvivors and for the repose of the souls of those who passed.\n  There has been a lot of flooding in Texas over the past year or so, \njust as recently as last week. I represent Wharton, Texas. The river in \nWharton rose just as it had gotten repairs from the previous flood a \nfew months earlier. All the Sheetrock was newly installed and ready to \ngo; and sure enough, another flood comes and the damage to the property \ncontinues.\n  Unfortunately, the floods of last week and the previous weeks did not \nresult in loss of life in the district that I represent. Thank the Lord \nfor that.\n  I tell you, in the past 14 months, another county I represent, \nBastrop, has experienced the worst flooding it has seen in 35 years. It \nis currently dealing with $2.5 million in damaged infrastructure, and \n20 roads still remain closed today. Of the 100-plus homes damaged in \nthe past 14 months, more than half were determined to be unlivable, and \nfour families still remain in temporary housing.\n  Earlier, in Wharton County, more than 1,000 people were evacuated and \n150 homes flooded. It has really been tough.\n  I was driving through and visited with the emergency management folks \nin Wharton. You look at the fields of green. I posted on Instagram the \npicture of a milo field. It said, ``Amber waves of flooded grain.'' \nCotton fields are under water as well.\n  In addition to the property damage, I think our farmers in Texas may \nsuffer from an overabundance of water. As I grew up in a farming \nfamily, our complaint was it either rained too much, too little, or at \nthe wrong time. I will tell you that these floods have just been \nhorrible in Texas.\n  I do want to thank the folks from FEMA, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, for their quick response.\n  What it has told us is that we are taking way too much time for \nprojects to stem the flooding, levees and the like, to get approved by \nthe Army Corps of Engineers and the other Federal agencies. The funding \nfor it is difficult to come by.\n  We end up spending all this money with FEMA. If some of that money \nwere redirected to preventive maintenance or preventing these floods, \nwe might save lives and certainly save property as well. I think it is \nsomething that this Congress should look at: preventing problems rather \nthan just reacting to them.\n  I also want to commend the first responders and the emergency \nmanagement personnel throughout Texas who have done so much. I also \nwant to offer my thoughts and prayers to those brave servicemen who \nperished in Texas in the training exercises as well.\n\n[[Page H3558]]\n\n  It has been a tough few months here back in Texas. But you know what? \nWe are Texans, and we will survive. We will mourn those we have lost, \nand we will rebuild, and we will continue to reflect that which is the \ngreatest of the American spirit: perseverance through adversity.\n  I thank Mr. Al Green for the opportunity to speak.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Farenthold) for the unity that is engendered by his being here \ntonight.\n  It is important for people to know that this is not a time for \nDemocrats or a time for Republicans. This is a time for Texans to come \ntogether and to talk about some of the concerns that we have and to \nremember those who have lost their lives in these floods.\n  At this time, I am honored to yield to a neighbor who is from the \n22nd Congressional District of Texas. He is south of me. Of course, I \nspeak of the Honorable Pete Olson. We are honored to have him with us \ntonight, and we welcome your commentary about some of the concerns in \nyour district and, indeed, across the State.\n\n  I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson).\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and neighbor to the east, \nMr. Al Green, for holding this very Special Order about floods we have \nhad in Texas.\n  It has been a rough year in Texas' 22nd Congressional District. Last \nMemorial Day, we had the 100-year flood and lost one life, one who \ndrove into a flooded small creek and died in their vehicle.\n  Tax day 2016, there was lots of street flooding. I had to move my \npickup truck off my street before it was taken over by the water.\n  The worst came 2 weeks ago, the 500-year flood. The Brazos River came \nout of its banks like never before. That river cuts through the heart \nof my district. It first hit Simonton, a small town in the northwest \npart of Fort Bend County. They had a mandatory evacuation on May 29. \nEvery home, except for 12, left. Almost all the homes have been \nflooded.\n  Next, was Richmond and Rosenberg. Two days after Simonton, they, too, \nhad mandatory evacuations and had homes north of the railroad track \nflooded.\n  Next came my hometown of Sugar Land. We had to cancel our Memorial \nDay celebration because our park was flooded.\n  Next came Missouri City, Sienna Plantation, floods there. It crossed \nover Brazoria County and went down to Rosharon, and that place was \nflooded out as well. Luckily, God willing, we lost no lives these past \ncouple of weeks.\n  I saw the greatest in Texans this past week. I put 500 miles on my \npickup truck in 8 days. At our Fort Bend emergency command operations \ncenter, people from all over the region had taken pizza, Chick-fil-A, \ncoffee, Shipley Do-Nuts, kolaches, making sure these people who were \nworking 24/7 are fed.\n  I saw an old-fashioned cattle drive. Sheriff Troy Nehls led other \nsheriffs on a cattle drive, moving some cattle down flooded 90, away \nfrom the threat of floods.\n  But the best, my friend, was 2 days ago. My wife, Nancy, and I drove \nover the river and went down to Rosenberg, Texas, to be with B.F. Terry \nHigh School. There was a recovery center giving out goods to people in \nneed. This effort was started by what is called The Church, Second Mile \nMinistry, and Lamar Consolidated Independent School District, who \nopened up B.F. Terry High School. Every single day they said, ``We need \nmore rooms. We have to have more space,'' and they got it.\n  Nancy and I were assigned to stuffing small bags with one roll of \ntoilet paper, a toothbrush, some toothpaste, some shampoo, some soap, \nand a razor. We were supervised by three young ladies: Rachel, \nIsabella, and Layla. They were a true team of Texans, my friend. I \ncalled Rachel ``the skipper'' because, man, she was in charge. I called \nIsabella ``the executive officer'' because she was number two in making \nsure everything worked well. And Layla was ``the weapons officer.'' \nDon't mess with Layla. I failed my inspection the first two times. I \ncould not get the bag closed. They got on my back and made sure that I \nclosed that bag so people could have all they needed in times of \ncrisis.\n  That is what makes Texas so great, my friend: not waiting for D.C., \nbut neighbors helping neighbors in need. Those ladies know what the \nBible says: love thy neighbor more than thyself.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for not \nonly what he has said tonight, but for what he has been doing in his \ndistrict to help persons in times of need. It is greatly appreciated by \nhis constituents, and I greatly appreciate you coming to the floor \ntonight to let people know that we in Texas are standing together, and \nwe are going to work together and we will get through this, but it \nwon't hurt if we can get a little bit of help.\n  I am honored to have another colleague, who has a district that is in \nHouston. Of course, he has been in Congress for many years, and I \nconsider him a very dear friend, the Honorable Gene Green, from the \n29th Congressional District in Houston, Texas.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green).\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and \nnamesake from Houston, Congressman Al Green. I appreciate his effort, \nboth on the legislation that we are cosponsors of, but also setting up \nthese Special Orders. It is great to have bipartisan support.\n  As we found out in Houston, it doesn't matter if you are a Democrat \nor a Republican. If your house gets flooded, your cars get flooded, in \nsome cases, the lives of your family and your neighbors are in \njeopardy, as Texans, we work together.\n  I have watched this over the years because we have had some terrible \nfloods over the years, whether it be Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, \nHurricane Ike in 2008, or what we are seeing now in May of 2015, which \nwe called the Memorial Day flooding that was devastating and included \nmore than 11 inches of rain and $3 billion in damage. But in April of \n2016, this year, Houston and areas experienced what we call the \ndevastating tax day flooding on April 18 that claimed lives and caused \nhundreds of millions of dollars in damage.\n  In the last 3 weeks, just before Memorial Day, we also have seen \nhistoric rainfalls and subsequent flooding. The rain in the Houston \narea has ceased, but downstream in Brazoria County is my colleague from \nFort Bend, just southwest of Houston, the flooding has continued. An \nestimated 200,000 residents, nearly two-thirds of the population of \nBrazoria County, have been affected by the flooding. Once again, I \nstand before this body while southeast Texas is under water.\n  Once again, I stand with my Houston colleagues and ask the House of \nRepresentatives to give our constituents the resources we need to \nprotect lives and property in the future.\n  I have worked with my colleague, Al Green, on H.R. 5025, to \nappropriate $311 million to complete our bayou system. These projects \nare not imaginary. They are ideas that would help, and these projects \nduring the process would save lives. These are projects that the Corps \nof Engineers have said that they have approved. We just don't have the \nmoney to complete them.\n\n  In the Houston area, we have a number of bayou systems that actually \nstart in Congressman Olson's, Congressman Al Green's, Congressman \nCulberson's, and Congressman McCaul's districts. But it runs through my \narea because I have the eastern side of Harris County, where Buffalo \nBayou and the Houston Ship Channel are located. We are downstream from \nthose, and we see that flooding ourselves. I ask the House to bring our \nbill to the floor and to help mitigate the suffering of these thousands \nof Texans.\n  Earlier this month, our office received early notification that the \nUnited States is entering hurricane season as of June 1. Once again, \nthe problem could be expanded. Like I said earlier, in 2001, Tropical \nStorm Allison hit the Texas Gulf Coast and devastated my area of east \nand north Houston. In 2008, Hurricane Ike caused citywide flooding and \nhundreds of millions of dollars in damage. Again, it came over our \ndistrict in east Harris County.\n  Now we face another hurricane season with the possibility of extended \ndamage and no protection for our vulnerable citizens. Houstonians \ncontinue\n\n[[Page H3559]]\n\nto suffer the effects of Mother Nature, and we have the ability to help \nthem. The President has declared Houston a disaster area a number of \ntimes.\n  Again, with hurricane season upon us, we would like to see that \nCongress responds and acts on H.R. 5025 as the best option now.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Again, these are flood control projects that have been approved. We \njust don't have the money. Of course, in Houston, Harris County, we \nhave a flood control district that we pay our property tax to. They \nhave to come up with a match for the Federal funding, so it is not all \nFederal funding taking care of our problems. It is actually local folks \nalso paying up to be able to keep our houses and homes from flooding \nand our families and neighbors from drowning.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 5025. I want to thank my \ncolleague, Al Green, for his leadership on this. We will continue to \nask our colleagues to help even through this hurricane season. It \ndoesn't end until typically the end of October. Again, I thank the \ngentleman for yielding to me.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I thank my colleague for coming to the floor. \nI know a good many of his constituents--he and I are often in each \nother's districts. I know that they are exceedingly pleased that he has \ntaken up this cause. My hope is that he and I will continue with this \nmission of mercy, if you will, such that we will bring to fruition some \nsolutions for the problems that we encounter not only in Houston, but \nalso across the length and breadth of our State.\n  I am honored to yield, Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman from the 20th \nCongressional District of Texas (Mr. Castro), who is in Congress not as \na neophyte. I believe he has been here now into his second term. He has \ndone an outstanding job since he arrived in Congress. We are honored to \nhear from him about some of his concerns and his constituents.\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Green for \nyielding me this time and for organizing tonight's discussion on the \ndevastation our State has seen in recent weeks and months. I know that \nhis city of Houston has experienced truly horrific flooding and \ndestruction, and I offer my condolences to him and to the entire \nHouston community.\n  These storms have been severe and deadly. We all mourn the loss of \nnine soldiers training at Fort Hood whose lives were taken way too soon \nin floodwaters last week. Six other people across Texas have also died \nas a result of the storms as well. My prayers are with the families and \nloved ones of all those whose lives were claimed by this terrible \nflooding.\n  Some of the most destructive weather that my hometown, San Antonio, \nexperienced was back in April when three hailstorms struck our city. \nThe Insurance Council of Texas estimates that those storms caused more \nthan $2 billion in damage, and the Council projects $1.93 billion in \nlosses from auto and homeowner claims.\n  It is not unusual for San Antonio to get a foot of rain by early June \neach year, but rainfall totals are already double that amount so far in \n2016. All of this precipitation is a major economic hit to our city, \nand it poses a real threat to people's well-being.\n  I urge folks in San Antonio and across Texas to educate themselves on \nstorm and flood safety. I also encourage Texans who have questions \nabout what help the Federal Government can provide during this trying \ntime to reach out to their Members of Congress. You see a number of us \nhere on the House floor tonight drawing attention to this issue, \nspecifically the issue of flooding in Texas. We are deeply concerned, \nand we are here to offer any assistance that we can.\n  I would also say to Congressman Green that in addition to what has \nbeen the tragic loss of life and the obvious property destruction \nwrought by these floods, there is also an untold cost in the flooding. \nI grew up in a few neighborhoods in San Antonio where we didn't have \nsidewalks, for example.\n  Often in lower income areas or even in middle-income areas, older \nparts of the city that don't have sidewalks and don't have the proper \ninfrastructure to deal with even mid-level flooding. People's basements \nor garages will flood, ruining a lot of property. These are folks who \noftentimes are renters or don't have insurance, and so there is really \nno recourse for them. They end up just paying the price.\n  It really speaks to the importance of the work that we do, the States \ndo, and the local governments do in making sure that infrastructure is \nproperly built, that it is built across cities and counties, and that \nflooding is prevented everywhere it can be.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I greatly appreciate the \ngentleman sharing time with us on the floor tonight. He has spoken very \neloquently about some of the concerns that go beyond the visible \nproperty damages.\n  Ostensibly things happen, but there are some other things that are \nhappening that we don't always uncover. When these things happen to \npoor people, the damages can exceed far more than the eye can see. I am \ngrateful that he has called some of these things to our attention. \nThank you very much.\n  At this time, I am going to call upon another colleague. All of these \nare dear friends. These are persons who have come to the floor tonight, \nquite frankly, not in a bipartisan effort, but more in a nonpartisan \neffort. There is no partisanship associated with what we do. We work \ntogether on these issues.\n  I am honored to yield to the gentleman from the 14th Congressional \nDistrict, the Honorable Randy Weber. He is one of my neighbors as well. \nI welcome you, and I yield to him, my dear friend.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. I thank my good friend, Congressman Green from \nHouston, for yielding to me. I appreciate that. He is the consummate \ngentleman. I appreciate him lining this up and helping us to draw \nattention to it.\n  Mr. Speaker, all the recent rains in Texas have devastated parts of \nup to 31 counties in our beloved State. Governor Greg Abbott has \ndeclared them a disaster area. I happen to represent the lower half of \nBrazoria County, from the south side of Alvin going south, and it has \nbeen the recipient of a lot of flooding.\n  On Monday, I toured the Emergency Management Office Command Center in \nAngleton, Texas, which is the county seat for Brazoria County. I was \nprivileged to meet with County Judge Matt Sebesta and others as I was \nintroduced to the Brazoria County first responders working night and \nday to take care of our citizens, our citizens' animals and their \nlivestock, and their property as much as we could.\n\n  I was also privileged, Mr. Speaker, to go up in a Texas DPS \nhelicopter with two of our great Department of Public Safety pilots. \nWow. What devastation, Congressman Green, in Brazoria County. I have \npictures on my iPhone. I mean, it is just unbelievable the flooded \nareas. The devastation and destruction is astounding. Waters from the \nBrazos River, the San Bernard, and other creeks and bayous are out of \ntheir banks and wreaking havoc in our area.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want my constituents to know that our office is \nalready on the ground in the area, already working to ensure that FEMA \nis in gear, and that our constituents are taken care of. I would like \nto give a shout out to my great staff, Ms. Dodie Armstrong, Ms. Carmen \nGalvan, and Jed Webb, who have been on the ground there at the \nEmergency Management Center monitoring this almost night and day and \ninterfacing with the county to provide them any assistance needed. We \nhave assured Brazoria County that anything we can do, as my good friend \nJoaquin Castro was saying, from our end to assist, we would be glad to \ndo that.\n  Let me just add that we, too, mourn the loss of the Fort Hood \nsoldiers. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them and their families.\n  Mr. Speaker, we will bounce back from this. Our great Brazoria County \nfirst responders are on top of the situation, and our great Brazoria \nCounty folks are resilient. I have to say that about Congressman \nGreen's Houston constituents as well, our Texas people.\n  I have lived on the Gulf Coast of Texas almost 63 years. In fact, it \nwill be 63 years this July 2nd coming up. I have seen nothing quite of \nthis magnitude in flooding in our area, but I have seen a lot of \nhurricanes, a lot of disasters. Texans are a resilient people.\n\n[[Page H3560]]\n\nThey are going to need our help. They are going to need our prayers. \nThey are going to need some time to heal and get back to business as \nusual.\n  I want to say, again, thank you to my good friend, Al Green from \nHouston, for setting this up in a very bipartisan way. We just \nappreciate that.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honorable Randy \nWeber. I especially thank him for signing on early to the legislation \nthat Congressman Gene Green called to our attention. I appreciate it \ngreatly. We look forward to working with the gentleman. I thank him for \nthe outstanding effort.\n  Mr. Speaker, you heard one of our Members mention that we were having \n100-year and 500-year floods. This is debatable, I suppose, whether \nthey are 100-year floods or 500-year floods, but there is one fact that \nis beyond dispute. It is beyond reproach. The fact is this: We are \nhaving billion dollar floods. Billion dollar floods, Mr. Speaker, in \nHouston, Texas.\n  Within the last year, a little more than a year now, but within a 12-\nmonth period of time, Houston, Texas, has been declared a disaster area \ntwice. Twice. Over the last 20 years, billions of dollars spent, and we \nhave had 4 to 5 days of flooding each year over the last 20 years.\n  This flooding is causing great harm to property. There are people who \nhave just moved back into their homes, Mr. Speaker, and they find \nthemselves now being evicted by floodwaters again, waters that they \ncannot extricate themselves from. Their homes are stationary and fixed. \nThey have to cope with these floods. They have to cope with their life \nafter the floods. We are here tonight to let the country know that we \nin Houston, Texas, are tough. We are Texas tough. But there is \nsomething that we can do to help the people in Houston, Texas.\n  I don't want to talk about that right now, to be quite candid with \nyou. After losing the lives of our military persons in Fort Hood, \nTexas, I believe it is very important for us to make some special \nreference to them. These are people who have served this country, who \nwere prepared to live and die for the country. They are persons who \nwere in training, and they were among the finest that we have. I regret \nthat we have lost them.\n  All lives are precious. All lives are special. I came to the floor \nearlier, and I recited the names of persons who had lost their lives, \nsome 16 persons in the Memorial Day flood and the tax day flood. At \nthis time, I believe it necessary and appropriate to mention the \npersons who lost their lives in Fort Hood, nine soldiers.\n  Mr. Speaker, we had a staff sergeant lose his life, Staff Sergeant \nMiguel Angel Colonvazquez, 38 years of age. Mr. Speaker, he served with \nhonor. He received five Army Commendation Medals and Army Achievement \nMedals, three Army Good Conduct Medals, two Korea Defense Service \nMedals, the Army Service Ribbon, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \nMedal, and other honors as well.\n  Specialist Yingming Sun, age 25, from California. He received the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Medal, the \nKorea Defense Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas \nService Ribbon.\n  Specialist Christine Faith Armstrong, age 27, from California. She \nreceived the National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism \nMedal, Korea Defense Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, and the \nOverseas Service Ribbon.\n  Private First Class Brandon Austin Banner, 22 years of age. He \nreceived the National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism \nMedal, Korea Defense Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas \nService Ribbon, Marksmanship Qualification Badge.\n  Private First Class Zachery Nathaniel Fuller, age 23, Floridian. He \nreceived the National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism \nMedal, Army Service Ribbon.\n  Private Isaac Lee Deleon, age 19. He received the National Defense \nService Medal, Global War on Terrorism Medal, Army Service Ribbon.\n  Private Eddy Gates, age 20, North Carolina. She received the National \nDefense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Medal, Army Service \nRibbon.\n  Private Tysheena James, age 21. She received the National Defense \nService Medal, Global War on Terrorism Medal, Army Service Ribbon.\n  Finally, Cadet Mitchell Alexander Winey, age 21. He was majoring in \nEngineering Management at West Point.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the time, and I would like to close \nwith this, if you will allow. All of these people were meeting the \nmeasure of life that Ruth Smeltzer called to our attention: Some \nmeasure their lives by days and years, others by heartthrobs, passions \nand tears; but the surest measure under God's sun is what for others in \nyour lifetime have you done.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  These were persons who were committed to doing for others in this \ngreat country; and they were committed to doing it to the extent that, \nunfortunately, with all of their honors, they lost their lives in \ncircumstances from which they could not extricate themselves under \nadverse weather conditions.\n  I believe that they are worthy of a moment of a silence. They are \nworthy of much more, to be quite candid with you, but I believe that \ntonight this House should recognize all of them and all of those who \nhave lost their lives with a moment of silence. And I shall ask that we \nengage in such at this time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would have the families of all of them note that they \nmay be gone physically, but they will never be forgotten. We want the \nrecord to show that they served their country with distinction and with \nhonor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in \nrecognition of the ongoing flooding in my home state of Texas. Texas \nhas experienced numerous incidences of heavy rain and extreme weather \nevents since last summer, which have resulted in extensive flooding, \nproperty damage, and tragic loss of life.\n  Flooding and heavy rain has affected much of our vast state this \nspring. Flood warnings continue throughout Dallas County along the \nTrinity River this week, while my district has been the focus of flash \nflooding and severe weather for the better part of this year. Further \nthroughout Texas, rain gauges at the Austin-Bergstrom International \nAirport, College Station-Bryan, and San Angelo have recorded the \nwettest spring seasons on record for these areas.\n  Recent flooding in Texas has so far claimed the lives of 16 \nindividuals and has resulted in significant costs associated with \nproperty damage. Even more alarming is the fact that these catastrophic \nfloods seem to be occurring with greater severity and frequency over \ntime. More than ever, we need to recognize the effects of climate \nchange on our normal weather systems. Before we can begin to seriously \naddress these severe acts of nature, we must trace these events back to \ntheir root cause. Climate change is undeniably a significant \ncontributing factor of the increase in frequency and severity of these \nstorms.\n  The State of Texas has fostered a strong relationship with our \nfederal partners, such as the Department of Homeland Security, to \ndeliver critical funding and emergency response for rescue and clean-up \nefforts. As long as these floods continue, we need to continue to build \non our cooperation and work over the past year by not only improving \nour response to current events, but also by taking deliberate steps to \nmitigate future risks.\n  Mr. Speaker, the extreme weather events that we are experiencing in \nTexas are emblematic of the potentially devastating consequences of \nclimate change--and this is only the beginning. As we continue our \nefforts to assist the people of Texas, I urge for more federal \nassistance in our fight to address the recent rain and flooding while \nalso mitigating future flooding concerns throughout the state.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, on April 17-18, 2016 Houston \nexperienced a historic flood event that claimed the lives of eight \npeople; damaged over 1,150 households; disrupted hundreds of \nbusinesses; closed community centers, schools, and places of worship \ndue to flood waters.\n  On Monday, April 25, I led a tour and held a press conference with \nthe Army Corps of Engineers, local and state elected officials to focus \non the damaged caused by the flood and to refocus our efforts on \nreducing the damage and frequency of flooding in the Houston area.\n  On April 25, President Obama granted the request for federal \nIndividual Assistance for Harris County residences and business owners \nwho were affected by severe weather and flooding. I would like to thank \nall the local, state and federal officials who helped in making this \npossible.\n\n[[Page H3561]]\n\n  On May 3, 2016, I held a town hall for the residents of Houston, \nwhich includes my constituents in the 18th Congressional District so \nthat they could learn from FEMA what resources were available to assist \nthem with recovery.\n  Unfortunately, that was not the end of the story of flooding in \nHouston for 2016--in early June another record setting rainfall led to \ncatastrophic flooding throughout the Houston area.\n  At the beginning of this month Houston once again was flooded and \nanother Disaster Assistance request was submitted to the White House.\n  I am grateful to the President and the great work of those at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security who worked tirelessly to help people \nafter both events.\n  I spoke on the House Floor several times over the last six weeks \nabout the floods and the suffering caused by the waters that came \nthrough our communities--damaging homes, our schools, places of \nbusiness, and our places of worship.\n  I am gratified that the House approved my amendments to The Energy \nand Water Appropriations Act which will help facilitate the $3 million \nneeded to fund the Army Corps of Engineers' Houston Regional Watershed \nAssessment flood risk management feasibility study.\n  The Energy and Water Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (H.R. \n5055) provides that the Secretary of the Army may initiate up to six \nnew study starts during fiscal year 2017, and that five of those \nstudies are to consist of studies where the majority of the benefits \nare derived from flood and storm damage reduction or from navigation \ntransportation savings.\n  My discussion on the House floor about Jackson Lee Amendment with \nChairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur of the Energy and Water \nAppropriations Subcommittee made a compelling case and legislative \nrecord that the Houston Regional Watershed Assessment Flood Risk \nManagement Feasibility study is most deserving to be selected by the \nSecretary of the Army as one of the new study starts.\n  The Energy and Water Appropriations Act is still under consideration \nin the House, and I continue to work with my colleagues in moving this \nimportant effort forward.\n  The Houston Regional Watershed Assessment study is critically needed \ngiven the frequency and severity of historic-level flood events in \nrecent years in and around the Houston metropolitan area.\n  The purpose of the Houston Regional Watershed Assessment is to \nidentify risk reduction measures and optimize performance from a multi-\nobjective systems performance perspective of the regional network of \nnested and intermingled watersheds, reservoir dams, flood flow \nconveyance channels, storm water detention basins, and related Flood \nRisk Management (FRM) infrastructure.\n  Special emphasis of the study, which covers 22 primary watersheds \nwithin Harris County's 1,756 square miles, will be placed on extreme \nflood events that exceed the system capacity resulting in impacts to \nasset conditions/functions and loss of life.\n  The Federal government should not run every aspect of our lives--but \nit is an umbrella on a rainy day--it is a shelter in a powerful storm.\n  The Federal government is help when no other source of help can meet \nthe challenges we may be facing is sufficient.\n  It takes all sectors of a community to effectively prepare for, \nprotect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate against any \ndisaster.\n  We come together as community--we come together as Houstonians--we \ncome together as Texans and yes--we come together as Americans to \nprovide support, help and assistance to each other during difficult \ntimes.\n  This is a difficult time for many in our city of Houston.\n  Some of those who were hit hard by the flood are here tonight, but \nthere are many others who suffered losses who were not able to be here.\n  I ask that you take material with you to share with your neighbors, \nfriends, family, and co-workers who had flood damage or economic \nimpacts due to the flood, but were not able to join us tonight so that \nthey can get the help they may need to recover from the historic \nflooding.\n  You may qualify for FEMA Individual Assistance grants of up to \n$33,000 from the federal government, and low-interest disaster loans \nfrom the U.S. Small Business Administration.\n  An estimated 240 billion gallons of water fell in the Houston area \nover a 12 hour period, which resulted in several areas exceeding the \n100 to 500 year flood event record.\n  The records on floods are based upon the time period of rain fall, \nthe location of the rain fall, and the duration of the event over a \nwatershed.\n  The areas that experienced these historic rain falls in April were \nwest of 1-45, north of I-10, and Greens Bayou.\n  An estimated 140 billion gallons of water fell over the Cypress \nCreek, Spring Creek, and Addicks watershed in just 14 hours.\n  The flooding problems in the Houston area are frequent, widespread, \nand severe, with projects to reduce flood risks in place that are \nvalued at several billion dollars.\n  Recent historical flooding in the region was documented in 1979, \n1980, 1983, 1989, 1993, 1994, 1997, 2001 (Tropical Storm Allison), \n2006, 2007, and 2008 (Hurricane Ike).\n  In 2015, the Houston and surrounding area experienced widespread \nhistoric flooding; and again two weeks ago we saw significant flooding \ndamage and loss of life during the 12 hour flood event from April 17-\n18, 2016.\n  On June 6, 2016, I held a tour of the flood damage in Houston, Texas \nwith the President and CEO of The American Red Cross Gail McGovern:\n  Following the flooding in April I worked with FEMA and the city of \nHouston to provide housing to those left homeless by the flooding in \nApril.\n  Organized a Houston area delegation letter to appropriators to fund a \nstudy.\n  Sent letters to appropriators on the impact of flooding on the region \nand requested that a similar effort to deal with storm surge be \nundertaken for the upper Texas Gulf Coast.\n  On March 10, 2016, I held what is likely one of the first \nCongressional events to raise public awareness regarding Zika Virus and \nto ascertain the needs of local and state agencies who would be \nresponsible for responding to the threat.\n  On June 1, 2016, CDC reports are there are 1,732 confirmed Zika cases \nin the continental United States and U.S. Territories.\n  Cases of the Zika Virus have been reported in every state in the \nUnited States except Alaska; Idaho; North Dakota; South Dakota; and \nWisconsin.\n  At that meeting I called for the following directives to happen:\n  1. Establish a national task force to discuss the Zika virus;\n  The First meeting of the Task Force occurred on Tuesday, June 7, \n2016.\n  Other objectives that I outlined included:\n  2. Creation of public service messages explaining what the word DEET \nmeans and why it is important to protect yourself with insect \nrepellant;\n  3. We must make sure that untreated mosquito bed netting is available \nto women and girls in high risk areas;\n  4. Post posters in all public hospitals highlighting the dangers of \nthe Zika virus and how one can protect themselves from the Zika virus;\n  5. Hold a MAJOR briefing in Houston with officials from the CDC \nregarding the Zika virus;\n  6. Conduct a Houston/Harris County Public service campaign to inform \nthe community about traveling to Zika Virus mosquito borne infected \nregions around the world; and\n  7. We must secure public and private funds to cleanup illegally \ndumped tires and other debris where mosquitos may breed near people.\n  We must also rethink how testing is conducted for the Zika Virus.\n  Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor \nCollege of Medicine recommends that an aggressive testing and disease \nsurveillance approach be adopted for areas of greatest risk along the \nGulf Coast like the city of Houston.\n  Sub-tropical climate;\n  Areas of Extreme Poverty;\n  Presence of the most threatening Zika Virus carrying mosquitoes the \nAedes Aegypti;\n  Mosquito breeding conditions that are supportive of spread of the \ndisease from travelers who come to the Houston area with the illness.\n  The CDC guidance for persons who seek testing for the disease should \nallow for greater testing in areas that have these conditions along the \nGulf Coast from Texas to Florida.\n  Mosquito surveillance along the Gulf Coast is not even nor as well-\nresourced as it once was due to budget cuts and a lack of concern \nregarding mosquito borne disease, which has greatly reduced capacity \nand competence in this critical area.\n  The mosquito that carries Zika Virus is known as the greatest killer \nof people--it is also known as the yellow fever mosquito.\n  This Aedes mosquito is the real threat and it must be battled from \nthe neighborhood level up to the county or parish level.\n  President Obama's request for $1.9 Billion in Zika Virus Emergency \nResponse Funding.\n\n[[Page H3562]]\n\n  The Senate passed a Zika Virus Appropriations of $1.1 billion, but \nunfortunately the House only provided $622 million.\n  The Senate has called for a conference to reconcile the differences \nbetween the two bills.\n  The CDC reported on May 30, 2016, that it has confirmed cases of the \nZika Virus include 279 pregnant women in the United States or U.S. \nTerritories.\n  This number is double the number of cases reported the previous week.\n  The CDC is reporting all pregnant women who have ``any laboratory \nevidence'' of possible infection, no matter what.\n  The CDC made the change after seeing reports of asymptomatic pregnant \nwomen--women with no symptoms who delivered children with known Zika \nVirus birth defects.\n  These are sobering and troubling numbers this early in our mosquito \nseason.\n  These cases of Zika Virus include both travel related and those that \nwere contracted from mosquito bites.\n  The 13 Local Cases of the Zika Virus are all travel related thus far.\n  Seven cases of the Zika Virus recorded by Harris County Public Health \nEnvironmental Services.\n  Six reported by the City of Houston Public Health Department Reported \ncases of the Zika Virus.\n  We know that 4 in 5 people who contract the Zika Virus have no \nsymptoms.\n  This is especially problematic for pregnant women who may become \ninfected with the Zika Virus and have no symptoms.\n  Although the contracting of the disease is most associated with \nmosquitoes it has been transmitted sexually.\n  This presents other challenges to Zika Virus public education and \npreparedness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/house-section/article/H3562-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
