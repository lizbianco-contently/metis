The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, as it turns out, deporting 11 million \nundocumented immigrants and banning Muslims from entering the country \nmight not be the most radical anti-immigration ideas that the \nRepublicans have come up with. There seems to be a sinister, anti-\nimmigration arms race breaking out in the Party of Trump.\n  Last week, a Federal judge--Judge Andrew Hanen of Texas, pictured \nhere--the same one whose judgment on immigration executive actions is \nbeing deliberated by the Supreme Court, ordered the punishment of every \nsingle lawyer in the Justice Department in 26 States. His claim is that \nsome DOJ lawyers misrepresented to him whether they were complying with \nhis injunction suspending the immigration executive actions announced \nby President Obama in November of 2014.\n  After his injunction, they were only supposed to issue 2-year work \npermits under the old rules to immigrants who applied for and received, \nafter an extensive criminal background check, the ability to be treated \nas the lowest priority for deportation. But the remedial ethics classes \nare for every single Department of Justice lawyer in 26 States.\n  You say you weren't in any way associated with the case before the \njudge?\n  Too bad.\n  Never practiced law that is remotely related to immigrants or \nimmigration?\n  Sorry, the judge is ordering your punishment.\n  Never been to the State of Texas in your life?\n  Tough cookies, the Texas judge knows best, and is ordering you around \nas if you had argued cases yourself before his court.\n  Overreach much?\n  The newspaper La Opinion called Judge Hanen's plan ``onerous and \nabsurd.'' I think that is an understatement.\n  Judge Hanen is also using some good old-fashioned scare tactics to \nsee if he can compete with Sheriff Joe Arpaio and the GOP Presidential \nnominee for the title of who is so shamelessly anti-immigrant. Judge \nHanen has called for the Department of Justice to turn over the names \nof 100,000 people who were possibly granted the 3-year, not the 2-year, \nwork permits.\n  So if you come forward, pay hundreds of dollars, submit your \npaperwork and fingerprints, then 2 years later a judge says, Though you \nhave made no mistake and have zero--I want to repeat--zero--\nresponsibility for the controversy, you, the applicant, before the \nAmerican government, could have your name and address published for \nevery two-bit vigilante and Twitter troll to read.\n  I thought Republicans were the ones who didn't like activist judges. \nI thought they wanted as little government as possible and to leave the \nlegislating and, I suppose, the intimidating to the politicians here in \nWashington, D.C.\n  So when the Republicans up the ante in one area, they have to up the \nante in another. Nowhere is this crass political opportunism more \napparent than right here.\n  This morning we are having a little hearing in the Judiciary \nCommittee aimed at--get this--shutting down legal immigration as much \nas possible. Your son's fiancee, your mom's doctor, your neighbor's \nnanny, your grocery store's janitorial crew, if they are coming legally \nto the United States, Republicans want to stop it, slow it down, and \nmake it cost a lot more.\n  The party obsessed with illegal immigration now has legal immigration \nfirmly in its sight. And if you are from certain countries or are of a \ncertain religion, you must have a special security review.\n  I thought the campaign promise to bar Muslims from traveling here to \nthe USA was a campaign promise that would never be realized unless your \nleader actually won the campaign.\n  Don't get me wrong. If I thought Republicans were proposing a process \nto make things more secure and give the U.S. a better immigration \nsystem, I would support it. And I think we could pass something that \nwas on a bipartisan basis in Congress today.\n  But come on, guys. Do you really believe that the House of \nRepresentatives is trying to craft a sensible bill related\n\n[[Page H3100]]\n\nto immigration in an election year? Do you think the American people \nare that gullible?\n  No. The Party of Trump has launched an all-out radical assault on \nlegal immigration, and hopes everyone is so scared of the ``rapey'' \nMexicans, the sex-crazed Italians, and the Vietnamese immigrants with \nEbola on the one hand and ``ziki flies'' on the other. Lock down the \nwhole system, they say. Lady Liberty, lower your lamp, cover up your \npoem, and take a seat because terrorists got in once, which is enough \nreason to keep everyone out of America--from the computer programmer to \nthe ski instructor, to the refugee fleeing systematic violence.\n  If you ask me, maybe it is not the hundreds of Justice Department \nlawyers who have nothing to do with Judge Hanen's courtroom who need \nonerous remedial ethics training classes; maybe it is Judge Hanen's \nallies here in the House and throughout the Republican Party who could \nuse a mandatory lesson on right and wrong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/house-section/article/H3100-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRESSIONAL YOUTH SHADOW DAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome \nDonald Robinson to Capitol Hill as part of the Congressional Foster \nYouth Shadow Program.\n  This program is a part of Foster Care Month across the Nation. This \nrecognition was created more than 25 years ago to bring the issue of \nfoster care to the forefront, highlighting the importance of permanency \nfor every child. Having a brother who joined my family through foster \ncare 46 years ago, foster care is important to me.\n  As for Donald, he entered foster care in Pennsylvania at the age of \n14, experiencing six placements. Despite attending multiple schools, he \nwas able to complete his education and enroll in college after aging \nout of foster care.\n  I am proud to say that Donald recently graduated with his master's \ndegree in exercise science from the University of Texas. He plans to \ncreate an international sport performance training and consultancy \nbusiness, and would eventually like to open a charter school.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am so happy to see someone with Donald's background \nworking to give back to our Nation's children. I look forward to \nspending time with him today and to learn more about his story.\n\n\n              Recognizing the Retirement of Raymond Graeca\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute \nRaymond Graeca, who will retire next month as CEO of Penn Highlands \nHealthcare, which includes several hospitals in Pennsylvania's Fifth \nCongressional District, including in DuBois, Brookville, Clearfield, \nand St. Marys.\n  Raymond is a native of Erie and graduated with a degree in accounting \nfrom Gannon University. He is also a veteran and completed a tour of \nduty with the United States Army before earning a master's degree in \nhealth service administration from Tulane University in New Orleans in \n1973.\n  After graduation, Raymond entered the field of health care and did \nnot look back. He worked at hospitals in Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas \nbefore returning to Pennsylvania in 1979 to become president of the \nCorry Memorial Hospital in Corry, Pennsylvania, also located in \nPennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District.\n  Ray came to DuBois in 1990 as president of the DuBois Regional \nMedical Center. He is credited as being part of a group which started \nthe Free Medical Clinic of DuBois in 1998, and has served on a number \nof statewide boards, including the Hospital Council of Western \nPennsylvania, The Hospital & Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania, \nand the Pennsylvania chapter of the VHA. In 1998, he was named the \nDistinguished Citizen of the Year in DuBois.\n  In 2011, he was instrumental in the creation of Penn Highlands \nHealthcare, bringing together hospitals across the DuBois region, \nincluding the DuBois Regional Medical Center, Clearfield Hospital, \nBrookville Hospital, and later, the Elk Regional Medical Center. The \nsystem covers eight counties, employs more than 3,600 people, including \n360 physicians.\n  Raymond Graeca's retirement caps a more than 40-year career in \nhealthcare services and hospital administration. I congratulate him on \nall of his hard work, and wish him the best of luck in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/house-section/article/H3100-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3100-H3101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ENERGY AND WATER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, the House is considering this week the \nappropriations for energy and water. These are important decisions, \nvital programs that seriously touch all of us across the country, and \nhave important decisions on resource allocation.\n  There were two elements in the accompanying report that I would like \nto highlight for a moment. First is that I am pleased that the \ncommittee has included language encouraging the Army Corps of Engineers \nto continue efforts to construct new tribal housing at The Dalles Dam \non the Columbia River between Oregon and Washington.\n  The Columbia River is the cultural artery that ties together the \nNorthwest. It is an engine for agriculture and for industry. But long \nbefore we started changing that river into a machine with the \nconstruction of dams in the 1930s, the artery was the core of the \ncivilization for thousands of years for Native Americans.\n  The river looked very different. It was faster-moving and steeper. It \nproduced salmon in such abundance that it was rumored you could walk \nacross their backs as they swam upstream to spawn. And it provided \nfood, trade, and a cultural identity for Native American tribes for \nyears. These tribes--now known as the Nez Perce, Umatilla, Warm \nSprings, and Yakama Nation--were never fully compensated for the \ndisruption to their native ways of life, despite promises to the \ncontrary.\n  We have found that the Army Corps of Engineers now understands that \nit has the authority to begin the process of building another housing \nvillage at The Dalles Dam. It is important that we encourage and \nsupport this work, and continue to expand it through congressional \naction. It is the least we can do to keep faith with Native Americans, \nwho have had their lives dramatically disrupted with that construction.\n  Second, the report also continues an unfortunate rider, which blocks \nthe Army Corps of Engineers from modernizing how it develops water \nresource projects. This has been an interest of mine since I first \nstarted serving on the Water Resources Subcommittee 20 years ago in \nCongress.\n  The Corps operates on an antiquated methodology that are known as \n1983 principles and guidelines for water infrastructure projects. It \ndirects the Corps to focus on maximizing national economic development \nbenefits when planning projects, not looking comprehensively at the \nbenefits and the problems attained for everybody. It severely limits \nthe Corps' ability to select projects which minimize environmental \nimpacts, or contribute to the national interest in ways other than a \nnarrowly defined economic development.\n  I worked for years with the Corps back when General Flowers was in \ncharge, and there was great interest on the part of the Corps to be \nable to update the ways that they operate to incorporate modern \nscience, engineering, and environmental awareness. Those principles and \nguidelines were drafted back in the Carter administration.\n  398 months have elapsed since they were enacted into law. In that \nperiod of time, a lot has happened with food, fashion, technology, and \nscience. It is time for the Army Corps of Engineers to be able to base \nits planning and activities on the best science and the best \nengineering, for the needs that we have today.\n  I sincerely hope that we can come together and recognize that it is a \nneed to finally remove that rider. It was frustrating for me, having \nworked for years, to finally achieve authorization in 2007 for the \nprinciples and guidelines to be updated. Yet, the Corps, having done \nthat job, cannot use the updated principles and guidelines because of \nshortsighted action on the part of Congress.\n  I strongly urge that my friends and colleagues in Congress take a \nlook at\n\n[[Page H3101]]\n\nthis restrictive language. Think about the opportunities available to \nus to allow the Corps of Engineers to do its job right based on the \nlatest information available to us. This does not speak well of the \nability of Congress to prepare for the future. It makes the job of the \nArmy Corps of Engineers much harder, and it makes it less likely that \nwe are going to give people the benefit that they need from the various \nthings that the Corps constructs and plans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/house-section/article/H3101-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1015\n  TSGT VIRGIL POE, UNITED STATES ARMY: CHARTER MEMBER OF THE GREATEST \n                               GENERATION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, born in the 1920s, he grew up in the \nDepression of the 1930s, poor, like more most rural American children. \nFresh vegetables were grown in the family garden behind the small frame \nhouse. His mother made sandwiches for school out of homemade bread. \nStore-bought bread was for the rich.\n  He grew up belonging to the Boy Scouts, playing the trumpet in the \nhigh school band, and he went to church on almost all Sundays. In 1944, \nthis 18-year-old country boy, who had never been more than 50 miles \nfrom home, quickly found himself going through basic training at the \nUnited States Army at Camp Wolters in Camp Wolters, Texas.\n  After that, he rode a train with hundreds of other young teenagers--\nAmerican males--to New York City for the ocean trip on a cramped \nLiberty ship to fight in the great World War II. While crossing the \nAtlantic, he witnessed another Liberty ship next to his that was sunk \nby a German U-boat.\n  As a soldier in the Seventh Army, he went from France to survive the \nBattle of the Bulge and through the cities of Aachen, Stuttgart, \nCologne, and Bonn. As a teenager, he saw the brutal concentration camps \nof the Nazis and saw the victims. He saw incredible numbers of other \nteenage Americans buried in graves throughout Europe. A solemn monument \nto those soldiers is at Normandy.\n  After Germany surrendered, he was ordered back to Fort Hood, Texas. \nHe was being reequipped for the invasion of Japan. Then Japan \nsurrendered. It was there he met Mom at a Wednesday night prayer \nmeeting service. My mom was a Red Cross volunteer in WWII.\n  Until a few years ago, this GI--my dad--would never talk about World \nWar II. He still won't say much, but he does say frequently that the \nheroes are the ones who are buried today in Europe.\n  After the war was over, he opened a DX service station, where he \npumped gas, sold tires, fixed cars, and began a family. Deciding he \nwanted to go to college, he moved to west Texas and enrolled in a small \nChristian college named Abilene Christian College.\n  He and his wife and two small children lived in an old, converted \nArmy barracks with other such families. He supported us by working \nnights at the KRBC radio station and by climbing telephone poles for Ma \nBell, which was later called Southwestern Bell.\n  He finished college, became an engineer, and worked 40-plus years for \nSouthwestern Bell Telephone Company in Houston, Texas. He turned down a \npromotion and a transfer to New York City because it was not Texas and \nhe didn't want to raise his family in New York.\n  Dad instilled in my sister and me the values of being a neighbor to \neverybody, of loving the USA, of loving our heritage, and of always \ndoing the right thing to all people.\n  He still gets mad at the media. He flies Old Glory on holidays. He \ngoes to church on Sunday, and he takes Mom out to eat on Friday nights. \nHe stands in the front yard and talks to his neighbors, and he can \nstill fix anything.\n  He can still mow his own grass even though he is 90 years of age. He \nhas a strong opinion on politics and world events. He gives plenty of \nadvice to everybody, including a lot of advice to me. He has two \ncomputers in his home office. He sends emails to hundreds of his \nbuddies all over the world.\n  Dad and Mom still live in Houston, Texas, where I grew up.\n  So today, Mr. Speaker, as we approach Memorial Day and honor the \nfallen warriors of all wars, we also honor all who fought in the great \nWorld War II and who got to come home. We honor my dad, but also other \nAmerican warriors.\n  My dad was one of those individuals of the Greatest Generation. He is \nthe best man I ever met, and he certainly is a charter member of the \nGreatest Generation. So I hope I turn out like him, Tech Sergeant \nVirgil Poe, United States Army, good man, good father. That is enough \nfor one life.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/house-section/article/H3101-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3101-H3102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TOP TEN ABUSES OF THE ``SELECT INVESTIGATIVE PANEL'' REPUBLICANS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nIllinois (Ms. Schakowsky) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, yesterday 181 Democrats wrote to Speaker \nRyan to ask the Republican Select Panel to Attack Women's Health--that \nis what we call it--to be shut down.\n  From the outset, this investigation has been a political weapon to \npunish women, doctors, and scientific researchers, not an objective, \nfair-minded, or fact-based search for the truth.\n  Here are the top 10 reasons to shut down this partisan panel \nimmediately:\n  One: The select panel is a waste of taxpayer money.\n  Republicans are wasting taxpayer dollars in their chasing of \ninflammatory allegations of anti-abortion extremists.\n  Three Republican-led House committees, 12 States, and one grand jury \nhave already investigated charges that Planned Parenthood was selling \nfetal tissue for a profit. None found any evidence of wrongdoing.\n  Two: The select panel is an attack on women's rights.\n  Republicans are using the panel as part of their campaign to deny \nwomen access to legal reproductive health services, including \nabortions--the panel comes at a time when Republicans have voted \nrepeatedly to defund Planned Parenthood, which provides health services \nto over 3 million American women and men each year--to eliminate family \nplanning services, and to restrict access to abortion.\n  Three: The select panel is harming scientific research.\n  Republicans are using the panel to intimidate scientists into \nstopping legal fetal tissue research on treatment for cures for \ndiseases and conditions that afflict millions of Americans, including \nmultiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and spinal cord injuries. \nSome medical research outfits have already been canceled.\n  Four: The select panel is just partisan politics.\n  Republicans are conducting an unfair, one-sided, and partisan \ncampaign. They refuse to put indicted video maker David Daleiden under \noath, who made those highly edited tapes against Planned Parenthood, \nwhile issuing subpoenas and demanding sworn testimony from law-abiding \nresearchers and doctors.\n  Republicans have suppressed facts that contradict their preferred \npartisan narratives. For example, they refused to hear directly from \ntissue procurement companies while they publicly accused them of \nmisconduct based on misleading and inaccurate staff-created exhibits \nthat lacked any sourcing or foundational information.\n  Five: The select panel is a McCarthy-like witch hunt:\n  Mirroring the bullying behavior of Senator Joe McCarthy, Republicans \nare demanding that universities and clinics name names of their \nresearchers, graduate students, lab technicians, clinic personnel, and \ndoctors. When Democrat Jerry Nadler asked Chair Blackburn to explain \nwhy she needs to amass this database of names, she responded: No, sir. \nI am not going to do that.\n  Six: The select panel threatens innocent lives.\n  Republicans are putting researchers and doctors at risk by publicly \nnaming them as targets of their investigation and creating a database \nof names.\n  On May 11, Republicans issued a press release that publicly named a \nphysician who had already been the\n\n[[Page H3102]]\n\ntarget and the subject of violence by anti-abortion extremists. That \nphysician was never contacted to voluntarily provide information before \nhe received a subpoena.\n  Seven: The select panel is dangerous.\n  Republicans are refusing to protect confidentiality despite known \nrisks and tragedies, such as the murders of three people at the \nColorado Springs Planned Parenthood women's health clinic. That \nmurderer echoed the words of our Republican chairman of the select \ncommittee.\n  The killer used words like ``no more baby body parts.'' Even after \nthey promised to protect confidentiality, the committee said: We will \nnot assure that witnesses' names or any of the other names used in the \ndeposition will remain private.\n  Eight: The select panel is an abuse of power.\n  Republicans are abusing congressional subpoena power. The \noverwhelming majority of their unilateral subpoenas--30 of 36--have \nbeen sent without any effort to obtain voluntary compliance.\n  We should provide physicians, medical researchers, and others with an \nopportunity for them to provide information voluntarily. A subpoena \nshould not be the first contact they have with Congress.\n  Nine: The select panel excludes Democrats.\n  Republicans have consistently refused to work with Democratic panel \nmembers. They have refused to discuss or to even give Democrats copies \nof their unilateral subpoenas until after they have been served, which \nis in violation of the House.\n  Ten: The select panel bullies witnesses they don't like.\n  It is time, Mr. Speaker, to end this panel right now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/house-section/article/H3102-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THANK YOU, SENATOR BROWN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Senator Dave \nBrown for serving in the Minnesota State Senate.\n  Senator Brown represents an area located in Minnesota's Sixth \nDistrict, and I have enjoyed working with him on a variety of issues \nthat are important to our constituents.\n  Senator Brown has worked on policy solutions in the fields related to \ncommerce, education, and finance. However, his main area of expertise \nhas been in promoting Minnesota energy.\n  Our district is home to the Sherco coal-fired power plant, which is \nresponsible for hundreds of jobs as well as the abundance of energy it \nprovides. During a time when Sherco's future was unclear and unstable, \nSenator Brown was a voice of reason that helped many to keep the plant \nopen, allowing many Minnesotans to keep their jobs.\n  Thank you, Dave, for the work you have done for our community and for \nMinnesota. I will miss working with you, but we wish you the best of \nluck in your next endeavor.\n\n\n                      Thank you, Senator Pederson\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Senator John \nPederson for his dedicated service to the St. Cloud area residents over \nthe past 6 years.\n  John Pederson was born and raised in Minnesota's Sixth Congressional \nDistrict and first served on the St. Cloud City Council in 2007. After \n4 years on the City Council, John ran and won his seat in the Minnesota \nState Senate.\n  Throughout his time in the Minnesota legislature, Senator Pederson \nhas shown his expertise in a variety of areas, but none more than in \ntransportation. Like me, Senator Pederson understands that an intense \nfocus on transportation in Minnesota's Sixth is crucial to relieving \ncongestion, improving safety, increasing mobility, and fostering \neconomic development in our State.\n  John, thank you for your time in serving the people of our great \nState.\n\n\n                       Thank you, Senator Ortman\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Senator Julianne \nOrtman for her years of dedicated service in the Minnesota Senate.\n  Following her time in practicing law and as a county commissioner, \nJulianne Ortman was first elected to the Minnesota Senate in 2002. Her \ntalent quickly became apparent as she rose to various leadership \npositions.\n  Senator Ortman served as an assistant minority leader during the \n2007-2008 legislative session. During the 2011-2012 session, she served \nas deputy majority leader and as chairwoman of the Senate Tax \nCommittee.\n  Of the many issues Senator Ortman championed, taxes, transportation, \njudiciary, and public safety were among her highest priorities. During \nher time as chairwoman of the Senate Tax Committee, the State \ngovernment had a $5 billion deficit, which it eventually managed to \neliminate without raising taxes on hardworking Minnesotans, evidence of \nSenator Ortman's strong leadership.\n  Thank you, Julianne, for your service and for all that you have done \nfor Minnesota. Thank you for your leadership.\n\n\n                       Thank you, Senator Johnson\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Senator Alice \nJohnson for her dedication and service to the people of Minnesota.\n  Alice Johnson began her career as a public servant in the Minnesota \nHouse of Representatives in 1986. She served for 14 years before taking \na brief break from the Minnesota legislature.\n  Alice again ran for office in 2012 and has served in the Minnesota \nSenate for the past 4 years, where she has served as vice chair for \nboth the Education Finance and Policy Committees. After an incredible \n18 years in public service, Senator Johnson deserves her well-earned \nretirement.\n  Thank you, Alice, for the time you have spent in working tirelessly \non behalf of Minnesotans and in working to end the gridlock in \npolitics. It is greatly appreciated.\n\n\n                   Thank you, Representative Sanders\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank my friend, \nRepresentative Tim Sanders, for the incredible work that he has done \nwhile serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives.\n  Representative Sanders has served in the legislature for four terms, \nduring which he has held various leadership positions. In the 2014 \nelection, he was nominated to the position of assistant majority leader \nand has also served as chair of the Government Operations and Elections \nCommittee.\n  I got to know Tim personally during my own time in the State \nlegislature and have an enormous amount of respect for him. He has been \na successful and passionate legislator, proven by the fact that a \nsubstantial number of his bills have actually been signed into law.\n  Thank you, Tim, for your service to our community and to our State. I \nknow that you will continue to accomplish great things. I wish you \nnothing but happiness as you spend more time with Farrah and the kids.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/house-section/article/H3102-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3102-H3103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1030\n                         TAMMY LAMBERT'S STORY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Jenkins) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, West Virginians are \nstruggling right now. Our State's unemployment rate is one of the \nhighest in the Nation. Our coal mines are closing, and so are our \nschools and mom-and-pop businesses throughout our State.\n  There is a lot of uncertainty. Families are wondering how they will \nmake ends meet without our coal jobs.\n  Tammy Lambert is from Raleigh County, and her family is one of those \nwho are worried about her family's future. Her son-in-law is \nconsidering moving out of the State just to find work; her daughter \ndoesn't know if she will have the money to finish college; and her \nhusband's mine has gone through periods of being idled. She is a West \nVirginia coal voice. Here is what she said:\n  ``My daughter has worked hard to get this far and was just beginning \nto see the light at the end of the tunnel. Now, she may not be able to \never get that degree.\n  ``It is a shame when young people who try can't get ahead. It is even \nsadder when a man who has worked as a coal miner for 36 years can't \nfeel secure in his job.''\n  What our families need is not just hope; they need jobs that give \nthem a good paycheck.\n  We can make that happen in several ways. We can diversify our State's\n\n[[Page H3103]]\n\neconomy to attract new employers. We can expand retraining programs to \nhelp prepare the workforce. But most of all, we can get Washington off \nthe backs of our miners.\n  Let West Virginia miners get back to work, put food on their tables, \nand mine the coal that has powered our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/house-section/article/H3103-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, my district is home to many ecological \nwonders, from the mighty Adirondacks to the Saint Lawrence River. The \nenvironment is truly our lifeblood in the North Country. Sadly, \ninvasive species threaten the health and beauty of these natural \necosystems.\n  Given our unique position as both the gateway to the Great Lakes and \nas the center of international shipping trade, our State has the \nunfortunate distinction of being a principal point of entry for many \ninvasive species.\n  Today I am introducing two pieces of bipartisan legislation to help \ncombat and raise awareness about the threat that invasive species pose \nto our ecosystems. Nationwide, an estimated 50,000 nonnative invasive \nanimal and plant species have been introduced, resulting in more than \n$100 billion in economic losses annually.\n  Every State and U.S. territory has at least some form of invasive \nspecies. Therefore, I hope my colleagues will cosponsor these vital \nbills so we may prevent the spread and introduction of these harmful \ninvasive species.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/house-section/article/H3103-9", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE AWARDED NEW RESEARCH GRANTS\n\n  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HIGGINS.

He was an impactful leader, principled, generous, and \ncompassionate. When he retired, he passed his knowledge on to future \ngenerations by teaching at the Carlson School of Management at the \nUniversity of Minnesota.\n  Wheelock's civic leadership included playing a large role in local \nsports\n\n[[Page H3104]]\n\nfranchises, like the Twins, the Vikings, and the North Stars. He also \nhelped save and improve lives in his founding of the Johnson Institute \nin 1966, one of the Nation's very first drug and alcohol abuse \ntreatment centers.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is really hard to put into words the respect that \nMinnesotans have for Wheelock Whitney and his stature as a leader.

They are two young adults with whom I am spending time. Both \nhave spent years in the foster care system and have grown to be really \nremarkable young adults.\n  Justin is studying international relations at Michigan State \nUniversity, and Jameshia just graduated from the University of \nMichigan-Flint, one of my alma maters, with a degree in social work.\n  Along with their interest in school, they both have dedicated \nthemselves to bettering the lives of other children in Michigan and \naround the world.

Tad Dufelmeier was honored with the tournament's Sportsmanship \nAward.\n  I congratulate the team on their championship win and for \nrepresenting their school, their community, and the State in such an \nexceptional way.\n  Go Bruins.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/house-section/article/H3105-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                      HONORING EDUCATOR JOYCE TOAN\n\n  (Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Joyce Toan, who has \ntaught the children of Joseph Sears School as a kindergarten teacher \nfor nearly two decades. First arriving at Sears in 1997, Mrs. Toan has \npositively shaped the lives of hundreds of students.\n  Personally, she has had an undeniably positive impact on my family, \nteaching my three children, Harper, Bobby, and Honor. Each is better \noff because of her guidance and teaching.\n  Our family and community will be forever indebted to her for the \nkindness she has shown all of our children. Mrs. Toan always went out \nof her way to recognize what makes each of her students unique. She \ntaught her students not what to think, but how to think, a skill that \nwill be useful for the rest of their lives.\n  Despite her career at Sears coming to an end, the lessons and \nmemories that she has imparted upon Harper, Bobby, Honor, and all of \nher students will last a lifetime.\n  Mr. Speaker, I offer my personal thanks to Mrs. Toan for all that she \nhas done and wish her well in her retirement. She will be deeply \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/house-section/article/H3105-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROTECTING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\n\n  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, in contrast to the religious persecutions \nin Europe between the 16th and 19th centuries, America increasingly \nbecame a safe space for people to exercise their faith in accordance \nwith their conscience. Religious freedom was woven into the fabric and \nconstitution of our country from the beginning, and faith has played a \nbig role in forming the character of our Nation.\n  From efforts to abolish slavery, secure civil rights, and protect \nhuman life, to providing health care, food, shelter, and hope to \ncountless millions, religious organizations have been indispensable to \nthe progress we have made. Indeed, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \nrecognized the extraordinary contributions of religious organizations \nwhen it preserved their right to hire individuals who shared their \nbeliefs.\n  Today we see clouds encroaching upon the sunshine of religious \nfreedom and the freedom of conscience. These attempts to crush \nconscience must be resisted. It is conscience that convicts us of our \nown shortcomings, and it is that conviction that allows us to correct \ncourse and to seek what is good, beautiful, and true. That is why \nprotecting religious freedom is vital.\n  Mr. Speaker, let us together join forces against the growing \nintolerance that threatens it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/house-section/article/H3105-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      STOP GIVING GUANTANAMO PRISONERS EXPENSIVE SPECIAL TREATMENT\n\n  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I had 43 students and \nchaperones from Washburn High School in east Tennessee as my guests at \nthe Capitol.\n  Among other things, I told them I was next going to a hearing about \nthe prison in Guantanamo and that one group had estimated it was now \ncosting us over $4 million per prisoner to keep that prison open. One \nof the students said, ``How can I get in?''\n  There are now only 80 prisoners there, and we spent $445 million to \nrun the facility in 2015. The Washington Times reported in 2013 that we \nwere giving these prisoners classes on computers, horticulture, art, \nand calligraphy as well as library services, special food, and \nrecreational facilities. We sometimes hear of country club prisons. \nApparently, this should be called a resort prison.\n  I know the Federal Government cannot do anything in a fiscally \nconservative way, but spending $4 million per prisoner in Guantanamo is \nridiculous. It costs an average of $34,000 per year per prisoner in \nmost Federal prisons and $78,000 per year in the supermax prison.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should stop giving these terrorists such ridiculously \nexpensive special treatment and send all 80 to the worst, most \ndangerous prison in the U.S.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/house-section/article/H3105-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMMUNICATION FROM THE HONORABLE TED S.

The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 \nhour.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 744 provides for the \nconsideration of S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2016, \nand H.R. 5233, Clarifying Congressional Intent in Providing for DC Home \nRule Act of 2016.\n  The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided amongst the \nmajority and minority members of the Committees on Energy and Commerce \nand Natural Resources for S. 2012. As S. 2012, as amended, is a \ncomprehensive compilation of energy legislation that has already passed \nthe House, the Committee on Rules made no further amendments in order. \nHowever, the rule affords the minority the customary motion to \nrecommit, a final opportunity to amend the legislation should the \nminority choose to exercise that option.\n  The rule further provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided \nbetween the majority and minority of the Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform on H.R. 5233. No amendments were made in order as the \nbill is a targeted response to what Members of the House have perceived \nas an unlawful action taken by the District of Columbia in \ncontravention of the Federal Home Rule Act. The minority is, however, \nafforded the customary motion to recommit, a final chance to amend the \nlegislation.\n  Finally, the rule contains the standard tools to allow the orderly \nmanagement of the floor of the House of Representatives during an \nupcoming district work period.\n  The House amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act \nof 2016, builds on the work of the House. The House has done this work \nover the past year and a half to update the Nation's energy laws and \nmove the country forward on energy policy. The bills included in this \npackage include work from the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the \nAgriculture Committee, Committee on Natural Resources, and the \nCommittee on Science, Space, and Technology.\n  While many House committees have had input on this package, Members \ncan feel comfortable that a wide array of opinions and positions are \nrepresented in the legislation. This is how the House works its will \nmost effectively, by combining various pieces of legislation into one \npackage.\n  In amending S. 2012, the Senate passed energy legislation. Following \npassage of S. 2012 in the House, both bodies will be able to begin to \nconference the differences in the two bills, a further step in the \nregular order of this bill becoming a law.\n  The legislation will benefit Americans across the country: \nmodernizing our energy infrastructure; expediting and improving forest \nmanagement; providing for greater opportunities on Federal lands for \nhunting, fishing, and shooting; and prioritizing science research using \nFederal taxpayer dollars.\n  S. 2012, as amended, includes various pieces of legislation \nconsidered and passed by the House not only in the current 114th \nCongress, but it also includes many pieces of bipartisan legislation \nfrom the 112th and 113th Congresses.\n  A major win for the American people in this package is the provisions \nallowing for expanded access by sportsmen, fishermen, and recreational \nshooters to Federal lands, lands that should have always been \naccessible to all Americans for various legal and constitutional \nactivities.\n  Further, the legislation before us focuses on protecting American \ninterests in a world where uncertainty due to terrorism and unfriendly \nand unstable regimes in the Middle East threaten American access to \nreliable sources of energy. We have long believed that America should \nfocus less on relying on foreign energy sources, given the abundance of \nresources below our very feet across this Nation. Only if Federal \npolicies are aligned with this view, which the House will do with this \npackage, can our country fully focus on becoming energy secure.\n  The second piece of legislation contained in today's rule addresses \nthe House concerns with recent actions taken by the District of \nColumbia's Mayor and City Council. H.R. 5233, Clarifying Congressional \nIntent in Providing for DC Home Rule Act of 2016, repeals the Local \nBudget Autonomy Amendment Act of 2012, a referendum passed in the \nDistrict of Columbia, which many believe violates both the U.S. \nConstitution and the Federal Home Rule Act.\n  When the Founding Fathers crafted our Constitution, they acknowledged \nthe special status that the Nation's Capital held and created a special \nrelationship between it and the Federal Government not enjoyed by other \nStates and other localities.\n  While some argue that the District of Columbia should be entirely \nself-governed, that is not how our Constitution treats the Federal \ncity. Article I, section 8, clause 17 states that the Congress of the \nUnited States shall have the power--I am quoting from the Constitution \nhere--``to exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over \nsuch District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of \nparticular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of \nthe Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority \nover all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the \nState in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, \nArsenals, dock-Yards and other needful Buildings.''\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  The District of Columbia, falling squarely within the parameters of \nthis clause, is, therefore, subject to Congress' exclusive exercise \nover its laws.\n  I have no doubt that a strong debate will surround the consideration \nof H.R. 5233, as we heard in the Committee on Rules last night, but \nCongress would be relinquishing its duty under the United States \nConstitution to oversee the governance of the Nation's Capital.\n  Today's rule will allow the House to complete the final two pieces of \nlegislation for the month of May, a month where the House of \nRepresentatives has passed legislation to provide funding for our \nmilitary bases, funding for our veterans, funding for energy and water \npolicies; to provide new authorities and funding to combat the growing \nthreat of the Zika virus; to update our Nation's chemical laws; to \nprovide help to those in this country facing opioid addictions; and to \nprovide tools to our Nation's armed services necessary to keep our \ncitizens safe from the growing threat of terrorism. It has been one of \nthe most productive months of the year for the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the \ntime. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the rule which joins two \ndisparate\n\n[[Page H3107]]\n\nissues. The first, District of Columbia budget autonomy. The second, \npursuing an energy bill that prioritizes an outdated energy policy.\n  First, D.C. budget autonomy. Mr. Speaker, Congress sits in the \nDistrict of Columbia, and our presence looms far beyond the footprint \nof the buildings. Congress has mandated that the government of the \nDistrict of Columbia pass every budget plan--every spending plan down \nto the penny of their own money that they raise--through Congress.\n  But in 2012, the District of Columbia exerted its own authority and \npassed the Local Budget Autonomy Amendment Act of 2012 and essentially \nsaid: We will allocate our own local funds ourselves unless Congress \noverrides our plan, and we will only ask permission beforehand when we \nspend money that comes from the Federal Treasury.\n  The bill before us, H.R. 5233, would repeal the District's local law, \nkeep the District of Columbia from spending its own money on local \nservices, and prohibit the District from granting itself budget \nautonomy in the future.\n  For far too long, the residents of the District have paid their fair \nshare of taxes and have not had full representation in Congress. The \nDistrict sends young people off to war, but doesn't have an equal voice \nin either going to war or how the country is governed. In fact, it \nreminds me a lot of a plantation.\n  Subjecting the District to the lengthy and uncertain congressional \nappropriations process for its own use of their local tax collection \nimposes operational and financial hardships for the District, burdens \nnot borne by any other local government in the country. In addition to \nthat, it is more expensive to them.\n  It defies reason that the House majority would continue this \noverreach, and I urge each considerate Republican to rethink their \nposition. In fact, there are some key Republicans who do support the \nDistrict's budget autonomy. The Oversight and Government Reform \nCommittee's last four chairmen--including Republicans Tom Davis and \nDarrell Issa--worked to give D.C. budget autonomy. I urge my Republican \ncolleagues to follow suit.\n  Second, the rule would allow the House to replace the text of the \nSenate's bipartisan energy reform legislation with the House's partisan \nenergy bill. Time and again, we have seen the Senate come to a \nreasonable, bipartisan compromise, but the House chases a partisan \nagenda and derails the legislative process every time.\n  The House proposal encourages an outdated energy policy that favors \nfossil fuels above the clean and renewable energy sources, and it seeks \nto roll back important environmental protections. The majority's \ninsistence on negating environmental protections and doubling down on \ntheir attacks on environmental laws is a troubling waste of time. \nNevertheless, Democrats will fight to protect the environment and \nprecious natural resources.\n  The bill locks in fossil fuel consumption for years to come by \nrepealing current law aimed at reducing the government's carbon \nfootprint. It also puts up barriers to the integration of clean, \nrenewable energy technologies, all while rolling back the energy \nefficiency standards. In the past, efficiency standards were an area of \nbipartisan compromise. Not anymore.\n  Americans cannot afford the Republican majority's head-in-the-sand \napproach to climate change and energy consumption. In fact, I \nunderstand that the presumed Presidential candidate of the Republican \nParty had applied to build a wall on one of his foreign golf courses, \nblaming climate change for the erosion. So if he believes it in a \nforeign country, I certainly hope he will think about believing it \nhere.\n  I urge my colleagues to work toward an all-of-the-above strategy that \nwill modernize our Nation's energy infrastructure in a way that \naddresses climate change, promotes clean energy, drives innovation, and \nensures a cleaner, more stable environment for future generations.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  I would remind the House that this energy legislation has worked its \nway through the House for the last 18 months; and, indeed, the two \nprevious Congresses, multiple committees have had input on this. It has \nbeen one of the most thoroughly vetted pieces of legislation. I cannot \ntell you the number of hearings, the number of markups that I have sat \nthrough in the Committee on Energy and Commerce. It has had similar \ntreatment over in the Senate. The concept of getting this bill through \nthe House, going to conference with the Senate, this is a good product \nand is worthy of the support of this body.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), a hardworking Member who \nrepresents 700,000 people who have no say because this body decides \neverything that they do. As I pointed out before, they pay their taxes \nand they send their children off to war, but she cannot vote in this \nHouse in any way to affect anything.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank my good friend from \nNew York State for the way she has always understood and championed \nwith respect to the District of Columbia, which also happens to be the \ncapital of the United States. But, as she said, it is more than the \nCapitol and this building. It is where almost 700,000 Americans live.\n  Mr. Speaker, I must strongly oppose that portion of the bill \nproviding for consideration of H.R. 5233. Understand the spectacle we \nhave ongoing here. A strong Republican House is actively sponsoring a \nbill that repeals a local law, a local law that in this case authorizes \nthe District of Columbia government to spend its own local funds \nwithout congressional approval.\n  Who do the Republicans think they are, that the people I represent \nshould ask for their approval to spend, and to process funds that they \nhad nothing to do with raising?\n  Understand, no Federal funds are involved, not one penny, but those \npennies, over $7 billion--and I want people who come to the floor to \ntell me if their State raises $7 billion on its own. Over $7 billion. \nThese are our pennies. Not a cent of Federal money is even implicated.\n  Let's go back to Republican principles to understand what is \nhappening on this floor today because it is going to happen twice. My \nRepublican friends propose in this rule--these are the same friends who \ndespise the Federal reach, despise it so much that every year they try \nto give back what have long been Federal matters to the States, like \nthe Department of Education. Need I go through the laundry list? The \none thing they stand for in this Congress and have stood for throughout \nhuman time is that they prefer that power over the people be exercised \nat the State and local level. That is what they stand for. There are \nnot many things that you can say a particular party stands for. Local \ncontrol is certainly their cardinal principle.\n  But look what they are doing this afternoon. They are doubling down. \nThat is not just a matter of emphasis. That means double bills. They \nare doubling down to use the awesome power of the Federal Government \nagainst a local district. If you will excuse me, I regard that as very \nun-Republican.\n  We are talking about two provisions--not just the rule before us--\nthat use identical language, as if to say, you know, we really mean it, \nDistrict of Columbia, because we are going to do it twice. We want to \nbe doubly sure that we keep this local district from enforcing its own \nlocal budget.\n  So what is the point of this bill if they are doing it twice?\n  This bill is a pretense. It is solely designed to lay the predicate \nfor another action that has occurred this very morning in the Committee \non Appropriations. How coincidental. I sat through a Committee on \nAppropriations markup where a rider, using the very same language that \nis proposed through this rule, and that rider was indeed passed by the \nHouse appropriations subcommittee.\n  Heavens. I wonder if in the history of the House of Representatives \nwe have ever had this Congress or the Congress of the United States to \nbe so threatened by what a local jurisdiction would do that it proposes \nnot one bill, but two, to keep that local jurisdiction\n\n[[Page H3108]]\n\nfrom proceeding. We are not seceding from the United States. We are \nsimply trying to spend our own money.\n  So here we have a bill twice over because the--appropriations bill \ncontains the same language, understand, despite another of their rules \nthat prohibits legislating on an appropriations bill. The Republican \nleadership included the text of H.R. 5233 in the appropriations bill \nfor what appears to be a very good reason. They recognize that that is \nthe only chance they have of enacting the text of the rule before you, \nand that is to do so in an appropriations bill. So they are doing it \ntwice for good measure, but the only way it is going to pass is \nattaching it to some must-pass bill.\n  The Senate--and I say this on this floor--does not have the votes to \npass H.R. 5233 itself. And even if it did, the President of the United \nStates, who has long supported budget autonomy, put it in his own \nbudgets, has said he would veto it. The Executive Statement of \nAdministration Policy that came out yesterday indicated so.\n  This may be news to some Members of this body, but I am the only \nMember of Congress who was elected by the almost 700,000 American \ncitizens who live in the District of Columbia, and my constituents are \nthe only American citizens who are affected by this bill.\n  You might be able to understand the anger of my constituents if you \nknew these numbers. The people I represent pay more taxes than 22 \nStates pay.\n  Or you want another one that would make you understand the anger of \nmy constituents?\n  They are number one per capita in the Federal taxes paid to support \ntheir homeland, highest taxes per capita in the United States. And yet \nthis very day, twice--first with respect to this rule, then with \nrespect to the bill--every single Member of Congress will get a vote on \nthis bill solely concerning the District of Columbia except the Member \nof Congress who represents the District of Columbia and is elected to \nrepresent them.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  If you have never felt like a despot before, I hope that side of the \naisle understands how it feels and what it looks like.\n  The Republican leadership has claimed that it is committed to letting \nthe House work its will on legislation. However, yesterday, the Rules \nCommittee, on a party-line vote, prevented me from offering my \namendment to this bill to the House floor. What are you afraid of, if \nmy amendment comes to the House floor that says, ``Congress, you do it; \nyou grant D.C. budget autonomy''? Are you afraid you can't do it? Sure \nyou can do it. Or, at least let us do it. Give D.C. some respect.\n  My amendment was the only chance for D.C. residents to have a say on \nthe bill during floor consideration. So even though you could have, \nobviously, and would have defeated my amendment to say, ``You do it, \nyou grant us budget autonomy,'' what in the world kept you from \nallowing us the respect of bringing that amendment to counter what you \nare doing today, particularly knowing that we can't counter what you \nare doing today?\n  My amendment, of course, would have called the question on whether \nMembers support or oppose local control of local jurisdictions over \ntheir own budget. Do Members oppose budget autonomy because the \nDistrict initiated it? Or do they actually want to toss their own local \ncontrol principles out of the Capitol window through a vote requiring \nFederal approval of local funds?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 3 minutes.\n  Ms. NORTON. My amendment would have made the text of D.C.'s Local \nBudget Autonomy Act Federal law. It would have simply said, look, if \nyou don't like what the District did, you do it. We would have lost. \nBut you would at least have given to us the respect that we are \nentitled to as American citizens--afraid even to do that.\n  The Local Budget Autonomy Act is already law. The District government \nhas begun to implement it, and I applaud them for doing so. When you \nare up against a despotic House of Representatives, the only way to \nproceed in a democracy is to move on your own, or else they will say: \nSee, we waited them out and there is nothing they can do. There is only \none of them against all of us.\n  Only one court opinion has, in fact, upheld the Budget Autonomy Act, \nthough the good Member on the other side implied that this was a \nlawless act. Well, let me tell you what the court said, without going \nthrough all of it: \n       Forthwith, enforce all provisions of the Local Budget \n     Autonomy Act of 2012.\n\n  That is the law. Who is being lawless, who is being unprincipled is \nany majority that would want to be involved with the local funds of any \nAmerican jurisdiction.\n  When Members cast their vote today on the bill, they will be voting \non a bill to require Congress to approve a local budget. How un-\nRepublican. And worse, undemocratic.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Founders recognized that, within the District of \nColumbia, this was a unique entity. But Congress, in its benevolence, \ngranted the District of Columbia limited autonomy in the Home Rule Act \nof 1973. That autonomy did not extend as far as what the current Mayor \nand city council envisioned it to.\n  The Home Rule Act maintained the role of the Federal Government in \nthe District's budget process; and, indeed, the Federal Government has \nhad to step in as late as the 1990s because the District had so \nmismanaged its finances.\n  Then, the District of Columbia Financial Control Board had to be \ninstituted in order to correct the many financial disasters that the \nDistrict of Columbia government had created for itself. Congress gave \nthe board the power to override the D.C. government where it saw fit.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina \n(Mr. Meadows), from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, \nwhere this bill originated.\n  Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his \neloquent words.\n  As we look at this particular bill, there is a lot that has been said \nabout what home rule is and what it is not. There is a lot that has \nbeen said about what the law is and what it is not, and yet it is \nundeniable that the Constitution actually reserved for this esteemed \nbody the power to legislate over all affairs within the District, going \nback to Article I, section 8 of our Constitution.\n  And yet in 1973, Mr. Speaker, this body took on a law, debated it in \nboth the House and the Senate, to actually take some of those \nauthorities granted by the Constitution and allow the District to \nactually put forth laws with regard to local issues.\n  Now, specifically reserved in that 1973 law was the whole issue of \nthe budget and appropriations. As we started to look at this particular \nfunction--my good friend, the Delegate from the District, obviously has \ntalked very seriously about the law.\n  Well, the law was very clear in 1973 on what we passed. Actually, \nCharles Diggs--Chairman Diggs--had what they called the Diggs \nCompromise that specifically was spelled out in a dear colleague letter \non the fact that budgetary control would remain with this body and, \nindeed, with the appropriators. Yet somehow we see a decision by a \nsuperior court as having the effect of law?\n  Well, we know from our civics class that it is this body that is \nputting forth Federal law. It cannot be a local jurisdiction that comes \nin and usurps the power of the Federal law with its local mandates.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, while my good friend and I will disagree perhaps on \na number of issues, what we should agree on is the fact that the \nConstitution reserved this right for Congress. The Constitution and, \nindeed, those relegated and delegated powers in 1973 were specific in \nkeeping the appropriations and budgetary process within this body. To \nignore that would be, honestly, ignoring the debate that happened then, \ndebate that happens now, and sworn testimony in hearings that, indeed, \nthose who crafted this particular law are all in agreement that this \nwas the intent of Congress.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to not only \nsupport this, but reaffirm the role that Congress has and make sure \nthat we keep it within this body.\n\n[[Page H3109]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on \nboth sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New York has 13 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Texas has 18\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to \nthe gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).\n  Ms. NORTON. My good friend Mr. Meadows speaks as if he didn't speak \nup for the Congress of the United States with its awesome power, then \nCongress would be stripped of its power by the District of Columbia--\nplease.\n  If there is any concern here about this bill, the one thing my good \nfriend should not do is to base it on what lawyers say. The latest and \nmost definitive, on what lawyers say is a court of law.\n  I want to indicate what happened, because the matter was first in the \nFederal district court, then appealed to the Federal court of appeals. \nThe Federal court of appeals heard oral argument and received briefs. \nIt looked at this--and we don't know why--but they sent it to a local \nD.C. court.\n  That court heard at every single argument Mr. Meadows has raised and \nfound for the District of Columbia. And that is the definitive word on \nthe law, unless what he is saying is: Je suis the law, or, I am the \nlaw. Well, maybe you are, but you are the kind of law that led the \nFramers to rebel against England. No respect for local law.\n  You speak of the Diggs Compromise. What you didn't say is that some \ncompromise had to be reached because the Senate, in its home rule bill, \ngave the district control over its local budget.\n  So what we say, what our lawyers say, is that compromise did leave \nsome room in the charter--which does not specifically say that budget \nautonomy is denied to the District; and they could have said it, but \nthey didn't--and the compromise was to leave some room at such point as \nit became relevant to step up and claim the right to process and \nenforce their own local budget.\n  My good friend managing the bill on that side dares reach back to the \n1990s. Yes, the District got into trouble. My congratulations to the \nDistrict of Columbia as the only city which, for 200 years, carried \nState functions. And yes, in the 1990s, it became too much; and yes, \nthe city had a serious financial crisis.\n  So if you want to go back two decades, also come forward, because at \nthis time, the District has perhaps the strongest economy in the United \nStates of America. How many of you have surpluses? How many of you have \nanything to brag about in terms of the economy of your district?\n  Have you looked at what is happening in the District of Columbia? You \ncan see the building going on. You can see the increase in our \npopulation. So yes, we have had hard times, and I am sure you have, but \nI am sure that there was a whole lot less reason for your hard times \nthan for ours.\n  I am asking you to think about your own principles of local control \nand try to justify taking local control from the District, but \nparticularly to justify taking local control over our own money. That \nis what the Framers went to war about. Somebody somewhere was trying to \ntell them about taxes having to do with their own local funds.\n  I don't know if that spirit still lives on that side of the aisle, \nbut it still lives in the District of Columbia. This is our money. We \nare going to keep going at it until you have nothing to say about funds \nraised in a jurisdiction not your own. My constituents cannot hold you \naccountable because they cannot vote for you.\n  Well, sir, they have voted for me; and what I say today represents \nwhat they believe and what they will never give up, and that is the \nright to control their own local laws and, and above all, their own \nlocal funds raised from their own local taxpayers.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks \nto the Chair.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Meadows).\n  Mr. MEADOWS. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, indeed, the delegate opposite is my friend. She serves \nher constituency well. Her impassioned plea on behalf of her \nconstituents is not only recognized this day, but each and every day in \nthis body.\n  This particular debate is not over what is believed to be right or \nwrong. It is over the rule of law. Indeed, the argument was made by the \ngentleman from Georgia yesterday that this is a matter of law, not on \nthe merits of what is right or what is wrong from a standpoint of \nbudget autonomy.\n  But I would also refer, Mr. Speaker, to the argument that would \nsuggest that everything is great here in Washington, D.C., in terms of \nthe budget. If that indeed is the case that is being argued here today, \nyou can't have it both ways, because the status quo today has been one \nthat truly has the authority rested and vested here in this esteemed \nbody.\n  So to suggest that things are less than perfect, I am not here to do \nthat. But if indeed everything is turning up roses today, it is the \nstatus quo that has indeed preserved that.\n  So I would suggest that, as we start to look at this, it is a \nfundamental question: Are we going to uphold the rule of law?\n  The rule of law here is very clear. In fact, the debates back in 1973 \ntalked about that all we wanted was some of the local control over our \nlocal government. And as that debate went on, there was indeed, as my \ngood friend mentioned, in the Senate the desire to give budget autonomy \nto the district.\n  Yet, as we know from our civics class, it takes both the Senate and \nthe House and the President to sign it into law. I would say that we \nneed to continue to support the rule of law.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up two desperately needed pieces of \nlegislation.\n  The first would shed light on secret money in politics by requiring \ngroups to disclose the source of the contributions they are using to \nfund their campaign-related activities. The second would provide $600 \nmillion in funding to combat the growing opioid epidemic.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a personal privilege \nand rise today with a really sad heart and take a moment to mark what \nis the end of an era for the Rules Committee family.\n  This is Miles Lackey's last week as the staff director for the \ncommittee's minority, and we are sad about it indeed. The Rules \nCommittee is a family, and the loss is personal.\n  The Rules Committee, in my opinion, has the highest regarded staff of \nanybody that is on the Hill. In both the House and Senate, Miles has \nproved to be the gold standard for any staff wishing to make a \ncontribution to the Congress.\n  He has been a mentor and a colleague to anyone who asked for it. His \ncounsel will be missed not just for the four of us on the Democratic \nside of the Rules Committee, but I think both staff members and all \nother Members alike on both sides of the aisle.\n  Miles is a graduate of the University of North Carolina and of Yale \nDivinity School, and he brings a grounded, holistic vision of his work \nas a staff member, and the example has been a guiding force.\n  He has the patience of Job and takes every dramatic turn of events in \nstride. From government shutdowns to national emergencies, Miles has \nalways known exactly what to do.\n  As the staff director of the Rules Committee or as Senator Dodd's \nchief of staff in the Senate, he made incredible contributions to \nlegislation that has passed out of Congress during his tenure in both \nChambers.\n  From Dodd-Frank to the Affordable Care Act, it is clear that he \ndedicated his career to benefiting the American people with skill, \nintellect, and patience.\n  There is always one more story to tell, one more hug to linger over, \nbut\n\n[[Page H3110]]\n\nthere sure is no good way to say goodbye to a trusted and cherished \nadviser, a colleague, and a friend. There is only the deep gratitude \nthat we feel and the legacy of the excellence that Miles leaves.\n  Thank you, dear friend, for everything.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Woodall).\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, when you serve on the Rules Committee, you \nspend a lot of time dealing in acrimony at least here on the floor.\n  When you serve on the Rules Committee and your job is to get the \nbusiness of the House accomplished, when we are not on the House floor, \nit isn't acrimony. It may be impassioned. It may be, at times, \ndivisive.\n  But it is all focused on a single goal, and that is making sure that \nthis institution fulfills not just the expectations of our constituents \nback home, but the expectations of our framers who established it to \nbegin with.\n  Members of Congress come and go, Mr. Speaker, and, inevitably, what \nmakes a Member of Congress successful is being surrounded by a team of \nexcellence, a team of excellence back home in terms of bosses and \nconstituents and a team of excellence here in Washington to help make \nsure that all the i's are dotted and all the t's are crossed and that \nthe big things get done.\n  When Miles Lackey leaves this institution, Mr. Speaker, it is going \nto be harder to get the big things done. It is going to be harder \nbecause the biggest commodity we have in this town is not a Member pin, \nis not a Member representational allowance, is not how much mail goes \nout the door.\n  The most precious commodity in this town is trust, and not everybody \nhas it. Sadly, not everybody wants it. But to do anything that is worth \ndoing in this town, it has to be built on a foundation of trust.\n  If you don't have people like Miles Lackey on the other side of the \naisle--I sit on this side of the aisle. He is physically sitting on \nthat side of the aisle today not just emotionally, not just \nintellectually, but physically. If you don't have folks that you can \ntrust, you can't begin the conversations about how to make things \nhappen.\n  There is no committee that brings more measures to the floor than the \nRules Committee. That doesn't happen by accident. It happens \nintentionally. It happens with good folks like Miles Lackey.\n  There is no committee that has to deal with more contentious issues \nthan the Rules Committee. The committees of jurisdiction have dealt \nwith as many as they can. The hardest ones, the worst ones, end up on \nthe Rules Committee's plate. We don't deal with those issues \nsuccessfully without the trust built by folks like Miles Lackey.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, we can read the resolution that the Rules Committee put \nout for Miles, but it is only a page long. Truthfully, it doesn't do \njustice. When you lose folks who have built that trust, it takes years \nto find folks to rebuild it.\n  I want you to look at the folks who come to speak on Miles' behalf \ntoday, Mr. Speaker. I want you to look at the folks who sit in Miles' \nchain of command.\n  He is certainly not leaving the ranking member high and dry. He has \ntrained a tremendous team of folks who are going to step up and try to \nfill those shoes.\n  I came to this institution to make a difference, Mr. Speaker. I \ndidn't come just to make a point. Because Miles Lackey has served in \nthis institution not for a day, not for a week, not for a month, but \nfor decade upon decade. We have been able to make a difference.\n  I don't want to date Miles. He dates back not just before I got here, \nbut before my predecessor got here. He dates back before Republicans \ntook over this institution, Mr. Speaker, and has seen the control \nchange time and time again.\n  Watch folks when power changes, Mr. Speaker. Watch folks when power \nchanges in this institution. Watch whether they behave the same once \nthey have it as they did yesterday when they didn't.\n  We are all in the minority at some point, Mr. Speaker. We are all in \nthe minority at some point. The rules exist to protect the minority.\n  Watch the folks who have the ability to use the rules. See if they \ntreat you the same when they have the power as when they don't.\n  There is not going to be a man or woman who stands in this Chamber \nwho will tell you that Miles treats you any differently when he is in \nas when he is out.\n  He is an advocate for his position, but he is an institutionalist who \nbelieves in all of us collectively. I thank him for his service.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Rules \nresolution.\n\n       Expressing the gratitude of the Committee on Rules to Mr. \n     Miles M. Lackey, the Committee's Democratic staff director, \n     for his service to the Committee, the House, and the Nation \n     on the occasion of his retirement from the House of \n     Representatives.\n       Whereas Mr. Miles M. Lackey has served the Nation in both \n     the legislative and executive branches over the course of \n     nearly three decades;\n       Whereas he has served the Committee on Rules for most of \n     his career, first as an associate of the Rules Committee \n     staff, then later as senior advisor to the Chair and both \n     majority and minority staff director;\n       Whereas during his career, he has brought competence and \n     dignity to each office he has held;\n       Whereas his advice and counsel are sought by both Members \n     and staff alike;\n       Whereas he has always endeavored to ensure the effective \n     operation of the Committee, even when the majority and \n     minority differed on policy or process;\n       Whereas his good humor and steady demeanor will be missed: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Committee on Rules expresses its profound gratitude \n     to Mr. Miles M. Lackey for his exemplary service; and\n       (2) the clerk of the Committee is hereby directed to \n     prepare this resolution in a manner suitable for presentation \n     to Mr. Lackey.\n\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), a member of the Rules Committee.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking member \nof the Rules Committee for yielding me the time, and I join with her in \nexpressing my admiration and my respect for Miles Lackey.\n  I have known Miles for many, many years. We both served as staff \nmembers up here when I first came to the Hill. I have known him in his \ncapacity when he worked with Tony Beilinson and Ted Weiss and Chris \nDodd and John Edwards in the Rules Committee and I guess a thousand \nother things he did up here. I always admired his intellect and his \ndedication.\n  Mr. Speaker, Miles Lackey is a good man. He is a very, very good man. \nThat is an important quality for people who serve up here, whether as \nMembers of Congress or as staff members, that they are good people.\n  Miles always put the interests of the people of this country first, \nand always the most vulnerable were at the top of his list. No matter \nwhat we talk about in the Rules Committee, he always talks about how it \nis going to impact people who are struggling in this country.\n  I just want to say that I have admired Miles' dedication to this \ncountry. I have admired his intellect. I have admired his compassion. \nWe are going to miss him greatly.\n  He has taught me a lot. I know he has taught a lot of people on the \nRules Committee and other staffers and Members a lot as well. But he is \na unique individual in that everybody loves him.\n  I joked last night in the Rules Committee that I appreciated the fact \nthat Miles was the inspiration for a resolution in the Rules Committee \nthat Democrats and Republicans could support because very rarely do we \nhave resolutions that we support in a bipartisan way.\n  So I am grateful to Miles, and I join with everybody here when I say \nwe are going to miss him.\n  I will just conclude with this. I have had the privilege of serving \nwith some great Members of the House and great Members who have served \nas staffers up here.\n  Miles is at the top of that list. He is a great human being and a \ngreat public servant. We are all here, in a bipartisan way, to express \nour admiration, our deep affection, and our respect for him. We wish \nhim well.\n  And, Miles, we will be calling you often, so be prepared.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the time.\n\n[[Page H3111]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on \nthe previous question and ``no'' on the rule that joins two unrelated \nmeasures, first, to continue the House majority's overreach into the \nDistrict of Columbia's local budgetary affairs; second, to double down \non an outdated energy policy and pursue a partisan path instead of the \nbipartisan Senate plan.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out in the statement I gave at the \nbeginning of this hour, just reflecting back on the month of May, a \nmonth where the House of Representatives passed legislation funding our \nmilitary bases, funding our veterans, funding energy and water \npolicies, providing new authorities to combat the growing threat of the \nZika virus, we updated our Nation's chemical laws for the first time in \n40 years, we provided help to people in this country facing opiate \naddictions, we provided pay and benefits to our military, we provided \nthe tools to our armed services necessary to keep our citizens safe \nfrom the growing threat of terrorism, it has been a significant month \nin the United States House of Representatives. Oftentimes we don't \nreflect back on what has been accomplished. So this is a good \nopportunity to do that.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for consideration of two important \nbills to update our Nation's energy policies and address the \nconstitutional deficiencies in recent District of Columbia Council \nactions.\n  I want to thank the many Members of the House on both sides who \ncontributed to the underlying pieces of legislation, which will be \nconsidered today following the passage of today's rule.\n  Finally, I do want to join my colleagues--I am probably the most \nrecent addition to the House Rules Committee, but I certainly have been \nthere long enough to appreciate the wise counsel and guidance of Miles \nLackey and certainly wish him well in his future endeavors and pray for \nhis successor.\n  The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:\n\n          An Amendment to H. Res. 744 Offered by Ms. Slaughter\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     430) to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \n     provide for additional disclosure requirements for \n     corporations, labor organizations, and other entities, and \n     for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and \n     controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority \n     members of the Committees on House Administration, the \n     Judiciary, and Ways and Means. After general debate the bill \n     shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. \n     All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H. R. 430.\n       Sec 8. Immediately after the disposition of H.R. 430 the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     5189) to address the opioid abuse crisis. The first reading \n     of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order \n     against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate \n     shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour \n     equally divided among and controlled by the respective chairs \n     and ranking minority members of the Committees on Energy and \n     Commerce and the Judiciary. After general debate the bill \n     shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. \n     All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 5189.\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution. . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States has enjoyed a renaissance in energy \n     production, establishing the United States as the world's \n     leading oil producer.\n       (2) By authorizing crude oil exports, the Congress can spur \n     domestic energy production, create and preserve jobs, help \n     maintain and strengthen our independent shipping fleet that \n     is essential to national defense, and generate State and \n     Federal revenues.\n       (3) An energy-secure United States that is a net exporter \n     of energy has the potential to transform the security \n     environment around the world, notably in Europe and the \n     Middle East.\n       (4) For our European allies and Israel, the presence of \n     more United States oil in the market will offer more secure \n     supply options, which will strengthen United States strategic \n     alliances and help curtail the use of energy as a political \n     weapon.\n       (5) The 60-ship Maritime Security Fleet is a vital element \n     of our military's strategic sealift and global response \n     capability. It assures United States-flag ships and United \n     States crews will be available to support the United States \n     military when it needs to mobilize to protect our allies, and \n     is the most prudent and economical solution to meet current \n     and projected sealift requirements for the United States.\n       (6) The Maritime Security Fleet program provides a labor \n     base of skilled American mariners who are available to crew \n     the United States Government-owned strategic sealift fleet, \n     as well as the United States commercial fleet, in both peace \n     and war.\n       (7) The United States has reduced its oil consumption over \n     the past decade, and increasing investment in clean energy \n     technology and energy efficiency will lower energy prices, \n     reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase national \n     security.\n\n     SEC. 4002. REPEAL.\n\n       Section 103 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 6212) and the item relating thereto in the table of \n     contents of that Act are repealed.\n\n     SEC. 4003. NATIONAL POLICY ON OIL EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, to promote the \n     efficient exploration, production, storage, supply, \n     marketing, pricing, and regulation of energy resources, \n     including fossil fuels, no official of the Federal Government \n     shall impose or enforce any restriction on the export of \n     crude oil.\n\n     SEC. 4004.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Western Water and American \n     Food Security Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 1002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) As established in the Proclamation of a State of \n     Emergency issued by the Governor of the State on January 17, \n     2014, the State is experiencing record dry conditions.\n       (2) Extremely dry conditions have persisted in the State \n     since 2012, and the drought conditions are likely to persist \n     into the future.\n       (3) The water supplies of the State are at record-low \n     levels, as indicated by the fact that all major Central \n     Valley Project reservoir levels were at 20-35 percent of \n     capacity as of September 25, 2014.\n       (4) The lack of precipitation has been a significant \n     contributing factor to the 6,091 fires experienced in the \n     State as of September 15, 2014, and which covered nearly \n     400,000 acres.\n       (5) According to a study released by the University of \n     California, Davis in July 2014, the drought has led to the \n     fallowing of 428,000 acres of farmland, loss of $810 million \n     in crop revenue, loss of $203 million in dairy and other \n     livestock value, and increased groundwater pumping costs by \n     $454 million. The statewide economic costs are estimated to \n     be $2.2 billion, with over 17,000 seasonal and part-time \n     agricultural jobs lost.\n       (6) CVPIA Level II water deliveries to refuges have also \n     been reduced by 25 percent in the north of Delta region, and \n     by 35 percent in the south of Delta region.\n       (7) Only one-sixth of the usual acres of rice fields are \n     being flooded this fall, which leads to a significant decline \n     in habitat for migratory birds and an increased risk of \n     disease at the remaining wetlands due to overcrowding of such \n     birds.\n       (8) The drought of 2013 through 2014 constitutes a serious \n     emergency that poses immediate and severe risks to human life \n     and safety and to the environment throughout the State.\n       (9) The serious emergency described in paragraph (4) \n     requires--\n       (A) immediate and credible action that respects the \n     complexity of the water system of the State and the \n     importance of the water system to the entire State; and\n       (B) policies that do not pit stakeholders against one \n     another, which history shows only leads to costly litigation \n     that benefits no one and prevents any real solutions.\n       (10) Data on the difference between water demand and \n     reliable water supplies for various regions of California \n     south of the Delta, including the San Joaquin Valley, \n     indicate there is a significant annual gap between reliable \n     water supplies to meet agricultural, municipal and \n     industrial, groundwater, and refuges water needs within the \n     Delta Division, San Luis Unit and Friant Division of the \n     Central Valley Project and the State Water Project south of \n     the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and the demands of \n     those areas. This gap varies depending on the methodology of \n     the analysis performed, but can be represented in the \n     following ways:\n       (A) For Central Valley Project South-of-Delta water service \n     contractors, if it is assumed that a water supply deficit is \n     the difference in the amount of water available for \n     allocation versus the maximum contract quantity, then the \n     water supply deficits that have developed from 1992 to 2014 \n     as a result of legislative and regulatory changes besides \n     natural variations in hydrology during this timeframe range \n     between 720,000 and 1,100,000 acre-feet.\n       (B) For Central Valley Project and State Water Project \n     water service contractors south of the Delta and north of the \n     Tehachapi mountain range, if it is assumed that a water \n     supply deficit is the difference between reliable water \n     supplies, including maximum water contract deliveries, safe \n     yield of groundwater, safe yield of local and surface \n     supplies and long-term contracted water transfers, and water \n     demands, including water demands from agriculture, municipal \n     and industrial and refuge contractors, then the water supply \n     deficit ranges between approximately 2,500,000 to 2,700,000 \n     acre-feet.\n       (11) Data of pumping activities at the Central Valley \n     Project and State Water Project delta pumps identifies that, \n     on average from Water Year 2009 to Water Year 2014, take of \n     Delta smelt is 80 percent less than allowable take levels \n     under the biological opinion issued December 15, 2008.\n       (12) Data of field sampling activities of the Interagency \n     Ecological Program located in the Sacramento-San Joaquin \n     Estuary identifies that, on average from 2005 to 2013, the \n     program ``takes'' 3,500 delta smelt during annual surveys \n     with an authorized ``take'' level of 33,480 delta smelt \n     annually--according to the biological opinion issued December \n     9, 1997.\n       (13) In 2015, better information exists than was known in \n     2008 concerning conditions and operations that may or may not \n     lead to high salvage events that jeopardize the fish \n     populations, and what alternative management actions can be \n     taken to avoid jeopardy.\n       (14) Alternative management strategies, removing non-native \n     species, enhancing habitat, monitoring fish movement and \n     location in real-time, and improving water quality in the \n     Delta can contribute significantly to protecting and \n     recovering these endangered fish species, and at potentially \n     lower costs to water supplies.\n       (15) Resolution of fundamental policy questions concerning \n     the extent to which application of the Endangered Species Act \n     of 1973 affects the operation of the Central Valley Project \n     and State Water Project is the responsibility of Congress.\n\n     SEC. 1003.

FACTORING INCREASED REAL-TIME MONITORING AND \n                   UPDATED SCIENCE INTO DELTA SMELT MANAGEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Director shall use the best scientific \n     and commercial data available to implement, continuously \n     evaluate, and refine or amend, as appropriate, the reasonable \n     and prudent alternative described in the smelt biological \n     opinion, and any successor opinions or court order. The \n     Secretary shall make all significant decisions under the \n     smelt biological opinion, or any successor opinions that \n     affect Central Valley Project and State Water Project \n     operations, in writing, and shall document the significant \n     facts upon which such decisions are made, consistent with \n     section 706 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (b) Increased Monitoring To Inform Real-Time Operations.--\n     The Secretary shall conduct\n\n[[Page H3156]]\n\n     additional surveys, on an annual basis at the appropriate \n     time of the year based on environmental conditions, in \n     collaboration with other Delta science interests.\n       (1) In implementing this section, the Secretary shall--\n       (A) use the most accurate survey methods available for the \n     detection of Delta smelt to determine the extent that adult \n     Delta smelt are distributed in relation to certain levels of \n     turbidity, or other environmental factors that may influence \n     salvage rate; and\n       (B) use results from appropriate survey methods for the \n     detection of Delta smelt to determine how the Central Valley \n     Project and State Water Project may be operated more \n     efficiently to minimize salvage while maximizing export \n     pumping rates without causing a significant negative impact \n     on the long-term survival of the Delta smelt.\n       (2) During the period beginning on December 1, 2015, and \n     ending March 31, 2016, and in each successive December \n     through March period, if suspended sediment loads enter the \n     Delta from the Sacramento River and the suspended sediment \n     loads appear likely to raise turbidity levels in the Old \n     River north of the export pumps from values below 12 \n     Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) to values above 12 NTU, \n     the Secretary shall--\n       (A) conduct daily monitoring using appropriate survey \n     methods at locations including, but not limited to, the \n     vicinity of Station 902 to determine the extent that adult \n     Delta smelt are moving with turbidity toward the export \n     pumps; and\n       (B) use results from the monitoring surveys referenced in \n     paragraph (A) to determine how increased trawling can inform \n     daily real-time Central Valley Project and State Water \n     Project operations to minimize salvage while maximizing \n     export pumping rates without causing a significant negative \n     impact on the long-term survival of the Delta smelt.\n       (c) Periodic Review of Monitoring.--Within 12 months of the \n     date of enactment of this title, and at least once every 5 \n     years thereafter, the Secretary shall--\n       (1) evaluate whether the monitoring program under \n     subsection (b), combined with other monitoring programs for \n     the Delta, is providing sufficient data to inform Central \n     Valley Project and State Water Project operations to minimize \n     salvage while maximizing export pumping rates without causing \n     a significant negative impact on the long-term survival of \n     the Delta smelt; and\n       (2) determine whether the monitoring efforts should be \n     changed in the short or long term to provide more useful \n     data.\n       (d) Delta Smelt Distribution Study.--\n       (1) In general.--No later than January 1, 2016, and at \n     least every five years thereafter, the Secretary, in \n     collaboration with the California Department of Fish and \n     Wildlife, the California Department of Water Resources, \n     public water agencies, and other interested entities, shall \n     implement new targeted sampling and monitoring specifically \n     designed to understand Delta smelt abundance, distribution, \n     and the types of habitat occupied by Delta smelt during all \n     life stages.\n       (2) Sampling.--The Delta smelt distribution study shall, at \n     a minimum--\n       (A) include recording water quality and tidal data;\n       (B) be designed to understand Delta smelt abundance, \n     distribution, habitat use, and movement throughout the Delta, \n     Suisun Marsh, and other areas occupied by the Delta smelt \n     during all seasons;\n       (C) consider areas not routinely sampled by existing \n     monitoring programs, including wetland channels, near-shore \n     water, depths below 35 feet, and shallow water; and\n       (D) use survey methods, including sampling gear, best \n     suited to collect the most accurate data for the type of \n     sampling or monitoring.\n       (e) Scientifically Supported Implementation of OMR Flow \n     Requirements.--In implementing the provisions of the smelt \n     biological opinion, or any successor biological opinion or \n     court order, pertaining to management of reverse flow in the \n     Old and Middle Rivers, the Secretary shall--\n       (1) consider the relevant provisions of the biological \n     opinion or any successor biological opinion;\n       (2) to maximize Central Valley project and State Water \n     Project water supplies, manage export pumping rates to \n     achieve a reverse OMR flow rate of -5,000 cubic feet per \n     second unless information developed by the Secretary under \n     paragraphs (3) and (4) leads the Secretary to reasonably \n     conclude that a less negative OMR flow rate is necessary to \n     avoid a negative impact on the long-term survival of the \n     Delta smelt. If information available to the Secretary \n     indicates that a reverse OMR flow rate more negative than \n     -5,000 cubic feet per second can be established without an \n     imminent negative impact on the long-term survival of the \n     Delta smelt, the Secretary shall manage export pumping rates \n     to achieve that more negative OMR flow rate;\n       (3) document in writing any significant facts about real-\n     time conditions relevant to the determinations of OMR reverse \n     flow rates, including--\n       (A) whether targeted real-time fish monitoring in the Old \n     River pursuant to this section, including monitoring in the \n     vicinity of Station 902, indicates that a significant \n     negative impact on the long-term survival of the Delta smelt \n     is imminent; and\n       (B) whether near-term forecasts with available salvage \n     models show under prevailing conditions that OMR flow of \n     -5,000 cubic feet per second or higher will cause a \n     significant negative impact on the long-term survival of the \n     Delta smelt;\n       (4) show in writing that any determination to manage OMR \n     reverse flow at rates less negative than -5,000 cubic feet \n     per second is necessary to avoid a significant negative \n     impact on the long-term survival of the Delta smelt, \n     including an explanation of the data examined and the \n     connection between those data and the choice made, after \n     considering--\n       (A) the distribution of Delta smelt throughout the Delta;\n       (B) the potential effects of documented, quantified \n     entrainment on subsequent Delta smelt abundance;\n       (C) the water temperature;\n       (D) other significant factors relevant to the \n     determination; and\n       (E) whether any alternative measures could have a \n     substantially lesser water supply impact; and\n       (5) for any subsequent biological opinion, make the showing \n     required in paragraph (4) for any determination to manage OMR \n     reverse flow at rates less negative than the most negative \n     limit in the biological opinion if the most negative limit in \n     the biological opinion is more negative than -5,000 cubic \n     feet per second.\n       (f) Memorandum of Understanding.--No later than December 1, \n     2015, the Commissioner and the Director will execute a \n     Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to ensure that the smelt \n     biological opinion is implemented in a manner that maximizes \n     water supply while complying with applicable laws and \n     regulations. If that MOU alters any procedures set out in the \n     biological opinion, there will be no need to reinitiate \n     consultation if those changes will not have a significant \n     negative impact on the long-term survival on listed species \n     and the implementation of the MOU would not be a major change \n     to implementation of the biological opinion. Any change to \n     procedures that does not create a significant negative impact \n     on the long-term survival to listed species will not alter \n     application of the take permitted by the incidental take \n     statement in the biological opinion under section 7(o)(2) of \n     the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n       (g) Calculation of Reverse Flow in OMR.--Within 90 days of \n     the enactment of this title, the Secretary is directed, in \n     consultation with the California Department of Water \n     Resources to revise the method used to calculate reverse flow \n     in Old and Middle Rivers for implementation of the reasonable \n     and prudent alternatives in the smelt biological opinion and \n     the salmonid biological opinion, and any succeeding \n     biological opinions, for the purpose of increasing Central \n     Valley Project and State Water Project water supplies. The \n     method of calculating reverse flow in Old and Middle Rivers \n     shall be reevaluated not less than every five years \n     thereafter to achieve maximum export pumping rates within \n     limits established by the smelt biological opinion, the \n     salmonid biological opinion, and any succeeding biological \n     opinions.\n\n Subtitle B--ENSURING SALMONID MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIVE TO NEW SCIENCE\n\n     SEC. 1021.

The Commissioner and the Assistant \n     Administrator shall fully utilize these authorities as \n     described below.\n       (b) Annual Reviews of Certain Central Valley Project and \n     State Water Project Operations.--No later than December 31, \n     2016, and at least annually thereafter:\n       (1) The Commissioner, with the assistance of the Assistant \n     Administrator, shall examine and identify adjustments to the \n     initiation of Action IV.2.3 as set forth in the Biological \n     Opinion and Conference Opinion on the Long-Term Operations of \n     the Central Valley Project and State Water Project, \n     Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultation, issued by the \n     National Marine Fisheries Service on June 4, 2009, pertaining \n     to negative OMR flows, subject to paragraph (5).\n       (2) The Commissioner, with the assistance of the Assistant \n     Administrator, shall examine and identify adjustments in the \n     timing, triggers or other operational details relating to the \n     implementation of pumping restrictions in Action IV.2.1 \n     pertaining to the inflow to export ratio, subject to \n     paragraph (5).\n       (3) Pursuant to the consultation and assessments carried \n     out under paragraphs (1) and (2)\n\n[[Page H3157]]\n\n     of this subsection, the Commissioner and the Assistant \n     Administrator shall jointly make recommendations to the \n     Secretary of the Interior and to the Secretary on adjustments \n     to project operations that, in the exercise of the adaptive \n     management provisions of the salmonid biological opinion, \n     will reduce water supply impacts of the salmonid biological \n     opinion on the Central Valley Project and the California \n     State Water Project and are consistent with the requirements \n     of applicable law and as further described in subsection (c).\n       (4) The Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior shall \n     direct the Commissioner and Assistant Administrator to \n     implement recommended adjustments to Central Valley Project \n     and State Water Project operations for which the conditions \n     under subsection (c) are met.\n       (5) The Assistant Administrator and the Commissioner shall \n     review and identify adjustments to Central Valley Project and \n     State Water Project operations with water supply restrictions \n     in any successor biological opinion to the salmonid \n     biological opinion, applying the provisions of this section \n     to those water supply restrictions where there are references \n     to Actions IV.2.1 and IV.2.3.\n       (c) Implementation of Operational Adjustments.--After \n     reviewing the recommendations under subsection (b), the \n     Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary shall direct the \n     Commissioner and the Assistant Administrator to implement \n     those operational adjustments, or any combination, for which, \n     in aggregate--\n       (1) the net effect on listed species is equivalent to those \n     of the underlying project operational parameters in the \n     salmonid biological opinion, taking into account both--\n       (A) efforts to minimize the adverse effects of the \n     adjustment to project operations; and\n       (B) whatever additional actions or measures may be \n     implemented in conjunction with the adjustments to operations \n     to offset the adverse effects to listed species, consistent \n     with (d), that are in excess of the adverse effects of the \n     underlying operational parameters, if any; and\n       (2) the effects of the adjustment can be reasonably \n     expected to fall within the incidental take authorizations.\n       (d) Evaluation of Offsetting Measures.--When examining and \n     identifying opportunities to offset the potential adverse \n     effect of adjustments to operations under subsection \n     (c)(1)(B), the Commissioner and the Assistant Administrator \n     shall take into account the potential species survival \n     improvements that are likely to result from other measures \n     which, if implemented in conjunction with such adjustments, \n     would offset adverse effects, if any, of the adjustments. \n     When evaluating offsetting measures, the Commissioner and the \n     Assistant Administrator shall consider the type, timing and \n     nature of the adverse effects, if any, to specific species \n     and ensure that the measures likely provide equivalent \n     overall benefits to the listed species in the aggregate, as \n     long as the change will not cause a significant negative \n     impact on the long-term survival of a listed salmonid \n     species.\n       (e) Framework for Examining Opportunities To Minimize or \n     Offset the Potential Adverse Effect of Adjustments to \n     Operations.--Not later than December 31, 2015, and every five \n     years thereafter, the Assistant Administrator shall, in \n     collaboration with the Director of the California Department \n     of Fish and Wildlife, based on the best scientific and \n     commercial data available and for each listed salmonid \n     species, issue estimates of the increase in through-Delta \n     survival the Secretary expects to be achieved--\n       (1) through restrictions on export pumping rates as \n     specified by Action IV.2.3 as compared to limiting OMR flow \n     to a fixed rate of -5,000 cubic feet per second within the \n     time period Action IV.2.3 is applicable, based on a given \n     rate of San Joaquin River inflow to the Delta and holding \n     other relevant factors constant;\n       (2) through San Joaquin River inflow to export restrictions \n     on export pumping rates specified within Action IV.2.1 as \n     compared to the restrictions in the April/May period imposed \n     by the State Water Resources Control Board decision D-1641, \n     based on a given rate of San Joaquin River inflow to the \n     Delta and holding other relevant factors constant;\n       (3) through physical habitat restoration improvements;\n       (4) through predation control programs;\n       (5) through the installation of temporary barriers, the \n     management of Cross Channel Gates operations, and other \n     projects affecting flow in the Delta;\n       (6) through salvaging fish that have been entrained near \n     the entrance to Clifton Court Forebay;\n       (7) through any other management measures that may provide \n     equivalent or better protections for listed species while \n     maximizing export pumping rates without causing a significant \n     negative impact on the long-term survival of a listed \n     salmonid species; and\n       (8) through development and implementation of conservation \n     hatchery programs for salmon and steelhead to aid in the \n     recovery of listed salmon and steelhead species.\n       (f) Survival Estimates.--\n       (1) To the maximum extent practicable, the Assistant \n     Administrator shall make quantitative estimates of survival \n     such as a range of percentage increases in through-Delta \n     survival that could result from the management measures, and \n     if the scientific information is lacking for quantitative \n     estimates, shall do so on qualitative terms based upon the \n     best available science.\n       (2) If the Assistant Administrator provides qualitative \n     survival estimates for a species resulting from one or more \n     management measures, the Secretary shall, to the maximum \n     extent feasible, rank the management measures described in \n     subsection (e) in terms of their most likely expected \n     contribution to increased through-Delta survival relative to \n     the other measures.\n       (3) If at the time the Assistant Administrator conducts the \n     reviews under subsection (b), the Secretary has not issued an \n     estimate of increased through-Delta survival from different \n     management measures pursuant to subsection (e), the Secretary \n     shall compare the protections to the species from different \n     management measures based on the best scientific and \n     commercial data available at the time.\n       (g) Comparison of Adverse Consequences for Alternative \n     Management Measures of Equivalent Protection for a Species.--\n       (1) For the purposes of this subsection and subsection \n     (c)--\n       (A) the alternative management measure or combination of \n     alternative management measures identified in paragraph (2) \n     shall be known as the ``equivalent alternative measure'';\n       (B) the existing measure or measures identified in \n     subparagraphs (2) (A), (B), (C), or (D) shall be known as the \n     ``equivalent existing measure''; and\n       (C) an ``equivalent increase in through-Delta survival \n     rates for listed salmonid species'' shall mean an increase in \n     through-Delta survival rates that is equivalent when \n     considering the change in through-Delta survival rates for \n     the listed salmonid species in the aggregate, and not the \n     same change for each individual species, as long as the \n     change in survival rates will not cause a significant \n     negative impact on the long-term survival of a listed \n     salmonid species.\n       (2) As part of the reviews of project operations pursuant \n     to subsection (b), the Assistant Administrator shall \n     determine whether any alternative management measures or \n     combination of alternative management measures listed in \n     subsection (e) (3) through (8) would provide an increase in \n     through-Delta survival rates for listed salmonid species that \n     is equivalent to the increase in through-Delta survival rates \n     for listed salmonid species from the following:\n       (A) Through restrictions on export pumping rates as \n     specified by Action IV.2.3, as compared to limiting OMR flow \n     to a fixed rate of -5,000 cubic feet per second within the \n     time period Action IV.2.3 is applicable.\n       (B) Through restrictions on export pumping rates as \n     specified by Action IV.2.3, as compared to a modification of \n     Action IV.2.3 that would provide additional water supplies, \n     other than that described in subparagraph (A).\n       (C) Through San Joaquin River inflow to export restrictions \n     on export pumping rates specified within Action IV.2.1, as \n     compared to the restrictions in the April/May period imposed \n     by the State Water Resources Control Board decision D-1641.\n       (D) Through San Joaquin River inflow to export restrictions \n     on export pumping rates specified within Action IV.2.1, as \n     compared to a modification of Action IV.2.1 that would reduce \n     water supply impacts of the salmonid biological opinion on \n     the Central Valley Project and the California State Water \n     Project, other than that described in subparagraph (C).\n       (3) If the Assistant Administrator identifies an equivalent \n     alternative measure pursuant to paragraph (2), the Assistant \n     Administrator shall determine whether--\n       (A) it is technically feasible and within Federal \n     jurisdiction to implement the equivalent alternative measure;\n       (B) the State of California, or subdivision thereof, or \n     local agency with jurisdiction has certified in writing \n     within 10 calendar days to the Assistant Administrator that \n     it has the authority and capability to implement the \n     pertinent equivalent alternative measure; or\n       (C) the adverse consequences of doing so are less than the \n     adverse consequences of the equivalent existing measure, \n     including a concise evaluation of the adverse consequences to \n     other affected interests.\n       (4) If the Assistant Administrator makes the determinations \n     in subparagraph (3)(A) or (3)(B), the Commissioner shall \n     adjust project operations to implement the equivalent \n     alternative measure in place of the equivalent existing \n     measure in order to increase export rates of pumping to the \n     greatest extent possible while maintaining a net combined \n     effect of equivalent through-Delta survival rates for the \n     listed salmonid species.\n       (h) Tracking Adverse Effects Beyond the Range of Effects \n     Accounted for in the Salmonid Biological Opinion and \n     Coordinated Operation With the Delta Smelt Biological \n     Opinion.--\n       (1) Among the adjustments to the project operations \n     considered through the adaptive management process under this \n     section, the Assistant Administrator and the Commissioner \n     shall--\n       (A) evaluate the effects on listed salmonid species and \n     water supply of the potential adjustment to operational \n     criteria described in subparagraph (B); and\n       (B) consider requiring that before some or all of the \n     provisions of Actions IV.2.1. or IV.2.3 are imposed in any \n     specific instance, the Assistant Administrator show that the \n     implementation of these provisions in that specific instance \n     is necessary to avoid a significant negative impact on the \n     long-term survival of a listed salmonid species.\n       (2) The Assistant Administrator, the Director, and the \n     Commissioner, in coordination with State officials as \n     appropriate, shall establish operational criteria to \n     coordinate management of OMR flows under the smelt and \n     salmonid biological opinions, in order to take advantage of \n     opportunities to provide additional water supplies from the \n     coordinated implementation of the biological opinions.\n       (3) The Assistant Administrator and the Commissioner shall \n     document the effects of any adaptive management decisions \n     related to the coordinated operation of the smelt and \n     salmonid biological opinions that prioritizes the maintenance \n     of one species at the expense of the other.\n       (i) Real-Time Monitoring and Management.--Notwithstanding \n     the calendar based triggers described in the salmonid \n     biological opinion Reasonable and Prudent Alternative\n\n[[Page H3158]]\n\n     (RPA), the Assistant Administrator and the Commissioner shall \n     not limit OMR reverse flow to -5,000 cubic feet per second \n     unless current monitoring data indicate that this OMR flow \n     limitation is reasonably required to avoid a significant \n     negative impact on the long-term survival of a listed \n     salmonid species.\n       (j) Evaluation and Implementation of Management Measures.--\n     If the quantitative estimates of through-Delta survival \n     established by the Secretary for the adjustments in \n     subsection (b)(2) exceed the through-Delta survival \n     established for the RPAs, the Secretary shall evaluate and \n     implement the management measures in subsection (b)(2) as a \n     prerequisite to implementing the RPAs contained in the \n     Salmonid Biological Opinion.\n       (k) Accordance With Other Law.--Consistent with section 706 \n     of title 5, United States Code, decisions of the Assistant \n     Administrator and the Commissioner described in subsections \n     (b) through (j) shall be made in writing, on the basis of \n     best scientific and commercial data currently available, and \n     shall include an explanation of the data examined at the \n     connection between those data and the decisions made.\n\n     SEC. 1023. NON-FEDERAL PROGRAM TO PROTECT NATIVE ANADROMOUS \n                   FISH IN THE STANISLAUS RIVER.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Nonnative Predator Fish Removal \n     Program.--The Secretary and the districts, in consultation \n     with the Director, shall jointly develop and conduct a \n     nonnative predator fish removal program to remove nonnative \n     striped bass, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black bass, \n     and other nonnative predator fish species from the Stanislaus \n     River. The program shall--\n       (1) be scientifically based;\n       (2) include methods to quantify the number and size of \n     predator fish removed each year, the impact of such removal \n     on the overall abundance of predator fish, and the impact of \n     such removal on the populations of juvenile anadromous fish \n     found in the Stanislaus River by, among other things, \n     evaluating the number of juvenile anadromous fish that \n     migrate past the rotary screw trap located at Caswell;\n       (3) among other methods, use wire fyke trapping, portable \n     resistance board weirs, and boat electrofishing; and\n       (4) be implemented as quickly as possible following the \n     issuance of all necessary scientific research.\n       (b) Management.--The management of the program shall be the \n     joint responsibility of the Secretary and the districts. Such \n     parties shall work collaboratively to ensure the performance \n     of the program, and shall discuss and agree upon, among other \n     things, changes in the structure, management, personnel, \n     techniques, strategy, data collection, reporting, and conduct \n     of the program.\n       (c) Conduct.--\n       (1) In general.--By agreement between the Secretary and the \n     districts, the program may be conducted by their own \n     personnel, qualified private contractors hired by the \n     districts, personnel of, on loan to, or otherwise assigned to \n     the National Marine Fisheries Service, or a combination \n     thereof.\n       (2) Participation by the national marine fisheries \n     service.--If the districts elect to conduct the program using \n     their own personnel or qualified private contractors hired by \n     them in accordance with paragraph (1), the Secretary may \n     assign an employee of, on loan to, or otherwise assigned to \n     the National Marine Fisheries Service, to be present for all \n     activities performed in the field. Such presence shall ensure \n     compliance with the agreed-upon elements specified in \n     subsection (b). The districts shall pay the cost of such \n     participation in accordance with subsection (d).\n       (3) Timing of election.--The districts shall notify the \n     Secretary of their election on or before October 15 of each \n     calendar year of the program. Such an election shall apply to \n     the work performed in the subsequent calendar year.\n       (d) Funding.--\n       (1) In general.--The districts shall be responsible for 100 \n     percent of the cost of the program.\n       (2) Contributed funds.--The Secretary may accept and use \n     contributions of funds from the districts to carry out \n     activities under the program.\n       (3) Estimation of cost.--On or before December 1 of each \n     year of the program, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     districts an estimate of the cost to be incurred by the \n     National Marine Fisheries Service for the program in the \n     following calendar year, if any, including the cost of any \n     data collection and posting under subsection (e).

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) recreational fishing and hunting are important and \n     traditional activities in which millions of Americans \n     participate;\n       (2) recreational anglers and hunters have been and continue \n     to be among the foremost supporters of sound fish and \n     wildlife management and conservation in the United States;\n       (3) recreational fishing and hunting are environmentally \n     acceptable and beneficial activities that occur and can be \n     provided on Federal lands and waters without adverse effects \n     on other uses or users;\n       (4) recreational anglers, hunters, and sporting \n     organizations provide direct assistance to fish and wildlife \n     managers and enforcement officers of the Federal Government \n     as well as State and local governments by investing volunteer \n     time and effort to fish and wildlife conservation;\n       (5) recreational anglers, hunters, and the associated \n     industries have generated billions of dollars of critical \n     funding for fish and wildlife conservation, research, and \n     management by providing revenues from purchases of fishing \n     and hunting licenses, permits, and stamps, as well as excise \n     taxes on fishing, hunting, and recreational shooting \n     equipment that have generated billions of dollars of critical \n     funding for fish and wildlife conservation, research, and \n     management;\n       (6) recreational shooting is also an important and \n     traditional activity in which millions of Americans \n     participate;\n       (7) safe recreational shooting is a valid use of Federal \n     lands, including the establishment of safe and convenient \n     recreational shooting ranges on such lands, and participation \n     in recreational shooting helps recruit and retain hunters and \n     contributes to wildlife conservation;\n       (8) opportunities to recreationally fish, hunt, and shoot \n     are declining, which depresses participation in these \n     traditional activities, and depressed participation adversely \n     impacts fish and wildlife conservation and funding for \n     important conservation efforts; and\n       (9) the public interest would be served, and our citizens' \n     fish and wildlife resources benefitted, by action to ensure \n     that opportunities are facilitated to engage in fishing and \n     hunting on Federal land as recognized by Executive Order No. \n     12962, relating to recreational fisheries, and Executive \n     Order No. 13443, relating to facilitation of hunting heritage \n     and wildlife conservation.\n\n     SEC. 2063.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The industrialization of developing nations has driven \n     demand for nonfuel minerals necessary for telecommunications, \n     military technologies, healthcare technologies, and \n     conventional and renewable energy technologies.\n       (2) The availability of minerals and mineral materials are \n     essential for economic growth, national security, \n     technological innovation, and the manufacturing and \n     agricultural supply chain.\n       (3) The exploration, production, processing, use, and \n     recycling of minerals contribute significantly to the \n     economic well-being, security, and general welfare of the \n     Nation.\n       (4) The United States has vast mineral resources, but is \n     becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign sources of these \n     mineral materials, as demonstrated by the following:\n       (A) Twenty-five years ago the United States was dependent \n     on foreign sources for 45 nonfuel mineral materials, 8 of \n     which the United States imported 100 percent of the Nation's \n     requirements, and for another 19 commodities the United \n     States imported more than 50 percent of the Nation's needs.\n       (B) By 2014 the United States import dependence for nonfuel \n     mineral materials increased from 45 to 65 commodities, 19 of \n     which the United States imported for 100 percent of the \n     Nation's requirements, and an additional 24 of which the \n     United States imported for more than 50 percent of the \n     Nation's needs.\n       (C) The United States share of worldwide mineral \n     exploration dollars was 7 percent in 2014, down from 19 \n     percent in the early 1990s.\n       (D) In the 2014 Ranking of Countries for Mining Investment \n     (out of 25 major mining countries), found that 7- to 10-year \n     permitting delays are the most significant risk to mining \n     projects in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3003.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the House amendment to S. \n2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2016.\n  In December of last year, the House passed H.R. 8, the North American \nEnergy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015, which is a large \nportion of the language we are considering today. This legislation, \ntogether with provisions from the Committee on Natural Resources and \nthe Committee on\n\n[[Page H3199]]\n\nScience, Space, and Technology, would be the first major piece of \nenergy legislation in 8 years, and it addresses many outdated aspects \nof our Federal energy policy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nUpton), the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to wish the chairman a happy \nbirthday.\n  It has been nearly a decade since we last considered an energy \npackage like this. In that time, a lot has changed. Continued \ninnovation and discovery across the energy sector have brought about a \nnew landscape of abundant supply and tremendous potential for economic \ngrowth. This has been a multiyear, multi-Congress effort, and a lot of \nwork has gone in to make sure that the bill that we put forward to \nsupport the future of American energy is truly comprehensive. Together \nwith our colleagues, I am proud to be moving this legislation one step \ncloser to becoming the new reality for energy producers and consumers \nacross the country.\n  This bill is about jobs. It is about keeping energy affordable. It is \nabout boosting our energy security here and across the globe. H.R. 8 is \nthe embodiment of an all-of-the-above energy strategy. One of the most \nimportant provisions is, in fact, modernizing and protecting critical \nenergy infrastructure, including the electric grid, from new threats, \nincluding severe weather from climate, cyber threats, and physical \nattacks as well.\n  It helps to foster and promote new 21st century energy jobs by \nensuring that the Department of Energy and our labs and universities \nwork together to train the energy workforce and entrepreneurs of \ntomorrow. It makes energy efficiency, including Federal Government \nenergy efficiency, a priority, and focuses less on creating new \nmandates and subsidies to incentivize behavior and more on market \nchanges and using the government as an example.\n  Finally, it helps update existing laws that bring some added \ncertainty to permitting processes and helps to promote using our \nabundant resources to aid in diplomacy. For example, by streamlining \nthe approval process for projects such as the interstate natural gas \npipelines and LNG export facilities, the legislation will allow \nbusinesses at the cutting edge of research to keep putting the full \nscope of energy abundance to work for consumers both here and abroad. \nThis allows us to provide an energy lifeline to our allies across the \nglobe.\n  Provisions within H.R. 8 and others that have been included in the \namendment under consideration today also seek to capitalize on energy \nsources that the administration has rejected. H.R. 8 brings much-needed \nreforms to the hydropower licensing process as well, a clean energy \nsource that, together with nuclear, provides some 25 percent of the \nUnited States' electricity, with no greenhouse gas emissions. It is \nimperative that hydropower remains a vital part of any future.\n  The all-of-the-above energy strategy also means that the future of \nAmerican energy does not need to be a series of choices between the \nenvironment and the economy. By introducing 21st century regulatory \nreforms that reflect our energy abundance, and with the DOE's \nQuadrennial Energy Review as a guide, this bill will help bring about \nneeded reforms and continued innovation across the energy sector.\n  The legislation before us today is the product of a thorough \nassessment of the gap that we face between our stale energy regulations \nand our budding energy supply. H.R. 8 closes the gap. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, when members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce \nfirst began to address a comprehensive bipartisan energy bill in the \nbeginning of 2015, there was a sense of hopefulness, a sense of \noptimism that the committee would once again set the standard for \nworking together to get things done on behalf of the American people in \na spirit of bipartisan cooperation.\n  At that time, Mr. Speaker, many of us on the minority side had \nenormous expectations that we would draft a bill that would move our \nenergy policy forward in a manner befitting the challenges facing our \nNation in this, the 21st century.\n  Specifically, Mr. Speaker, from my perspective, a comprehensive \nenergy bill would need to modernize the Nation's aging energy \ninfrastructure, train a 21st century workforce, and address the \ncritically important issue of manmade climate change. Unfortunately, \nMr. Speaker, none of these issues are addressed in the bill that we are \nvoting on here today.\n  This 800-page hodgepodge of Republican and corporate priorities is \nnothing more than a majority wish list of strictly ideological bills, \nmany of which the minority party opposes and the Obama administration \nand the American people do not support.\n  Outside of just a few minor crumbs thrown in to represent the \npriorities of the minority party, including my workforce development \nlegislation, the bill almost contains nothing that the American people \ncould support or rally behind. Specifically, Mr. Speaker, the \nunderlying bill, H.R. 8, does little more than take us backwards in \nterms of energy policy, while also providing loopholes to help industry \navoid accountability and to avoid further regulation.\n  H.R. 8 contains efficiency provisions that will actually increase \nenergy use and energy costs to consumers, putting industry interests \nabove the public interest.\n  The bill's hydropower title weakens longstanding environmental review \nprocedures and curtails State, local, and tribal authority over \nprojects in their respective lands.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill flagrantly binds the U.S. to an outdated \ndependency on fossil fuels while failing to offer any constructive, \nforward-looking policies to incentivize the development and the \ndeployment of clean energy.\n  As you know, Mr. Speaker, many of the bills contained in the House \namendment include controversial provisions that the minority party has \nrepeatedly opposed at both the committee level as well as here on the \nHouse floor. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, many of these same poison pill \namendments in the bill have already received veto threats from the \nObama administration.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, with a bill that fails to modernize our energy \ninfrastructure, that fails to invest in job-creating clean energy \ntechnologies, and that fails to cut carbon pollution, it is safe, Mr. \nSpeaker, to proclaim to this body that we still have a long, hard, and \ncumbersome road ahead if we are ever to reach a point of finding \nconsensus, bipartisan consensus.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, I cannot support this bill before us. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose it as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), who is a member of the Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce and is quite familiar with energy issues.\n  Mr. WALDEN. I thank my colleague from Kentucky for his great work on \nthis legislation and his thoughtful leadership on these issues over \nmany years.\n  Mr. Speaker, for all your work on this legislation to make much-\nneeded reforms to modernize energy policy into something that better \npromotes affordability, reliability, and ensures we have the energy we \nneed to continue growing jobs in our communities, I say thank you.\n  Among the many strong provisions in this bill, several are \nparticularly important to the West and our rural communities across \ncentral, eastern, and southern Oregon.\n  For farmers and ranchers in the Klamath Basin, this bill ensures that \nthey will actually get a formal seat at the table when there is \nconsultation with Federal agencies on decisions under the ESA. \nIrrigators in this area have long been impacted by these decisions, and \nit is only fair they should have an equal seat at the table with other \nentities during these discussions.\n  Perhaps one of the timeliest provisions, Mr. Speaker, as we head into \nforest fire season in the West, are the provisions that provide for \nstreamlined planning and would reduce frivolous lawsuits and speed up \nthe pace of forest management across our public lands.\n  This House, 4 years in a row now, after we pass this, has considered \nmuch-needed legislation to fix the management of our Federal forests. \nNow the Senate will have an opportunity to join us in this effort, as \nwe\n\n[[Page H3200]]\n\namend this legislation and send it on over to the Senate. Our forested, \nrural communities, Mr. Speaker, have waited long enough. They have \nchoked on smoke summer after summer long enough. They have seen their \nwatersheds get destroyed by catastrophic fire. It is time to fix the \nproblem.\n  Now, a couple other specifics, Mr. Speaker, on national forests \nacross eastern Oregon.\n  Forest managers' hands are tied by a one-size-fits-all rule \nprohibiting the harvest of trees over 21 inches in diameter. This \nmeasure was implemented temporarily in 1997 but still has not been \nlifted 20 years later, just about. It represents really poor science. \nIt only serves as a source of frequent appeals and litigation. \nRepealing this will give our forest managers the flexibility they need \nto use modern science to actually manage the forests for healthier \nconditions.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Last month the Bureau of Land Management released their proposed \nresource management plan for Oregon's unique O lands in southern and \nwestern Oregon. Frankly, it is a terrible plan.\n  Despite a clear statutory requirement that they manage these lands \nfor sustainable timber production and revenue to the counties--dare I \nsay, jobs in the community--the BLM's plan goes the other way. It locks \nup 75 percent of the lands and harvests less than half the minimum \nlevel directed by the O Act. This is a job killer.\n  This bill includes bipartisan legislation that I wrote, working with \nmy colleagues from Oregon, Representatives DeFazio and Schrader, to cut \ncosts, increase timber harvest and revenue to local counties, and \ndirect BLM to revise their flawed management plan to actually reflect \nthe underlying act.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is good energy legislation. This is good natural \nresource legislation. This is sound environmental legislation. I urge \nits passage.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pallone), the outstanding ranking member of the full \ncommittee.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Rush for managing the \nopposition to the bill so successfully.\n  Mr. Speaker, today we are considering the House amendment to S. 2012, \nthe mistitled North American Energy Security Act of 2016. This \nlegislation once again shows us the vastly different paths taken by the \ntwo Chambers of Congress.\n  On the one hand is the Senate energy bill that the House intends to \ngo to conference on. It passed by a vote of 85-15 because it is \nbalanced and because it contains a number of nonenergy provisions that \nthe public supports overwhelmingly, such as permanent funding for the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund. On the other hand, the House energy \nbill was the result of a highly partisan process that the President \nthreatened to veto.\n  As we prepare to head to conference, we have a second chance to do \nthings right and to produce a new, bipartisan energy bill. \nUnfortunately, that is not what we are doing today. The Republican \nmajority has decided to replace the consensus Senate bill with a new \npro-polluter package that dwarfs the original H.R. 8.\n  When crafting the House amendment before us today, the Republican \ncaucus decided to tack on over 30 extraneous bills to an already bad \npiece of energy legislation that the President promised to veto. While \na number of these new additions are noncontroversial bills, many of \nthese provisions are divisive, dangerous, and have drawn veto threats \nof their own.\n  The House amendment to S. 2012 weakens protections for public health \nand the environment, undermines existing laws designed to promote \nefficiency, and does nothing to help realize the clean and renewable \nenergy policies of the future.\n  And, of course, this so-called energy infrastructure bill provides \nabsolutely no money to modernize the grid or our pipeline \ninfrastructure.\n  The House amendment is a backward-looking piece of energy legislation \nat a time when we need to move forward.\n  Let me highlight some of the most harmful provisions solely from the \njurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  This bill eliminates the current Presidential permitting process for \nenergy projects that cross the U.S. border. Such action would create a \nnew, weaker process that effectively rubber-stamps permit applications \nand allows the Keystone pipeline to rise from the grave.\n  It makes dangerous and unnecessary changes to the FERC natural gas \npipeline siting process at the expense of private landowners, the \nenvironment, and our national parks.\n  It harms electricity consumers at all levels by interfering with \ncompetitive markets to subsidize uneconomic generating facilities. \nThese facilities would otherwise be rejected by the market in favor of \nlower cost natural gas and renewable options.\n  It strikes language in current law that requires Federal buildings to \nbe designed to reduce consumption of fossil fuels.\n  It creates loopholes that would permit hydropower operators to dodge \ncompliance with environmental laws, including the Clean Water Act, and \ngives preferential treatment to electric utilities at the expense of \nStates, tribes, farmers, and sportsmen.\n  It contains an energy efficiency title that, if enacted, would result \nin a net increase in consumption and greenhouse gas emissions compared \nto current law.\n  Frankly, Mr. Speaker, this is not a legitimate exercise in \nlegislating, and it speaks volumes about the total lack of seriousness \nwith which House Republicans are approaching this conference. We should \nbe trying to narrow the differences and move closer to the bipartisan \nSenate product.\n  Instead, we are going in the opposite direction, voting on an 800-\npage monstrosity energy package that the Republican leadership has \nstitched together from pieces of pro-polluter bills that passed the \nSenate only to die in the Senate or on the President's desk.\n  Voting once on these fundamentally flawed ideas was more than enough. \nWe shouldn't make a mockery of the conference process and be using the \nHouse floor to try to raise the dead.\n  The House amendment to S. 2012 has one central theme binding its \nenergy provisions: an unerring devotion to the energy of the past. It \nis the Republican Party's 19th century vision for the future of U.S. \nenergy policy in the 21st century.\n  I strongly oppose the House amendment, obviously, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Smith), who is a real expert on energy issues.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the \ngentleman from Kentucky, Chairman Whitfield, for yielding me time.\n  I am pleased to support the House amendment to the Senate Energy \nPolicy Modernization Act.\n  Division D of this legislation includes the three energy titles from \nthe Science Committee's House-passed legislation, H.R. 1806, the \nAmerica Competes Reauthorization Act of 2015, and H.R. 4084, the \nNuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. Division D is both pro-\nscience and fiscally responsible and sets America on a path to remain \nthe world's leader in innovation.\n  America's economic and productivity growth relies on government \nsupport of basic research to enable the scientific breakthroughs that \nfuel technological innovation, new industries, enhanced international \ncompetitiveness, and job creation.\n  Title V reauthorizes the Department of Energy Office of Science for 2 \nyears. It prioritizes the National Laboratories' basic research that \nenables researchers in all 50 States to have access to world-class user \nfacilities, including supercomputers and high-intensity light sources.\n  The bill prevents duplication and requires DOE to certify that its \nclimate science work is unique and not replicated by other Federal \nagencies.\n  Title VI likewise reauthorizes DOE's applied research and \ndevelopmental programs and activities for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal \nyear 2017. It restrains the unjustified growth in spending on late-\nstage commercialization efforts and focuses instead on basic and \napplied research efforts.\n  Division D also requires DOE to provide a regular strategic analysis \nof science and technology activities within the Department, identifying \nkey\n\n[[Page H3201]]\n\nareas for collaboration across science and applied research programs.\n  This will reduce waste and duplication and identify activities that \ncould be better undertaken by States, institutions of higher education \nor the private sector, and areas of subpar performance that should be \neliminated.\n  Title VII proposes to cut red tape and bureaucracy in the DOE \ntechnology transfer process. It allows contractor operators of DOE \nNational Laboratories to work with the private sector more efficiently \nby delegating signature authority to the directors of the National Labs \nthemselves rather than DOE contracting officers for cooperative \nagreements valued at less than $1 million.\n  Also included is H.R. 4084, Energy Subcommittee Chairman Randy \nWeber's House-passed Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. It \nprovides a clear timeline for DOE to complete a research reactor user \nfacility within 10 years. This research reactor will enable proprietary \nand academic research to develop supercomputing models and design next \ngeneration nuclear energy technology.\n  H.R. 4084 creates a reliable mechanism for the private sector to \npartner with DOE labs to build fission and fusion prototype reactors at \nDOE sites.\n  Overall, Division D sets the right priorities for Federal civilian \nresearch, which enhances U.S. competitiveness while reducing spending \nand the Federal deficit by over $550 million.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Castor), an outstanding and hardworking member of the \nEnergy and Power Subcommittee and the Energy and Commerce full \ncommittee.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I thank the gentleman, Ranking Member Rush, \nfor his leadership on energy solutions for America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Republican amendment because \nit is a giveaway to special interests and it is a missed opportunity to \ncraft a bipartisan package of energy policies that meet the challenges \nof the 21st century and boost America's clean energy economy.\n  The GOP-led Congress is out of sync with the American public and out \nof touch with what is happening in electricity generation across \nAmerica.\n  The future is about energy efficiency and geothermal, renewables like \nsolar, wind power, and biomass. In fact, the U.S. Energy Information \nAdministration says renewable energy is the world's fastest growing \nenergy source.\n  That means innovative, cost-saving energy investments for our \nneighbors and businesses back home. That means we are going to create \njobs through the clean energy economy and, at the same time, reduce \ncarbon pollution.\n  Instead, in this amendment, the GOP doubles down on dirty fuel \nsources. It logrolls 36 bills into a single package that, in many \ncases, eliminates environmental reviews, and the experts say the bill \nwill actually accelerate climate change.\n  So if the Republican energy package was a car, it wouldn't just be \nstuck in neutral, it would be stuck in reverse because it harkens back \nto the energy policies of decades ago rather than America's growing \nclean energy economy of the future.\n  Let's not go backwards. Let's move Americans forward and put money \nback into the pockets of our hardworking neighbors.\n  I urge the House to reject the GOP amendment.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire how much time is \nremaining on both sides.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky has 4\\3/4\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Illinois has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Valadao).\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on both \ncommittees of jurisdiction here, Energy and Commerce and Natural \nResources. The language that they allowed to be put into this energy \nbill from my water bill is something that truly makes a difference for \nthe constituents of the Central Valley.\n  We have been suffering over these last few years, and what it has \ndone is devastated our communities. We have unemployment numbers \nreaching as high as 30 and 40 percent. We see numbers even in some \nsmaller communities as high as 50 percent. To see these things happen \nin our communities is a total tragedy, and it doesn't have to happen. \nAll we need is some commonsense legislation.\n  We have tried reaching out. We have passed legislation out of the \nHouse a few different times. We have negotiated and tried to get \nsomewhere, but we weren't able to do it.\n  So finding another way to get this onto our Senators' desks so that \nthey can actually take some action and get it to the President's desk \nis of the utmost importance.\n  I appreciate all the leadership and all the help from both committees \nto help this move forward.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McNerney).\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Rush. I also want \nto thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, including \nthe chairman of the subcommittee, for their hard work.\n  I am pleased to have several bipartisan measures included in the \nlegislation, including reforming hydropower licensing, addressing \nefficiency in Federal buildings, enhancing the energy-water nexus, \nverification of cyber-resilient products for the grid, authorization of \nwater programs, an update of our national policy on the future of the \ngrid, and smart grid-capable labels on products to enhance consumer \nchoice.\n  These are items I believe should remain in any final energy package. \nUnfortunately, the Republicans have loaded the bill with \nnonconstructive language.\n  One such provision is language from H.R. 2898 that would harm \nCalifornia's delta and the economies of the families, farmers, and \ncommunities I represent. There is no way this language should be part \nof an energy package. It is just an add-on. It just shows how desperate \nthe Republicans are to push through this bad policy.\n  Because of this, I regretfully oppose this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, our Nation's energy and electricity systems need \nupgrades and modernization. Climate change needs to be addressed. The \nSenate companion bill does not address these issues.\n  So, again, unfortunately, I have to oppose this legislation.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Garamendi).\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I want to say we have been here before. \nLast night we argued about undertaking the water wars of California. \nOnce again, here we are. This time, as last night, legislation dumped \ninto this energy bill that will gut the environmental protections of \nthe delta and San Francisco Bay, destroy the fisheries, destroy the \neconomy of the delta and water for millions of people.\n  Why would we want to do this?\n  Well, presumably, to take care of the water interests of the San \nJoaquin Valley, not southern California, but the San Joaquin Valley \nalone. It makes no sense whatsoever. It is the wrong policy.\n  We have to let science govern the delta. We have to operate the delta \nbased upon the very best possible science available, do the pumping, do \nthe exports, consistent with the protection of the ecology and the \nenvironment of the delta; that is fish, that is the land, that is the \nwater systems.\n  The ESA, the Clean Water Act, and the biological opinions, cannot be \noverrun. Yet, this legislation does exactly that.\n  We ought to vote ``no'' on this bill. These particular sections \nshould be removed.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Illinois has 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to reemphasize that, for the minority side \nto support this bill and its going forward,\n\n[[Page H3202]]\n\nthere must be provisions included in the bill that will address the \ndeeply felt concern that our Members have continually expressed.\n  Specifically, Mr. Speaker, our Members would like to see funding to \nmodernize the Nation's energy infrastructure. Our Members want to see \ninvestment in clean energy technology. Our Members want to see \nresources to train a 21st century workforce. Our Members want to see \npolicies to transition our economy away from the energy sources of the \npast and towards the sustainable energy sources of the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, without these provisions, this bill won't go very far.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members of this House to vote ``no'' on \nthis so-called energy bill. It is a relic. It is backwards-looking. It \nputs the Nation on a reverse course.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  To our friends on the other side of the aisle, I want to thank them \nfor working with us on this legislation. I know it is difficult to \nplease everyone.\n  Any time you talk about energy today, of course, people raise the \nissue of climate change. And I might say that America does not have to \ntake a back seat to any country in the world on climate change. We have \n64 different government programs addressing climate change, so I think \nAmerica is doing more on that issue than anyone else.\n  But we have other problems that we have to deal with as well. For \nexample, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that \npower outages in America cost Americans at least $150 billion annually. \nOne of the reasons we have a lot of power outages is because of our \ninfrastructure needs, but also because of regulations coming out of \nthis administration.\n  One of the provisions in this bill requires FERC to analyze the \nimpact on electric reliability of new Federal regulations that have \nmany experts concerned. So we want an analysis of all these regulations \nand its impact on reliability.\n  We have heard a lot of discussion about the need for work-training \nprograms for people to work in energy, in the renewable sector, and all \nsectors. And we had a serious discussion with our friends on the other \nside of the aisle as we were marking up this legislation. We had \nbasically agreed on a provision to provide training for African \nAmericans, for Hispanics, for women, and for other minorities, to get \nthem involved in the energy field, which we all wanted to do. We even \nprovided some money for that training program.\n  But we had said, if we do this, we want to change a couple of \nprovisions in the 2005 Energy Policy Act. For example, in that act, \nthere was a prohibition against the Federal government in Federal \nbuildings using any fossil fuels after the year 2030.\n  We think that is pretty draconian. So we said we are not going to \nmandate the use of fossil fuels, but in keeping even with the \nPresident's statements about an all-of-the-above energy policy, we \nwanted a provision in there that would repeal that so if there was a \ntime in the future when we needed fossil fuels because fossil fuels are \nstill providing about 50 to 60 percent of all the electricity in \nAmerica--even more than that--coal and natural gas.\n  So this provision simply says we are going to allow it. We are not \nmandating it, but the government has the option, after 2030, of using \nfossil fuel in government buildings. We think that is a sensible \napproach, but our friends on the other side of the aisle had dug in the \nsand so much, they refused that: We will not support it if that is in \nthere.\n  So some of these provisions that we all wanted, we don't have in \nhere, but we are trying to do the best that we can do.\n  I think this is a major step forward for the American people, and I \nwould urge everyone to support S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization \nAct of 2016, and the House amendment to it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in strong support for the inclusion of H.R. 2647, the \nResilient Federal Forests Act, in the House amendment to S. 2012.\n  The House passed H.R. 2647 with 262 bipartisan votes last July, and \nit has been waiting for Senate action since then.\n  When we passed the bill nearly a year ago, we knew we were facing a \nsevere wildfire season. We were correct. More than 10.1 million acres \nof forest land burned across the country, the largest number of acres \never recorded. Over 4,500 homes and other structures were destroyed.\n  Mr. Speaker, these fires destroyed valuable resources, and emitted in \nthe order of magnitude of 100 million tons of carbon into the \natmosphere while burning up the equivalent renewable energy stored in \nour forests of 20 to 30 billion gallons of gasoline. Tragically, these \nfires also claimed the lives of seven firefighters who worked \ncourageously to stop the spread of these wildfires into communities.\n  When the House passed H.R. 2647 last summer, we hoped that the \npassage would spur action from the Senate. Unfortunately, that has not \nbeen the case. We have waited patiently for the Senate to offer its own \nlegislation so we could sit down and negotiate a compromise. However, \nthat has not been the case, so we should again ask the Senate to act on \nforestry reform.\n  H.R. 2647 is premised on a simple idea: that the Forest Service and \nthe BLM need to do more work to restore the health and resilience of \nour Nation's forests.\n  We understand the problem clearly. Our forests are overgrown due to \nyears of neglect. This problem cannot be solved immediately, but we \nhave an obligation to our rural communities to do everything we can to \nhelp mitigate the problem.\n  In drafting this bill, we included provisions which would allow our \nFederal land management agencies to be able to shorten lengthy \nenvironmental review periods when they already understand the \nenvironmental impacts of a proposed management action. This bill also \nencourages and rewards collaboration between diverse stakeholder \ngroups.\n  The Natural Resources Committee recognizes the chilling effect of \nunnecessary litigation and how that can prevent needed restoration work \nfrom occurring in our Nation's forests. The committee heard testimony \nfrom a variety of experts who testified about how restoration work is \nnot being proposed by the Forest Service for fear that it will be \nlitigated.\n  My bill takes the simple step of requiring anyone who litigates a \nforest management project to post a bond if they are challenging a \nproject put forth by a collaborative effort. It is not unreasonable to \nask a litigant who threatens an urgently needed project that is put \nforth by a diverse group of stakeholders to have some skin in the game.\n  This bill also recognizes the reality that we must rethink the manner \nin which we fund the fighting of catastrophic wildfires. The Forest \nService is burdened with having to transfer funds from other accounts \nin order to cover the cost of wildfire suppression. Just last year, the \nForest Service was forced to transfer $243 million from other agency \naccounts during 1 week in August in order to pay for firefighting \ncosts. These transfers disrupt the very work that reduces the risk of \nwildfires in the first place.\n  H.R. 2647 addresses this issue by allowing catastrophic wildfires to \nbe treated like any other natural disaster. The Department of \nAgriculture and the Department of the Interior would be able to access \nFEMA's Disaster Relief Fund to help fight wildfires when all \nappropriated accounts are exhausted. This provision was drafted in a \nfiscally responsible manner to ensure that fighting these fires does \nnot become a drain on our budget.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill will not make a difference in the health of \nour Nation's Federal forests overnight, but it provides urgently needed \ntools to help our land management agencies to reduce the threat of \ncatastrophic wildfires in our communities and to be good stewards of a \ntreasured national resource.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the House amendment to S. 2012 so \nthat we can go to conference and work out a solution to the many \nproblems facing our Nation's Federal forests.\n\n[[Page H3203]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Today I rise in opposition to the litany of bad, environmentally \nharmful bills that the House Republican leadership is offering in place \nof the bipartisan Senate energy bill.\n  Now, the Senate bill, S. 2012, was sound policy and represented real \nprogress on many important issues, but the package we are considering \ntoday is a dangerous threat. Not only is this package bad for drought-\nstricken States like California, but it includes a wish list of \ngiveaways for the fossil fuel and mining industries, it undermines \nvital Endangered Species Act protections, and it undermines public \nreview.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  This is not a promising start to conference negotiations. Why are we \nwasting our time on a package of partisan bills that we have considered \nbefore and which we all know will never be signed into law?\n  Even worse than the substance, Republicans shot down the request to \nconsider this bill under an open amendment process. Now, I, for one, \nwould have recommended many changes if we were allowed to consider this \nvery controversial omnibus bill under regular order. Just to name a \nfew:\n  The House amendment we are considering today continues the unending \nthreats that Congress poses under current management to the health of \nthe bay delta and the vital salmon runs that are so important to \nCalifornia and to my district, not to mention specific threats to the \nSan Joaquin River and to the Klamath and Trinity River systems, their \nsalmon fisheries, and the people that depend upon them;\n  The House amendment we are considering today would bring back from \nthe dead the undeniably harmful Keystone XL pipeline;\n  The House amendment we are considering today would roll back building \ncodes;\n  It would be harmful to forest management policy and wildfire \nmitigation because it uses a short-sighted model for funding instead of \nbringing forward the actual fix to the fire borrowing problem, the \nbipartisan legislation by Representatives Simpson and Schrader that I \nhave supported each of the last several years but we never seem to be \nable to actually bring to a vote in this House.\n  I urge my colleagues today to vote for the Senate energy bill in its \ncurrent form, in its original form, which is the result of true, \nbipartisan compromise, so we can actually get that legislation and all \nof its useful provisions over the finish line.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nWyoming (Mrs. Lummis).\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased this amendment will improve \nthe stewardship of public lands, water, and natural resources \nthroughout the West.\n  I am pleased to see Western priorities included in this bill, from \nthe drought-stricken California to the responsible production of \nstrategic and critical minerals on Federal lands. They are critical to \nnational defense and make possible modern amenities like smartphones \nand tablets.\n  On tribal lands, the House amendment will empower tribes with more \nauthority over their own land. The best forestry bill we have seen in \nyears came from Mr. Westerman, and he just talked about it.\n  Finally, the sportsmen's title will restore much-needed attorney fee \ntransparency under the Equal Access to Justice Act. This law was \ncreated to help small businesses, veterans, and Social Security \nbeneficiaries when they have to take the Federal Government to court. \nBut it is being used on endless public lands litigation with \nconsequences for sportsmen's access and other multiple use of public \nlands.\n  Finally, this would reinstate the Fish and Wildlife Service's own \nrulemaking regarding gray wolves in Wyoming and Western States.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues' support.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nStockton, California (Mr. McNerney), who continuously fights for his \ndistrict's water interests and the interests of California as they \npertain to our most important estuary, the bay-delta system.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, we had a debate last night about a familiar issue--\nCalifornia's drought. It is something that impacts all of us, including \nOregon and Washington State, not just people south of the delta.\n  Unfortunately, H.R. 2898 was included in the Energy and Water \nDevelopment appropriations bill, and it is alarming that the House \nRepublicans have tacked the same language onto the energy bill. This \nshows the desperation of the House Republicans to force this bad \nlegislation through.\n  As I said last night, these provisions would further drain freshwater \nfrom the California delta. These provisions would damage the delta's \necosystem and harm the communities I represent. It harms some people to \nbenefit others just because one side has the power to do it.\n  I represent the seventh largest agricultural county in the Nation, so \nI understand the needs of farmers and ranchers and the impact that \nwater has on the ability to produce the Nation's fruits, nuts, and \nvegetables.\n  Unfortunately, H.R. 2898 would weaken the Endangered Species Act and \nset a precedent of undermining environmental protections. It also \nexacerbates a water war in the West just at a time when we are working \nto bridge those divides. In fact, the State and Federal agencies have \nbeen working effectively over the past few years to maximize water \ndeliveries to the delta to communities down south.\n  Federal and State agencies have maximized what little water exists in \nthe State. A lack of water is our biggest threat, not operational \nflexibility. Last night we heard about wasted water. What hasn't been \nsaid is that water that flows to the ocean pushes the saltwater out \naway from our farms and allows a path for salmon to the ocean.\n  The majority hasn't reauthorized WaterSmart. They haven't supported \ninvestments in recycling. They have cut funding for the Department of \nthe Interior's efforts to boost water assistance. They haven't voted on \nwater infrastructure improvements. How do we prepare for the future \neither in wet or dry years? This House isn't willing to make those \nkinds of investments.\n  Our Nation loses approximately 2 trillion gallons of water because of \naging infrastructure. That is about 6 billion gallons of water wasted \nevery day.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. There are investments that can be made to recycle water \nand find wasteful leakage. For example, the State of Israel recycles 90 \npercent of its water. California recycles only 15 percent. Instead, the \nRepublicans have pushed language that results in diminished fish \npopulations and worsens saltwater intrusion, which affects the water \nbeing exported that permanently damages some of our most productive \nfarmland in the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not a solution. It is a step backward. I am \ndisappointed with this bill, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Wittman).\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the House amendment to S. \n2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2016.\n  The House amendment includes the Sportsmen's Heritage and \nRecreational Enhancement Act of 2016, better known as the SHARE Act, \nwhich passed with bipartisan support in February in the House.\n  The SHARE Act is part of a group of commonsense bills that will \neliminate unneeded regulatory impediments, safeguard against new \nregulations that impede outdoor sporting activities, and protect Second \nAmendment rights. These packages were similarly introduced and passed \nin the 112th and 113th Congresses.\n\n  Outdoor sporting activities, including hunting, fishing, and \nrecreational shooting are deeply engrained in the fabric of the United \nStates' culture and heritage. Values instilled by partaking\n\n[[Page H3204]]\n\nin these activities are passed down from generation to generation and \nplay a significant part in the lives of millions of Americans.\n  Much of America's outdoor sporting activity occurs on our Nation's \nFederal lands. Unfortunately, Federal agencies like the U.S. Forest \nService and the Bureau of Land Management often prevent or impede \naccess to Federal land for outdoor sporting activities. Because lack of \naccess is one of the key reasons sportsmen and -women stop \nparticipating in outdoor sporting activities, ensuring the public has \nreliable access to our Nation's Federal lands must remain a top \npriority. The SHARE Act does just that.\n  One of the key provisions of this bill, the Recreational Fishing and \nHunting Heritage Opportunities Act, will increase and sustain access \nfor hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on Federal lands for \ngenerations to come. Specifically, it protects sportsmen and -women \nfrom arbitrary efforts by the Federal Government to block Federal lands \nfrom hunting and fishing activities by implementing an open-until-\nclosed management policy.\n  It also, in the package, provides tools to jointly create and \nmaintain recreational shooting ranges on Federal lands and allows the \nDepartment of the Interior to designate hunter access corridors through \nNational Park units so that sportsmen and -women can hunt and fish on \nadjacent Federal lands.\n  The package also protects Second Amendment rights and the use of \ntraditional ammunition and fishing tackle. It defends law-abiding \nindividuals' constitutional rights to keep and bear arms on lands \nmanaged by the Corps of Engineers and ensures that hunters are not \nburdened by outdated laws preventing bows and crossbows from being \ntransported across national parks.\n  This important legislation will sustain America's rich hunting and \nfishing traditions, improve access to our Federal lands for responsible \noutdoor sporting activities, and help ensure that current and future \ngenerations of sportsmen and -women are able to enjoy the sporting \nactivities this country holds dear.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on \nthis important achievement.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from Fresno, California (Mr. Costa).\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Huffman for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the amendment in the Energy Policy \nModernization Act that was reflected in Congressman Valadao's \nlegislation, H.R. 2898, of which I am a cosponsor. It is an important \neffort to try to fix California's broken water system.\n  We cannot continue to kick this can down the road as we have for the \nlast several years. Unfortunately, that is what has continued to \nhappen. Farms, farm communities, and farmworkers are desperate to have \nWashington recognize that we cannot continue the status quo.\n  Our Nation's food supply is an issue of national security, and we are \ndependent upon it. We don't think about it that way, but it is a fact. \nThe drought impacts in California and the West are not going to get \nbetter. With climate change, they are going to continue to get worse. \nPassing this bill is part of a continuing effort to try to get \nsomething done. The Federal Government cannot continue to ignore the \ndrought and the devastating impacts not only in the San Joaquin Valley, \nbut statewide and Western States-wide.\n  Parts of the valley are parched and without water, and we must \ncontinue to raise this issue every way we can. That is why we are doing \nthis. Getting this legislation passed is part of an effort to fix \nCalifornia's broken water system.\n  There was talk about issuing an allocation, and we were hoping for an \nEl Nino. Guess what. It didn't happen. We got a 5 percent water \nallocation on the West side. Last year it was zero. The year before it \nwas zero. Zero is zero. It means no water.\n  So let's try to work together. Let's put aside our talking points and \nthe political posturing for not only California farmers, farmworkers, \nand farm communities, but American families who count on having \nnutritious, healthy, and affordable food on their dinner table every \nnight.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. LaMalfa).\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for his \nhelp and for all his good work and for his vast knowledge of trees and \nforestry. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. Speaker, today the House has an opportunity to advance real \nreforms and modernize the outdated policies that are preventing \nresponsible management of California's water resources.\n  Title I of division C of this measure includes language developed \nthrough exhaustive bipartisan, bicameral negotiations passed repeatedly \nby the House with bipartisan support. While the House has taken action \non this issue, including this language today ensures that California's \nSenators can no longer ignore the crisis facing our State.\n  This Chamber has heard quite a bit about California's water woes over \nthe last few years, including some claims that don't meet the threshold \nof fact, and it is time we set the record straight.\n  Some falsely claim this bill prioritizes one area over another. As \nthe sole Representative of the source of the vast majority of \nCalifornia's usable water, I can state this measure includes the \nstrongest possible protections for northern California area of origin \nand senior water rights. It safeguards the most fundamental water right \nof all: that those who live where water originates have access to it. \nThat is why northern California water districts and farmers in my area \nstrongly support this bill.\n  The measure accelerates surface water storage infrastructure projects \nthat over two-thirds of Californians voted to fund, updating the system \nlast expanded four decades ago. One of these projects, Sites Reservoir, \nwould have saved 1 million acre-feet of water this winter alone, enough \nto supply 8 million Californians for a year. We simply can't expect 40 \nmillion people to survive on infrastructure designed for half that, yet \nthat is exactly what members of the minority party argue for.\n  We have heard wild claims about how this measure could harm \nendangered species, but in reality it lives within the ESA and the \nbiological opinions. Rather than alter the ESA--and believe me, I would \nlike to--this measure improves population monitoring techniques and \ntechnology. Wildlife agencies currently base orders to cut off water on \nhunches, not data. This bill would provide actual facts to end the \narbitrary decisions we have seen in recent years.\n  Finally, this bill sensibly allows more water to be stored and used \nduring winter storms when river flows are highest and there is no \nimpact to fish populations. Even as delta outflows surpassed 100,000 \nacre-feet per second this year, as we see in this graphic here, during \n2016, the water saved was even less by a percent than during low-flow \nyears.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. As a result, the lost opportunity of filling one of our \nlargest reservoirs. San Luis Reservoir is barely half full. This bill \nensures that, when we have more water, it is saved for later use, which \nhelps all Californians. Why wouldn't we want to do this?\n  Mr. Speaker, we can't wait any longer. It is time that we end the \nrhetoric, end the obstruction, and address the crisis that threatens \nour State's strong economic livelihood.\n  If Marin County and San Francisco can get all the water they need, \nhow is it fair that districts in the Central Valley get only 5 percent \nof their allocation when water is aplenty?\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Calling the Valadao water bill bipartisan does not make it genuinely \nso.\n  Let me just share with my colleagues what Senator Dianne Feinstein \nhas said about this bill. She said it contains ``provisions that would \nviolate environmental law,'' which she cannot support.\n  California Senator Barbara Boxer said the bill is ``the same-old, \nsame-old and will only reignite the water wars.''\n\n[[Page H3205]]\n\n  The Obama administration opposes this bill. The State of California \nnot only opposes these provisions, but has opposed all previous \nincarnations of this bill, which has been bouncing around for some \ntime, long before the current drought gave it a new drought-related \ntitle.\n  I will just close with what the Fresno Bee has said about this bill.\n  The Fresno Bee says about this bill: ``In some cases, it's an \nunabashed GOP wish list'' that has ``little, if anything, in common \nwith a 140-page draft water bill floated by Democrats.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California \n(Ms. Matsui), who has long fought to protect the delta and the \ninterests of her region.\n  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the House \namendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act.\n  Although this bill contains some important provisions overall, it \nraises barriers to our clean energy future by reversing important \nprogress we have made to curb emissions and combat climate change. \nHouse Republicans have made a bad bill worse by attaching harmful \nprovisions that will have a negative impact on consumers, public \nhealth, and our environment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am particularly concerned that this energy package is \nbeing used to advance irresponsible, short-term policies in response to \nCalifornia's drought. The provisions included in this bill will pit one \nregion of our great State against another instead of providing a \nbalanced, long-term solution.\n  We need to be taking an all-of-the-above approach to our drought by \nadvancing wastewater recycling projects, investing in groundwater \nstorage, and encouraging new technologies that allow us to responsibly \nmanage our water usage.\n  I actually grew up on a Central Valley farm. My grandparents farmed \nin Reedley, California, and I grew up in Dinuba. So I understand that \nthe debate over water is complicated and personal to so many, but I \nbelieve that we can balance the needs of our farmers and urban centers \nwhile protecting our drinking water supply and our ecosystems. Our \nAmerican families deserve an energy package that brings us forward, not \nbackwards.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Energy Policy \nModernization Act of 2015.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McCarthy), our distinguished, hardworking, and, above \nall, compassionate and fair majority leader.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are places in this world that hold people's \nimagination--Washington, D.C., New York City, and Paris, the great \nrolling plains crossed by American pioneers, and the Himalayan \nmountains touching into the heavens.\n  I was blessed, blessed more than I knew, to grow up in such a place, \na place called California. It is so distinctive and impressive, it is \nunreal. Warm, sun-drenched beaches, snowcapped mountains, great cities, \nforests, deserts, farmland growing fruits, nuts, and vegetables \nstretching as far as the eye can see. It is a place that is always \nfilled with promise and potential. In many ways, California's history \nmirrors the history of America. It started as nothing much, but people \ncame and they built it. We grew and prospered. We became the envy of \nthe world.\n  Like America, today, California faces great uncertainty. Some \nproblems are the same, shared by the entire Nation, but California and \nalmost the entire Western United States are enduring something much \nworse--the drought. The drought has lingered for years. El Nino helped \nalleviate some of the problem, but the drought continues. Communities \nhave less water, farmland that once fed the world now sits dry. People \nare losing their livelihoods and their hope. There is no way to end the \ndrought, but it doesn't have to be as bad as it is.\n  Now, water that can be stored is being lost. Bureaucrats release \nfreshwater out to the sea. Our most valuable resource is being wasted.\n  This matters today because we are considering a bill from our \ncolleagues in the Senate--the Energy Policy Modernization Act. Before \nthe Senate passed this bill, they added several provisions, including \nlanguage to address water issues in Washington State.\n  I have to say, Mr. Speaker, that I am very happy that the Senate \nbrought this up. After all, if we are going to address the water issue \nin Washington State, we should address the water issue across the West. \nSo we included in our amendment to the legislation Representative \nValadao's Western Water and American Food Security Act. We passed this \nlast year in the House so we could build more water storage and \nincrease our reservoirs while still allowing water to flow through the \nSacramento delta.\n  Water is so necessary for our constituents that we aren't stopping \nwith this bill. We have already began consideration of the Energy and \nWater Appropriations bill, which includes even more provisions to deal \nwith the drought.\n  So there is a simple message for our Democrat colleagues in the \nSenate. House Republicans won't stop. We will keep passing bills until \nour people get the water they need. Because once we get water, so much \nof the uncertainty facing California and the entire West will be \nbrushed aside.\n  You see, California and America as a whole face a crisis of bad \ngovernance. Many look around and see life isn't getting any better. \nThey wonder if our Nation is in decline.\n  But that is not who we are, not as Americans and not as Californians. \nOur best days are not behind us. We will not quietly manage our \ndecline. I reject the idea that we have reached the heights of our \nshining city on a hill, and that it is time to come back down to a \nworld of limits and uncertainty. The choice is ours to make because as \nAmericans we write our own future. That is what this vote means for me \nand for every Californian. The laws governing water are broken. The \nbureaucracy is working against the people. The system is holding us \nback, but this is not how it has to be.\n  California has long been a reflection of America's promise. We also \nhelped America to realize its promise. We led the way in media, \ntechnology, agriculture, and even space. Bring the water back and I \nknow we will lead America once again, and help to restore hope in our \nfuture.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I share the majority leader's view that California is a unique and \niconic and majestic place. I would only add that part of what makes it \nso includes the great rivers and iconic salmon runs in California from \nthe Central Valley to the North Coast, where I represent, and the \nincredibly important bay-delta estuary, the most ecologically important \nestuary on the West Coast of the Americas, which despite all of the \ndamage we have done to it over the past 100-plus years, still teams \nwith waterfowl and wildlife and still supports salmon that are the \nstaple of the commercial salmon fishing industry, not just in \nCalifornia, but in Washington and Oregon.\n  That is why groups who advocate for these fisheries, folks who make \ntheir living by depending on these fish, are uniformly against the \nRepublican water bill that has been added in by way of this amendment. \nFishing jobs matter, too. It is part of what makes California great. \nThere is no one that understands that better than my colleague, Mike \nThompson.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nThompson).\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for \nyielding time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment to the Senate bill \nthat is before us.\n  California is in a true state of emergency when it comes to water. We \nare in a multiyear drought. And even after this winter's El Nino, only \none of our State's reservoirs are filled to capacity.\n  The drought is having a serious impact on families, on farms, on \nfarmers, on fishers, and on businesses across California. We need \nscience-based, long-term solutions to our State's water challenges, and \nthis bill is not the solution.\n  It won't help our State to improve water efficiency and make the most \nof the water that we have. It is based on the misguided assumption that \nour\n\n[[Page H3206]]\n\nwater crisis can be remedied by pumping more water south. The truth is \nwe haven't pumped more water south because there simply isn't enough \nwater. We are in a drought.\n  The provisions we are debating today redefine the standard by which \nthe Endangered Species Act is applied. This will weaken the law, \nincrease the risk of species extinction, and lead to costly litigation.\n  You will hear the other side talk about how this is necessary because \nwe are letting millions of gallons of water wash out to sea in order to \nprotect fish when that water could have been pumped to farmers in \nCalifornia's Central Valley.\n  The reality is that water needs to keep moving through the delta so \nthat saltwater doesn't wash in, jeopardizing water quality for farms \nand for communities, including cities in my district that rely on the \ndelta for their freshwater supply.\n  It is important to note that this bill sets a dangerous precedent for \nevery other State in our country. California has a system of water \nmanagement rules that have endured for a long time, but this bill \noverrides water regulations developed by Californians themselves, and \ntells local resource managers and water districts how to administer \ntheir water supplies.\n  If we pass this bill, we are telling every State in America that we \nare okay with the Federal Government undermining local experts and \nState laws from coast to coast.\n  We need real solutions that are based on science and that work for \neveryone. If you can set the science aside in California, you can do it \nanywhere. You have no protection for your resources.\n  This isn't about farmers versus fish. It is about saving salmon, \nsaving cities in the delta, delta farmers, north of delta farmers, and \nresources across our country.\n  I am not insensitive to the supply and demand reality of California's \nwater. I understand the concerns of Central Valley farmers. Remember, I \nam one. Ag is big in my district, too. But if your well runs dry, the \nsolution isn't to steal water from your neighbors.\n  This bill isn't the solution. It is bad for the millions who depend \non the delta for their livelihoods, it is bad for California, and it is \nbad for States across our country.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this measure.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Valadao).\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I always enjoy listening to my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle say that this is theft, that we are \nstealing water.\n  This graph has been used a few times. This is the amount of water \ngoing through the delta in 2015, and this is when it was exported; in \n2016, the amount of water going out into the ocean. This is not \nstealing from one person's well in their community to another \ncommunity. This is water that is going out into the ocean that they are \nadvocating that we go and spend more taxpayer money and desalinate so \nthat we can bring it right back.\n  When it comes to protecting the delta, which we all want to do, I \nwould actually recommend that the communities around the delta stop \ndumping their sewage in it. With over 300 million gallons of sewage \nbeing dumped in the delta on a daily basis, you would think that would \nhave a bigger impact on the delta species and everything else that is \ngoing on there than a little bit of water being pumped.\n  There were periods this past winter alone where there was 150,000 \ncubic feet of water per second going through that delta. We are asking \nfor 5,000, and at those high periods maybe 7,500. Think about that. \n150,000 cubic feet per second, and we are asking for 7,500, as if we \nare going to pump a delta dry and have a huge impact. I would still \nargue that dumping your sewage in the delta would have a bigger impact \non those species than anything else.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  If you are truly concerned with protecting those species, you would \nthink you would take some of the legislation that we have in there that \nhas to do with the invasive species, the predator species, the striped \nbass that is actually consuming baby salmon and is also consuming the \ndelta smelt.\n  We know that it is happening. I have seen studies that point to as \nmuch as 98 percent of delta smelt being consumed by this striped bass.\n  Why don't we take a look at the legislation that is in this bill now \nand actually adopt it and have a real impact and save these species for \nour future generations. It is time top stop playing games and hurting \nother communities.\n  We are looking to capture a little bit of water that goes to the \ndelta. Obviously, a lot was wasted this year. We are not trying to \nsteal from anybody else. It is a fair and very equitable ask. It has \nlittle impact on the delta.\n  If there are those who really want to protect the delta, let's look \nat every part of it, including the sewage, including the invasive \nspecies. I think there is a lot of room to compromise, and I would \nappreciate the opportunity.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  When I hear my colleagues across the aisle continually describe \noutflow through the delta estuary as water that is somehow wasted and \navailable to be taken for any purpose, it requires us often to remind \nthem that this delta water system without that outflow would not be \navailable to millions of Californians for drinking water and it would \nnot be available to the Central Valley for agricultural irrigation \nbecause that outflow maintains salinity control and water quality in \nthis very complex water system.\n  It is also incorrect--and, yet, we continue to hear it regularly--\nthat huge amounts of water in the last few years have been wasted for \nenvironmental purposes.\n  The State Water Resources Control Board in California estimates that, \nin 2014, only 4 percent of all runoff in the bay-delta watershed flowed \ninto the San Francisco Bay solely for environmental protection, again, \nbecause there are other values, other benefits, to this outflow that \nsustains water quality and other values in the system.\n  In 2015, the State estimates that it was only 2 percent of the runoff \nin the watershed that made it through the system for environmental \npurposes only. It is important that we bear those facts in mind.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California has 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier) from Contra Costa County.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. I thank my colleague. I will try to be brief.\n  Mr. Speaker, this debate reminds me of the old expression by Mark \nTwain that, in California, whiskey is for drinking and water is for \nfighting.\n  So for those of you who are listening, as somebody who has \nrepresented the delta in local and State government and now at the \nFederal level for 25 years, I think we are doing well in California.\n  In a recent op-ed by Charles Fishman, who is an expert on water \nresources of the United States, the title of it is ``How California is \nWinning the Drought.''\n  He writes in this article that it has been the driest 4-year period \nin California history and the hottest, too. Yet, by almost every \nmeasure, except perception, California is doing fine--not just fine--\nCalifornia is doing fabulously. It has grown 27 percent more than the \nrest of the country, and the agricultural industry has also grown.\n  He goes on to write that more than half of the fruits and vegetables \nthat are grown in the United States come from California farms and that \nlast year, 2014, in the third growing season of the drought, both farm \nemployment and farm revenue increased slightly.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose the bill because it jeopardizes not \njust the delta, but California's economy.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Perfect policy is rare or even impossible. Good policy requires hard \nwork, sound science, good data and data analytics, common sense, and a \nlittle bit of give-and-take. Mr. Speaker, this is good policy, fair \npolicy. Most importantly, it will provide for a better way of life for \nAmericans.\n  I urge support for S. 2012, as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H3207]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \nexpress my concerns with the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2016. \nThis bill passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support; \nhowever this bill contains unnecessarily controversial language which \nwill jeopardize its passage here in the House. Many of the bills \nincluded in today's House amendment have passed largely along party \nlines and have received veto threats from the White House.\n  For example, the House Amendment contains The Western Water and \nAmerican Food Security Act, a bill which aims to address California's \nrecord drought. As we all know, California has been in a severe drought \nwhich has devastated its water supply. Although this bill includes \nlanguage to address California's current water crisis, I do not believe \nthat it takes into account the concerns of all major stakeholders. Yes, \nwe need to increase storage sites, reexamine infrastructure to move \nwater to the south, and take immediate steps to provide water to the \nfarmers who put food on our tables. We also cannot afford to ignore the \nenvironment as our kids and their kids will have to live in it.\n  I believe we must put everything on the table. All community \nstakeholders should be involved as we address California's short-term \nand long-term water future--and this must be done immediately. Last \nweek during National Infrastructure Week, I spoke about the importance \nof investing in California's water infrastructure. We should utilize \nour resources to capture, reuse, and recycle our precious water for \nfuture generations.\n  The House amendment also contains harmful language from the National \nStrategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2015. This \nlegislation would allow mining companies to set their own rules \nregarding environmental reviews. It would also cripple the permitting \nauthority under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. Another \nbill added into this package, the North American Energy and \nInfrastructure Act, increases our reliance on fossil fuels and cripples \nthe Department of Energy's ability to enforce energy efficiency \nstandards.\n  Further provisions in this bill would curtail NEPA even further, \nthreaten wildlife protections, and ban the results of Department of \nEnergy-supported research from being used to create assessments. Mr. \nSpeaker, this legislation hurts our environment, our wildlife, our \npublic health, and our energy independence.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 744, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill, as amended.\n  The question is on the third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be read a third time, and was read the third \ntime.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to commit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. PETERS. I am opposed in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to commit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Peters moves to commit the bill S. 2012, as amended, to \n     the Committee on Energy and Commerce, with instructions to \n     report the same back to the House forthwith, with the \n     following amendment:\n       Add at the end the following:\n\n                   TITLE XI--CONSIDERATION OF IMPACTS\n\n     SEC. 11001. CONSIDERATION OF IMPACTS.\n\n       Because the scientific consensus is unequivocal that \n     climate change is real, nothing in this Act shall prevent a \n     Federal agency from considering potential climate impacts \n     during any permitting, siting, or approval process undertaken \n     pursuant to this Act.\n\n  Mr. PETERS (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the reading be dispensed with.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California is recognized for \n5 minutes in support of his motion.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, my amendment simply expresses something \nscientists know to be true and something that is recognized everywhere \nin the world but in these halls of the United States Congress, that \nclimate change is real and influenced by human activity. We need \nCongress to get on board with a response, not to stand in the way. That \nis important for at least three reasons.\n  First, if we are to lower the rate and impact of greenhouse gas \nemissions, we need Federal action.\n  The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States \nis from burning fossil fuels, which raises atmospheric levels of \nCO2.\n  Super pollutants like methane and HFCs are many times more potent \nthan CO2 and are the most significant drivers of climate \nchange. Greenhouse gas emissions can affect coastal regions, energy, \ndefense, food supplies, wildfire preparedness, and our quality of life.\n  That is why just last month the United States signed the historic \nParis climate agreement so as to reduce emissions by at least 26 \npercent by 2025. As a country that contributes 17 percent of the \nworld's greenhouse gas emissions, we pledge to do our part.\n  This follows President Obama's executive order on climate change, \nwhich established national sustainability goals for the Federal \nGovernment. We need Congress to support these efforts, not to get in \nthe way.\n  Second, all new national plans and projects should consider these \neffects of climate change as we make decisions about what and where to \nbuild infrastructure and to permit projects.\n  Extreme weather conditions are at an all-time high. One of my first \nvotes as a Member of Congress was to fund a response to Superstorm \nSandy with an appropriation of $60 billion off budget.\n  That is just going to keep happening, folks. Regions around the world \nare experiencing intense droughts, longer wildfire seasons, and water \nshortages and flooding, and sea levels are rising at twice the rate \nthey were 20 years ago, threatening to cause destructive erosion, \npowerful storms, the contamination of agriculture, and lost habitat for \nwildlife.\n  We have to make sure that Federal permitting and construction learns \nthe lessons from these trends and these events and that we account for \nthe effect of rising seas, increased winds, and drought on the \nbuildings and infrastructure that we approve and build.\n  We have to build resiliency into Federal decisionmaking, not dodge \nthe question. A bipartisan Bloomberg report estimated that, if we do \nnot address climate change, between $66 billion and $106 billion worth \nof coastal property in the United States will be below sea level by \n2050.\n  Third, we need to bring our Federal practices into line with what is \nalready happening outside of the United States Congress, the only \nentity in the world with its collective head in the sand on the reality \nof climate change.\n  There are 175 countries that are on board. That is how many signed \nthe historic Paris Agreement on the first day it was open for \nsignature. There are 154 companies that are on board with Paris, and \nbusinesses across the country have committed to putting forward climate \ntargets by reducing carbon emissions and becoming more energy \nefficient.\n  PepsiCo, Apple, Qualcomm, Nestle, Kellogg's, and Starbucks are among \nthe private businesses that have included sustainability and \nalternative energy as smart business practice, and the Department of \nDefense, our own military, is on board, acting now to address the \nimpacts of climate change.\n  In January, the Pentagon released a directive stating:\n\n       The Department of Defense must be able to adapt current and \n     future operations to address the impacts of climate change in \n     order to maintain an effective and efficient United States \n     military.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, let's take a cue from the rest of the world, the \nAmerican private sector, and the Pentagon and consider climate change \nin permitting and siting.\n  For some of my colleagues on the other side, the politics of simple \nfacts may be frightening, but U.S. leadership to curb climate change is \nnot about politics or ideology.\n  It is about security, ensuring the health of our citizens and of our \nfamilies, and seizing the unprecedented economic opportunity of the \nclean energy revolution. The stakes of climate change have never been \nhigher. The time to act is now.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of \norder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of a point of order is \nwithdrawn.\n\n[[Page H3208]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \nmotion to commit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized \nfor 5 minutes in opposition to the motion to commit.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, the main objection here and the basis of \nthe motion to commit relates to climate change. Contrary to the \ngentleman's statement that the House does not recognize climate change, \nall of us recognize that the climate is changing.\n  We do, however, have some significant differences with the President \nof the United States and with some other Members of the House and \nSenate in that we, many people, do not believe that climate change is \nthe number one issue facing mankind. There are many other issues as \nwell.\n  The United States does not have to take a backseat to anyone on this \nissue. The Congressional Research Service recently reported that over \n18 Federal agencies are already administering climate change programs. \nThere are over 67 individual climate change programs in the Federal \nGovernment. We are already spending in excess of $15 billion a year on \nclimate change.\n  One of the problems that we have is that the President has been \nacting unilaterally on this issue. He went to Copenhagen and made \nagreements. He went to Paris and unilaterally entered the United States \ninto an agreement without there being any consultation with the U.S. \nCongress, without discussing it with U.S. Congress on what he was \nagreeing to. He used that agreement in order to have the EPA issue its \nClean Power Plan.\n  In the Clean Power Plan, the EPA arbitrarily sets CO2 \nlimits for every State in America and each State would have had to have \nhad its State implementation plan adopted by this September except \nthat, since Congress was not involved and since many people throughout \nthe country were vitally concerned about this unilateral action, they \ntook the only thing available to them, and that was to file a lawsuit \nto stop it.\n  What happened? It went all the way to the United States Supreme \nCourt.\n  I might add that the Supreme Court issued an injunction to prohibit \nthe implementation of the President's clean energy plan until there \ncould be further discussion about it.\n  I might also say that Congress had many hearings on the clean energy \nplan. That was our only involvement. We certainly were not a part of \nthe plan. It was interesting that a professor from Harvard University \nwho is generally considered pretty liberal and who taught the President \nconstitutional law came to Congress and testified that the President's \nclean energy plan, to use not the President's words, but the \nprofessor's words, ``was like tearing up the Constitution and throwing \nit away.''\n  We agree that climate change is an issue. We simply disagree with \nthis President's unilateral action in trying to decide the way it is \naddressed.\n  We are amending the Senate bill because we want to use some \ncommonsense approaches so that we can continue to bring down \nCO2 emissions. We can also allow our economy to expand, to \ncreate jobs, and we don't have to take a backseat to any country in the \nworld. The U.S. is doing as much as any country in the world on climate \nchange.\n  I might also say that we expect that our carbon dioxide emissions \nwill remain below our 2005 levels through the year 2040. Now, if you \nlook at India, if you look at China, if you look at many developing \ncountries and even at parts of Europe, they do not meet that standard.\n  Let's be pragmatic. Let's use common sense. That is precisely what we \nattempt to do with our amendments to S. 2012, the Energy Policy \nModernization Act of 2016.\n  I would respectfully request that we deny this motion to commit.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to start, Mr. Speaker, by thanking the Delegate from the \nDistrict of Columbia (Ms. Norton). She pours her heart and soul into \nher passion for this country and certainly for the District itself. We \nhappen to disagree probably on this issue. We have\n\n[[Page H3209]]\n\nagreed on some issues, on some topics; and we disagree on others. But I \njust want to note, Mr. Speaker, how much I appreciate her passion, her \ncommitment, and her desire to represent her constituents as vigorously \nas she does.\n  I also thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows) for \nintroducing H.R. 5233, the Clarifying Congressional Intent in Providing \nfor DC Home Rule Act of 2016, and his leadership on this issue. He is \nthe subcommittee chairman who deals with this issue. He has spent a \nconsiderable amount of time working on this topic, working with city \nleaders, getting to know the city, and working with them. I appreciate \nhis proactive approach and the manner in which he approaches this and \nhis thoughtfulness on this sensitive but important topic.\n  We are here today to discuss the bill that would do, just as the \ntitle says: clarify the congressional intent behind the D.C. Home Rule \nAct passed in 1974.\n  First, a little bit of background about the need for this \nlegislation. In December of 2012, the District of Columbia Council \ndisregarded clear limitations found in the Home Rule Act of 1973. In \ndoing so, it passed the Local Budget Autonomy Act, or the LBAA, in an \nattempt to remove Congress from the District's budgeting process.\n  If the bill is implemented, it would allow the District government to \nappropriate money without the need for any Federal action. In doing so, \nthe Council violated clear legislative authority granted to Congress by \nthe Constitution.\n  Article I, section 8, clause 17 of the Constitution gives Congress \nplenary authority over the District of Columbia. As with its other \npowers, Congress may delegate some of its authority to the local \nDistrict government, which it did when it passed the Home Rule Act back \nin 1974. Absent the congressional delegation, the District has no \nlegislative power.\n  As enacted more than 40 years ago, the Home Rule Act was designed to \nallow the District to self-govern on truly local matters. At the same \ntime, Home Rule preserved a necessary role of Congress in matters that \ncould affect the Federal Government, including congressional authority \nover the District's overall budget. The LBAA, however, violates the \nHome Rule Act and removes Congress from the District's budgeting \nprocess.\n  Today's legislation clarifies the original intent behind the Home \nRule Act and reinforces the intent of Congress, our Founding Fathers, \nand the Constitution.\n  Importantly, the language of the Home Rule Act makes it clear it is \nnot authorizing the District authority over its budget.\n  In fact, Mr. Jacques DePuy, then counsel to the House subcommittee \nthat drafted the Home Rule Act, testified this month at our committee. \nHe said: ``Congress did not intend to delegate the D.C. Council or \nDistrict voters any authority over local revenues through the charter \namendment or any other process.'' And then it went on.\n  His recollections are supported by the legislative history, \nparticularly a dear colleague letter sent by then-Chairman Diggs. \nChairman Diggs' letter indicated the comprise language that became the \nHome Rule Act was drafted with the explicit intention of maintaining \nthe congressional appropriations process for the District funds.\n  I believe Chairman Diggs' letter leaves no confusion as to whether \nCongress intended to give the District budget autonomy in the Home Rule \nAct. Therefore, it is clear the District acted beyond its own authority \nto grant itself budget authority.\n  Today's legislation will clarify the original intent of the Home Rule \nAct and address any pending legal questions currently working their way \nthrough the courts.\n  H.R. 5233 will make clear the Local Budget Autonomy Act of 2012 is \nnot legally valid and will ensure the congressional intent behind the \nHome Rule Act is preserved. It will also prevent a potential violation \nof the Antideficiency Act protecting District government employees from \nadministrative and criminal penalties.\n  Ultimately, the unilateral action, as taken by the District in this \ninstance, to subsume congressional authority is unacceptable. H.R. 5233 \nrecognizes this need for exclusive congressional authority and \nstewardship.\n  I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support the bill and place budget \nauthority for the District firmly back in the hands of Congress, the \nsole place where it was intended to be located.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am happy to speak of my friendship with the chairman of our full \ncommittee, and I thank him for his kind words. I only hope he will come \nto where the two past immediate Republican chairs of the committee--\nformer-Chairman Davis and former-Chairman Darrell Issa--have come and, \nthat is, to support budget autonomy for the District of Columbia.\n  I rise in strong opposition to this bill. This bill, that would \nrepeal a law approved by 83 percent of the District of Columbia voters, \nwould nullify a court ruling and would permanently take away the \nauthority of the 700,000 D.C. citizens and their elected officials to \nspend their local funds without congressional approval.\n  This bill manages to be unprincipled and impractical at the same \ntime. It is profoundly undemocratic for any Member of Congress in the \n21st century to declare that he has authority over any other \njurisdiction except his own. It also would harm the finances and \noperations of the District of Columbia.\n  As a matter of fact, the District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act is \nalready in effect. The District Council has begun the process of \npassing its first local budget without the assistance of Federal \noverseers. Therefore, this bill would be the most significant reduction \nin the District's authority to govern itself since Congress granted the \nDistrict limited home rule in 1973.\n  Now, as a lawyer myself, I am the first to concede that lawyers \ndiffer about the validity of the Budget Autonomy Act, even when the \nDistrict was in the process of enacting it.\n  What is indisputable, though, Mr. Speaker, is that the Budget \nAutonomy Act is now law; the Budget Autonomy Act has been litigated; \nand there is only one judicial opinion in effect.\n  In March, the D.C. Superior Court upheld the Budget Autonomy Act. Do \nyou believe in the rule of law? It upheld the Budget Autonomy Act. No \nappeal was filed, and the court ordered D.C. officials to implement it.\n  The Superior Court of the District of Columbia then evaluated each \nand every legal and constitutional argument you will hear brought \nforward today about whether the Budget Autonomy Act violates the U.S. \nConstitution, the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, the Federal \nAntideficiency Act, and the Federal Budget and Accounting Act. All of \nthat, every last one of it, every last provision has been litigated.\n  The House leadership made the very same arguments in an amicus brief \nthey filed. There are a whole gang of Members anxious to see that this \none jurisdiction can't handle its own money. The court, nevertheless, \nfound--indeed, disposed of--all of these arguments.\n  Specifically, the court upheld the Budget Autonomy Act and held that \nthe Home Rule Act preserved the then-existing 1973 budget process, but \ndid not--and this is essential here--did not prohibit the District from \nchanging the local process in the future. The charter does not. The \ncharter is like the Constitution. Congress knew how to say: Don't \nchange budget matters discussed in this document. It did not do so. So \nit had to be interpreted, and it was interpreted by the District.\n  The Senate of the United States, at the time of the Home Rule Act, \npassed budget autonomy for the District of Columbia. So you can cite \nthe Diggs Compromise all you want to. The compromise was that budget \ncontrol now is in the hands of the Congress. But you will note they \nhave left room in the charter for budget control to come from the \nDistrict. That was the compromise.\n  There was no compromise that said that the District can never have \nany jurisdiction, any final say, over its local budget.\n  This is, after all, the country that went to war over taxation \nwithout representation. Imagine saying: you folks, you can raise all \nthe money you want to; but it doesn't mean anything unless the Congress \nof the United States passes your budget.\n  The District followed the charter procedure that was in the Diggs \nbudget\n\n[[Page H3210]]\n\nto pass the Budget Autonomy Act. And as the court noted, Congress had \nthe authority to pass a disapproval resolution while the referendum was \nin the Congress for 30 days but this Congress did not disapprove it.\n  The Federal courts also have evaluated the validity of the Budget \nAutonomy Act. A Federal district court, indeed, did find the act to be \ninvalid.\n  But then look at what the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia did. After receiving briefs, reading them hopefully and \nhearing oral argument, the higher court, the Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia, vacated the district court decision altogether, \nmeaning that that initial decision against the Budget Autonomy Act had \nno force or effect.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Instead of issuing a decision on the merits or sending the case back \nto the lower Federal court, the Federal appeals court, without \nexplanation, simply remanded the case to the Superior Court of the \nDistrict of Columbia, which then issued the only existing court ruling \non the validity of the D.C. Budget Autonomy Act.\n  Is there a rational reason for opposition to budget autonomy?\n  After all, budget autonomy is not statehood, it is not independence, \nit doesn't take away any of your much-vaunted power. The D.C. budget \nautonomy act has no effect, indeed, on congressional authority over the \nDistrict.\n  Under the Budget Autonomy Act, the D.C. Council must transmit the \nlocal D.C. budget to Congress for a review period before that budget \nwould take effect, like all other D.C. legislation under the Home Rule \nAct, and that is about to happen, as I speak. During the review period \nCongress can use expedited procedures to disapprove the budget.\n  You see, what the District was doing here was not committing \nrevolution. It was using the procedures in place in order to gain \ngreater control over its own local budget. In addition, under the U.S. \nConstitution, Congress has total legislative authority over the \nDistrict. Congress can legislate on any District matter at any time, \nbut Congress can also delegate any or all of its legislative authority \nover the District, and it can take back any delegated authority at any \ntime.\n  In 1973, under the Home Rule Act, Congress did just that. It \ndelegated most of its authority, its legislative authority over the \nDistrict to an elected local government. Congress can delegate more or \nit can delegate less authority than provided in the Home Rule Act. It \ncan repeal the Home Rule Act at any time. It can even abolish the \ngovernment of the District of Columbia.\n  My friends, I ask you: Is that enough authority for you? Over 700,000 \nAmerican citizens who are not your constituents, is that enough for \nyou? Is that enough power? Why is that not enough to satisfy any \nCongress of the United States?\n  Until this Congress, Democrats were not alone in supporting budget \nautonomy. President George W. Bush supported D.C. budget autonomy. The \nRepublican-controlled Senate passed a budget autonomy bill by unanimous \nconsent in 2003. The last two Republican chairmen, of whom I spoke \ntoday as I began to speak myself, who had the jurisdiction that \nChairman Chaffetz now has--Tom Davis and Darrell Issa--actually fought \nfor, not simply supported, but fought for budget autonomy. I think they \nrecognized that this is a set of principles we have in common.\n  I always thought that local control was a cardinal principle of the \nRepublican Party. Even the Republicans' own witnesses at the hearing on \nthis bill who took a position on the policy of budget autonomy--and \nthat was most of them--supported budget action.\n  Control over the dollars raised by local taxpayers is a much-cited \nprinciple of congressional Republicans, and it happens to be central to \nour form of government as held by Democrats and Republicans. The \nexalted status of local control for Republicans, though, keeps being \nannounced as if we need to be retaught.\n  The Republicans did so again in their recently released budget. I \nquote you only one sentence: ``We are humble enough,'' Republicans \nsaid, ``to admit that the Federal Government does not have all the \nanswers.'' That was their latest abeyance to local control for every \nsingle American jurisdiction, except the American jurisdiction that \nhappens to be the capital of the United States.\n  Beyond this core principle, budget autonomy has practical benefits \nthat I don't see how any Member of Congress can ignore. In a recent \namicus brief filed by former Congressman Davis: ``The benefits of \nbudget autonomy for the District are numerous, real, and much needed. \nThere is no drawback.''\n  One of the other signatories of the brief was Alice Rivlin, a former \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office, also a former Director of \nthe White House Office of Management and Budget.\n  It is with some irony and real pain that I see come to this floor \neven to speak against this bill Members whose budgets are not as large \nas the budget of the District of Columbia, even though they come from \nentire, big States. The District's budget is bigger than the budgets of \n14 States. We raise that money ourselves. The District raises more than \n$7 billion in local funds. The District contributes more Federal taxes \nto the Treasury of the United States than 22 States. The District of \nColumbia is number one in federal taxes per capita paid to the Federal \nGovernment, and the District is in better financial shape than most \ncities and States in the United States, with a rainy day fund of $2.17 \nbillion on a total budget of $13.4 billion. Budget autonomy will make \nthe District--which, after all, has no State to fall back on--even \nstronger.\n  How?\n  Budget autonomy gives the District what every other local government \nin the United States enjoys: lower borrowing costs on Wall Street. \nImagine having to do what the District has to do: pay a penalty because \nyour budget has to come to a Congress that knows nothing of your city \nor your budget, and they get to vote on it even though your own Member \ndoes not. D.C. will also have improved agency operations, and in D.C.'s \ncase, the removal of the threat of Federal Government shutdowns, \nshutting down the entire D.C. government just because Members of \nCongress can't figure out what to do about the Federal Government. The \nFederal Government has benefits, too. Congress would no longer waste \ntime on a budget it never amends.\n  So budget autonomy has no downside. I am trying to figure out why \nanybody would want to deal with my budget. Heavens.\n  Don't Members have enough to do?\n  Congress maintains total legislative control over the District, with \nall the Federal financial controls in place. Congress has nothing to \nlose, can step in at anytime they don't like it. We are not asking for \nvery much. It is for some loosening of Congressional control. So, for \nexample, we would not have to pay more when we borrow on Wall Street \nbecause we are seen as involved in a two-step budgetary process; one, I \nmight add, that is far more problematic, the Federal process, than the \nother, the local process. It also is ironic to note that Congress \ngranted D.C. budget autonomy during its early years.\n  Yesterday the Committee on Rules prevented my amendment to make the \ntext of the Budget Autonomy Act Federal law from getting a vote. Today \nthe appropriations subcommittee passed an appropriation rider \ncontaining the text of the very bill that is before us on this floor \nright now. That makes 2 days, 2 identical provisions. Just in case--\njust in case anybody would think that Republicans don't mean it, they \nare doing it twice.\n  What do they need? An insurance policy of identical language in case, \nGod forbid, the Senate does not pass this bill?\n  I predict that the Senate won't pass this bill. So it is on you, \nMembers of the House of Representatives, the people's House, to take \nthe lead in denying for the people who live in your Nation's Capital \nthe same control over their local budget that you, yourselves, hold so \ndear. You can stand on what you do today, but you won't stand up \nstraight because what you do today, if you vote to take away our budget \nautonomy bill, will not be standing on principle.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the\n\n[[Page H3211]]\n\ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows), the chief sponsor of this \nbill.\n  Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from \nUtah, Chairman Chaffetz, for his strong statement in support of H.R. \n5233, the Clarifying Congressional Intent in Providing for DC Home Rule \nAct of 2016.\n  As we begin debate on this important bill, I would like to first take \nthe opportunity to reiterate that I firmly believe that the Local \nBudget Autonomy Act is, indeed, unlawful and null and void. The Home \nRule Act clearly provides that the District's budget shall pass through \nthe Federal appropriations process, preserving Congress' role in the \npassage of that budget.\n  However, because of the precedent that allowing the District to usurp \nthe congressional authority may set, and the potential negative \nconsequences that the District government employees may face for \nenforcing the Local Budget Autonomy Act, I have introduced H.R. 5233.\n  I would further say that my good friend, the Delegate from the \nDistrict of Columbia, Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton, indeed is a friend, \nand I appreciate her passionate way that she always represents her \nconstituency. While we disagree on the debate and the merits of that \ndebate, I can't help but acknowledge my friendship with her and, truly, \nher passion for the people who she serves.\n  H.R. 5233 will repeal the Local Budget Autonomy Act and reinforce \nCongress' intended role in the budgetary process. As many of you know, \nCongress was granted that exclusive legislative authority over the \nDistrict in Article 1, section 8, clause 17. This exclusive authority \nwas explained further in the Federalist 43 as being a crucial component \nin keeping the Federal Government free from potential influence by any \nState housing the government's seat.\n  There was a distinct worry that placing the seat of the Federal \nGovernment in a territory where Congress was not the sole sovereign \nwould, indeed, impact its integrity. Therefore, the Founding Fathers \nsaw fit to authorize Congress to create the District and act as the \nsole legislative authority for the District.\n  As seen in Federalist 43, the Founding Fathers believed that Congress \nwould delegate some of those exclusive authorities to the District, \nspecifically the power to deal with solely local matters. In 1973, \nCongress made a decision to enact such legislation when they passed the \nHome Rule Act.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  In that act, Congress provided the District with the authority to \nhave the jurisdiction over legislative matters on a limited basis. \nBut--and this is a critically important point--Congress reserved for \nitself, and prohibited the District from altering, the role of Congress \nin the budgetary process.\n  There can be little doubt that Congress intended to reserve that \npower for itself. The language of the Home Rule Act itself is clear. \nBoth the former and the current attorney general for the District, as \nwell as the former Mayor, believe the Local Budget Autonomy Act to be \nunlawful and contrary to the Home Rule Act.\n  Mr. Irvin Nathan, the former attorney general, testified before the \nHouse Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that numerous \nsections of the Home Rule Act prohibit the District's action.\n  Mr. Nathan, who supports the policy, as my good friend acknowledged, \nwho actually supports the policy of budget autonomy, even stated that \nhe believed the Federal District Court's opinion invalidating the Local \nBudget Autonomy Act was, indeed, a correct opinion.\n  Beyond the clear language, the legislative history makes it clear, \nMr. Speaker, that Congress had no intent to delegate to the District \nthe authority for the budgetary process. In fact, Mr. Jacques DePuy, \nwho participated in the drafting of the Home Rule Act itself, made it \nclear in testimony before Congress that, indeed, Congress did not \nintend to delegate the appropriations powers to the District. The \nlegislative record of the Home Rule Act supports Mr. DePuy.\n  One such piece of the record is, indeed, the Diggs letter, which the \nchairman referenced earlier, that was issued by Chairman Charles Diggs. \nThe letter describes how it was clarifying the intent of Congress by \nmaking several changes, including reserving Congress' role in the \nbudgetary process.\n  The Diggs letter highlighted a pivotal aspect of the congressional \nintent in the Home Rule Act. It represents a compromise in response to \nthe Senate's Home Rule Act, which actually included a form of budget \nautonomy.\n  The compromise does not indicate that Congress intended to grant the \nDistrict budget autonomy. To the contrary, what the Diggs compromise \nrepresents is that there could be no Home Rule Act, absent an express \nreservation of the role of Congress in the District's budget process.\n  I believe there can be no stronger statement that Congress intended \nto reserve its appropriation role than the fact that the Home Rule Act \nwould have failed, absent that reservation.\n  Importantly, both of these men, Mr. Irvin and Mr. DePuy, who support \nbudget autonomy further believe that the District's action is illegal \nand, therefore, null and void.\n  I want to be clear on this. We are not here today to make a power \ngrab against the District, as some would suggest. We are here, Mr. \nSpeaker, to uphold the rule of law.\n  At the committee's hearing, even the chairman of the Council of the \nDistrict of Columbia was forced to acknowledge that it was clear that \nthe majority of the Members of Congress who passed the Home Rule Act \nintended to reserve the complete appropriations for Congress. Again, \nanother individual who supports budget autonomy recognizes the intent \nof Congress.\n  So, in moving ahead with the Local Budget Autonomy Act, the District \ngovernment is usurping congressional authority, and inaction would \nundermine not only this institution, but all organs of government \nacross this Nation.\n  To suggest that any city council's action, whether it be here in the \nDistrict or in any other city in the country, could unilaterally \noverturn the intent of Congress would set a bad precedent. Regardless \nof the precedent, however, such action by local government is a blatant \nviolation of the Supremacy Clause and, therefore, unconstitutional.\n  Moreover, as a result of the unlawful way in which the budget \nautonomy is purported to have been achieved, District government \nemployees are now at risk of the Antideficiency Act and the sanctions \ntherein.\n  Under the Antideficiency Act, absent a congressional appropriation, \nthe District may not expend or obligate funds. Doing so will result in \npotential criminal or administrative penalties for not only the \nDistrict's elected officials, but the line level employees charged with \npurchasing items for the District.\n  The GAO testified that they maintain that the Local Budget Autonomy \nAct violates the Home Rule Act and the Antideficiency Act, despite the \nsuperior court's decision. H.R. 5233 would repeal the Local Budget \nAutonomy Act and prevent the District government employees from having \nto worry that the purchases they make on behalf of the District may \nindeed violate the law.\n  H.R. 5233 will also augment the already clear prohibitions on the \nDistrict in altering the role of Congress in the budget process, \nensuring that Congress' intent and constitutional authority, Mr. \nSpeaker, remains in place.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer) the Democratic Whip and my good friend from a \nneighboring jurisdiction.\n  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I \nthank the gentleman from North Carolina for outlining his position.\n  We are a nation of laws. The gentleman has indicated a court has \nruled on this issue--an opinion with which he disagrees--and we have a \nmechanism for overturning or clarifying or changing such a ruling, and \nthat is the court system. That case may well reach the Supreme Court.\n  I rise in opposition to this piece of legislation, which, in my \nopinion, is an exercise in hypocrisy. Why do I say that? That can be a \nharsh word. We are witnessing the party that proclaims itself to be the \nchampion of local autonomy and less Federal Government\n\n[[Page H3212]]\n\ninvolvement in local affairs--we hear that all the time--bring to this \nfloor legislation that would do exactly the opposite.\n  The District of Columbia's over 700,000 American citizens deserve a \nform of home rule not characterized by constant and intrusive \nmicromanaging by congressional Republicans or Democrats.\n  Now, if I were to ask unanimous consent that we substitute the \nDistrict of Columbia and perhaps include Milwaukee, Wisconsin--now, I \nam not going to ask for that--I am sure I would get objection. Or, if I \nmight ask that Salt Lake City be substituted or perhaps even Baltimore, \nMaryland, my own city in my State, or maybe even Charlotte, North \nCarolina, those of us who represent those four cities would stand and \nsay: This is not your role, Congress of the United States.\n  Speaker Ryan just released a statement in which he said: ``The \ncurrent D.C. government needs to be reined in.''\n  From where? From balanced budgets? From surpluses in their budgets? \nReined in? They are a model, I would suggest, of fiscal responsibility. \nNot always, but today. But then again, none of our jurisdictions have \nalways been such a model.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hultgren). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Maryland.\n  Mr. HOYER. I would say to the Speaker, in response, quite the \nopposite. The government and the people of the District of Columbia \nneed to be allowed to chart their own course, which is what I think \nmost of you say on a regular basis.\n  It is a mystery to me--and ought to be a mystery to every American \nwho believes in the premise that people ought to govern themselves--why \nHouse Republicans are determined to strip that ability from the 700,000 \nAmericans who live in our Nation's Capital. They pay taxes. They pay \ntaxes to their local government. And we want to make that decision.\n  I understand what the court has said and that courts may rule that \nway, but shouldn't we have the patience to let the court system decide \nwhether or not this referendum of the people of the District of \nColumbia is adjudged to be appropriate? The locally raised revenues \nfrom taxes and fees do not originate from the Federal Government, but \nfrom the hardworking residents of Washington.\n  The District of Columbia has proven Congress' wisdom in enacting the \n1973 D.C. Home Rule Act time and again by managing its affairs in a \nfiscally responsible, democratic way.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. HOYER. The gentleman is very generous, and I appreciate it.\n  I would say to my friends, the District of Columbia deserves the same \nrespect that any of our governments deserve and that, in fact, we \ndemand for them. And I always lament how the District is demeaned.\n  When I was the majority leader, I made sure that Ms. Norton had a \nvote on the floor of this House and that the Virgin Islands' \nRepresentative had a vote on the floor of this House. One of the first \nthings you did when you took the majority was take that away.\n  It was not a vote that made a difference. It was a vote that was \nsymbolic. But it gave them the opportunity to have their name as our \nequals, as Americans, on that board and express their opinion.\n  Let us not take this degree of autonomy away from them. Let us \nrespect these local citizens as you would want your local citizens \nrespected.\n  I urge the defeat of this legislation. If the courts tell us that \nthey could not do this, so be it, but let us let the system work its \nwill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill, which is an exercise \nin Republican hypocrisy.\n  We are witnessing the party that proclaims itself to be a champion of \nlocal autonomy and less Federal Government involvement in local affairs \nbring to this floor legislation that would do exactly the opposite.\n  The District of Columbia deserves a form of home rule not \ncharacterized by constant and intrusive micromanaging by congressional \nRepublicans.\n  Speaker Ryan just released a statement in which he said--and I quote: \n``The current D.C. Government needs to be reined in.''\n  I would say to the Speaker in response: Quite the opposite; the \ngovernment and people of the District of Columbia need to be allowed to \nchart their own course.\n  It is a mystery to me--and ought to be a mystery to every American \nwho believes in the premise that people ought to govern themselves--Why \nHouse Republicans are determined to strip that ability away from the \n670,000 Americans who live in our Nation's Capital.\n  The locally raised revenues from taxes and fees do not originate from \nthe Federal Government but from hardworking residents of Washington.\n  The District of Columbia has proven Congress's wisdom in enacting the \n1973 D.C. Home Rule Act time and again by managing its affairs in a \nfiscally responsible, democratic way.\n  That is what this bill is, Mr. Speaker--a reminder to the people of \nthis city that they remain unrepresented in this House and a Federal \ncolony within a nation dedicated to democracy and fair representation.\n  When Democrats were in the majority, we worked to give District of \nColumbia residents a greater voice in the Committee of the Whole.\n  And when Republicans took the majority, one of the first acts was \ntaking this small but important democratic tool and indication of \nrespect away from the District's representative and the other \nrepresentatives of our U.S. territories.\n  Now Republicans want to erode the District of Columbia's hard-earned \nright to govern itself.\n  I thank my friend the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia, Ms. \nHolmes Norton, for her impassioned defense of Washingtonians' \nunalienable right to have a say.\n  And I will continue to stand with her to demand that right be \nrecognized--and in seeking for the District of Columbia the real budget \nautonomy, home rule, and representation in Congress that its people \ndeserve.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks \nto the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I have no additional speakers, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, how much time does each side have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from the District of \nColumbia has 8 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Utah has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nthe Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), my very good friend.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the District \nof Columbia, and I thank all of the speakers here today for expressing \ntheir opinions.\n  Today, I rise in support of retaining local budget autonomy for the \nDistrict of Columbia and to express my strong opposition to H.R. 5233, \nClarifying Congressional Intent in Providing for DC Home Rule Act of \n2016.\n  Now, this partisan bill would repeal a District of Columbia \nreferendum that allowed the District to implement its own local budget \nwithout affirmative congressional approval.\n  While this bill passed the Oversight and Government Reform Committee \non a party-line vote of 22-14, I would remind this body that the \ncommittee's last four chairmen--including Republican Chairmen, \nRepresentatives Tom Davis and Darrell Issa, who have studied and had \nsubstantial oversight over the D.C. government--each worked to give the \nDistrict of Columbia budget autonomy.\n  Now, some of my colleagues here may argue that the District of \nColumbia will loose its financial discipline under budget autonomy; \nhowever, this could not be further from the truth. Budget autonomy \nactually improves the operations and finances for the District of \nColumbia government because the District would employ financial budget \nexperts who are focused solely on the economic growth, fiscal \nsoundness, and stability of the District, not Members of Congress \nintent on ideological posturing or voting on budgets of constituencies \nthat are not their own, with Members of those districts or those \njurisdictions prohibited from voting on those measures.\n\n[[Page H3213]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Autonomy would, in fact, lower borrowing costs, allow more accurate \nrevenue and expenditure forecasts, improve agency operations and the \nremoval of the threat that the Federal Government shutdowns would also \nshut down the District of Columbia's government.\n  Congress also loses no authority under budget autonomy because this \nbody can use expedited procedures during the 30-day review period or \nother measures that are in there.\n  The U.S. Constitution also provides for Congress to retain authority \nto legislate any D.C. matter, including its local budget, at any time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. NORTON. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Now, I fear, when we leave the well-being of the \nDistrict of Columbia to this body, this body seems to lack the will or \nfortitude to make equitable decisions for everyday people of this \ncountry or, more particularly, the historically disenfranchised people.\n  This Congress seems intent on stripping away what little power those \nwho don't have a vote on this floor have been able to wring from the \nhands of the majority.\n  It is my belief that Congress should stop wasting its time debating \nlegislation that continues to subjugate the District of Columbia to its \nauthority and work on passing a Federal budget that would boost the \neconomy of the entire American people.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Before I recognize the ranking member of the Committee on Oversight \nand Government Reform, I cannot help but note, when I listen to my \nfriend, Ms. Plaskett, speak up for the District of Columbia, she, who \ncomes from what is known as a territory, the Virgin Islands--isn't it \ninteresting--and I know she must understand it--that the Virgin Islands \ndoes not have to submit a budget to the Congress of the United States. \nI never have had to debate the gentlewoman's budget here. I have never \nhad to debate the gentlewoman's legislation here.\n  There is a unique denial here in the District of Columbia. That is \none reason it is so roundly resented.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. \nCummings), my good friend, the ranking member of the Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this bill, which would repeal the \nDistrict of Columbia's Local Budget Autonomy Act and prohibit D.C. from \npassing such laws in the future.\n  I do not believe there is a Member of Congress who would stand for \nthe Federal Government dictating the local budget of a city in his or \nher district, and D.C. should be treated no differently.\n  Granting D.C. local budget autonomy is not only the right thing to \ndo, it would also have significant financial benefits for the District, \nsuch as lowering borrowing costs.\n  It would also mean an end to the threat of a cutoff of D.C. municipal \nservices in the event of a Federal Government shutdown.\n  I also want to express my disappointment that some Members have \nthreatened jail for D.C. employees who implement the Autonomy Act. The \nthreat is backwards. The only court ruling in effect on this law upheld \nit and ordered all District employees to implement it.\n  House Republicans have taken a regrettable turn in their approach to \nD.C. home rule. The last four chairmen of the Oversight and Government \nReform Committee, including Republicans Tom Davis and Darrell Issa, \nsought to give the District more home rule and more budget autonomy, \nnot less.\n  Yet, in this Congress, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee \nhas passed legislation to overturn a District law that prohibits \nemployment discriminating based on reproductive health decisions and \nlaunched an investigation into the District's marijuana legalization \ninitiative. This bill is not only unprincipled. It is simply bad \npolicy.\n  The former counsel for the District of Columbia Committee and the \nmajority's own hearing witness said this: ``It is the duly elected \nrepresentatives for the citizens of the District of Columbia who should \ndetermine how taxpayer money is spent.''\n  We hear a lot of rhetoric about devolving authority to local \ngovernments. Yet, this bill tramples on local government and the will \nof their local citizens.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to reject this bill.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to be clear about my motives and intentions. I find it curious \nwhen other Members try to prescribe my feelings and my approach to this \nissue.\n  It is my belief, and support of this legislation is based on the \nConstitution. It is that simple to me. Article I, section 8, clause 17, \nsays: ``To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over \nsuch District,'' and it continues on.\n  The District of Columbia is more than just a local jurisdiction. It \nis more than just a local city. It is our Nation's Capital.\n  I think what the founders were intending to do was to understand and \nallow participation for Members all over this country in the affairs of \nthe city. That was the intention, and that is what is in the \nConstitution.\n  Don't be confused or misled or allow anybody else to prescribe my \nmotives and my motivation, my belief, in the District of Columbia \nbecause it is rooted, first and foremost, in the Constitution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on both sides, please?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from the District of \nColumbia has 2 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Utah has 13 \nminutes remaining.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Just as lawyers have disagreed about whether or not the District \ncould proceed with budget autonomy, lawyers have disagreed from the \nbeginning of our Nation on what the Constitution says.\n  I would take at his word what James Madison said in speaking of the \nDistrict of Columbia: ``A municipal legislature for local purposes, \nderived from their own suffrages, will of course be allowed to them.''\n  That is what, according to Madison, the Constitution said.\n  Now, my friends have cited all manner of lawyers and their own views \non whether this matter is legal or constitutional. They have even cited \nthe interpretation of staff who helped draft the Home Rule Act.\n  Well, we stand this afternoon on the only authoritative opinion, the \nopinion of the Superior Court and its court order. And I leave with you \nthat order.\n\n       Ordered that all members of the Council of the District of \n     Columbia, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser, Chief Financial Officer, \n     Jeffrey S. DeWitt, their successors in office, and all \n     officers, agents, servants, employees, and all persons in \n     active concert or participation with the Government of the \n     District of Columbia shall forthwith enforce all provisions \n     of the Local Budget Autonomy Act of 2012.\n\n  That is the law. Respect the rule of law.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of H.R. 5233. I am proud of the fact \nthat, in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, we had a \nhearing, we had a proper markup, and we are bringing it here to the \nfloor today for all Members to vote on.\n  I would urge my colleagues to adhere to the Constitution. Do what the \nConstitution says and support the bill, H.R. 5233.\n  I want to thank again Mr. Meadows for his work and leadership on this \nand getting us to this point. I urge its passage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. \n5233, the Clarifying Congressional Intent in Providing for DC Home Rule \nAct of 2016.\n  The legislation seeks to overturn a local statute in Washington, \nD.C., the Local Budget Autonomy Amendment Act of 2012, a measure that \nwas passed by the Washington, D.C.\n\n[[Page H3214]]\n\nCity Council, approved by the Mayor, and subsequently ratified by D.C. \nvoters by ballot initiative with an overwhelming 83 percent of the \nvote.\n  The Local Budget Autonomy Amendment Act of 2012, the BAA, gave the \nDistrict of Columbia authority to determine its own budget without \ngetting approval from Congress. H.R. 5233 removes this authority and \nprohibits D.C. from passing any budget autonomy legislation in the \nfuture.\n  Washington, D.C. voters want budget autonomy. Washington D.C. voters \ndeserve budget autonomy. They have already voted for it, passed it, and \nratified it. When it was challenged by the Government Accountability \nOffice (GAO), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit and the D.C. Superior Court upheld its validity. This should be \na done deal.\n  But instead of focusing on the critical issues facing this body--\npassing a budget for instance, which we were required by law to do last \nmonth--the House of Representatives has decided to focus on this.\n  I remind those here today and watching at home that Washington D.C. \nis a Federal District. Congress maintains the power to overturn laws \napproved by the D.C. Council and can vote to impose laws on the \ndistrict, as it is trying to do right with this particular measure. \nWashington D.C.'s Delegate to the House of Representatives, my good \nfriend Eleanor Holmes Norton, who has served in this body for 24 years, \nis not permitted to vote on final passage of any legislation, let alone \nlegislation directly intended to govern the jurisdiction which she was \nelected to serve.\n  Congresswoman Norton described the measure in question as ``the most \nsignificant abuse of congressional authority over the District of \nColumbia since passage of the Home Rule Act in 1973.''\n  One might hope that Congress would consider the wishes of the sole \nRepresentative of Washington, D.C. and the nearly 700,000 residents of \nthe District. But, as we see today, that simply isn't the case.\n  Congress is currently undergoing its own appropriations process, and \nI need not remind everyone here that Republicans haven't even passed a \nbudget. We have missed deadline after deadline and are now moving ahead \nwithout setting a budget at all. How can anyone tell me that the \nDistrict of Columbia should yield to the budgetary wisdom of the House \nMajority when they can't even get their own act together to pass a \nbudget?\n  The issue of Home Rule has come up before in this body. In recent \nyears, House Republicans have challenged the District of Columbia on \nissues ranging from the legalization of marijuana, access to \nreproductive health care, and charter schools, in all three instances \nforcing their will over the desires of the residents of D.C. This needs \nto stop.\n  Given the numerous pressing and time-sensitive matters facing this \nbody, I can't help but feel bewildered as to why we are spending our \ntime on this measure. What is more confusing is our current efforts to \nundo a measure that was passed by an overwhelming majority of D.C. \nresidents and subsequently upheld in the courts.\n  Meanwhile, Republicans continue to ignore our nation's crumbling \ninfrastructure, income inequality, the need for jobs, immigration \nreform, and sensible gun control, not to mention the Federal budget, \nyet we are debating a measure that would further roll-back the clock on \nthe rights of D.C. residents. Where are our priorities?\n  Let me put it another way--why should Congressional dysfunction keep \nthe District government from using tax revenues paid by District \nresidents to pick up trash? Why should Congressional dysfunction keep \nthe District from spending its own money on its own priorities?\n  I will note that Representatives Tom Davis and Darrell Issa, both \nmembers of the Majority and former Chairmen of the House Committee on \nOversight and Government Reform each supported the idea of budget \nautonomy for Washington, D.C.\n  Budget autonomy means lower borrowing costs and more accurate revenue \nand expenditure forecasts. It means improved government operations and \nremoving the threat of government shutdown for Washington, D.C.'s local \ngovernment. It means streamlining Congressional operations. Most \nimportantly, it means giving residents of Washington, D.C., the right \nto make decisions for themselves.\n  These are all things we should all be overwhelmingly support of. We \nshould move on and focus on the real issues before us. It is past time \nfor Congress to get out of the way of the will of the residents of D.C.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I submit the following:\n\n                                                     May 25, 2016.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives.\n       Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Democratic Leader Reid, \n     Speaker Ryan, and Democratic Leader Pelosi: This week, the \n     House of Representatives is voting on H.R. 5233, the \n     Clarifying Congressional Intent in Providing for DC Home Rule \n     Act of 2016. I strongly oppose this legislation as well as \n     any effort to overturn the District of Columbia's budget \n     autonomy law with a rider to any appropriations bill.\n       Budget autonomy was approved by the voters and upheld in \n     the courts. I have proposed our 21st consecutive balanced \n     budget in accordance with the prevailing law and I expect the \n     Council of the District of Columbia to do the same. As is the \n     case with all DC laws, the approved 2017 DC budget will be \n     submitted to Congress for passive review. The American people \n     expect their congressional representatives to focus on the \n     issues affecting our nation--safety and security, fair wages, \n     and growing the middle class--not on the local budget of DC.\n       The District has a strong track record of administering our \n     government finances responsibly. We have passed and \n     implemented a balanced budget every year for the last 21 \n     years and our General Fund balance--which currently stands at \n     $2.17 billion--is the envy of other jurisdictions. Our bond \n     rating is AA by S and Fitch and Aa1 by Moody's as a result \n     of the District's strong, institutionalized and disciplined \n     financial management and long track record of balanced \n     budgets and clean audits. Our debt obligations remain within \n     the 12 percent limit of total General Fund expenditures and \n     the District's pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plan \n     (OPEB) remain well-funded.\n       The vast majority of the District of Columbia's budget is \n     locally-generated revenue (such as property and sales taxes) \n     or federal grant funds received in the same manner as any \n     other state. In fact, the vast majority of our $13.4 billion \n     budget is raised locally. In recent years, only about one \n     percent, or about $130 million, has been a direct federal \n     payment to the District, and that amount remains subject to \n     active appropriation by Congress. About 25 percent of our \n     budget, or $3.3 billion, is federal grants and Medicaid \n     payments that are made to every other state.\n       The District of Columbia operates as a state, county, and \n     city, administering federal block grant programs, health and \n     human services programs, transportation infrastructure, \n     homeland security services, and other governmental duties \n     typically overseen by governors. It is time that Congress \n     recognizes the District's financial maturity and \n     responsibility and allows us to approve our own budget \n     without first seeking a congressional appropriation.\n       Budget autonomy also supports good government by helping \n     the District of Columbia plan its finances more efficiently. \n     For instance, tying our budgeting process to the \n     congressional appropriations process requires us to rely on \n     outdated revenue and uncertain expenditure projections, which \n     in turn results in more uncertainty and budget reprogramming. \n     Also, Congress has not completed its appropriations process \n     on time since 1996. Without budget autonomy, each time \n     congressional appropriations are delayed, the finalization of \n     the District's budget is also delayed. If the District cannot \n     spend its own locally-raised revenue (as occurred in 2013) by \n     the start of the fiscal year, the operations of the District \n     and the well-being of its residents are put at risk. Budget \n     autonomy relieves us of this inefficiency and uncertainty.\n       Budget autonomy will also improve our already excellent \n     bond ratings. The rating agencies are keenly interested in \n     predictability. Tying the District's budget to the \n     congressional appropriations process hurts our credit rating \n     which unjustly punishes District taxpayers who have no voting \n     representation in either the U.S. House of Representatives or \n     the U.S. Senate.\n       Further, it is important to note that budget autonomy does \n     not exclude Congress from the District's budget approval \n     process. Each annual budget for the District of Columbia will \n     be submitted to Congress for a 30-day period of review under \n     the Home Rule Act. During that time period (and, for that \n     matter, even after that time period), Congress is able to \n     reject the District's budget or modify it as Congress sees \n     fit. Budget autonomy does not mean that Congress no longer \n     has a say in the District's budget. It just means that we \n     have a more efficient and productive way of passing our \n     budget and thus a more efficient and productive way to serve \n     the residents, visitors, and businesses in the District.\n       With the move to pass H.R. 5233, Congress is unnecessarily \n     restricting local government control and further denying \n     democracy to the residents of the District of Columbia. I ask \n     for your support in putting aside any attempts to overturn \n     local control of our budget and our ability to operate our \n     government more efficiently.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Muriel Bowser,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Superior Court of the District of Columbia Civil Division\n\n       Council of the District of Columbia, Plaintiff, and Muriel \n     E.

A point of order is reserved.\n  The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Connolly moves to recommit the bill H.R. 5233 to the \n     Committee on Oversight and Government Reform with \n     instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith \n     with the following amendment:\n       In section 2 of the bill--\n       (1) strike ``Effective with respect to fiscal year 2013'' \n     and insert ``(a) Repeal.--Except as provided in subsection \n     (b), effective with respect to fiscal year 2013''; and\n       (2) add at the end the following new subsection:\n       (b) Exception for Use of Local Funds to Prevent and Treat \n     Zika.--The Local Budget Autonomy Amendment Act of 2012, \n     together with any applicable provision of law amended or \n     repealed by such Act, shall remain in effect with respect to \n     the use of local funds by the District of Columbia government \n     to prevent and treat the Zika virus.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I have listened with great, rapt attention \nthis afternoon to my friends, Mr. Chaffetz and Mr. Meadows, who have \ngone on eloquently about protecting the Constitution of the United \nStates at, of course, the collateral expense of the people of the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  They cite the Constitution as if the Constitution and the Founders \nwho wrote it were fully cognizant of the evolution that was going to \ntake place in the District of Columbia when we know, as a historical \nfact, the Constitution was actually written before there was a District \nof Columbia, let alone almost 700,000 American citizens still denied \nvoting representation in this body today.\n  In fact, that very Constitution my friends cite protected slavery, \ndecided that certain people of color were only worth three-fifths of \nthe normal mortal, but allowed the South to count them for the purposes \nof representation in this body.\n  The same Constitution. We changed it. We took cognizance of changes \nin reality. The fact that you exercise your will over an entire city \njust because you can does not make it right or noble.\n  In fact, if we follow the logic of my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle, why not just take over the day-to-day mechanics of running \nthe government of the city?\n  So let's do rezoning. Let's do emergency preparedness. Let's run the \npolice department. Let's run the EMT and the fire department. Let's \ntake over mental health facilities and human services.\n  Why go only halfway? Why go only halfway? I am curious. What is it \nabout the budget that is so sacred? All the rest you are going to let \ngo.\n  This final amendment, Mr. Speaker, will preserve a small modicum of \nthe District's control over local taxpayer dollars to prevent and treat \nthe emerging threat of Zika. If adopted, we can move to immediate final \npassage of the bill.\n  Although we may disagree--and do--on the underlying purpose of the \nbill, surely we can agree on the seriousness of the Zika threat. There \nhave already been 4 reported cases of travel-associated Zika here in \nthe District, 15 in the Commonwealth of Virginia, my home State, and 17 \nin Maryland.\n  It may seem foreign to some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, but in the National Capital Region, the two States, D.C., and \nthe region's local governments actually have a rich tradition of \nworking together, including in public health.\n  Working through the Council of Governments, which I used to chair, \nour local and State partners regularly come together. The District of \nColumbia needs to be a full partner in those regional efforts so that \nit cannot be placed in a position of having to come to Congress to \nactually ask for permission before spending its own local dollars on \nZika prevention and education.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  I might add, it is not just the people of the District of Columbia \nwho will be at risk if we are not addressing Zika in an efficacious \nway; it is the 12 million constituents, the people my friend from North \nCarolina (Mr. Meadows) represents and that I represent who come to this \ncity every year to visit the Nation's Capital. Will we protect them? Or \nwill we dither here in Congress?\n  There is irony in that, isn't there? Because we can't get our own \nbudget together. We can't pass our own appropriations bills, but we are \ngoing to second-guess the local government here in the District of \nColumbia because somehow we do it better? I don't think there is a \nneutral observer who would conclude that.\n  But we are going to do it cloaked in the respectability of a \nconstitutional argument that is, I believe, false and antiquated--not \nbecause the Constitution is antiquated, but because what was known in \nthe late 18th century at the time of the writing of the Constitution is \ndifferent today.\n  Are we going to return to the plantation mentality Congress used to \nhave with respect to the District of Columbia? Or are we actually going \nto act on principle here, not ideology? We are not going to fire up our \nbase or the right-wing radio talk show hosts. We are actually going to \ndo the right thing--the right thing for 700,000 fellow citizens--and \nlet them have an ounce of decency with respect to their own self-\ndetermination.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of \norder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of the point of order is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from North Carolina is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, my friend opposite--and I say that in the \nmost authentic and complete terms because, indeed, the gentleman is my \nfriend--raises a point of debate about the Constitution and the fact \nthat explicitly in the Constitution, our Founding Fathers reserved this \nparticular authority in Article I, section 8, clause 17, which shows \nthe wisdom of our Founding Fathers to anticipate what, indeed, we are \ndebating here today.\n  For many of the other arguments that my good friend has made in terms \nof what we need to change, there is the appropriate place for those \nchanges to be made, and that is exactly what this debate has been \nabout. It is about the rule of law; it is about the Constitution; and \nit is about this institution being the proper place to make those \ndeterminations on behalf of the will of We the People.\n  Now, the motion to recommit talks about Zika funding. And I might \nremind the gentleman that, indeed, in this very body within the last \nfew days,\n\n[[Page H3216]]\n\nwe have already passed funding to address the Zika virus' potential \nhealthcare concern; and, indeed, this is the correct body for us to do \nthat. It is not the District of Columbia or any other municipality \nacross the country. It is, indeed, this body, the role for this \nparticular body that has been reserved constitutionally; and it has \nbeen that way since the very founding of this great country we all call \nhome.\n  I would also add that, as we start to look at this, the debate has \nbeen over local control. And when we start to see the debate that \ncontinues to play out, this particular issue was reserved in the \nConstitution, and it was solely that of Congress to have all \nlegislative power over the District.\n  Now, is that somehow inconsistent with the fact that we want to make \nsure that all control is local? It is not. Because as we look at that, \nwe must, indeed, make sure that we stand up.\n  And I would ask all of my colleagues to look at the very foundation \nof who we are as an institution, as Members of Congress. To allow the \nBudget Autonomy Act to stand in place would not only usurp the \nauthority--the congressional authority--that has been given to us in \nour Constitution but, indeed, it would undermine it for future \nCongresses to come.\n  So it is with great humility, but also with great passion, that I \nwould urge my colleagues to defeat the motion to recommit, knowing that \nwe have already addressed the particular funding requirement that the \ngentleman from Virginia brings up--defeat the motion to recommit, and \nsupport the underlying bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

This is a bill that \nwill update our national energy policy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the motion.\n\n[[Page H3219]]\n\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton).\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n\n               Motion to Instruct Offered by Mr. Grijalva\n\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Grijalva moves that the managers on the part of the \n     House at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two \n     Houses on the House amendment to the bill S. 2012 (an Act to \n     provide for the modernization of the energy policy of the \n     United States, and for other purposes) be instructed to \n     insist on inclusion of section 5002 of S. 2012.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 7 of rule XXII, the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) and the gentleman from Utah (Mr. \nBishop) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, the Democratic motion would instruct House \nconferees to insist that section 5002 of S. 2012 be included in the \nfinal conference report on this energy package. Section 5002 of the \nSenate bill would permanently reauthorize the Land and Water \nConservation Fund and make other minor changes to the program.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 is based on a simple \nidea. If we are going to allow Big Oil to make huge profits from \ndrilling off our coasts, then a small percentage of those profits \nshould be set aside for parks and recreational opportunities onshore. \nThe oil and gas on the Outer Continental Shelf belongs to all our \nconstituents, so it is only right that all of our constituents should \nsee the same benefit when Big Oil develops these resources.\n  Fifty years later, the program has been a huge success. More than $36 \nbillion has accrued to the fund. Millions of acres have been conserved \nand projects have been funded in every State in the Union.\n  Meanwhile, the companies paying into the fund have become some of the \nmost profitable multinational conglomerates in human history. Over the \nsame five decades, States with large amounts of public land have \ndeveloped robust tourism and recreation economies, with job and \neconomic opportunities and a quality of life attractive enough to make \nthem among the fastest growing communities in the country.\n  By investing and expanding recreational opportunities, Congress gets \na significant return on its investment as outdoor recreation generates \n$646 billion in spending each year, supports 6.1 million jobs, and \n$39.9 billion in tax revenue.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund benefits people. It benefits the \nenvironment. It benefits companies and allows them to drill off our \nshores. It benefits the Federal budget. It benefits those mainly \nwestern States with lots of public land. It is a win-win-win.\n  Our colleagues in the Senate saw fit to include permanent \nreauthorization for LWCF in the Senate-passed energy bill, a bill which \nreceived overwhelming support, including most Republicans.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund is pretty popular here in the \nHouse as well. My legislation to permanently reauthorize the program, \nH.R. 1814, has 207 bipartisan cosponsors.\n  There is no doubt that many of the provisions in the House and Senate \nenergy bills are controversial. It is, frankly, difficult to see a path \ntoward a bipartisan conference report. In such a contentious conference \nsituation, a provision reauthorizing a program as widely popular as \nLWCF would play a constructive role in moving toward consensus.\n  Section 5002 from the Senate bill should be absolutely included in \nthe conference report.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in opposition to the motion. I appreciate that this is a \nnonbinding resolution, so I have to appreciate the fact that--\nhopefully, I think I will be one of the conferees--the instructions \ntell me to do what I already can do.\n  At this time, we are looking at a program that does not necessarily \nfit with the goal of the rest of the bill. Look, everything that we are \ndoing in this entire bill that we just passed was to support House-\nendorsed programs. This now asks us to do something that has never been \nendorsed by the House. In fact, it is quite the opposite.\n  So, when the Land and Water Conservation Fund was first established \nback in 1965, the goal was that 60 percent of all the revenue that is \ngenerated would go to local governments to build what they call the \nstate assistance grant program. That program is widely popular. In \nfact, unfortunately, most people think that that 60 percent, as \noriginally intended, is the entire Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  The sad part is that, over the years, that 60 percent has dwindled \naway and is no longer a statutory mandate. It dwindled down to like 16 \npercent of all that money was going to those stateside widely popular \nprograms to help local governments come up with recreation \nopportunities for their citizens. That part that everyone supports had \ndwindled from 60 down to 16 percent. The rest of the money went for the \nFederal Government to acquire more property.\n  Now, if you think about this rationally for a second, we are putting \nmore money into the Federal Government to acquire more property when \nthe Federal Government already has a $20 billion backlog in the \nmaintenance of what we already have. Park Service alone has a $12 \nbillion backlog in the maintenance of the programs we already have.\n  So what we are basically trying to do in this motion to instruct is \nto tell us to go in there and fight for money to go to a program to get \nmore land when we can't actually manage what we want.\n  If the program was to go and say it would be mandatory for local \ngovernments to be able to pick and choose their recreation opportunity, \nthen you have got something that makes sense, but that is not what the \nSenate has tried to do in their appropriations.\n  Now, last December, the House did vote on this issue when it \nreauthorized the Land and Water Conservation Fund for 3 more years. But \nwhat they did in that process is do, at least, the first step of the \nreform by saying, if you are going to do it for 3 more years, at least, \nat least as a minimum 50 percent has to go to the States, and then you \ncan spend the other 50 percent for this quixotic effort to control all \nthe land in America. But at least do that. Now, unfortunately, that, at \nleast, is a reform to make the process better.\n  But this motion to instruct would tell us to even go back from that \nand would not even put that modest type of reform into the program. At \nthe minimum, that should be the way. It should not be a process where \nwe try and walk back from what we have already done. It should not be a \nprocess where we forget what the original intent of this program is. It \nshould not be a process in which we add to the Federal estate when we \ncan't manage what we already have. It should not be a process that \nbasically has been abused from the intent of 1965.\n  So, with that, I appreciate the offer to instruct me to do what I can \nalready do. I appreciate that this is still nonbinding. It is a nice \nconcept, nice spirit. There is a better way. We did a better way \nbefore. We can come up with a better way now.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. Let's move this stuff along as \nquickly as we can. I already said what we are supposed to do.\n  If we are really serious about these instructions, let's do an \ninstruction that actually moves us forward. I know that they are still \njust simply nonbinding issues. It is kind of cute, but it doesn't move \nthe body forward and it certainly does not support House-backed \npositions.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Some of the claims that the Land and Water Conservation Fund is some \nkind of a slush fund are completely false. All LWCF expenditures are \napproved by Congress through the appropriations process. The proposed \nland acquisitions are developed over many years after a public land \nmanagement\n\n[[Page H3220]]\n\nplanning process. This is a far more responsible and transparent \nprocess than many Federal expenditures, and it is opposite of a slush \nfund.\n  The allegation that the Land and Water Conservation Fund has drifted \nfrom its original intent is also false. The purpose of the program is \nto provide balance. As we allow oil companies to reap massive profits \nfrom Federal oil reserves, we should set some of the revenue aside for \nconservation purposes, and that is still what LWCF does today.\n  Funding for State matching grants has fluctuated over the years, but \nthat is not a drift. That is the result of previous Congress' \nappropriations decisions, many of which were made during Republican \nCongresses.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  The truth is, LWCF is under attack precisely because for 50 years it \nhas not drifted from its conservation goals. We do not need to rob LWCF \nin order to pay the maintenance costs. Federal land management agencies \nhave maintenance backlogs because Congress refuses to give them the \nfunding they deserve and need. Any Member concerned about backlogged \nmaintenance should contact the Committee on Appropriations immediately \nand express support for an increase in maintenance budgets. You can do \nthis without gutting LWCF.\n  Finally, LWCF is not a Federal land grab. At least 40 percent of LWCF \nmoney goes to States in the form of matching grants. The Federal \nfunding is targeted at in-holdings, already surrounded by Federal land. \nAcquiring an in-holding does not increase the size of the Federal \nfootprint. Buying in-holdings can provide access to parcels that are \nclosed because there is no public access route. These purchases are \nfrom willing sellers. These are people who want to sell their land.\n  Those who oppose this motion to instruct or oppose LWCF are part of a \nlarger campaign to hand over all remaining open space to private \ndevelopment. Oil and gas companies, mining conglomerates, timber \ncompanies, real estate developers, and large scale agribusinesses would \nlove to get their hands on the open space in the West. Some in Congress \nwant to help them, and they see LWCF standing in the way because it \nconserves open space for public and not private use.\n  Congress should reauthorize and strengthen this program. We face more \nhabitat fragmentation, greater urban sprawl, and more severe climate \nchange than ever before. It is time to double down on the promise of \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund, not fold so developers can cash \nout.\n  The energy bill is the place to do that, and I urge the adoption of \nthe motion to instruct.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Culberson). Without objection, the \nprevious question is ordered on the motion to instruct.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to revoke funding previously awarded to or within the \n     State of North Carolina.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in full support of this \nvery critical amendment. The objective of this amendment is to prohibit \nthe President of the United States from restricting funds to go to \nNorth Carolina.\n  The President's emissaries have stated through the Department of \nTransportation, Department of Education, Department of Justice, \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, and, yes, through Valerie \nJarrett and through his press secretary, Josh Earnest, that funds \nshould not be dispensed to North Carolina until North Carolina is \ncoerced into complying with the legal beliefs of the President and his \npolitical views.\n  We believe that this is an egregious abuse of executive power and \nthat the State of North Carolina should not be required to comply with \nthe President's wishes. The President is not a monarch; he is not a \ndictator; he doesn't issue fiats. We are a constitutional divided \ngovernment.\n  This amendment I am offering today stops the President from bullying \nStates, stops the President from bullying North Carolina. What he seeks \nto do in North Carolina, he has sought to do around the country. He has \nsent letters to the Departments of Education in every State giving them \nguidelines. Already 11 States in the country have sued the Federal \nGovernment over the abuse of these egregious powers.\n  This is not a fight about a city ordinance with wording that was \npoorly edited or about a legislature. This is about a constitutional \ndivided government. To that end, I would submit to our colleagues in \nthe House of Representatives that it is critical that we address this \nand we rein in this President, who has time and again used his \nauthority and abused his power; that we must submit to the President \nand to the will of the people that we are a country of the people, by \nthe people, and for the people, and this is a constitutionally divided \ngovernment.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from North \nCarolina (Mr. Walker).\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of this amendment.\n\n[[Page H3221]]\n\nPresident Obama and his administration are threatening to remove \nFederal funding to North Carolina's educators, law enforcement, and \ncritical infrastructure as punishment for its passage of the Public \nFacilities Privacy & Security Act. This is despite the fact that this \nadministration's lawsuit against North Carolina is still pending and \nunresolved. Simply put, our courts have not yet found North Carolina in \nviolation of the law.\n  To punish or to threaten to punish North Carolina before our courts \nhave properly ruled on the case violates our Constitution. It is for \nour courts, not President Obama, to adjudicate whether someone has \nviolated the law.\n  Further, our Nation was founded on the strength of diverse values. \nDuring this time of heated rhetoric, we must focus on maintaining a \ncivil society where the government does not punish people for what they \nbelieve, but allows an open discourse to all where all are free to \nfollow their beliefs.\n  This is why this amendment is necessary--to protect North Carolinians \nfrom President Obama's executive overreach and maintain our \nconstitutional system.\n  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Chairman, I submit to my colleagues in the House \nof Representatives that now is the time that we must stand. We cannot \nallow the President of the United States to continue to bully. We must \nwait on the adjudication by this court action with the Department of \nJustice. We must wait and allow the people to decide and make these \ndeterminations through its constitutionally divided government.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I thank Mr. Simpson for his leadership on \nthis bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman will state her parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I would like to assure the Members that the \nfollowing amendment is the one that we are debating: ``None of the \nfunds made available by this act may be used to revoke funding \npreviously awarded to or within the State of North Carolina.''\n  Is this the amendment that the gentleman is offering?\n  The Acting CHAIR. Amendment No. 34, as printed in the Congressional \nRecord, is pending.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Okay. I thank the Chair so very much. In such case, I \nclaim the time in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment which ties the hands of several departments--certainly the \nDepartment of Energy, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of \nReclamation, all of our independent agencies that are contained in the \nbill, like Denali and Northern Border--from making responsible \nfinancial decisions and basic oversight of Federal dollars going into \nNorth Carolina.\n  I find it interesting that my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle support this amendment, as they normally are such strong \nsupporters of fiscal responsibility and government accountability and \nfiscal oversight. Prohibiting the Federal Government from being able to \nwithhold or revoke funding in a particular State would abandon that \nprinciple.\n  How do we know that contractors are meeting their obligations? How do \nwe know that criminal activity is not occurring inside the State of \nNorth Carolina related to Federal expenditures in that State?\n  If this amendment were accepted, the Department of Energy, the Army \nCorps of Engineers--these are huge contracting departments--would be \nprohibited from conducting investigations of performance issues related \nto contracts or financial assistance awards. The departments could not \nterminate financial assistance agreements for material noncompliance.\n  I don't think that the gentleman wishes to promote irresponsibility, \nbut I think that is what his amendment actually does. If an award \nwinner wanted to terminate their relationship with one of the \ndepartments or agencies under our bill for whatever reason, the Federal \nGovernment could not accept that termination. This throws a wrench into \nevery Federal project inside of your State. I don't think the gentleman \nreally wants to do that.\n  If an organization which receives funding, for example, from the \nDepartment of Energy commits fraud, the Department of Energy has no \nrecourse. They can't report on the performance of the organization \nbecause it could prevent them from winning future awards.\n  I can think of no greater irresponsible or unjust system than \nbuilding on restrictions that deny the American people a proper \nfunctioning oversight by the Federal Government, including the \nliterally billions of dollars that go into the State of North Carolina. \nThose don't only come from our committee or our subcommittee, but they \nare significant.\n  I must oppose this amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson).\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I actually support this amendment, and I don't think it was as \ndrastic as was just characterized by the ranking member. The fact is \nyou can still have oversight; you can still do what is necessary to \nmake sure that contractors at various sites are doing their job; it \ndoesn't mean that you just have to pay them no matter what.\n  The reality is that this administration, as we all know, is using its \npen and phone to execute executive orders, and they are punishing the \nState of North Carolina because they don't like something that North \nCarolina did. It is in a court. And the Federal Government should not \nhave the ability to come in and prejudge the outcome of that \ndetermination by the court by withholding funds from the State of North \nCarolina simply because it doesn't like what North Carolina did.\n  So this is a good amendment, and I compliment the gentleman for \nbringing it forward.\n  We have got numerous provisions in this bill to stop the \nadministration and their efforts to impose policies without regard to \ncurrent law or the support of the Congress. I compliment the gentleman.\n  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Chairman, I submit this is a good amendment. I do \nbelieve that what we do with this amendment is prevent the egregious \nabuse of power by our President and allow the adjudication of this \nprocess to be completed by the Justice Department.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Loudermilk). The gentleman will avoid \ninappropriate references to the President.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining, \nplease?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I hate to disagree with the chairman of our \nsubcommittee. But let me just say that the amendment actually reads: \n``None of the funds made available by this act may be used to revoke \nfunding previously awarded.''\n  ``None of the funds.'' That means there can be no oversight. If \ncriminal activity is occurring, none of the funds may be used to revoke \nfunding previously awarded.\n  What kind of an amendment is this? This is a very irresponsible \namendment, and it shouldn't be on this bill. If the gentleman has got \nsome problem down there he wants to solve, we will be happy to work \nwith him on that on. But I think to tie the hands of our government in \nmaking sure that every taxpayer dollar is properly managed and has \noversight is really wrongheaded.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Pittenger \namendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n\n[[Page H3222]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North \nCarolina will be postponed.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Garamendi\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Bureau of Reclamation to issue a permit for \n     California WaterFix or, with respect to California WaterFix, \n     to provide for compliance under section 102 of the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332) or section \n     7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1536).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  About an hour ago, this House of Representatives kicked off a new \nquarter in the ongoing California water war. This House passed a piece \nof legislation that will ultimately gut the Endangered Species Act; the \nClean Water Act; the biological opinions protecting salmon and smelt; \nthe health of the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western \nHemisphere, the San Francisco Bay; and salmon up and down the Pacific \nCoast.\n  This amendment is designed to stop the ultimate threat to the \nCalifornia Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and San Francisco Bay. The \nultimate threat is the twin tunnels that are being proposed by the \nBrown administration, tunnels that are sized at 15,000-cubic-feet-per-\nsecond capacity, tunnels that have the capability to take half or take \nall of the water out of the Sacramento River.\n  Six months of the year, the Sacramento River flows somewhere between \n12,000 and 18,000 cubic feet per second. These tunnels, if ever built, \nwill be capable of literally sucking the Sacramento River dry and \ndestroying the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western \nHemisphere.\n  This amendment is designed to protect the delta by denying the State \nof California the opportunity to use the Federal Government to build \nsuch a destructive system. We don't need that system.\n  There are solutions to the delta problem. There are solutions that \nare capable of addressing the water issues of California. They have \nbeen proposed for many, many years. But this particular proposal that \nhas been on the books for, now, nearly half a decade is the ultimate \nvampire ditch that will suck the Sacramento River dry and destroy the \nlargest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere. It is not \nneeded. It is, at a minimum, a $15 billion boondoggle that will not \ncreate 1 gallon of new water. It will only destroy. It will be the \nultimate death.\n  Some day, what was proved here in the House of Representatives not \nmore than an hour ago, some day the votes will be there both in the \nHouse of Representatives and in the Senate and a bill will be sent to \nthe President that will not be able to be vetoed. We will see the death \nof the largest estuary, the most important estuary on the West Coast of \nthe Western Hemisphere from Alaska to Chile. There is no other place \nlike this.\n  The solutions are known. They have been proposed. They have been out \nthere. Build the infrastructure.\n  I have introduced a bill that would provide the Federal Government to \nwork with the State government, in proposition 1 at the State level, to \nbring into harmony reservoirs, underground aquifers, conservation, \nrecycling, desalinization, community water supplies.\n  It is in the legislation. It is available to us today. All of that, \nwithout destroying the delta and also operating it in such a manner \nthat we let science determine what to do--not legislation, not \nlegislation here, not the desire of the Governor of California, but, \nrather, science.\n  Where are the fish? Are they going to be harmed? Ramp the pumps down. \nIf they are not going to be harmed, then turn the pumps on--very \nsimple. But the solution that passed the House today doesn't do that. \nOh, it gives some bypassing words to the Endangered Species Act, to the \nbiological opinions. But, in reality, what it does, it says turn the \ndam pumps on anyway. Let them rip. Let them destroy the delta.\n  This bill speaks to the second threat to the delta--not the \nlegislation that was passed today, but the issue that is before the \nCalifornia voters in November, the issue that is before the California \nLegislature and others today--and that issue is: Should the tunnels be \nbuilt?\n  The tunnels must never be built. They must never be built because \nthey are the ultimate existential threat to the delta. With their size, \n15,000 cubic feet per second, they are perfectly capable of taking all \nof the water out of the Sacramento River half of the year. Don't ever \nbuild something that is so destructive.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chairman, I really wish on this floor that there was \na requirement that we had to tell the whole truth and nothing but the \ntruth.\n  Mr. Chairman, the amendment that is being offered here, there is a \nhuge exaggeration that is going on now. There were periods this past \nyear alone, just in the last few months, that there were 150,000 cubic \nfeet per second flowing through that delta.\n  Now, these tunnels, I do not believe are the ultimate solution for \nthe delta and for the valley, but I do believe that taking more options \noff the table and an option that, actually, the Governor of \nCalifornia--a close friend of the person that offered this amendment--\ndoes support, and making sure that we have an honest debate as we go \nforward to solve the problems of the delta, that we have to have all \noptions on the table.\n  I have looked for every opportunity to have an honest dialogue across \nthe aisle. We have had those conversations. Those who were in the room \nwith us walked away and told the press they never existed or were never \na part of them. Now they are coming back and asking for those same \nprivate conversations again, and we are not going to play that game \nanymore. We want to make sure we have an honest dialogue.\n  In conference, as this bill moves forward and as long as language is \nthere, we have the opportunity to have that dialogue and keep those \noptions on the table that the Governor of California actually supports. \nAnybody who supports this amendment is actually closing more \nopportunities for us to have that open dialogue, so I rise in \nopposition to this.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Calvert), the chairman.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, here we go. This last winter, as the \ngentleman pointed out, actually upwards of 200,000 cubic feet per \nsecond were moving through the delta. On days like that, we were \npumping 2,300 cubic feet per second at the pumps.\n  Now, the Governor believes--and many believe--that the solution, \nbecause they were afraid it was going to reverse flow, the delta, when \n200,000 cubic feet are moving through the delta, is to build these \ntunnels. And now, if these tunnels are built, we are saying we are \ngoing to suck dry the Sacramento River. Come on. That couldn't happen. \nWe can't even pump up to the biological opinion.\n  We are not talking about eviscerating the Endangered Species Act. We \nare talking about pumping water up to the biological opinion of 5,000 \ncubic feet per second. We all know that those pumps are capable of \npumping up to 11,000 cubic feet per second. They couldn't even pump \n15,000 cubic feet per second, because they can only go up to 11,000 \ncubic feet.\n  Saying that, this is a solution that is on the table. It has been \nthought out. It costs a lot of money. I know there are some questions \nthat have to be answered. But the solution that the gentleman keeps \nbringing up is a solution that nobody can agree to.\n  So we are doing the best we can in the majority to make sure that we\n\n[[Page H3223]]\n\nhave water for the people in the Central Valley--and, by the way, for \nsouthern California, where our economy is suffering because of this; \ncertainly, the Central Valley is suffering because of this--and to come \nup with solutions that can work.\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chairman, again, I have to rise in opposition to \nthis. I think we have to have an open dialogue on water legislation \ngoing forward, and it obviously needs to be transparent and open for \nthe world to see.\n  We have tried working quietly with some folks and, obviously, that \ndidn't produce anything. This is the next best option: having that \noption to have an open dialogue with all options on the table. We \nalready have the option that is being performed today, where my \ndistrict is suffering, unemployment is through the roof, and people are \ntruly suffering, and that needs to be fixed.\n  We are asking for a simple solution to this. Legislation has been \nintroduced. It has been part of a couple pieces of legislation now. I \nthink it is a very reasonable request, and I strongly recommend a \n``no'' on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to prepare, propose, or promulgate any regulation or \n     guidance that references or relies on the analysis contained \n     in--\n       (1) ``Technical Support Document: Social Cost of Carbon for \n     Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive Order 12866'', \n     published by the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of \n     Carbon, United States Government, in February 2010;\n       (2) ``Technical Support Document: Technical Update of the \n     Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Under \n     Executive Order 12866'', published by the Interagency Working \n     Group on Social Cost of Carbon, United States Government, in \n     May 2013 and revised in November 2013; or\n       (3) ``Revised Draft Guidance for Federal Departments and \n     Agencies on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the \n     Effects of Climate Change in NEPA Reviews'', published by the \n     Council on Environmental Quality on December 24, 2014 (79 \n     Fed. Reg. 77801).\n\n  Mr. GOSAR (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the amendment be considered as read.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Arizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense \namendment that will protect American jobs and our economy by \nprohibiting funds from being used to implement the Obama \nadministration's flawed social cost of carbon valuation.\n  This job killing and unlawful guidance sneakily attempts to pave the \nway for cap-and-trade-like mandates. Congress and the American people \nhave repeatedly rejected cap-and-trade proposals.\n  Knowing that he can't lawfully enact a carbon tax plan, President \nObama is attempting to circumvent Congress by playing loose and fast \nwith the Clean Air Act and unilaterally implementing this unlawful new \nrequirement under the guise of guidance.\n  The committee was wise to raise concern about the administration's \nabuse of the social cost of carbon valuation in the report. My \namendment explicitly prohibits funds from being used to implement this \ndeeply flawed guidance in the bill text.\n  The House voted in favor of similar measures to reject the social \ncost of carbon four times last Congress and multiple times over the \npast couple of years.\n  Roger Martella, a self-described, lifelong environmentalist and \ncareer environmental lawyer, testified at the May 2015 House Natural \nResources Committee hearing on the revised guidance and the flaws \nassociated with the social cost of carbon model, stating that the \nsocial cost of carbon estimates suffer from a number of significant \nflaws that should exclude them from the NEPA process.\n  Among these flaws are:\n  One: The projected costs of carbon emissions can be manipulated by \nchanging key parameters, such as timeframes, discount rates, and other \nvalues that have no relation to a given project undergoing review.\n  Two: OMB and other Federal agencies developed the draft social cost \nof carbon estimates without any known peer review or opportunity for \npublic comment during the developmental process.\n  Three: OMB's draft social cost of carbon estimates are based \nprimarily on global rather than domestic costs and benefits.\n  Four: There is still considerable uncertainty in many of the \nassumptions and data elements used to create the draft social cost of \ncarbon estimates, such as the damage functions and the modeled time \nhorizons.\n  Mr. Martella's testimony was spot on. Congress, not Washington \nbureaucrats, at the behest of the President should dictate our \ncountry's climate change policy.\n  The sweeping changes that the White House is utilizing did not go \nthrough the normal regulatory process, and there was no public comment.\n  Unfortunately, this administration just doesn't get it and continues \nto try to circumvent Congress to impose an extremist environmental \nagenda that is not based on the best available science.\n  Worse yet, the model utilized to predict the social cost of carbon \ncan be easily manipulated to arrive at the desired outcome.\n  For instance, the administration recently attempted to justify the \nEPA's methane rule using the social cost of carbon. Using this flawed \nmetric, they claim that the EPA's methane rule will yield climate \nbenefits of $690 million in 2025 and that those benefits will outweigh \nthe $530 million that the rule will cost businesses and job creators \nthat year alone.\n  Clearly, the social cost of carbon is the administration's latest \nunconstitutional tool to deceive the American people and to enact job-\nkilling regulations.\n  The House voted in favor of similar measures to reject the social \ncost of carbon four times last Congress and multiple times over the \nlast couple of years.\n  This amendment is supported by the Americans for Limited Government, \nAmericans for Tax Reform, Arch Coal, the Council for Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste, FreedomWorks, the National Taxpayers Union, the \nTaxpayers Protection Alliance, and the Gila County Cattle Growers \nAssociation.\n  I ask that all Members join me once again in rejecting this flawed \nproposal and in protecting job rights here in America.\n  I commend the chairman and the committee for their efforts on this \nlegislation and for recognizing that the NEPA process is in desperate \nneed of reform.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition to \nthis amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman and Members, this amendment tells the \nDepartment of Energy to ignore the latest climate change science. Even \nworse, the amendment denies that carbon pollution is harmful.\n  According to this amendment, the cost of carbon pollution is zero. \nThat is science denial at its worst, and, frankly, it is just simply \nwrong.\n  Tell homeowners in Arizona or those who live up in Canada, where the \nwildfires have just raged and who have seen their homes ravaged by \ndrought-stoked wildfires, that there are no costs from climate change.\n  If you are a gardener, like I am, even the backs of seed packets have \nchanged, because what used to be a\n\n[[Page H3224]]\n\nTennessee tomato, now we grow it in Ohio. The climate zones are moving \nnorth. It is getting warmer.\n  Tell that to the firefighters who have to put everything else on the \nline to fight those fires that rage in California and points west or \nnorth.\n  Tell that to the children and the elderly that will be plagued by \nheat stress and vulnerable to increased disease.\n  Tell that to the people evacuated from the Isle de Jean Charles in \nLouisiana who will lose homes as their island vanishes under the rising \nsea.\n  Or how about Houston, Texas, with the flash flooding? That is one of \nthe most recent.\n  These people are looking to us to protect America and to protect \nthem, and they are looking to the Republicans to finally be reasonable.\n  The truth is that no one will escape the effects of unmitigated \nclimate change. It will have an impact on all of us, and, frankly, it \nis having an impact on all of us.\n  But this amendment waves a magic wand and decrees that climate change \nimposes no costs at all. House Republicans can vote for this amendment. \nThey can try to block the Department from recognizing the damage caused \nby climate change and the potential damage, but they cannot overturn \nthe laws of nature. They are powerful.\n  We should be heeding the warnings of the climate scientists, not \ndenying reality. Thank God we have them. We don't have to operate in \nignorance.\n  Recently, our Nation's leading climate scientists released the \nNational Climate Assessment, which continues to show evidence \nconfirming the ongoing impacts of climate change.\n  Leading scientists around the world, not just here, agree the \nevidence is unambiguous. This amendment tells the Department to ignore \nsome of the wisest people in the world.\n  The latest science shows that climate change is expected to \nexacerbate heat waves--those have been felt around the country--\ndroughts--look at Lake Mead in Las Vegas. Look at the rings going down.\n  Look at millions and millions of acres now enduring wildfires. Look \nat the added floods, water- and vector-borne diseases, which will be \ngreater risks to human health and lives around the world.\n  The security of our food supply will diminish, resulting in \nreductions in production and increases in prices.\n  According to a leading climate science body, the IPCC, increasing \nglobal temperatures and drastic changes in water availability, which we \nhave just heard about on this floor, in California, for heaven's sake, \ncombined with an increase in food demand poses large risks to food \nsecurity globally and regionally.\n  When I was born, there were 146 million people in this country. By \n2050, we will have 500 million. It takes more animals, it takes more \nmachines, it takes more energy, to feed that population, and it takes \nmuch more to feed the global population.\n  Human beings and our way of life do have an impact on what happens on \nthis very, very suspended planet in the Milky Way galaxy.\n  This amendment tells the Department to ignore these and many other \nimpacts, and, frankly, I view that as irresponsible.\n  Federal agencies have a responsibility to calculate the costs of \nclimate change and take them into account. It is plain common sense, \nand it is a life-and-death matter.\n  That is exactly what the Obama administration is doing. An \ninteragency task force worked over the course of several years to \nestimate the costs of the harm from carbon pollution.\n  The cost calculation was first issued in 2010 and updated in 2014 and \ncontinues to be refined by incorporating new scientific and technical \ninformation and soliciting input from leading experts.\n  This was a very constructive calculation and a conservative one at \nthat, with the full costs of climate change almost certainly being \nhigher. But it is better than the previous estimate and much, much \nbetter than assuming the costs are nothing.\n  Unfortunately, that is what this amendment would require the \ngovernment to assume: zero harm, zero costs, zero danger, from carbon \npollution and climate change.\n  The truth is that unchecked climate change would have a catastrophic \neconomic and human impact here and across the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, if I could inquire from the Chair how much \ntime I have.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, the Earth's climate has been changing since \nthe beginning of time, and that is something on which I think we can \nall agree.\n  MIT researchers have looked at a massive extinction some 252 million \nyears ago as a result of a massive buildup of carbon dioxide. Funny, \nman wasn't around.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service estimates that the \nadministration squandered $77 billion, with a B, between fiscal year \n2008 and fiscal year 2013 in trying to study all this.\n  Now, if the President, the emperor himself, would like to bypass \nCongress, that is fine. But Congress has a fiduciary duty and a \nresponsibility legislatively to actually pass something that the agency \nshould enforce.\n  We talked about wildfires. Well, there we go again. It has been \nmismanagement of our forests that have created these catastrophic \nwildfires. Take it from somebody in Arizona who should know.\n  So I ask all of my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 29 Offered by Mr. Garamendi\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I have amendment No. 29 at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. (a) For an additional amount for ``Bureau of \n     Reclamation--Water and Related Resources'' for an additional \n     amount for WaterSMART programs, as authorized by subtitle F \n     of title IX of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 \n     (42 U.S.C. ch. 109B), section 6002 of such Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1015a), title XVI of the Reclamation Projects Authorization \n     and Adjustment Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 390h et seq.), and the \n     Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act (43 U.S.C. \n     ch. 40), there is hereby appropriated, and the amount \n     otherwise made available by this Act for ``National Nuclear \n     Security Administration--Weapons Activities'' is hereby \n     reduced by, $100,000,000.\n       (b) None of the funds made available by this Act for \n     ``National Nuclear Security Administration--Weapons \n     Activities'' in excess of $120,253,000 may be used for the \n     W80-4 Life Extension Program.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I believe this is known as amendment \n116.\n  I think most of us should be aware that we are well into the first \nquarter of a new nuclear arms race this time with not only Russia, but \nwith China. And perhaps there are some others out there that would like \nto build nuclear weapons and armaments.\n  This amendment goes directly to one of the critical parts of that \narms race, which is the development of what is essentially a new \nnuclear bomb. Some would like to say it is simply a refurbishment of an \nolder weapon, and I guess you can get away with that if you stretch the \nwords a bit.\n  But this is the W80-4 nuclear bomb. It is the warhead that will go on \nthe new cruise missile, sometimes called the LSRO. It is a very \nexpensive proposition.\n  This particular budget calls for $240 million to be spent this year \non the\n\n[[Page H3225]]\n\nearly stages of the refurbishment. We are probably looking at twice \nthat level of funding over the next decade to develop a few hundred of \nthese weapons or these bombs.\n  We need to wake up. We need to be paying attention to this trillion-\ndollar enterprise. Over the next 25 years, we will be spending $1 \ntrillion on a new nuclear arms race.\n  To what effect? Well, some would say that what we have is old and we \nought to have something that is new. Well, what is old actually \ncontinues to work for many, many years.\n  So it is not just the nuclear bombs that will be refurbished or \nrebuilt or life-extended or whatever words you want to use, but they \nare new and are extraordinary expensive and, obviously, extraordinarily \ndangerous.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  We are going to develop an entire new array of delivery systems. \nDiscussed on the House floor not so long ago in debate was the question \nof whether we ought to have new intercontinental ballistic missiles in \nthe silos in the upper Midwest. It was an interesting debate. The \nresult of the debate was, well, we ought to build new ICBMs for those \nsilos without paying too much attention to the cost, and we ought to \nhave a whole new array of nuclear-armed submarines, a new Stealth \nBomber, and a new cruise missile.\n  So what are we talking about here? A trillion dollars. At the same \ntime, we debate on the floor whether we have any money for Zika. \nApparently, we don't; although that is a real threat, and it is real \ntoday. We talk about our community water systems, and we don't have any \nmoney for those either. I will tell you where the money is. It is in \nthis nuclear arms race.\n  It is not about disarmament. Nobody is suggesting that. It is about \nare we going to spend all this money and perpetuate what is already \nunderway without giving thought to the impact it is going to have on \nthe things that we know we must do--educate our children, provide the \ninfrastructure for our communities, our water, our sanitation systems, \nand our transportation systems--or are we going to go about building \nnew nuclear bombs.\n  Apparently, that is what we are going to do because there is $240 \nmillion right here, money that we didn't have available for Zika, money \nthat we don't have for the water systems of Flint, Michigan, or our own \nState of California. But it is here.\n  The W80--keep that number in mind, ladies and gentlemen. You are \ngoing to see that coming back before you as we appropriate more and \nmore dollars for not only this new nuclear bomb, but for many others.\n  So I draw your attention to this issue. I ask that we move about $100 \nmillion of this money out of this nuclear bomb that we really don't \nneed for another decade. We don't need it tomorrow. We may never need \nit. It won't be on any piece of equipment for at least a decade. So why \ndon't we spend this money on our communities? Why don't we spend it on \nFlint, Michigan? Why don't we spend it on the communities in Central \nValley, California, that we have heard so much about?\n  There are communities that don't have water systems, communities in \nthe San Joaquin Valley that we heard so much about just a moment ago \nwhere the children have to take their water out of a horse water \ntrough, not out of a tap.\n  No, we are going to spend our money building a new nuclear bomb. I \nthink that is wrong. I think it is not necessary. In fact, I know it is \nnot necessary. But that is what we are going to do.\n  So I ask you to make a choice, to make a choice to spend our money on \nwhat we need today: clean water systems, transportation, and education, \nnot on a new nuclear bomb.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I respect the gentleman's comments, and I \nrespect the gentleman.\n  He mentioned many of the functions that are necessary for the \ngovernment that we should be doing. The one he didn't mention was \ndefending the security of the United States. That is one of the \nfundamental purposes of the Federal Government.\n  What this amendment would do is take money out of the program to \ncontinue the life extension program of the W80 warhead, the only cruise \nmissile in the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The gentleman says we don't need \nit now, so let's spend the money somewhere else; and if we need it next \nyear, I guess we can just spend the money next year.\n  But you can't develop this, and you don't do these life-extension \nprograms in just a year. These are long-term investments. The life \nextension program will replace the nonnuclear and other components to \nsupport the Air Force's plan to develop the long-range standoff cruise \nmissile, or the LRSO. If the gentleman believes the LRSO is not \nnecessary, I would point him at the Air Force, whose leadership has \ntestified on numerous occasions before Congress that we need to sustain \nour nuclear capabilities and we need to make these investments.\n  We must do the work that is needed to extend the life of this warhead \nas long as there is a clear defense requirement for maintaining a \nnuclear cruise missile capability. While the LRSO is still at an early \nstage of development, these warheads are very complex, and there is a \nconsiderable amount of work to accomplish between now and then. \nPerforming development work earlier in the schedule will allow the NNSA \nto reduce technical risks and limit any cost growth by validating the \nmilitary requirements at an early stage.\n  The gentleman's amendment will not stop the program but would only \nadd additional risks into the schedule and raise the cost for \nmodernizing the warhead down the line.\n  I should point out also that the gentleman's amendment also proposes \nto move defense funding to nondefense without any regard to the \nfirewalls negotiated in previous budget deals.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to vote against this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, Gosar 221.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used for the Department of Energy's Climate Model \n     Development and Validation program.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to save \ntaxpayer money, help the Department of Energy avoid duplicative \nprograms, and ensure the agency's limited resources are focused on \nprograms directly related to its mission to ensure energy security for \nthe United States.\n  This simple amendment would prohibit the use of funds for the Climate \nModel Development and Validation program within the Department of \nEnergy. This exact same amendment passed this body in fiscal year 2015 \nand 2016.\n  This year, this amendment is even more important because, despite \nthis amendment getting approval from this body multiple years in a row \nand being denied funding from the bipartisan Appropriations Committee \nmultiple years in a row, the President was given access to about half \nof what he requested previously to create this new duplicitous and \nwasteful program.\n  With our Nation more than $19 trillion in debt, the question must be \nasked: Why would Congress give millions of dollars to the President for \nnew computer-generated climate models? The administration is already \nmanipulating the social cost of carbon models to deceive the American \npeople and to enact job-killing regulations.\n  For example, the administration recently attempted to justify the \nEPA's methane rule using the social cost of carbon valuation model. \nUsing this flawed metric, they claimed that the EPA's methane rule will \nyield climate benefits of $690 million in 2025 and that those benefits \nwill outweigh the $530\n\n[[Page H3226]]\n\nmillion that the rule would cost businesses and job creators that year \nalone.\n  If funded, the Climate Model Development and Validation program will \nbe yet another addition to the President's ever-growing list of \nduplicative global warming, research, and modeling programs currently \nbeing hijacked by the EPA to manufacture alleged climate benefits and \nforce new regulations like the EPA's Clean Power Plan and WOTUS down \nthe throats of the American people. The nonpartisan Congressional \nResearch Service estimates this administration has already squandered \n$77 billion from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2013 studying and \ntrying to develop global climate change regulations.\n  This amendment is about fiscal responsibility and priorities. While \nresearch and modeling of the Earth's climate--including how and why \nEarth's climate is changing--can be of value, it is not central to the \ndepartment's mission and is already being done by dozens of government, \nacademic, business, and nonprofit organizations around the world. With \nmore than 50 universities and academic institutions around the globe \nengaged in climate modeling, this particular issue is being addressed \nvery well by the academic and nonprofit sector with much greater \nefficiency and speed than any government bureaucracy can offer. \nFurther, the research and models utilized by our universities are not \nbeing manipulated to impose a partisan agenda.\n  Regardless of your opinion on climate change, I feel strongly that \nthe House of Representatives must continue its firm position that we \nshould not be wasting precious taxpayer resources on programs that are \nduplicitous in nature and compete with programs funded by private \ninvestment.\n  The wastefulness of the Climate Model and Validation program has been \nrecognized by several outside spending and watchdog groups. This \namendment proposal has been supported in the past by the Council for \nCitizens Against Government Waste, the American Conservative Union, \nEagle Forum, and the Taxpayers Protection Alliance.\n  The House of Representatives has wisely declined to fund this program \nin fiscal years 2014, 2015, and 2016. Considering the extensive work \nbeing done to research, model, and forecast climate change trends by \nother areas in government, the private sector, and internationally, \nfunding for this specific piece of President Obama's climate agenda is \nnot only redundant, but inefficient. Considering the Nation's $19 \ntrillion in debt, it is also irresponsible\n  I thank the chairman, ranking member, and committee for their work.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, years ago, there were people that served in \nthis body that denied that America should pass a Clean Water Act. \nToday, in many places in our country when we turn on the tap, we trust \nwhat we drink. We had to change our way of life. Yes, we had to make \ninvestments, but we produced a stronger country.\n  There were those who fought against the Clean Air Act. You can go \nback and read the Record. There are always those folks who have \ndifficulty embracing the future.\n  This amendment blocks funding for the Department of Energy's Climate \nModel Development and Validation program. This is climate science \ndenial at its worst.\n  It used to be that people said, well, it is okay that industry dumps \nin the water. It kind of washes everything out somewhere. Well, when \nthe bald eagle became an endangered species, it became pretty clear \nthat all of that pollution was causing long-term damage. Now the \nworld's top scientists are telling us that we have a rapidly closing \nwindow to reduce our carbon pollution before the catastrophic impacts \nof climate change cannot be avoided.\n  So far, the world has already warmed by 0.9 degrees Celsius, and we \nare already seeing the effects of climate change. Most scientists agree \nthat 2 degrees Celsius is the maximum amount we can warm without really \ndangerous tipping points, although many scientists now believe that \neven 2 degrees is far too much, given the effects we are already \nexperiencing all around the world. But absent dramatic action, we are \non track to warm 4 to 6 degrees Celsius by midcentury. That is more \nthan 10 degrees Fahrenheit.\n  Even with the pledges to reduce carbon emissions as part of COP 21, \nwe are still in danger of experiencing the drastic consequences of \nclimate change, including increased frequency and intensity of extreme \nweather events and drought. The International Energy Agency has \nconcluded that increased efforts are still needed--in addition to \nexisting pledges--to stay within the 2-degree limit.\n  We are already seeing the devastation from climate change, including, \nrecently, the evacuation of climate refugees from the Isle de Jean \nCharles near New Orleans. So you sort of think to the world you knew \nversus the world of the future, and you have to embrace the future, and \nyou have to help those who are going to follow us.\n  There are multiple lines of evidence, including direct measurements, \nthat life is changing. The projections that these models anticipate are \ncritical as they provide the guideposts to understanding how quickly \nand how steeply the world needs to cut carbon pollution in order to \navoid the worst effects of climate change.\n  The goal of the Department of Energy's Climate Model Development and \nValidation program is to further improve the reliability of climate \nmodels and equip policymakers and citizens with tools to predict the \ncurrent and future effects of climate change, such as sea level rise, \nextreme weather events, and drought.\n  This amendment scraps this program. It says ``no'' to enhancing the \nreliability of our climate models. Who wouldn't want that? It says \n``no'' to investing in the security of the people of this Nation and \nthe Nation's assets themselves. It says ``no'' to improving our \nunderstanding of how the climate is changing, and it says ``no'' to \ninforming policymakers about the consequences of unmitigated climate \nchange. That is absolutely irresponsible and an outcome this Nation \ncannot afford.\n  It is interesting. There is an author, Richard Louv, who has written \na book, ``Last Child in the Woods.'' What it talks about is how America \nhas become so technologically sophisticated that most people have lost \na real connection to nature, especially our children, who spend 8 hours \nin front of a blue screen. But perhaps it is because of that \ntechnological advancement and lack of connection to nature that we do \nnot have a population--including, perhaps, some who serve in this \nChamber--that observe what nature is actually doing in her powerful \nforce.\n  I would urge our colleagues to read that book and to think a little \nbit about reconnecting to nature, paying attention to what the \ntemperature is of the lake near you or the ocean near you. Pay \nattention to what is happening in our coastal communities. Pay \nattention to what is happening in agriculture and our ability to \nproduce food for the future because of changes in weather.\n  What is happening with rainfall? There is a lot going on. What \nhappens to clouds in your region of the country? How close do they come \nto the Earth? When the rain falls, how severe are those weather events? \nThese events are happening around our country and around our world.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have to rise in opposition, obviously, to this \namendment and urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment because I don't \nthink it leads us into the future. I think it takes us back into the \npast, to a world that does not exist anymore.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, could I inquire how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not about making a \nstatement about climate change or the validity of science. This \namendment is about fiscal responsibility and efficiency.\n  More than 50 universities and institutions around the globe are \nengaged in\n\n[[Page H3227]]\n\nclimate modeling. This particular issue is being addressed very well by \nthe academic and nonprofit sector, with much greater efficiency and \nspeed than government bureaucracy can offer.\n  Can I remind you of the VA? The government doesn't do anything very \nwell at all, and we need to start looking at this.\n  When we talk about responsibility, $19 trillion in debt, there are \nsome apples that we need to start coming to look at. When we start \nlooking at institutions that are actually doing this, they are hardly \nsecond-tier institutions--the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, \nMIT for short; the University of California, Berkeley. There are some \nreally good people out there doing this work on our behalf.\n  When we start looking at efficacies and effectiveness, we need to \nlook no further than the private sector and the universities that are \nalready doing this. This is something we don't need to be duplicitous \nin and be partisan in our outcomes.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 24 Offered by Mr. Al Green of Texas\n\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  In addition to the amounts otherwise provided \n     under the heading ``Department of the Army--Corps of \n     Engineers-Civil--Construction'', there is appropriated \n     $311,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, to remain available \n     through fiscal year 2026, for an additional amount for flood \n     control projects and storm damage reduction projects to save \n     lives and protect property in areas affected by flooding on \n     April 19th, 2016, that have received a major disaster \n     declaration pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster \n     Relief and Emergency Assistance Act: Provided, That such \n     amount is designated by the Congress as being for disaster \n     relief pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(D) of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman from Texas and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, as a preamble to my amendment, \nplease allow me to thank the chairman, Mr. Simpson, for his courtesies. \nI would also like to thank the ranking member, Ms. Kaptur, for her \ncourtesies.\n  Mr. Chairman, if you live in Houston, Texas, you monitor the weather. \nYou monitor the weather, Mr. Chairman, because, over the last year, \nHouston, Texas, has been declared a disaster area not once, but twice. \nIf you live in Houston, Texas, you monitor the weather because, in the \nlast year, we have spent billions in recovery damages. If you live in \nHouston, Texas, you monitor the weather because, in the last year, we \nhave lost 17 lives to flooding.\n  Houston has a problem. But there is a solution. This amendment--which \nis based upon H.R. 5025, an emergency supplemental bill--would accord \n$311 million that will eventually be spent. This is not money that will \nnot be spent in Houston, Texas, but money that will be spent on \nprojects that are already authorized. The projects are authorized. The \nmoney is going to be spent.\n  However, we can take a piecemeal approach and do some now, some \nlater, and spend billions more in recovery efforts, which is what we \nare doing. We are spending billions after floods when we could spend \nmillions before and save money, save lives, and give Houston, Texas, \nand the citizens therein some degree of comfort.\n  Mr. Chairman, I believe that my friends in this House have a great \ndeal of sympathy and a good deal of empathy for Houston, Texas, as is \nevidenced by the fact that over 70 Members have signed onto the bill, \nH.R. 5025. And we have bipartisan support. We have Republicans at the \ncommittee level who are doing what they can within the committee. We \nalso have Democrats who are working to try to help Houston, Texas.\n  So I am honored tonight to stand in the well of the House to make \nthis request, that Houston, Texas, be made a priority and that the \nCorps of Engineers, when they do assess the needs of the Nation, that \nHouston be given some degree of preference because money is being spent \nthat need not be spent.\n  But, more importantly, Mr. Chairman and Madam Ranking Member, lives \nare being lost. Houston, Texas, has what are captioned as flash floods. \nYou can find yourself in a circumstance from which you cannot extricate \nyourself, and you may lose your life when we have one of these \ninclement, adverse weather conditions.\n  They happen more often than prognosticated some years ago. It can be \ndebated as to whether we are having 100-year floods or 500-year floods. \nThat is debatable. But what is not debatable is the fact that we are \nhaving billion-dollar floods--billion-dollar floods--in Houston, Texas, \na major American city declared a disaster area not once, but twice in \nthe last year.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, on April 18th the City of Houston \nand Harris County, Texas were subjected to paralyzing flooding which \nclaimed the lives of seven of our citizens and required the rescue of \n1,200 more.\n  Approximately 2,000 housing units were flooded and we are currently \nworking to figure out where to house the folks who cannot return to \ntheir homes.\n  This is the second major flooding disaster Houston has experienced in \nthe last six months and the City is expecting additional rain and \nthunderstorms on Friday and Saturday of this week.\n  Residents in our congressional district as well as other Member's \ndistricts have been severely affected and we must do something to stop \nthe needless loss of life.\n  The President has recognized the significance of the catastrophe and \na fulfilled a request for a disaster declaration.\n  Now it's the job of Congress to help our constituents.\n  I have worked closely with my neighbor and friend, Rep. Al Green to \noffer this amendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill.\n  The amendment would provide $311 million dollars to the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers for the construction, and in most cases, completion \nof our bayous and flood control projects.\n  Flooding is not new in Houston but we've learned how to control it.\n  Our bayou system has saved countless lives and millions of dollars of \ndamage since creation.\n  Unfortunately, due to consistent budget pressure, the Army Corps of \nEngineers cannot adequately fund these projects.\n  This amendment would ensure that our federal, state, and local \nauthorities have the resources necessary to expedite the flood control \nprojects we know protect people and property.\n  Mr. Chair, we can help the victims in our neighborhoods and we must \nhelp them.\n  I urge this body to pass this emergency funding legislation and do so \nquickly.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I make a point of order against the amendment because it \nproposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an \nappropriation bill and, therefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The rule states in pertinent part: ``An amendment to a general \nappropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.''\n  The amendment includes an emergency designation and, as such, \nconstitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to be heard, if I \nmay.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized on the point of order.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Would Chairman Simpson allow me to give my \nclosing comments before we receive the ruling from the Chair, which \nwill be just a few seconds more, I believe?\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 1 minute remaining on \nthe amendment.\n\n[[Page H3228]]\n\n  Does the gentleman wish to be heard on the point of order?\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Well, yes, on the point of order, if so, in so \ndoing, I may speak to the flooding in Houston, Texas. I want to be \nappropriate as I do this, and I will yield to the wisdom of the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair will rule.\n  The Chair finds that this amendment includes an emergency \ndesignation.\n  The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of \nclause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The point of order is sustained, and the amendment is not in order.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the fine gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Al Green).\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Kaptur.\n  Please allow me to continue with just a brief commentary. I have a \ncolleague who is not here, the Honorable Gene Green. He has asked that \nhis statement with reference to this amendment be placed in the Record.\n  I would also add this. A good deal of my comments have emanated from, \nas I indicated, H.R. 5025.\n  This bill has bipartisan support. I see in the Chamber my good friend \nand colleague, the Honorable Ted Poe, who is one of the cosponsors of \nthe legislation.\n  Some of my other colleagues who are cosponsoring from Texas would \ninclude the Honorable John Culberson, the Honorable Randy Weber, the \nHonorable Sheila Jackson Lee, also the Honorable Gene Green whom I have \nmentioned. There are others as well.\n  This is bipartisan. This is a recognition that we are going to have \nproblems that we can solve that will create greater circumstances than \nwe should have to endure.\n  There is little reason for us to be back here a year or so from now \nindicating that we have had another flood, a billion-dollar flood--\nmaybe less, maybe more--and that we may have lost lives in that future \nevent.\n  My hope is that, while this amendment is not in order--and I accept \nthe ruling of the Chair--my hope is that we will find a means by which \nwe will do sooner that which we will do later, spend the $311 million \nafter we have had additional billion-dollar floods.\n  This amendment makes good sense. It is a commonsense solution.\n  I thank the ranking member for her very kind words and the \nopportunity that she has accorded me.\n  I thank you, Mr. Simpson, for being so generous as well.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I yield to the gentleman from Idaho.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's passion with \nthis and his obvious concern and interest. I will tell you that there \nis a great deal of support for what the gentleman is proposing.\n  Congressman Poe, Congressman Culberson, as well as Members on your \nside of the aisle, have talked to us repeatedly about the issues that \nyou address here.\n  While this amendment is out of order, I will promise to the gentleman \nthat we will work with him to try to address this problem of one of \nAmerica's great cities.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. As he \nknows, I believe his word is as good as gold.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Yoho\n\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Department of Energy to employ in excess of 95 \n     percent of the Department's total number of employees as of \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chair, my amendment is simply a commonsense measure to \nhelp reduce the size of out-of-control Federal departments that \ncontinue to grow annually unchecked, increasing both scope, size, and \nincreasing our spending, both discretionary and mandatory.\n  Our Nation is over $19 trillion in debt--let me repeat that--$19 \ntrillion in debt. This Chamber, us, we, the people, in government, or \nMembers of the people's House in charge of the taxpayers' purse \nstrings, must start taking action to actively reduce our expenditures.\n  I appreciate the chairman and ranking member for their hard work on \nthis bill. But I am concerned that the cost it will place on the \nAmerican people is too great. We can do better and we must do better.\n  This amendment is offered as a modest solution and establishes a 5 \npercent across-the-board cut to the Department of Energy's total \nemployees.\n  In the private sector, when scrambling to cover your costs, you have \nto make decisions, including sometimes the elimination of positions \nthat are not essential to the overall purpose and mission of the \norganization, or you simply can't afford it.\n  Not only is reducing the current size of the Department's full-time \nstaff essential, but I think it also should be accompanied by a 1-year \nhiring freeze.\n  In 2013, when the government was shut down--and I want to remind \npeople that the government shut down over money, and it wasn't from an \nexcess; it was from a lack of it--the Department of Energy was faced \nwith this very dilemma and made a decision to furlough 69 percent of \nits workforce. These workers were deemed nonessential.\n  I understand the circumstances were extraordinary, but the Department \nwas still able to target areas within it that were not deemed essential \nto maintaining its most necessary functions.\n  My amendment is only requiring the Department to reduce its full-time \nemployees by 5 percent, which in the scheme of things is nominal, but \nessential, in getting our country back on track fiscally, and it is the \nright thing to do.\n  For our Nation to remain prosperous and to keep the American Dream \nalive for generations to come, we must make these decisions now. We \nmust scale back Federal spending. One cannot have personal freedom \nwithout financial freedom.\n  That same philosophy also applies to nations if they wish to pass on \nto their future generations the blessings of our past and our current \nposterity, liberties, and freedoms.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Poe of Texas). The gentleman from Idaho is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I understand the desire for an efficient and \neffective Federal Government with an appropriately sized workforce. In \nfact, if the gentleman has specific programs or offices that he \nbelieves are currently overstaffed, I would be happy to work with him \nto see if that is the case and to figure out a way to address any \nproblems we may find; but this amendment doesn't look at specific \ndetails and make targeted reductions.\n  It requires the Department of Energy to furlough 5 percent of its \nemployees on October 1. It doesn't allow the Department time to review \nwhether it might need more people to carry out its national security \nresponsibilities, for instance, or fewer people to carry out other \nprograms whose work is ramping down or is being reduced by this bill. \nThat is not good government. That is putting almost 800 people across \nthe country out of work for no good reason.\n  The underlying bill, on the other hand, includes reasonable and \ntargeted reductions to funding levels for the Department's \nadministrative accounts. The departmental administration account was \n$36 million below the President's budget request in the bill that was \nbrought to the floor, and amendments already passed by the House have \nresulted in further cuts to the departmental administration. Federal\n\n[[Page H3229]]\n\nsalaries and expenses for the National Nuclear Security Administration \nare $30 million below the President's request. The funding levels in \nthis bill send a clear message about growth in the Federal workforce. \nRequiring an automatic 5 percent cut across the board is a step too \nfar. As I said, it is not good government.\n  For these reasons, I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues \nto vote against it.\n  I would also note that when the gentleman said that during the \ngovernment shutdown, it furloughed 60-some-odd percent of its \nemployees, remember, we are talking 16 days here, and these employees \nwere labeled as ``nonessential.'' The same thing happened in Congress. \nAt least I know in my office--and I would suspect in the gentleman's \noffice--we had to declare which employees were nonessential. Those \nemployees now work for me again and have been rehired. I would suspect \nthey have been in the gentleman's office, too. Just because they were \nfurloughed during a 16-day government shutdown doesn't mean they are, \nessentially, nonessential.\n  I don't think this is a well-thought-out amendment. I oppose it, and \nI urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chair, I join the chairman in opposing this amendment. It is, \ntruly, a blunt cut--5 percent to the Department of Energy from its \ncurrent level with no analysis, no consultation, no consideration of \nimpact. It is just a blunt cut. It would actually mean about 700 people \nwho would be fired at headquarters, at field offices, even at our Power \nMarketing Administrations across the West. Layoffs of this magnitude \nwould profoundly impede the Department of Energy's ability to oversee \nits nuclear security responsibilities, its science and energy and \nenvironmental cleanup mandates.\n  I strenuously oppose this amendment and urge the gentleman to bring \nback a more thoughtful amendment at some point if he wishes, but I \ndon't support the blunt cut.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the chairman and ranking member's \nopposition.\n  I would like to remind them that this amendment is a necessary step \nin reducing the size and scope of the Federal Government. We are \napproaching $20 trillion in debt. That approximates to about $60,000 \nfor every man, woman, and child in America. When we talked about \nnonessential employees, I didn't have any in my office. Everybody in my \noffice was essential, so we didn't lay anybody off. We didn't put them \noff.\n  The gentleman laughs, which is fine.\n  The executive departments and agencies have gradually taken on the \npersonification of the 1958 horror flick, ``The Blob.'' Departments \nlike the DOE are consuming everything in their path and increasing \ntheir own presence in the private sector.\n  At what point do we say enough is enough? At what point do we say we \nare going to get our spending under control?\n  This is a small, 5 percent incremental change to the Department of \nEnergy. It is not specific because it gives the flexibility to the \nDepartment to come up with the changes that it wants, keeping in mind \nthat our Federal Government's number one task is national security; so \nthe people who are tasked to run the Department of Energy can make the \ncommonsense and the needed reforms that they need to.\n  Again, in the private sector, you see the major companies changing \nand laying off people as they need to. Government continues to grow, \nand it adds not just to the discretionary spending, but also to the \nmandatory spending that goes into Social Security and retirement.\n  We have a responsibility to the American people and to future \ngenerations to fix the problems at hand instead of giving rhetoric and \nsaying: Well, it is not specific enough. We need to stand up and say: \nThe time is now. If we start now with small, incremental changes, we \ncan change the direction of our Nation's debt while we still have the \noption because the day will come when we will not have that option with \nour out-of-control spending.\n  I am telling my colleagues, if they really want to change the debt \nstructure in this country and get a handle on it, it is time we start \nnow and stop talking about it. I urge people to support this.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Foster\n\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Secretary of Energy for the Experimental \n     Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Illinois and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I offer an amendment on behalf of me and my colleague, Congressman \nScott Garrett, who is my Republican co-chair of the Payer State Caucus, \nwhich is a group of Members opposed to the massive transfer of wealth \nbetween one set of States to another.\n  This amendment is a very simple one that would prohibit any of the \nfunds in this bill from being used in the Experimental Program to \nStimulate Competitive Research, otherwise known as EPSCoR. EPSCoR was \nstarted in 1978 as an experimental program in the hopes of \nstrengthening research infrastructure in areas of the country that \nreceive less than their fair share, however defined.\n  As a scientist and as an American, I think this goal is commendable, \nbut the implementation of this program--and, in particular, the \nformulas used to earmark grants to a specific set of States--is absurd. \nThe ability to participate in EPSCoR opportunities is based solely on \nwhether or not a State has received less than 0.75 percent of the NSF \nresearch funding in the previous 3 years. Let me reiterate that. The \nDepartment of Energy's EPSCoR eligibility is determined by how much NSF \nresearch funding a given State has received in the previous 3 years.\n  There is no rational basis for earmarking a grant program in one area \nof spending based on the spending in another unrelated program. \nMoreover, because EPSCoR considers the funding on a per-State basis \nrather than on a per capita basis, it has devolved into just another \none of the many programs that steers money into States that already get \nfar more than their fair share of Federal spending.\n  EPSCoR is emblematic of a larger problem we have in this country. \nEvery year, hundreds of billions of dollars are transferred out of \nStates that pay far more in Federal taxes than they receive back in \nFederal spending--the payer States--and into States that receive a lot \nmore Federal spending than they pay back in taxes--the taker States. In \nthe case of Illinois, our economy loses $40 billion a year because we \npay far more in Federal taxes than we receive back in Federal spending. \nAs for my colleague from New Jersey, his State on a per capita basis \nhas it even worse. This alone is responsible for the fiscal stress in \nboth of our States.\n  This is an enormous and unjustifiable redistribution of wealth \nbetween the States. This amendment takes a first small step to begin \nrolling back these taker State preferences by eliminating one of the \nmany--but one of the most unjustifiable of them--the EPSCoR program.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague's passion for the \nOffice of Science. I am a strong supporter of the Office of Science and \nthe work that they do.\n  As the Nation's largest supporter of basic research in the physical \nsciences, the Office of Science directs important research funding to \nthe national laboratories and universities across this\n\n[[Page H3230]]\n\ncountry. The EPSCoR program extends this even further by supporting \nresearch in areas where there has historically been less Federal \nfunding.\n  The program has been successful in laying the foundation and in \nexpanding research programs in the basic sciences across the Nation. \nTaking away this funding puts existing grants and partnerships in \njeopardy at the many universities that receive EPSCoR grants. \nTherefore, I must oppose this amendment and urge other Members to do \nthe same.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from \nRhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).\n  Mr. CICILLINE. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, which would \neliminate funding for the Department of Energy's EPSCoR program.\n  For more than 40 years, the Department of Energy has provided \nacademic research funding to colleges and universities around the \nNation, and it has been critical to ongoing research that is essential \nto maintaining our competitive edge in energy advancement.\n  The DOE's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, \ncommonly known as EPSCoR, is a science-driven, merit-based program, \nwhose mission is to help balance the allocation of DOE and other \nFederal research and development funding to avoid an undue \nconcentration of money to only a few States.\n  This successful program has had a profound impact on my home State of \nRhode Island by allowing our academic institutions to increase research \ncapacity, to enrich the experiences of their students, and to \ncontribute to important advances in a variety of fields. Currently, 24 \nStates, including Rhode Island, and three jurisdictions account for \nonly about 6 percent of all DOE funding despite the fact that these \nStates account for 20 percent of the U.S. population. EPSCoR has helped \nto stabilize this imbalance in funding, and it should continue to do so \nin the 2017 fiscal year and beyond.\n  In order to ensure robust academic research and outcomes across the \ncountry, geographic diversity in funding should be considered to ensure \nthat we are taking advantage of the particular experiences, knowledge, \nand perspectives of academic institutions from every State. This \namendment to eliminate this successful program would be a step backward \nfor the United States' commitment to research and development. \nInvestments in critical programs, such as EPSCoR, are essential to \ncreating jobs, innovating for the future, and maintaining our \ncompetitive edge in scientific research and a global economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in strongly opposing this amendment.\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chair, I inquire as to how much time I have \nremaining.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chair, first off, I would like to emphasize that this \ndoes not take away funding from the Office of Science. It eliminates a \nvery poorly designed set-aside that is based on spending that is \ncompletely unrelated to the actual Office of Science.\n  If the goal of this program were to equalize the funding in the \nOffice of Science, then it should be based on the actual expenditures \nof the Office of Science so that States that are underrepresented there \nwould, presumably, be able to qualify for these. It does not do that. \nIf it were designed to equalize the spending between States that \nreceive a lot more Federal funding than those that don't, then you \nwould see a very different set of States in this.\n  Particularly the fact that it is not based on a per capita basis is \nthe fundamental flaw in this thing. If you look at those States, the \nsingle distinguishing characteristic is not that they are poor or rural \nor anything else; it is that they have small populations, which means \nthat they are overrepresented in the Senate.\n  One of the main mechanisms for transferring wealth out of large \nStates like New Jersey, like Illinois, like California, and a large \nnumber of other States into smaller States are spending formulas that \nhave, frankly, been cooked up in the Senate, where small States are \noverrepresented and the formulas steer large amounts of money into \nthem.\n  If this were based on a per capita basis, it would, at least, be \nrational. If the Office of Science's funding were based on actual \nexpenditures, at least in the Department of Energy, it would be \nrational. What we see are States receiving EPSCoR funds that get far \nmore than their share both in Federal funding and in Department of \nEnergy funding overall. A rational program would, first off, collect \nall research funding in all areas and base the set-asides on that. \nSecondly, it would do it on a per capita basis.\n  These are fundamental flaws, and at this point it is preferable to \njust eliminate the entire program and start over if people think it is \na useful thing.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's arguments. It \nsounds like we are back at the Constitutional Convention: Should we \nhave the legislative branch of government be represented by the \npopulation, or should it be represented by the States? I know. Let's \ncompromise. Let's have two bodies, one that represents the States with \nan equal number from each State, and one that represents the \npopulation. We will call one the House of Representatives, and we will \ncall one the Senate. That is how it works out.\n  We are one Nation, and we try to make sure that funds go to all \nStates. Some of them have a disadvantage just by the sheer size. And if \nyou look at Idaho, we are the 12th largest State, and, I suspect, \npopulationwise, we are down there substantially. Montana is probably \neven worse off than we are. So it is almost impossible for the \nuniversities and so forth to compete with some of the larger States.\n  So we can argue about whether the formulas are correct or absolutely \ncorrect or if they shouldn't be modified or anything else like that, \nand I am more than willing to do that, but to eliminate the program I \nthink is just an entire mistake.\n  I would urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mrs. Black\n\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 508.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of section 642(a) of the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n     (8 U.S.C. 1373(a)).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, sanctuary cities flaunt our laws and put \nour citizens at risk. We need only to look at the tragic 2015 murder of \nKate Steinle in San Francisco to see the grave danger of allowing \ncities to ignore the Federal immigration policy. We cannot allow this \nto stand. That is why I am introducing this amendment to the Energy and \nWater Development and Related Agencies Appropriations bill that would \nban funding to any State or city that refuses to comply with our \nimmigration laws.\n  Mr. Chair, I recognize that some of my colleagues may say that an \namendment like this is better suited on the Homeland Security or the \nCommerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill; and, indeed, I joined \nmy colleague, Congressman Gosar, on a letter to the subcommittees \nasking that similar language be attached to their bills as well. But \nthe truth is, Mr. Chairman, amnesty for lawbreakers impacts every \naspect of our society: our jobs, our security, and, in the case of Ms. \nSteinle, a young innocent woman's life.\n\n[[Page H3231]]\n\n  I believe the crisis of sanctuary cities demands a multipronged \nresponse, and this amendment can be a piece of that effort. If cities \nchoose to put their citizens at risk in defiance of Federal law--yes, \nin defiance of Federal law--there is no reason to continue spending \nFederal money on their energy and water projects. It is really that \nsimple.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a vote for your constituents and support \nthis commonsense amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, the Black amendment would prohibit financial \nassistance to any State or political subdivision that is acting in \ncontravention of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act. But this is an energy and water bill. This isn't a \npart of our bill.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment because it is, frankly, \nnongermane. The Department of Energy isn't involved. The Army Corps of \nEngineers or the Bureau of Reclamation or the regional independent \nagencies that are under the jurisdiction of this bill have nothing to \ndo with the concern that the gentlewoman raises.\n  Why are we debating immigration policy on an Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill? It doesn't make any sense.\n  Frankly, the amendment would prohibit funding for State and local \ngovernments that have policies against the sharing of information \nrelated to immigration status, but State and local law enforcement \nroutinely and automatically share biometric information with ICE that \nis used to determine immigration status. They do so through the same \nelectronic system that shares these biometrics with the FBI for checks \nagainst the criminal databases. So even if this amendment were germane, \nI don't think the amendment is necessary or would do what the \ngentlewoman believes that it would do.\n  Even more to the point, if the premise of the amendment is that local \nlaw enforcement agencies aren't notifying ICE prior to releasing from \ncustody individuals who fit ICE immigration enforcement priorities, \nthen the amendment is misguided because the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has established a priority enforcement program, known as the \nPEP, designed to better work with State and local law enforcement to \ntake custody of criminal aliens who pose a danger in public safety \nbefore they are released into our communities.\n  Prior to that program's establishment, 377 jurisdictions refused to \nhonor some or all of ICE detainers. But as of early this year, 277 of \nthose jurisdictions, or 73 percent, have now signed up to participate \nin that program by responding to ICE requests for notification, \nhonoring detainer requests, or both.\n  So the Department of Homeland Security is making good progress in \nsoliciting the participation of State and local law enforcement in the \nPEP program, and we should support them in those efforts and avoid \nmuddling the issue and reject this amendment.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is not a part of the \nAppropriations Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies \nSubcommittee; and it is doubtful that this amendment would have any \neffect, even if it were germane to the bill and not subject to a point \nof order.\n  Because this biometric sharing system is in effect across the \ncountry, no jurisdiction currently refuses to share information about \nimmigration with ICE. So, as a result, it is difficult to see how this \namendment would have any effect whatsoever, even if it were offered on \nthe Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Committee or the \nDepartment of Homeland Security bills.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Frankly, it is not \ngermane to this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chair, it really is ironic that this amendment is \neven necessary. It would not be necessary if the executive branch and \nthe Department of Justice and Homeland Security were all doing their \njob and applying the law to each one of these sanctuary cities.\n  I do want to point to the fact that, back in February of this year, \nAttorney General Loretta Lynch testified before the House \nAppropriations Committee. It was in that committee that she talked \nabout cracking down on what is happening in these sanctuary cities. I \nwant to read what was in The Washington Times that came as a result of \nthat testimony:\n  ``The Obama administration is preparing to crack down on sanctuary \ncities, Attorney General Loretta Lynch told Congress on Wednesday, \nsaying she would try to stop Federal grant money from going to \njurisdictions that actively thwart agents seeking to deport illegal \nimmigrants.''\n  It goes on to say that there was a follow-up in a letter to Mr. \nCulberson that week that the Justice Department said that if it \ndetermined that a city or a county receiving Federal grants is refusing \nto cooperate with ICE agents, they could lose money and face criminal \nprosecution.\n  So, hopefully, we will see the administration crack down on what \nreally is unlawful, and that is for these sanctuary cities to be in \noperation at all. They should not be receiving any Federal funds in \neach one of these appropriation bills, and that is exactly what this \namendment does.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. McNerney\n\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  No Federal funds under this Act may be used for a \n     project with respect to which an investigation was initiated \n     by the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior \n     during calendar years 2015, 2016, or 2017.\n\n  Mr. McNERNEY (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nthat my amendment be considered read.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I would object to waiving the reading.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will continue to read.\n  The Clerk continued to read.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman from California and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, California, like much of the West, has \nbeen enduring a devastating drought. This affects the livelihoods of \nfamilies, farmers, and small businesses throughout the State.\n  California's Governor now wants to move forward with something called \nWaterFix tunnels plan, which will build two massive tunnels to divert \nwater from one part of the State to another.\n  I agree with every other Californian that we need long-term, \nstatewide solutions to our State's water needs. I agree that there \nneeds to be some level of certainty for the families, farmers, and \nsmall businesses about our water supply. To do that, we need to focus \non conservation, recycling, reuse, storage, and leak detection and \nfixing. The WaterFix tunnels do none of these things. It creates no new \nwater at all.\n  California voters and the State legislature haven't agreed on whether \nor not to fund this project, which is expected to exceed at least $25 \nbillion, and that cost keeps rising. In addition, the Federal \nGovernment is expected to contribute $4 billion.\n  The cost of this plan is an even more important issue now that the \nDepartment of the Interior inspector general has opened an \ninvestigation into the possible illegal use of millions of dollars by \nthe California Department of Water Resources in preparing environmental \ndocuments for the WaterFix tunnels plan. Instead of funding important \nhabitat improvements, the State\n\n[[Page H3232]]\n\nadministration may be using Federal funds for the tunnel plan that will \nharm critical habitat for at least five endangered and threatened \nspecies.\n  California needs a water solution for the entire State, not one that \nis too expensive, doesn't create water, and is potentially the source \nof misappropriated funds. We have to use the funding for projects that \nmake sense for California, that make California resilient and \nregionally self-sufficient.\n  My amendment will ban the government from funding tunnels taking our \nwater, especially while subject to Federal investigation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the \namendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes \nlegislation in an appropriation bill and, therefore, violates clause 2 \nof rule XXI.\n  The rule states in pertinent part: ``An amendment to a general \nappropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.''\n  The amendment imposes additional duties.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The Chair finds that this amendment requires a new determination on \nthe Federal officials covered by the bill with regard to investigations \nof the Department of the Interior.\n  The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of \nclause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The point of order is sustained, and the amendment is not in order.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment has been ruled out and is no longer \npending.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Byrne\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  In allocating funds made available by this Act \n     for projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Chief of \n     Engineers shall give priority to the Dog River, Fowl River, \n     Fly Creek, Bayou Coden, and Bayou La Batre projects.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman from Alabama and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would allow for a number of \nimportant Army Corps of Engineers projects in my home district of \ncoastal Alabama to move forward.\n  In many areas, our Nation's waterways are the lifeblood of the \neconomy. Being from a port city, I certainly understand this and \nappreciate the work the Army Corps of Engineers does to keep our \nwaterways well maintained.\n  I know the Army Corps works hard in tandem with Congress to \nprioritize projects to keep our waterways and ports open for commerce. \nUnfortunately, at times, it seems like smaller projects in our more \nrural areas get ignored or forgotten altogether. While they may not \ninclude a major waterway, these projects are vital to many of our local \ncommunities and have a significant economic impact from commercial and \nrecreational fishing as well as tourism in general.\n  My amendment seeks to prioritize some projects in southwest Alabama \nthat are long overdue. These include a project to dredge Fly Creek in \nBaldwin County, where depths need restoring after severe flooding in \n2014. Another project would allow for Dog and Fowl Rivers to be dredged \nto help accommodate commercial and recreational fishing. This project \nhasn't been touched since 2009. Yet another project that needs \nattention is Bayou Coden, which is an important area for local \nshipbuilding.\n  I must thank the Army Corps of Engineers for their attention to a few \nprojects in coastal Alabama, such as dredging Perdido Pass and the Bon \nSecour River. These are critical projects, but more work remains.\n  Mr. Chairman, I understand that my amendment may not be allowed under \nHouse rules, but I believe it is important to have this debate and \nremind the Committee on Appropriations as well as the Army Corps of \nEngineers about the importance of these smaller projects that really \nmake a huge difference in communities across the United States.\n  In these tight budget times, I know it can be difficult to balance \nthe need for major Army Corps projects with smaller projects like the \none I have mentioned, but I hope the Army Corps will work with Congress \nto seek a proper balance that ensures our smaller waterways receive the \nmaintenance and attention they deserve.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve my point of order.\n  Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I do understand the gentleman's concern. \nIn fact, this is an issue we hear about from quite a few Members. The \nadministration's insistence on budgeting on tonnage alone with no other \nconsideration is shortsighted. That is why this bill provides \nadditional funding specifically for small navigation projects, and the \nreport encourages the administration to correct its budget criteria.\n  Unfortunately, the gentleman's amendment would establish priority in \nfunding for specific projects. That is not something I can support, \nparticularly in light of the House prohibition on congressional \nearmarks.\n  I would urge my colleague to withdraw his amendment and instead \ncontinue to work with the committee to show the administration the \nimportance of small navigation projects.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to the gentleman from Alabama.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's words. He is a \nman of his word. I appreciate his understanding the importance of these \nprojects.\n  Having heard his words, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Alabama?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. McNerney\n\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to issue Federal debt forgiveness or capital \n     repayment forgiveness for any district or entity served by \n     the Central Valley Project if the district or entity has been \n     subject to an order from the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission finding a violation of section 17(a)(2) of the \n     Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77q(a)(2)).\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman from California and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is being raised to raise \nawareness of a very unjust situation. My amendment would ban Federal \nfunding for debt forgiveness to any entity that has been subject to an \norder finding a violation of the Securities Act of 1933.\n  This is timely because there was a hearing yesterday in the Committee \non Natural Resources that included two bills that would affirm a \ndrainage settlement between the United States and Westlands Water \nDistrict. This settlement would award Federal forgiveness\n\n[[Page H3233]]\n\nto Westlands, which has violated such an SEC order.\n  These agreements matter because they will result in a $300 million \ntaxpayer giveaway. They also fail to address or solve the extreme water \npollution these irrigation districts discharge into the San Joaquin \nRiver and California delta estuary.\n  These settlement agreements do not require enough land retirements \nand provide more access to water, further draining the delta, and there \nare no real performance standards or oversight if pollution runoff is \nmismanaged.\n  Considering recent news of the SEC fining Westlands due to its \nconduct in misleading investors about its financial health, the lack of \nspecific performance standards and enforcement tools makes the current \nsettlement terms even more questionable.\n  My amendment will ban the government from funding the debt \nforgiveness of these agreements not only because these agreements are \nbad for California, but no entity should have Federal debt forgiveness \nwhen they have violated Federal laws.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Byrne\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. (a) None of the funds made available by this Act \n     may be used for the Energy Information Administration.\n       (b) The amount otherwise made available by this Act for \n     ``Department of Energy--Energy Programs--Energy Information \n     Administration'' is hereby reduced to $0.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Alabama and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would prohibit any funding from \ngoing to the Energy Information Administration, which under this bill \nis set to receive $122 million in taxpayer money.\n  Mr. Chairman, rule XXI of the House rules prohibits funding programs \nthat are not authorized under law. The authorization process is so \nimportant because it gives Congress the ability to set each agency's \nagenda, provide proper oversight, and ensure the agency is fulfilling \nthe mission it was designed by Congress to meet.\n  Nearly one-third of the Federal discretionary spending goes to \nprograms whose mandate to exist has expired. In this bill, we will fund \n28 programs that have expired authorizations, many which expired in the \n1980s. One program that we are funding has existed since the 1970s, but \nhas never been authorized by Congress.\n  The Energy Information Administration, which this amendment would \nblock funding for, is one of the worst offenders. Its authorization \nexpired in 1984, over 30 years ago. That means that the last time this \nagency received proper congressional instructions, oversight, and \nreview, the Los Angeles Raiders had won the Super Bowl, Ronald Reagan \nwas in the White House, and ``Ghostbusters'' was in the theaters.\n  The Energy Information Administration has seen its fair share of \nchallenges since it was last authorized. In fact, a few years ago The \nWall Street Journal wrote an article about how errors by the EIA caused \na significant jump in oil prices. The same story noted that the agency \nwas vulnerable to hacking and that information could be easily \ncompromised, yet this body has not acted on an authorization.\n  Mr. Chairman, I don't question that there may be some important \nfunctions performed by this agency, but at some point we must have \naccountability in the authorization process. If my amendment is \napproved, we can send a message as a House that we are serious about \nfiscal discipline and demand that, if a program is worthy to receive \ntaxpayer funds, it should be authorized by the Congress.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, this is kind of a hard one because I have \nto tell you, in all honesty, I agree with the gentleman. There are too \nmany programs that are not authorized. Unfortunately, it is not the \nCommittee on Appropriations' responsibility. It is the authorizing \ncommittees that haven't been doing their job.\n  It is not the EIA's fault that they are not reauthorized. It is that \nCongress has not done their job in reauthorizing them. As the gentleman \nhas stated, there are many, many programs throughout. I think the whole \nDepartment of State is up for reauthorization and hasn't been \nreauthorized.\n  The gentleman is absolutely right. We need to do something about \nthat. We have been debating and discussing how exactly you do that. We \nhave had various proposals. In fact, members of our Conference are \nlooking at it now. I know Mr. McClintock is very interested in doing \nthis. We have talked about it several times. We are trying to find some \nway to force the authorizing committees to actually do their job and do \nthe reauthorizations that are necessary.\n  But I rise to oppose this amendment. The amendment proposes to \neliminate funding for the Energy Information Administration, a semi-\nindependent agency that collects, analyzes, and disseminates impartial \nenergy statistics and information to the Nation. The EIA performs \nessential work for understanding the electricity generation and energy \nconsumption in the complex energy markets that make up our Nation. The \nEIA provides a statistical and informational service to the private \nsector that the private sector would not.\n  Eliminating this funding would immediately impact the ability to \nperform energy policy and would remove essential reports on the energy \nmarket. Eliminating the EIA would have virtually no effect on the total \nspending in this bill, but would negatively impact our ability to make \nenergy policies.\n  I must oppose this amendment, although I sympathize with what the \ngentleman is trying to do. I would be willing to work with him and any \nothers who are willing to work with a way to force the authorizing \ncommittees to do the authorizations that should be being redone or the \nreauthorizations that should being redone.\n  The reason things expire and the reason they need to be reauthorized \nis because you need to look to see if they are doing what we intended \nwhen we enacted them. Sometimes they are. Sometimes they are not. \nSometimes they need be modified. Sometimes they need to be amended. But \nif we don't get back to reauthorizing them, that never happens, and \nthat is our fault, Congress' fault.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I appreciate the chairman yielding to me. I agree with \nhis opposition to this amendment.\n  Why blame one of the best parts of our government, in my opinion, for \nCongress not doing its job? I am always impressed with the Energy \nInformation Administration. Their data is stellar. They are \nprofessionally run. The business community looks to them. Frankly, the \nglobal energy community looks to them.\n  I think the amendment is shortsighted and would eliminate one of the \nbest, most important sources of information that guides all of our \ndecisions. They are so precise. The data that they present also can be \neasily understood. They have maps. They have charts. They have \ncontinuous data over a number of years.\n  I think the gentleman wants to solve a problem, but I think that one \ncould say that this amendment might be penny wise and pound foolish \nbecause, if you have had any experience with the Energy Information \nAdministration, you know how excellent they really are and their work \nis.\n  We depend on it in order to make solid decisions to save money or to \nmake decisions that are sound rather than unsound. Don't rip the heart \nout\n\n[[Page H3234]]\n\nof one of the most important administrations that we have at the \nFederal level on the energy front.\n  I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  I would urge that this amendment be defeated.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Let me just explain that this is something that I have \nbeen trying to find a solution to for a number of years. When I was \nchairman of the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Subcommittee--this has been like 4 years ago--the \nEndangered Species Act had not been reauthorized for 23 years at the \ntime. It is like 27 years now that it has not been reauthorized. We \nbrought down the Interior appropriation bill, and we put no money in it \nfor endangered species listing or for critical habitat designation, and \nthe intent was to force the Committee on Natural Resources to do a \nreauthorization of the Endangered Species Act.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  The individual who was supporting me the most was the then-chairman \nof the Natural Resources Committee. Well, of course, we lost an \namendment because nobody wants to eliminate all the funding for the \nEndangered Species Act. But the gentleman that supported me the most \nwas the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee at the time, who \nhad the ability and authority to go do a reauthorization of the \nEndangered Species Act, but didn't do it. And it still hasn't been \ndone.\n  It is frustrating. I want to work with anybody in this body that is \nwilling to try to find a way to put pressure on the committees to do \ntheir job.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's remarks. I \naccept his offer. I look forward to working with him. We have got to \nstart somewhere, and this is a good place to start.\n  I heard the gentlewoman's remarks. The Wall Street Journal reported \nthat this agency caused an increase in oil prices by one of its \nmalfunctions. So I don't think it is quite a perfect agency as she made \nit out to be. This is a point that we need to make. And I intend to \ncontinue to make this point as we go through the appropriations \nprocess.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n       Amendment Offered by Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York\n\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I have an \namendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of Executive Order No. 13672 of July \n     21, 2014 (``Further Amendments to Executive order 11478, \n     Equal Employment in the Federal Government, and Executive \n     Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity'').\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, last week, I came \nto the floor to offer an amendment to preserve basic workplace \nprotections for LGBT Americans. My amendment would have kept taxpayer \ndollars from going to government contractors who discriminate against \nLGBT employees. That is it. It said you cannot take taxpayer dollars \nand fire people just for being gay.\n  There are 28 million Americans working for employers who receive \ntaxpayer dollars, and simple math will tell you millions would have \nbeen protected from arbitrary firing. So it made sense, it was fair, \nand it deserved a fair vote.\n  When the vote was held, a bipartisan majority of this House, \nincluding 36 members of the majority party, supported my amendment. \nThat tally clock right there showed 217 ``yes'' votes--4 more than the \n213 needed that day to pass. With all time expired, it was clear as can \nbe that equality had won the vote.\n  But when the world watched, something else happened. Something \nshameful happened. Something about sticking up for basic workplace \nfairness for LGBT Americans rankled certain people around here.\n  Even though my amendment simply would have applied the same standard \nto LGBT employees that we have long applied when people are fired \nbecause of their race or gender or religion or disability, it simply \nwas too much. Even though we would have preserved time-honored \nreligious exemptions, it was too much. Something about treating LGBT \npeople fairly just wouldn't do.\n  So people went to work. Even though all Members had voted, strangely, \nthe expired clock stayed up four times longer than it should have. The \ngavel did not fall. And as we all watched, the tally began to change: \n217, 216, 215. The votes in support were dropping. Members of this \nHouse were changing their votes. Why? From being in support of \nfairness, they were now changing them to be opposed to it.\n  Down the vote went, 214, 213, and yet no one came to the well, as is \ncustomary, to announce their vote. It was all in secret, happening out \nof sight, so no one might see the ugly reality of what was happening.\n  And what happened? Well, when it hit 212, one vote shy of the \nmajority it needed to pass--one vote shy of the majority it had a few \nmoments earlier--the gavel came down and the result was declared. A \ndefeat.\n  It was a shameful exercise, made more shameful in that it took place \non a civil rights vote that enjoyed a bipartisan majority of support in \nthis House. From Portland, Maine, to Des Moines, Iowa, to southeast \nOregon, to Bakersfield, California, newspaper editorial boards, radio \nhosts, and ordinary citizens joined a chorus that was heard first on \nthis floor. ``Shame,'' they said. Shame on those who would betray the \nwill of this House, who would betray this vote, and shame on anyone who \nwould rig this vote and rig our democracy.\n  Shame on those who snatched discrimination from the jaws of equality, \nespecially those ``Switching Seven'' who, having at first voted for \nfairness, allowed themselves to be dragged backward into voting for \ndiscrimination.\n  On Friday, at a meeting of my Veterans' Advisory Board back home, I \nspoke to decorated military heroes and civilians who have dedicated \ntheir lives to the service of this country. To a person, they were \noutraged by what happened on the floor of this House.\n  One member of the group, Edie, who served as a first lieutenant and \ncombat medic in Vietnam, said when she heard about the rigged vote, she \nthought of her daughter, who right now is serving her country in the \nmilitary. And Edie's daughter is a lesbian.\n  Edie said:\n\n       When my daughter finishes her active military service, she \n     will enter the civilian workforce--perhaps for a government \n     contractor, as so many vets do. Will they be able to fire \n     her, even though she and I are both veterans?\n\n  Mr. Chairman, does Edie's service in combat count for anything here? \nDoes her daughter's service right now to this country count for \nanything here?\n  Her daughter isn't alone. There are 71,000 Active Duty LGBT \nservicemen and -women right now and over 1 million LGBT veterans. \nMaking it easier to fire LGBT Americans, even LGBT veterans, isn't \nhonoring our values. It is sacrificing them to preserve a worn out and \ndying prejudice that weakens our Nation rather than strengthening it.\n  So, today, I want to thank Speaker Ryan for allowing an open process \nso that I can offer my amendment again. It is through this open process \nthat we can give our colleagues another chance--a second chance--to do \nthe right thing and to stand for equality.\n  Let us this time ensure that no taxpayer dollars will be used to \ndiscriminate against hardworking Americans simply because of who they \nare, simply because of who they love. And we will also reaffirm \nlegitimate religious exemptions that the President also included in his \nexecutive orders on this subject.\n  Discrimination has no place in our law. It does not make our water \ncleaner. It does not power our homes. It doesn't defeat ISIS. It \ndoesn't support our veterans.\n  Every American deserves the right to work, support a family, and \nachieve the American Dream, regardless of who they are or who they \nlove.\n\n[[Page H3235]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up to discrimination and adopt my \namendment to the bill.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n\n\nAmendment Offered by Mr. Pitts to Amendment Offered by Mr. Sean Patrick \n                          Maloney of New York\n\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment to the \namendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       In the section proposed to be added, insert before the \n     period at the end the following: ``, except as required by \n     the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and Article I \n     of the Constitution''.\n\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman from Pennsylvania and \na Member opposed each will control 5 minutes on the amendment to the \namendment.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to offer this perfecting \namendment to my colleague's amendment.\n  This is amendment is very simple. It would merely state that, as the \nFederal Government spends money with regard to contracting, the \nadministration must not run afoul of the First Amendment, the 14th \nAmendment, or Article I of the Constitution.\n  The President's executive order referred to in the Maloney amendment \ndefines a law that was never defined by Congress. It violates the equal \nprotection rights of individuals who are merely seeking work from the \ngovernment.\n  With this amendment, this Congress can help ensure that, while funds \nmay be going out the door to implement this policy, he must respect \nCongress' authority to write the law, respect an individual's right to \nexercise his or her religion, and respect their rights to work.\n  Does anyone in this Chamber seriously oppose Article I of the \nConstitution, the First Amendment, or the 14th Amendment?\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Constitution and \nlimiting the damaging effects of this executive order.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, may I have the \namendment read back? Does it include only the First Amendment, the 14th \nAmendment, and the Equal Protection Clause?\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the amendment to the amendment \nwill be reported.\n  There was no objection.\n  The Clerk reported the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I would like to ask \nmy colleague what is meant by Article I of the Constitution, if he \ncould clarify that for us.\n  No one who supports my amendment--certainly, not I--has any problem \nwith the First Amendment, the 14th Amendment, particularly the Equal \nProtection Clause, or with Article I of the Constitution, I assure the \ngentleman.\n  I also, however, would note--and I am sure the gentleman would \nappreciate--that many times throughout American history, Presidents, \nunder their authority under the Constitution, have acted in the area of \nworkplace discrimination, particularly in the executive branch.\n  For example, would the gentleman oppose President Truman's action to \nintegrate the armed services? Perhaps he would like that order to be \ncircumscribed in some way, if he thinks that violates Article I of the \nConstitution, the 14th Amendment, or the First Amendment to the \nConstitution?\n  In other words, the President has, throughout American history, under \nhis constitutional authority, taken actions to widen the circle of \nopportunity and to end discrimination in the executive branch.\n  Nothing in my amendment is in any way at odds with the Constitution \nof the United States or the amendments thereto, but it should not be \nallowed to go unchallenged on the floor of this House to suggest that \nPresident Obama, in his executive action in 2014, ran afoul of any of \nthose things either.\n  Indeed, I am unaware of any legal challenge to the President's action \nin those executive orders of 2014. It is pretty clear to me that, if \nthere was something illegal or unconstitutional about them, there would \nhave been a challenge.\n  I don't think anybody seriously contests the President's authority to \ndo what he did in 2014, and many Americans welcome it as one of the \nsignature equal protection actions by a Commander in Chief or by a \nPresident of the United States.\n  So, far from being concerned about reconciling our activities with \nthe Constitution, we believe they are perfectly consistent. Therefore, \nI would ask the gentleman if he would be willing to also include, since \nwe are so fond of the Constitution, Article II of the Constitution \nwhich specifies the powers of the President?\n  If the gentleman would answer that question.\n  In other words, if we are so fond of the Constitution, what do you \nsay we follow the whole thing, including the Civil War amendments, \nincluding some of the things about equal protection and due process. \nYou might have heard something about that. We had a little bit dispute \nabout that in the mid-19th century.\n  What do you say we abide by the whole Constitution; the part that \ntries to make it more progressive, more inclusive of people like me, of \npeople of color, of women, of people who are shut out when it was \nwritten?\n  How about we include the whole Constitution? Can we do that?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will address his remarks to the \nChair.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, how about we \ninclude the whole Constitution? Can we do that?\n  Hearing no objection, I assume we are including the entire \nConstitution, including the powers of the President under Article II.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has yielded back \nhis time.\n  Therefore, the gentleman from New York is recognized on the amendment \nto the amendment.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, how much time do \nI have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Well, then, let me just say \nagain, the point of today's vote is to redo a mistake that was made in \nthis House.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  But of course it wasn't really a mistake, was it?\n  It was an effort to change the outcome of a bipartisan majority \nsupporting an amendment to end discrimination in Federal contracting.\n  So today, what we are doing is getting a second bite at that apple, \ngiving Members a chance to vote their conscience, to do the right \nthing, free from any pressure, free from any vote swapping or \nswitching, free from a clock being held open long after it should have \nclosed.\n  The American people want to know if their government is on the level, \nso let's have this vote on the level. We know there is a bipartisan \nmajority for equality in this House, and, if allowed a fair vote, we \nknow what the outcome will be. I look forward to that vote, Mr. \nChairman.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my reservation of a point of \norder on the amendment to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The reservation of the point of order is withdrawn.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to say that I associate \nmyself with Congressman Maloney's remarks. Workplace discrimination is \na crime that we, as lawmakers, have long sought to mitigate.\n\n[[Page H3236]]\n\n  I have to say I admire him for his courage, for his eloquence, and \nfor being here this evening.\n  I yield to the gentleman from New York in order to complete his \nstatement.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, how much time is \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio has 4\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I want to make it \nperfectly clear that we stand here as servants of the Constitution, all \nof us, and all of the actions we take here are subject to that \nbeautiful document, as amended.\n  So there is nothing about the gentleman's amendment, to the extent \nthat it simply restates what is obvious which is that all of our \nactions are subject to the Constitution, that we would object to.\n  My only point is simply that we need to read it as a whole document. \nWe don't need to read anything into it. We can read the text. We can \nunderstand the history of the text. We can understand the global and \nexpansive nature of the language written into the Constitution after \nthe searing experience of the Civil War around equal protection, around \ndue process.\n  We don't fear the Constitution; we welcome it. We embrace it. We \nclaim it as our own when we come to this floor and ask that the circle \nof opportunity be widened for others who have been excluded before.\n  We think that is in the best tradition of the American Constitution. \nWe believe the Constitution provides a series of promises that, as King \nsaid, it is a promissory note and that a check was written; we are \ncoming to cash it so we will all be treated equally, so we will all be \ntreated fairly, that we all count. Regardless of who we love, \nregardless of the color of our skin, whether we walk in or roll in, we \nbelieve we all count. And we believe that the Constitution enshrines \nthose values in the most beautiful way in all of human history.\n  So, far from being concerned in any way by the gentleman's amendment, \nwe welcome it.\n  But let it not detract from the fact that what happened in this House \nwas an effort to enshrine and rationalize discrimination under Federal \nlaw. And despite the success we had in defeating that with a bipartisan \nmajority, there were those here who wanted to perpetuate discrimination \nat the expense of equality.\n  That is inconsistent with the Constitution, Mr. Chairman.\n  And let that be the final word on this.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio has 1\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, let me just end by saying, this country has \na long and storied history of supporting civil rights and worker \nrights, and that spirit was clearly violated last week during the vote \non the spending bill.\n  We know that businesses should operate under strict rules of fairness \nand equality, and, certainly, the Federal Government should.\n  I am just grateful that we could all be here this evening and try to \nfind a way to move America forward and to make progress, not just for \nthe people of this country, but for humankind.\n  This amendment will ensure that we are able to achieve a fully \nequitable workplace and society.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time having expired on the amendment to the \namendment, does any Member seek time in opposition to the first-degree \namendment offered by Representative Maloney?\n  If not, the Chair will put the question on the amendment to the \namendment.\n  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) to the amendment offered by the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney).\n  The amendment to the amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney), as amended.\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I demand a \nrecorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York, as \namended, will be postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Byrne\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act \n     shall be used in contravention of--\n       (1) the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 \n     U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.);\n       (2) Executive Order 13279; or\n       (3) sections 702(a) and 703(e)(2) of the Civil Rights Act \n     of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-1(a), 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(e)(2)), or \n     section 103(d) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n     (42 U.S.C. 12113(d)), with respect to any religious \n     corporation, religious association, religious educational \n     institution, or religious society.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Alabama and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, unlike our European forebears, the Framers \nmade clear that our Nation would have no state church. Instead, under \nthe First Amendment, all will be protected in the free exercise of the \nreligion of their choosing, and we have a proud tradition of \nconservatives and liberals, Republicans and Democrats, working together \nto protect this free exercise right.\n  In the 1963 case of Sherbert v. Verner, the liberal Justice William \nBrennan mandated that any government intrusion into one's free exercise \nmust meet the most stringent standard of judicial review, strict \nscrutiny.\n  It was actually the conservative Justice Antonin Scalia who wrote the \n1990 opinion in Employment Division v. Smith that rolled back the \nprotections of Sherbert.\n  Fortunately, 3 years later, a Democrat Congress and a Democrat \nPresident, Bill Clinton, rallied large, bipartisan majorities to \nlegislatively overturn Smith in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, \notherwise known as RFRA, and restores strict scrutiny when the \ngovernment seeks to invade the free exercise of religion.\n  RFRA had 170 cosponsors. The gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi) \nand the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) were original cosponsors. \nIt passed by a voice vote in the House and 97-3 in the Senate.\n  On July 21, 2014, President Obama signed Executive Order 11478 \nbanning Federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual \norientation and gender identity in hiring.\n  Unfortunately, despite our broad history of working together to \nprotect the free exercise right, the President refused to provide \nconscience protections for religious-based organizations who engage in \ngovernment contracting.\n  This amendment would clarify that existing religious freedom \nprotection already in law under the RFRA, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and President Bush's \nExecutive Order 13279 would apply, irrespective of the amendment \noffered by Mr. Maloney.\n  We can debate the merits of Executive Order 11478; however, we should \nhave no problem ensuring that religious entities still enjoy the \nprotections of the free exercise of religion.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I don't have a copy of the amendment in \nfront of me, but from what I have listened to the gentleman, it sounds \nlike discrimination in the guise of religious freedom, and I would hope \nthat isn't what the gentleman intends.\n  I have just been given language: ``None of the funds made available \nby this Act shall be used in contravention of the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act.''\n  I don't have full confidence that the equal protection of the laws \nfor the\n\n[[Page H3237]]\n\nfaith-based community are fully considered in this amendment, and I \nwould have to oppose the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, I want to make very clear that my amendment \nsays not one single thing about discrimination. It talks about \nreligious freedom.\n  We treat religious freedom sometimes in this country like it is a \nsecondary right. It is not. It is a fundamental right. And what my \namendment does is make sure that people of religious conscience still \nhave that freedom.\n  So, far from being discrimination, it makes sure that we have \nfreedoms for people that they have had for over 200 years; under the \n1964 Civil Rights Act, for over 50 years; under the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, for over 25 years; and under RFRA, for over 20 years.\n  This is not new. This is not novel. This is settled law. We are \nmaking sure we protect people here. This has nothing to do with \ndiscrimination.\n  I know that some people would like to wipe out the effect of church, \nthe effect of religion, the effect of faith in the public square in \nAmerica. But that is not what our Constitution is about, and I think \nthis House should stand up for religious freedom for everybody.\n  So I ask that everybody in this House vote for this very important \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alabama will \nbe postponed.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Higgins\n\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Secretary of Energy to carry out, or for the \n     salary of any officer or employee of the Department of Energy \n     to carry out, the proposed action of the Department to \n     transport target residue material from Ontario, Canada to the \n     United States, described in the supplement analysis entitled \n     ``Supplement Analysis for the Foreign Research Reactor Spent \n     Nuclear Fuel Acceptance Program'', issued by the Department \n     in November 2015 (DOE/EIS-0218-SA-07).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Simpson and \nRanking Member Kaptur for their work on this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment would prohibit the shipment of dangerous, \nhighly radioactive liquid nuclear waste, which the Department of Energy \nplans to begin shipping by truck later this year in a series of over \n100 shipments from Ontario, Canada, to South Carolina.\n  The department wants to transport this liquid waste, which is far \nmore radioactive than spent nuclear fuel, across the northern border at \nthe Peace Bridge and through downtown Buffalo.\n  In contrast to spent nuclear fuel in solid form, which has a history \nof being shipped by land, this would constitute the first ever shipment \nof liquid nuclear waste by truck in a transportation cask that was \nnever certified for this purpose. Its liquid form, if spilled, could \nmake containment nearly impossible.\n  The route crosses the Great Lakes, across the busiest passenger \ncrossing at the northern border, and through a high-density \nmetropolitan area. In the event of an attack or an accident, the \nconsequences could be devastating.\n  In spite of these concerns, the Department of Energy failed to comply \nwith the National Environmental Policy Act by not commencing with a new \nEnvironmental Impact Statement, instead, relying on old, outdated \ninformation.\n  The evolving threat picture since 9/11 requires that the Department \nof Energy reassess the manner in which it ships such dangerous \nmaterials.\n  Proceeding with the shipments would also ignore the will of the \nHouse, which unanimously passed legislation requiring the Department of \nHomeland Security perform a terrorism threat assessment regarding the \ntransportation of chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological \nmaterials through the United States.\n  To reiterate, my bill would only impact one type of nuclear waste \nshipment, and other shipments of spent nuclear fuel would not be \naffected.\n  I urge support for my amendment, which would prohibit these shipments \nuntil the Department of Energy performs a full and thorough review \nprocess. Proceeding without doing so would seriously compromise public \nsafety.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge support of my amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Huizenga of Michigan). The question is on the \namendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Grayson\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to enter into a contract with any offeror or any of \n     its principals if the offeror certifies, as required by \n     Federal Acquisition Regulation, that the offeror or any of \n     its principals:\n       (A) within a three-year period preceding this offer has \n     been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against it \n     for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection \n     with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public \n     (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation \n     of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the \n     submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, \n     forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, \n     making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal \n     criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; or\n       (B) are presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or \n     civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of \n     any of the offenses enumerated above in subsection (A); or\n       (C) within a three-year period preceding this offer, has \n     been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount \n     that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains \n     unsatisfied.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is identical to other \namendments that have been inserted by voice vote into every \nappropriations bill considered under an open rule during the 113th and \n114th Congresses. The amendment simply expands the list of parties with \nwhom the Federal Government is prohibited from contracting due to \nserious misconduct on the part of the contractors.\n  I hope that this amendment remains noncontroversial.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Babin\n\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be made available to enter into new contracts with, or new \n     agreements for Federal assistance to, the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of my amendment to\n\n[[Page H3238]]\n\nprohibit any contracts or Federal assistance to the Islamic Republic of \nIran from being funded in this Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations bill.\n  As a result of this recent nuclear deal, Iran is now cleared to \nreceive up to $150 billion in assets that should have never made its \nway back to the Ayatollahs.\n  Iran is the world's leading State sponsor of terrorism. Any dollar \nsent to Iran's government is a dollar sent to a brutal, apocalyptic, \nand dangerous regime that routinely flouts international norms, \nthreatens to wipe Israel off the map, captures and humiliates our U.S. \nsailors, flagrantly violating Geneva Convention rules, and is \nresponsible for the murders of hundreds of United States soldiers.\n  Passage of this amendment will wipe the slate clean of any potential \nfor money from the hardworking taxpayers in my district and from across \nthe United States of America to go to Iran. No money for contracts to \nbuy their heavy water, no money for their so-called civilian nuclear \npower program. Let's not get fooled again like we did with North Korea.\n  The Iran deal was only given an ``aye'' vote by 162 Members of this \nHouse--a very small total. The President may have lifted the sanctions \nthat Congress passed in 2010, but there is no reason that we cannot \ntake this step to show Iran and the world that we are serious about \nputting them back in place for their flagrant violations.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment and want to begin \nby saying that ideological riders have no place on appropriation bills, \ncertainly on this bill, and, frankly, I don't believe that this is even \ngermane to the Energy and Water Development bill.\n  This amendment is just the first of many possible attempts to tie the \nhands of the administration from implementing an extremely important \ninternational agreement that will result in exactly the opposite of \nwhat the gentleman infers.\n  The plan of action that was agreed to by several countries, P5+1, \nclosed the four pathways through which Iran could get to a nuclear \nweapon in less than a year. We do not gain anything by putting \nlimitations on United States' ability to engage or monitor Iran's \ncompliance with the agreement. The President has repeatedly said that \nhe will continue to take aggressive steps to counter any activities in \nviolation of existing sanctions, and this includes restrictions on \ncertain nuclear-related transfers, conventional arms, and ballistic \nmissile items, certain asset freezes and travel bans, as well as cargo \ninspections.\n  Today, international inspectors are on the ground, and Iran is being \nsubjected to the most comprehensive, intrusive inspection regime ever \nnegotiated to monitor a nuclear program. Inspectors will remain to \nmonitor Iran's key nuclear facilities 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. \nFor decades to come, inspectors will have access to Iran's entire \nnuclear supply chain. That is an incredible achievement.\n  The Department of Energy's vast expertise in the nuclear fuel cycle, \nnuclear safeguards and security, and nuclear materials plays a critical \nrole in informing and ensuring that Iran is meeting its nuclear \ncommitments.\n  To date, experts at the Department of Energy headquarters, seven \nnational laboratories, and two Department of Energy nuclear sites have \nbeen actively involved in reaching and now implementing the agreement. \nThese experts will continue to support the International Atomic Energy \nAgency's monitoring and verification activities worldwide and are vital \nas the United States works with our P5+1 and European Union partners to \nensure viability into Iran's nuclear program.\n  Why would we proactively cut off our nonproliferation program and \nexperts from working to prevent Iran to achieve nuclear weapons? Isn't \nthat counter to our own national security interests?\n  In other words, if Iran tries to cheat, if they try to build a bomb \ncovertly, we will catch them, the world will catch them, unless we here \nin Congress undo these efforts and adopt amendments such as the one we \nare discussing now.\n  The bottom line is this: Iran was steadily expanding its nuclear \nprogram. The agreement has now cut off every single path to build a \nbomb.\n  Mr. Chairman, I oppose this harmful amendment and encourage my \ncolleagues to oppose as well.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Lowenthal\n\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __ (a) None of the funds made available by this Act \n     may be used in contravention of Executive Order No. 13547 of \n     July 19, 2010.\n       (b) None of the funds made available by this Act may be \n     used to implement, administer, or enforce section 506 of this \n     Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I, along with Representatives Cicilline, \nFarr, Langevin, Keating, Beyer, and Peters have introduced an amendment \nto clarify that the National Ocean Policy is a critical multiagency \naction that should be implemented.\n  Mr. Chair, my district is a poster child for the need for ocean \ncoordination and information sharing between local, State, and Federal \nGovernments, and the military, ports, shippers, energy developers, \nrecreational users, and other stakeholders. I know firsthand that we \ncan have a thriving ocean economy and at the same time protect and \nconserve our precious ocean resources.\n  For example, the Port of Long Beach is the second busiest port in the \nUnited States in my district, moving $140 billion in goods, supporting \n1.4 million jobs in the United States.\n  Offshore oil platforms extract crude oil in San Pedro Bay less than a \nmile from my front door. San Clemente Island in my district has a Navy \ntraining ground and a ship-to-shore firing range. Nearby waters are \nhome to seabirds, fisheries, and migrating whales. Sea level rise and \nextreme weather threaten neighborhoods and businesses all along my \ndistrict and the entire coast of California.\n  With so much activity happening, it simply makes sense to have the \nNavy at the table when NOAA is working on siting of a new aquaculture \ninstallation. It makes sense to have the fishery management council \nweigh in when oil rigs are being decommissioned, and it is a no-brainer \nthat NOAA, the Coast Guard, and the ports all work together to get \nthese massive ships in and out of port safely.\n  We want these collaborations to happen because we want to have a \nsustainable ocean economy, and by developing regional plans and having \na framework for multi-stakeholder involvement, we can streamline this \nprocess and promote a robust ocean economy that also conserves our \nprecious ocean resources.\n  The country and my district need a comprehensive approach to our \nocean resources, which the National Ocean Policy provides.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, while there may be instances in which \ngreater coordination would be helpful in ensuring our ocean and coastal \nresources are available to future generations, any such coordination \nmust be done carefully to protect against Federal overreach.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  As we have seen recently with the proposed rule to redefine waters of \nthe United States, strong congressional oversight is needed to ensure \nthat we protect private property rights.\n  Unfortunately, the way the administration developed its National \nOcean\n\n[[Page H3239]]\n\nPolicy, it increases the opportunities for overreach. The \nimplementation plan is so broad and so sweeping, that it may allow the \nFederal Government to effect agricultural practices, mining, energy \nproducers, fishermen, and anyone else whose actions may have an impact \non the oceans.\n  The fact is the administration did not work with Congress to develop \nthis plan and has even refused to provide relevant information to \nCongress, so we can't be sure how sweeping it actually will be. That is \nwhy I support the language in the underlying bill and, therefore, \noppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, there is an agreement among all of us \nthat there needs to be more coordination among all of the stakeholders \nto make smart decisions about our ocean resources. However, many on the \nother side of the aisle oppose the National Ocean Policy on the grounds \nthat, as we have just heard, it is overreach, which is authorized by an \nexecutive order of a President that they don't like.\n  To me, this seems petty. National Ocean Policy is not a failed policy \nlike some suggest, nor is it an instance of executive overreach. It is \nmerely a commonsense way to facilitate multistakeholder collaboration \non complex ocean issues, and it promotes economic opportunity, national \nsecurity, and environmental protection.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Meadows\n\n  Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be spent by the Army Corps of Engineers to award contracts \n     using the lowest price technically acceptable source \n     selection process unless the source selection decision is \n     documented and such documentation includes the rationale for \n     any business judgments and tradeoffs made or relied on by the \n     source selection authority, including benefits associated \n     with additional costs.\n\n  Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe considered read.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I will be brief. The night is getting \nlong, and the committee has done some great work on the underlying \nbill.\n  This amendment is a commonsense amendment, one meant to provide \ntransparency as it relates to the Army Corps of Engineers and the \nawarding of contracts. When they actually award a technically \nacceptable lowest bid, the rationale and the other transparency \ndocuments would actually be reported that no funds could be extended \nexcept for those express purposes.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act for \n     ``Department of Energy--Energy Programs--Science'' may be \n     used in contravention of the Department of Energy \n     Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the ranking member, \nMs. Kaptur, her staff, and the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. \nSimpson, and staff and others because they have been working hard.\n  I want to emphasize that this is an amendment that was approved and \nadopted in an identical form on April 29, 2015, during the 114th \nCongress, as an amendment to H.R. 2028, the Energy and Water \nDevelopment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.\n  I do this amendment because I do believe it is extremely important. \nIf you travel around this country, whether it is Silicon Valley, \nwhether it is NASA, whether it is dealing with energy resources, \nrenewable and otherwise, you realize the importance of science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math.\n  Twenty years ago, Mr. Chairman, on February 11, 1994, President \nClinton issued Executive Order 12898, directing Federal agencies to \nidentify and address the disproportionately high and adverse human \nhealth or environmental effects of their actions on minority and low-\nincome populations.\n  The Department of Energy seeks to provide equal access to these \nopportunities for underrepresented groups in STEM, including \nminorities, Native Americans, and women. We need professionals in these \nareas to be able to assess the various impacts, environmental impacts, \non the minority community. But, more importantly, we also need our \norganizations, such as Historically Black Colleges and other colleges, \nto make sure to include opportunities for minority and women students. \nThey make up 70 percent of college students, but only 45 percent of \nundergraduate STEM degree holders.\n  This large pool of untapped talent is a great potential source of \nSTEM professionals. As the Nation's demographics change, I think it is \nimperative that we emphasize in the various Federal agencies that we \nneed to provide and extend opportunities for minorities in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math.\n  Earlier today, I had the opportunity to visit with Scott Kelly. One \nwould call him the miracle astronaut, spending over 300 days on the \nInternational Space Station. The International Space Station was the \nentity built some years ago when I was on the Science, Space, and \nTechnology Committee. But to realize that a human being tested himself \nto stay, an American making history. I believe science, technology, \nengineering, and math commemorates and celebrates the giant work of \nScott Kelly, but it produces more Scott Kellys.\n  I applaud Energy Secretary Moniz's commitment, which will increase \nthe Nation's economic competitiveness and enable more of our people to \nrealize their full potential.\n  I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment, as it has been \nsupported in the past, to again, through this legislation, emphasize \nthe importance of science, technology, engineering, and math.\n  I ask support for the Jackson Lee amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to describe my amendment, \nwhich simply provides that: ``None of the funds made available by this \nAct for `Department of Energy--Energy Programs--Science' may be used in \ncontravention of the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. \n7101 et seq.).''\n  This amendment was approved and adopted in identical form on April \n29, 2015, during the 114th Congress as an amendment to H.R. 2028, the \nEnergy and Water Resources Appropriations Act of 2016.\n  Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur \nfor their stewardship in bringing this legislation to the floor and for \ntheir commitment to preserving America's great natural environment and \nresources so that they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come.\n  Mr. Chair, twenty years ago, on February 11, 1994, President Clinton \nissued Executive Order 12898, directing federal agencies to identify \nand address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or \nenvironmental effects of their actions on minority and low-income \npopulations.\n  The Department of Energy seeks to provide equal access in these \nopportunities for underrepresented groups in STEM, including \nminorities, Native Americans, and women.\n  Mr. Chair, women and minorities make up 70 percent of college \nstudents, but only 45 percent of undergraduate STEM degree holders.\n  This large pool of untapped talent is a great potential source of \nSTEM professionals.\n  As the nation's demographics are shifting and now most children under \nthe age of one are minorities, it is critical that we close the\n\n[[Page H3240]]\n\ngap in the number of minorities who seek STEM opportunities.\n  I applaud the Energy Secretary Moniz's commitment which will increase \nthe nation's economic competitiveness and enable more of our people to \nrealize their full potential.\n  Mr. Chair, there are still a great many scientific riddles left to be \nsolved--and perhaps one of these days a minority engineer or biologist \nwill come-up with some of the solutions.\n  The larger point is that we need more STEM educators and more \nminorities to qualify for them.\n  The energy and science education programs funded in part by this bill \nwill help ensure that members of underrepresented communities are not \nplaced at a disadvantage when it comes to the environmental \nsustainability, preservation, and health.\n  Through education about the importance of environmental \nsustainability, we can promote a broader understanding of science and \nhow citizens can improve their surroundings.\n  Through community education efforts, teachers and students have also \nbenefitted by learning about radiation, radioactive waste management, \nand other related subjects.\n  The Department of Energy places interns and volunteers from minority \ninstitutions into energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.\n  The DOE also works to increase low income and minority access to STEM \nfields and help students attain graduate degrees as well as find \nemployment.\n  With the continuation of this kind of funding, we can increase \ndiversity, provide clean energy options to our most underserved \ncommunities, and help improve their environments, which will yield \nbetter health outcomes and greater public awareness.\n  But most importantly businesses will have more consumers to whom they \nmay engage in related commercial activities.\n  My amendment will help ensure that underrepresented communities are \nable to participate and contribute equitably in the energy and \nscientific future.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and support the Jackson Lee Amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Stivers\n\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used for the Cape Wind Energy Project on the Outer \n     Continental Shelf off Massachusetts, Nantucket Sound.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Ohio and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which \nwould prohibit the Department of Energy funding from being used for the \nCape Wind offshore wind generation project in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.\n  I offered this amendment in last year's appropriation, and it was \nadopted by a voice vote, so I believe it should be fairly \nnoncontroversial. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Nearly 2 years ago, the Department of Energy offered conditional \ncommitments for the Cape Wind project of a $150 million loan guarantee. \nSince that time, the project has been plagued by setbacks amid concerns \nabout its impact on the environment, disruptions of safety for \npassenger aircraft, or just the high cost of electricity produced by \nthe proposed facility. Last year, two of the State's utilities \nterminated contracts to purchase power from the wind farm, jeopardizing \nthe viability of the project.\n  I believe we should encourage the development of all forms of energy. \nRenewable sources like wind power are important for our Nation's energy \nportfolio.\n  But this project, in particular, has a troubled history. This \namendment seeks to ensure that the American taxpayers do not have to \nfoot the bill if the project fails.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  The amounts otherwise provided by this Act are \n     revised by reducing the amount made available for ``Corps of \n     Engineers-Civil--Investigations'', and increasing the amount \n     made available for the same account, by $3,000,000.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, allow me again to thank Mr. Simpson \nand Ms. Kaptur for their work on this energy and water bill that is so \nvery important, and emphasize the importance of this legislation to \nmany and all regions of the United States of America.\n  My amendment speaks to the need for robust funding for the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers investigations account. Let me be very clear. It \nspeaks to the general need for robust funding for the investigations \naccount, and it speaks to it in terminology of redirecting $3 million \nfor increased funding for postdisaster watershed assessment studies, \nlike the one that is being contemplated for the Houston/Harris County \nmetropolitan area. It does this to emphasize the importance of the \ninvestigations account, not to single out a particular project, but for \ndescribing a project, which I will take time to do.\n  I am pleased that H.R. 5055 provides $120 million for the \ninvestigations account. This is very important to the Army Corps of \nEngineers. As a Federal agency that collects and studies basic \ninformation pertaining to river and harbor, flood and storm damage \nreduction, shore protection, aquatic ecosystem restoration, and \nconducts detailed studies, plans, and specifications for river and \nharbor, and flood and storm damage reduction, the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers plays a critical role in building, maintaining, and expanding \nthe most critical of the Nation's infrastructure. We understand this \nvery well in my home State of Texas and the 18th Congressional \nDistrict.\n  Over the last 2 years, Mr. Chairman, 2 years around the exact same \ntime, we didn't have something called a hurricane. We had a heavy rain \nin April-May of 2015 and April of 2016. 2016 had 20 inches of rain, \nwhich was enormous. The damage was unbelievable.\n  Let me cite for you the words from the Greater Houston Partnership \nthat supports this amendment:\n  ``Perhaps the most telling statistic of all: based on the 7,021 calls \nthe United Way of Greater Houston has received through its 2-1-1 line, \n1,937 calls have been requests for `food replacement.'''\n  The amount of money that was lost was $1.9 billion in damage during \nthe weeks that followed the storm, which includes damage to homes, \ncars, schools, parks, churches, roadways, and other important elements \nof our infrastructure. This is what we faced in Houston, Texas.\n  I am recounting that and indicating that we believe this \ninvestigations account is so very important. It will have the \nopportunity, through a $3 million study, to deal with the bayous that \nare located in the larger Houston/Harris County area: Sims Bayou, \nGreens Bayou, Brays Bayou, White Oak Bayou, Hunting Bayou, and Clear \nCreek.\n  Again, let me be very clear. As the Army Corps of Engineers works \nthrough their work study program, this investigations account will be \nenormously important.\n  We have also received a letter from Members of the United States \nCongress supporting the study of all of the bayous in our community. We \nwant to ensure that the account is robust to provide that possible \nopportunity.\n  Let me indicate to my colleagues again, the investigations account is \n$120 million. We rise to support it. We also rise to acknowledge the \nneed for the utilization of those funds all over America, and certainly \nin Houston/Harris County, Texas, and the surrounding counties, which \nwill help us, through a study, have a better pathway to how we fix \nthis, how do we not have this be Houston next year in 2017.\n\n[[Page H3241]]\n\n  Let me thank my colleagues.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I am \nnot opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Idaho is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, first, let me assure my colleague that I \nunderstand her interest in addressing the flooding risks in her \ndistrict in Houston.\n  Besides the fact that the fiscal year 2017 Energy and Water bill \nincludes a total of $13.3 million above the budget request for flood \nand storm damage reduction studies, the bill also allows for several \nnew studies to be initiated, and the Corps could choose the study of \ninterest to the gentlewoman as one of them.\n  Since this amendment does not change the funding levels within the \nbill, I do not oppose the amendment.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee has been absolutely \nunrelenting in her representation of Houston and of the serious \nsituation that is faced there by the citizenry and leaders because of \nthe flooding. What a tremendous voice she is for the people whom she \nrepresents. There isn't a time that I see her in the elevators or \nwalking around that she doesn't ask me about this bill and about \nwanting to come down and amend it to make sure that it is sensitive to \nthe needs of Houston. I just wanted to put that on the record.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the distinguished gentleman and the \ndistinguished gentlewoman for their courtesies.\n  I want the chairman to know that I have acknowledged in my written \nstatement the funds that he has placed in the legislation.\n  Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment \nas a very fine statement that contributes to this bill, to the people \nof the Nation, but also to the people of Texas and Houston.\n  Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur \nfor shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment \nto preserving America's great natural environment and resources so that \nthey can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come.\n  My amendment speaks to the need for robust funding for the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers ``Investigations'' account by redirecting $3 million \nfor increases funding for post-disaster watershed assessment studies, \nlike the one that is being contemplated for the Houston/Harris County \nmetropolitan area.\n  Mr. Chair, I am pleased that H.R. 5055 provides $120 million for the \nInvestigations account.\n  As the federal agency that collects and studies basic information \npertaining to river and harbor, flood and storm damage reduction, shore \nprotection, aquatic ecosystem restoration, and conducts detailed \nstudies, plans, and specifications for river and harbor, and flood and \nstorm damage reduction, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer plays a \ncritical role in the building, maintaining, and expanding the most \ncritical of the nation's infrastructure.\n  We understand this very well in my home state of Texas and the \nEighteenth Congressional District that I represent.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers has been working with the Harris County I \nFlood Control District since 1937 to reduce the risk of flooding within \nHarris County.\n  Current projects include 6 federal flood risk management projects:\n  1. Sims Bayou\n  2. Greens Bayou\n  3. Brays Bayou\n  4. White Oak Bayou\n  5. Hunting Bayou, and\n  6. Clear Creek\n  In addition to these ongoing projects, the Army Corps of Engineers \noperates and maintains the Addicks and Barker (A) Detention Dams in \nnorthwest Harris County.\n  Mr. Chair, I am pleased that the bill provides that the Secretary of \nthe Army may initiate up to six new study starts during fiscal year \n2017, and that five of those studies are to consist studies where the \nmajority of the benefits are derived from flood and storm damage \nreduction or from navigation transportation savings.\n  I am optimistic that one of those new study starts will be the \nHouston Regional Watershed Assessment Flood Risk Management Feasibility \nstudy.\n  Such a study is certainly needed given the frequency and severity of \nhistoric-level flood events in recent years in and around the Houston \nmetropolitan area.\n  On April 15, 2016, an estimated 240 billion gallons of water fell in \nthe Houston area over a 12 hour period, which resulted in several areas \nexceeding the 100 to 500 year flood event record.\n  The areas that experienced these historic rain falls were west of 1-\n45, north of I-10, and Greens Bayou.\n  Additionally, an estimated 140 billion gallons of water fell over the \nCypress Creek, Spring Creek, and Addicks watershed in just 14 hours.\n  The purpose of the Houston Regional Watershed Assessment is to \nidentify risk reduction measures and optimize performance from a multi-\nobjective systems performance perspective of the regional network of \nnested and intermingled watersheds, reservoir dams, flood flow \nconveyance channels, storm water detention basins, and related Flood \nRisk Management (FRM) infrastructure.\n  Special emphasis of the study, which covers 22 primary watersheds \nwithin Harris County's 1,756 square miles, will be placed on extreme \nflood events that exceed the system capacity resulting in impacts to \nasset conditions/functions and loss of life.\n  Mr. Chair, during the May 2015 Houston flood, 3,015 homes were \nflooded and 8 persons died; during the April 2016 Houston flood, 5,400 \nhomes were flooded and 8 deaths recorded.\n  The economic damage caused by the 2015 Houston flood is estimated at \n$3 billion; the 2016 estimate is being compiled and is estimated to be \nwell above $2 billion.\n  Mr. Chair, minimizing the risk of flood damage to the Houston and \nHarris County metropolitan area, the nation's 4th largest, is a matter \nof national significance because the region is one of the nation's \nmajor technology, energy, finance, export and medical centers:\n  1. Port of Houston is the largest bulk port in the world;\n  2. Texas Medical Center is a world renowned teaching, research and \ntreatment center;\n  3. Houston is home to the largest conglomeration of foreign bank \nrepresentation and second only to New York City as home to the most \nFortune 500 companies; and\n  4. The Houston Watershed Assessment study area sits within major \nHurricane Evacuation arteries for the larger Galveston Gulf Coast \nregion.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and support the Jackson Lee Amendment \nfor the Environmental Justice Program.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                                      Greater Houston Partnership,\n                                                     May 26, 2016.\n     Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Jackson Lee, as you know, on April 18, \n     2016, the Houston region experienced unprecedented rain and \n     flooding. According to an estimate prepared by BBVA Compass, \n     Houston experienced over $1.9 billion in damage during the \n     weeks that followed the storm, which includes damage to \n     homes, cars, schools, parks, churches, roadways and other \n     important elements of our infrastructure. For many, the \n     recent storms have affected every aspect of their quality of \n     life. Perhaps the most telling statistic of all: based on the \n     7,021 calls the United Way of Greater Houston has received \n     through its 2-1-1 line, 1,937 calls have been requests for \n     ``food replacement.''\n       We greatly appreciate your leadership ensuring the Houston \n     area receives appropriate federal funding to help Houston \n     heal and make it more resilient in the future. To that end, \n     we are supportive of the requested $3 million for a study by \n     the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to investigate flood risk \n     management opportunities in the Houston metropolitan area by \n     analyzing the watersheds as a system of systems.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bob Harvey,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2016.\n     Hon. Hal Rogers,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nita Lowey,\n     Ranking Member, House Committee on Appropriations, Washington \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Lowey: We write to \n     the Committee on Appropriations to allocate $3 million in the \n     FY 2016 supplemental funding for a 3 year study to be \n     conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers that will \n     investigate flood risk management opportunities in the \n     Houston metropolitan area by analyzing the watersheds as a \n     system of systems. This request for funding is based upon the \n     frequency and severity of flood events in and around the \n     Houston metropolitan area.\n\n[[Page H3242]]\n\n       An estimated 240 billion gallons of water fell in the \n     Houston area over a 12 hour period, which resulted in several \n     areas exceeded the 100 to 500 year flood event record. The \n     records are based upon time period of rain fall, the location \n     of the rain fall, and the duration of the event over a \n     watershed. The areas that experienced these historic rain \n     falls were west of 1-45, north of I-10, and Greens Bayou. \n     Further, an estimated 140 billion gallons of water fell over \n     the Cypress Creek, Spring Creek, and Addicks watershed in \n     just 14 hours.\n       The study we seek funding will identify risk reduction \n     measures and optimize performance from a multi-objective \n     systems performance perspective of the regional network of \n     nested and intermingled watersheds, reservoir dams, flood \n     flow conveyance channels, storm water detention basins, and \n     related Flood Risk Management (FRM) infrastructure. Special \n     emphasis will be placed on extreme flood events that exceed \n     the system capacity resulting in impacts to asset conditions/\n     functions and loss of life.\n       The study area includes 22 primary watersheds within the \n     county's 1,756 square miles, each having unique flooding \n     problems. These include Spring-Creek, Little Cypress Creek, \n     Willow Creek, Cypress Creek, Addicks, Barker, Buffalo Bayou, \n     Clear Creek, Sims Bayou, Brays Bayou, White Oak Bayou, Greens \n     Bayou, Hunting Bayou, Vince Bayou, Armand Bayou, Carpenters \n     Bayou, San Jacinto River, Jackson Bayou, Luce Bayou, Cedar \n     Bayou, Spring Gully and Goose Creek, and San Jacinto and \n     Galveston Bay Estuaries. The flooding problems in the \n     watershed are frequent, widespread, and severe, with projects \n     to reduce flood risks in place that are valued at several \n     billion dollars. Recent historical flooding in the region was \n     documented in 1979, 1980, 1983, 1989, 1993, 1994, 1997, 2001 \n     (Tropical Storm Allison), 2006, 2007, 2008 (Hurricane Ike), \n     2015 and was most recently demonstrated during the \n     significant flooding, widespread damages, and losses of life \n     during the 12 hour flood event from April 17-18, 2016.\n       The study will involve coordination with local, state and \n     federal stakeholders to comprehensively evaluate the life \n     safety, economic, and environmental impacts of potential \n     regional flooding, as well as land use that is managed by \n     local entities so future regional development is regulated to \n     avoid individual and cumulative impacts of the broad pattern \n     and rapid pace of development that contribute to poor FRM \n     systems performance.\n       Thank you for your careful consideration of this request is \n     appreciated.

The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Mullin\n\n  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  Beginning on November 8, 2016, through January \n     20, 2017, none of the funds made available by this Act may be \n     used to propose or finalize a regulatory action that is \n     likely to result in a rule that may have an annual effect on \n     the economy of $100,000,000 or more, as specified in section \n     3(f)(1) of Executive Order No. 12866 of September 30, 1993.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, I offer an amendment to protect Americans from \nthe costly regulations this administration or future administrations \nmay try to issue before the President leaves office. My amendment would \nprohibit funds from being used to propose or to finalize any major \nregulation from November 8 to January 20 of next year.\n  In the past, we have seen administrations issue politically motivated \nregulations between the day of the election and the day the new \nPresident takes office. In 2000 and in 2008, the number of midnight \nregulations issued was nearly double the average of non-midnight \nregulations. We expect this administration to maintain this practice, \nand with the nature of the regulations we have seen from the Federal \nagencies over the past 8 years, this amendment is more important than \never.\n  I would like to briefly thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nWalberg) for leading on this issue in the House.\n  Let's hold the executive branch in check in its remaining days so \nthat families and businesses across the country don't fall victim to \nunnecessary, burdensome regulations.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, this amendment is actually costly, \ninefficient, and it rolls back progress in a department that has really \nbeen experiencing tremendous leadership under Dr. Ernest Moniz.\n  The Mullin amendment would stop the Department of Energy from \nproposing or finalizing any rule that may cost more than $100 million \nannually, the Congressman says. Mr. Chair, this is just another attempt \nto ensure that agencies are unable to enact important rules and \nregulations that protect consumers and benefit our Nation.\n  What if that had been done back when the Clean Water Act was first \npassed?\n  We would have had communities across this country pumping sewage into \ntheir kitchens.\n  At the DOE alone, the Mullin amendment would stall 14 rules that are \ncurrently in progress, a third of which are consensus agreements that \nthe DOE has worked with industry to finalize. The amendment would also \nwaste valuable manpower and resources for both the DOE and the \nindustries involved in these consensus agreements.\n  This makes no sense. We need to move on with the business of America. \nTaking a myopic view of our Nation's regulatory practices is nothing \nnew for this majority. Time and again, we have seen appropriation \nriders and authorizing legislation that only looks at the costs that \nare associated with agency rules and that completely ignores the \nassociated benefits to our country. This amendment is no different.\n  These proposals overlook the extensive review process that already \nexists for rules. For example, every new rule is already scrutinized up \nand down by numerous Federal agencies as well as by key stakeholders \nand the public through very, very extensive input that agencies seek. \nLet me explain.\n  For economically significant rules, an agency must provide the Office \nof Management and Budget with an assessment and, to the extent \npossible, with a quantification of the benefits as well as of the costs \nof a proposed rule. In accordance with Executive Order No. 12866, the \nagency has to justify the costs associated with the rule, and these \ncosts are justified with benefits, which is something the Mullin \namendment appears to think doesn't exist, but that is simply false.\n  For example, in his 2015 analysis of the estimated costs and benefits \nof significant Federal regulations, the OMB estimated that, over the \nlast decade, the benefits of these rules outweighed the economic costs \nby nine to one--and that is OMB. These benefits have translated into \nreal money for the American taxpayer.\n  As a result of standards established by the DOE, a typical American \nhousehold already saves over $200 a year on its energy bill. That comes \nin different forms. Whether it is a more efficient refrigerator or \nwhether it is light bulbs or whether it is insulation, we all know the \nbenefits.\n  Besides economic benefits, these standards provide benefits to our \nenvironment and the well-being of our communities. The 40 new or \nupdated standards issued by the DOE will assist in reducing carbon \nemissions by over 2 million metric tons through 2030, and will help \nthis Nation curb climate change, which we all know threatens the health \nof our environment as well as of our communities.\n  Republicans should stop trying to undermine the rulemaking process. \nThey should stop ignoring the real-world benefits of these rules to \nsociety and the progress that we are making as a country.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, with respect to my colleague, I do want to \npoint out that the Clean Water Act had absolutely nothing to do with \npumping sewage into someone's house. It had to do\n\n[[Page H3243]]\n\nwith the direct discharge into navigable waters, like in Mississippi. \nIt has nothing to do with what we are talking about or with what the \ngentlewoman brought up.\n  Second of all, when the gentlewoman starts talking about its being \ncostly, the last time I checked, the cost of living has skyrocketed due \nto the regulations, due to the amount of inflation that has been \nbrought on by regulations and from the costs of doing business. As a \nbusinessowner, I well understand the costs.\n  Through rulemaking, the legislators lose the ability to legislate, \nwhich is what our Founding Fathers had decided to do when they set up \nthe legislative branch. We surrender that when we allow the executive \nbranch to go crazy towards the end of the year to clean the slate of \ntheir last year in office. Let me give you some numbers.\n  Under the Carter administration--this is how far I am going to go \nback, and don't think that this is a Republican thing or a Democrat \nthing. During the midnight hours of regulations, which is considered to \nbe November 8 to January 20, the Carter administration issued 24,531 \npages of midnight regulations. The Reagan administration issued 14,584 \npages of midnight regulations. The Bush administration issued 20,148 \npages of midnight regulations. The Clinton administration issued 26,542 \npages of midnight regulations. Mind you, this is between the election \nin November until he leaves office in January. Bush: 21,251 pages.\n  All I am saying is let's be the legislators our Founding Fathers set \nup, and let's not allow the executive branch to allow rulemaking to go \non and bypass the legislative branch.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I urge Members to oppose the gentleman's \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote for this \namendment so we can hold this administration accountable.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  The amounts otherwise provided by this Act are \n     revised by reducing the amount made available for ``Corps of \n     Engineers-Civil--Construction'', and increasing the amount \n     made available for the same account, by $100,000,000.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, my previous amendment dealt with the \nInvestigations account, which is the predecessor to the Construction \naccount.\n  Before I begin the discussion, let me say that I took to the floor of \nthe House in May, after the floods occurred in Houston, and had a \nmoment of silence for the eight people who had died in those floods. \nMr. Chair, this was not a hurricane, and it was not a tornado. It was \nhard rain that caused individuals in their cars to drown. It was very, \nvery tragic. Some going to work, some nurses, some students who were \ndrowning in their cars. This is what it looked like in my district. It \nlooked the same way in 2015 and again in 2016.\n  The Construction account, for which I want to thank Ms. Kaptur and \nMr. Simpson, has $1.94 billion. I believe the Construction account is \nvery important to Members across the Nation. Certainly, it is important \nto the Houston-Harris County region, with other counties around. As the \nFederal agency that collects and studies basic information pertaining \nto river and harbor flood and storm damage and shore protection, this \nis important construction money that will be vital to preventing this \nkind of catastrophe--first a study, then the construction. The areas \nthat may be impacted by the Army Corps' resources include Sims Bayou, \nGreens Bayou, Brays Bayou, White Oak Bayou, Hunting Bayou, and Clear \nCreek Bayou. These are the areas that spilt over and caused the \nenormous damage.\n  On April 15, 2016, an estimated 240 billion gallons of water fell in \nthe Houston area over a 12-hour period, which resulted in several areas \nexceeding the 100- to 500-year flood event. That is why these \nconstruction dollars are so important. The areas that experienced these \nhistoric rainfalls were west of I-45, north of I-10 and Greens Bayou--\nmy congressional district, among others.\n  Finally, during the May 2015 Houston flood, 3,000 homes were flooded, \nand eight people died. During the April 2016 Houston flood, 5,400 homes \nwere flooded, and, again, eight deaths were recorded. As for my \nprevious numbers, April 15, 2016, was when they had this constant \nrain--240 billion gallons. The economic damage caused by the 2015 \nHouston flood is estimated at $3 billion.\n  This Construction account is so very important. I ask my colleagues \nto support the Jackson Lee amendment, which is the broader view of how \nthese dollars can be utilized to save lives, in particular in regions \nthat I happen to live in, which is the Houston-Harris County area.\n  Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur \nfor shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment \nto preserving America's great natural environment and resources so that \nthey can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come.\n  My amendment speaks to the need for robust funding for the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers ``Construction'' account by redirecting $100 million \nfor increased funding for critical construction projects, like those \ncurrent and future projects proposed for the Houston/Harris County \nmetropolitan area.\n  Mr. Chair, I am pleased that H.R. 5055 provides $1.945 billion for \nthe Construction account.\n  As the federal agency that collects and studies basic information \npertaining to river and harbor, flood and storm damage reduction, shore \nprotection, aquatic ecosystem restoration, and conducts detailed \nstudies, plans, and specifications for river and harbor, and flood and \nstorm damage reduction, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plays a \ncritical role in building, maintaining, and expanding the most critical \nof the nation's infrastructure.\n  We understand this very well in my home state of Texas and the \nEighteenth Congressional District that I represent.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers has been working with the Harris County \nFlood Control District since 1937 to reduce the risk of flooding within \nHarris County.\n  Current projects include 6 federal flood risk management projects:\n  1. Sims Bayou\n  2. Greens Bayou\n  3. Brays Bayou\n  4. White Oak Bayou\n  5. Hunting Bayou, and\n  6. Clear Creek\n  In addition to these ongoing projects, the Army Corps of Engineers \noperates and maintains the Addicks and Barker (A) Detention Dams in \nnorthwest Harris County.\n  Such a study is certainly needed given the frequency and severity of \nhistoric-level flood events in recent years in and around the Houston \nmetropolitan area. It is clear that much more needs to be done to \nminimize the vulnerability of the nation's 4th largest metropolitan \narea and economic engine from the flood damage.\n  On April 15, 2016, an estimated 240 billion gallons of water fell in \nthe Houston area over a 12 hour period, which resulted in several areas \nexceeding the 100 to 500 year flood event record.\n  The areas that experienced these historic rainfalls were west of 1-\n45, north of I 10, and Greens Bayou.\n  Additionally, an estimated 140 billion gallons of water fell over the \nCypress Creek, Spring Creek, and Addicks watershed in just 14 hours.\n  Mr. Chair, during the May 2015 Houston flood, 3,015 homes were \nflooded and 8 persons died; during the April 2016 Houston flood, 5,400 \nhomes were flooded and 8 deaths recorded.\n  The economic damage caused by the 2015 Houston flood is estimated at \n$3 billion; the 2016 estimate is being compiled and is estimated to be \nwell above $2 billion.\n  Mr. Chair, minimizing the risk of flood damage to the Houston and \nHarris County metropolitan area, the nation's 4th largest, is a matter \nof national significance because the region is one of the nation's \nmajor technology, energy, finance, export and medical centers:\n  1. Port of Houston is the largest bulk port in the world;\n\n[[Page H3244]]\n\n  2. Texas Medical Center is a world renowned teaching, research and \ntreatment center;\n  3. Houston is home to the largest conglomeration of foreign bank \nrepresentation and second only to New York City as home to the most \nFortune 500 companies; and\n  4. The Houston Watershed Assessment study area sits within major \nHurricane Evacuation arteries for the larger Galveston Gulf Coast \nregion.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and support the Jackson Lee Amendment.\n  I thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur for their work in \nshepherding this bill to the floor.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I \ndo not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Idaho is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, first let me assure my colleague that I \nunderstand the issue prompting this amendment. Seeing our communities \nflood and our constituents struggling to deal with the aftermath of \nflooding, especially when there are projects already planned to prevent \nsuch flooding, can be extremely frustrating.\n  That is why the energy and water bills over the past several years \nhave included significant funding above the budget request for the \nCorps of Engineers flood and storm damage reduction mission.\n  In fact, the fiscal year 2017 energy and water bill more than doubles \nthe budget requested from the administration for construction of these \nprojects. It is an increase of 113 percent, or $457 million.\n  More specifically, the bill includes $392 million in additional \nfunding, for which the Houston area projects could compete. That amount \nis $82 million more than the amount provided in the fiscal year 2016 \nact.\n  Additionally, the committee report directs the Corps to consider the \nseverity of risks of flooding or the frequency with which an area has \nexperienced flooding when deciding how to allocate the additional \nfunding provided. The bill provides strong support for addressing flood \nrisks.\n  Because the amendment does not actually change funding levels and, \nso, does not upset the balance of priorities within this bill, I will \nnot oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, again I thank Mr. Simpson for recounting \nthat information and Ms. Kaptur for the leadership that she has given \nand the understanding of the plight that we are in.\n  Flood control is critical to dams and harbors, and it is most \ncritical of all as infrastructure. That is what the construction \nfunding will do. We understand that this now will give us the \nopportunity for long overdue projects that are dealing with major \nflooding.\n  The previous amendment giving us a work plan through the Army Corps \nof Engineers will again be instructive and helpful to saving lives and \nreducing the enormity of loss and the enormity of damage that has been \ncaused to these areas.\n  I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to carry out the memorandum from the White House \n     Counsel's Office to all Executive Department and Agency \n     General Counsels entitled ``Reminder Regarding Document \n     Requests'' dated April 15, 2009.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment which will prevent \nthe administration from causing unnecessary delays and blocking \nimportant information from being released to the general public under \nthe Freedom of Information Act.\n  In 2009, the White House released a secret memo to every executive \ndepartment and agency urging them to consult with counsel at the White \nHouse before releasing any documents or fulfilling any requests that \nmay involve ``White House equities.''\n  Last year the Department of Energy, Office of Inspector General, \nreleased a special report titled The Department of Energy's Freedom of \nInformation Act Process.\n  In this report, Federal investigators determined that, in numerous \ncases where the Department of Energy's general counsel had provided \ntheir FOIA response to the White House, ``the FOIA case file was \nincomplete and did not contain all of the documents related to the FOIA \nresponse.''\n  What does that mean, Mr. Chairman? As the report tells us, incomplete \ndocumentation in these cases prevents us from being absolutely certain \nwe know what changes or redactions were made when the White House \nreviewed the documents. Further, we don't know how many records \nrequests submitted to the Department of Energy were blocked by the \nWhite House.\n  For an administration that once sought to be the most transparent \nadministration in our Nation's history, actions such as these do \nnothing to inspire trust or confidence amongst the American people.\n  It took a FOIA request in 2014 to reveal that, out of more than 450 \nDepartment of the Interior inspector general requests, the Obama \nadministration only allowed the IG to release three reports.\n  While that stat is troubling, figures released by the Associated \nPress this year through their annual FOIA review are even more \ndisturbing. The annual review covers Freedom of Information Act \nrequests made to more than 100 different Federal agencies.\n  Shockingly, the AP reported in March that, in 2015, the American \npeople received censored responses or nothing in 77 percent of all FOIA \nrequests, redacted releases or nothing in response to nearly 600,000 \nFreedom of Information Act requests. Absolutely shameful.\n  Daniel Epstein, executive director of the nonprofit government \nwatchdog Cause of Action, said it best when he stated: ``Information \nseekers, whether they're individuals, members of the news media or \npublic interest groups, should be extremely troubled by the fact that \nthis White House has been interfering with how Federal agencies comply \nwith the Freedom of Information Act.''\n  This amendment is supported by Americans for Tax Reform; the Council \nfor Citizens Against Government Waste; the National Taxpayers Union; \nthe Taxpayers Protection Alliance; Concerned Citizens for America, \nArizona Chapter; the Gila County Cattle Growers Association; and the \nSulphur Springs Valley Electric Cooperative.\n  Agency officials that want to comply with the law and respond to \nFreedom of Information Act requests in a timely manner should not be \nblocked from doing so because of an arbitrary memo from the White \nHouse.\n  The Department of Energy IG and numerous government watchdog groups \nclaim the memo that my amendment defunds is limiting public access \nunder the Freedom of Information Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and defund this \nunlawful memo.\n  I also want to thank the distinguished chair and ranking member for \ntheir work on this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Poe of Texas). The gentlewoman from Ohio is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I am opposed to the amendment as the provision \ninterferes with the standard practice spanning administrations of both \nparties and raises potential constitutional concerns.\n  It is standard practice for agencies processing Freedom of \nInformation Act\n\n[[Page H3245]]\n\nrequests to confer with other executive branch entities with equities, \nincluding the White House, prior to releasing documents. Agencies refer \ndocuments to the White House just as they refer documents to other \nagencies.\n  The practice of agencies consulting with the White House prior to \nFreedom of Information Act requests regarding White House equities is \nlongstanding, spanning administrations of both parties. The Reagan \nadministration issued a memorandum in 1988 directing such consultation.\n  Finally, the provision could interfere with the President's ability \nto protect privileged information and thereby could raise \nconstitutional concerns in some applications. This is just one more \ninstance of the majority prioritizing message amendments rather than \ngetting on with the hard work of legislating.\n  I oppose this amendment. It has no place on an appropriations bill \nand should be defeated.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, once again I would like to just actually \nreiterate these responses. Seventy-seven percent of all FOIA requests \nwere not complied with. Redacted releases are nothing in response to \nnearly 600,000 Freedom of Information Act requests. Once again, smoke \nand mirrors. When are we going to get this?\n  I would ask everybody to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Engel\n\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Department of Energy, the Department of the \n     Interior, or any other Federal agency to lease or purchase \n     new light duty vehicles for any executive fleet, or for an \n     agency's fleet inventory, except in accordance with \n     Presidential Memorandum--Federal Fleet Performance, dated May \n     24, 2011.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, on May 24, 2011, President Obama issued a \nmemorandum on Federal fleet performance that required all new light-\nduty vehicles in the Federal fleet to be alternative fuel vehicles, \nsuch as hybrid, electric, natural gas, or biofuel.\n  My amendment echoes the President's memorandum by prohibiting funds \nin this act from being used to lease or purchase new light-duty \nvehicles unless that purchase is made in accord with the President's \nmemorandum.\n  I have submitted identical language to 20 different appropriations \nbills over the past few years, and every time it has been accepted by \nboth the majority and the minority. I hope my amendment will receive \nsimilar support today.\n  Global oil prices are down. We no longer pay $147 per barrel. But \nspikes in oil prices would still have profound repercussions for our \neconomy. The primary reason is that our cars and trucks run only on \npetroleum. We can change that with alternative technologies that exist \ntoday.\n  The Federal Government operates the largest fleet of light-duty \nvehicles in America, over 640,000 vehicles. More than 55,000 of those \nvehicles are within the jurisdiction of this bill, being used by the \nDepartment of Energy, the Department of the Interior, and the Army \nCorps of Engineers.\n  When I was in Brazil a few years ago, I saw how they diversified \ntheir fuel use. People there can drive to a gasoline station and choose \nwhether to fill their vehicle with gasoline or ethanol. They make their \nchoice based on cost or whatever criteria they deem important.\n  I want the same choice for American consumers. That is why I am \nproposing a bill in Congress, as I have done many times in the past, \nwhich will provide for cars built in America to be able to run on a \nfuel instead of or in addition to gasoline. It is less than $100 per \nvehicle. That is a separate issue, but I raise it because it is in \nconjunction with what I am proposing here. If they can do it in Brazil, \nwe can do it here.\n  So, in conclusion, expanding the role these alternative technologies \nplay in our transportation economy will help break the leverage that \nforeign government-controlled oil companies hold over Americans. It \nwill increase our Nation's domestic security and protect consumers.\n  Again, I have submitted this in different appropriations bills \nthrough the years, and it has always passed unanimously by both \nDemocrats and Republicans. I hope it will be the same.\n  I ask that my colleagues support the Engel amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Engel).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Department of Energy for the 21st Century \n     Clean Transportation Plan.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment which will help \nprevent an unnecessary tax increase on hardworking families and send a \nstrong message from the House of Representatives that we oppose the \nadministration's new mandatory climate change transportation program.\n  In February, the Obama administration proposed creating a new program \nnicknamed the 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan that aims to spend \n$320 billion over the next 10 years and divert precious taxpayer funds \nto self-driving cars, high-speed rail, and mass transit in the name of \npreserving the environment.\n  In fact, $20 billion of the estimated $32 billion each year for this \nproposed program won't go to roads or bridges, but instead will be \nsquandered on inefficient programs that require significant taxpayer \nsubsidies.\n  To pay for the majority of this unlawful $320 billion program, the \nObama administration has proposed a $10.25 tax on every barrel of oil. \nThis new tax on crude oil and petroleum products will inevitably be \npassed on to hardworking Americans that can't afford another new tax \nincrease from the Obama administration.\n  In fact, the $10.25 per-barrel tax is estimated to add an additional \n25 cents to the cost of every gallon of gasoline. Millions of energy-\nrelated jobs will be put at risk and low-income families will be forced \nto bear larger financial burdens as a result of this unnecessary tax \nthat is being proposed to pay for Obama's flawed climate change \ntransportation program.\n  In the Department of Energy's fiscal year 2017 budget, the agency \nrequested $1.3 billion for this year and $11.3 billion over the next 10 \nyears to fund the administration's 21st Century Clean Transportation \nPlan.\n  My amendment rejects the new $10.25 tax on every barrel of crude oil \nand prohibits funding in this bill for the administration's flawed \nclimate change transportation program.\n  This amendment is supported by Americans for Limited Government; \nAmericans for Tax Reform; the Council for Citizens Against Government \nWaste; the National Taxpayer Union; the Taxpayers Protection Alliance; \nConcerned Citizens for America, Arizona Chapter; the Gila County Cattle \nGrowers Association; and the Sulphur Springs Valley Electric \nCooperative.\n  I thank the distinguished chair and ranking member for their work on \nthis bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page H3246]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman has hit a very soft spot with \nme here, the automotive and trucking industries, so vital to my area of \nthe country and so vital to the whole economy.\n  Actually, the manufacturing part of America, as it recovers, is \nlifting us to new heights with economic growth. I rise in strong \nopposition to this amendment because, again, it takes America backward, \nnot forward.\n  This amendment seeks to prohibit funding for the Department of \nEnergy's 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan, which is a fantastic \ninitiative which would set America on a long-term path to achieving our \neconomic and climate goals.\n  I am telling you, when you see some of what is being done with new \nmaterials science, with new composites, with metals and plastics \ntechnologies, I can go from Ford's Ecoboost engine, to Chrysler's new \nvehicles, to Dana's new axle plant being built in the Midwest, to \nGeneral Motors and the wonderful work that they are doing at Brook \nPark. One plant after another, you can see the results of innovation \nwhere the Department of Energy, working with the private sector, is \nbringing the future to us every day.\n  The 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan would scale up clean \ntransportation research and development, critical for the clean \ntransportation systems of the future. Did you know that in the internal \ncombustion engine we still do not understand how fuel actually burns? \nThe Department of Energy is doing wonderful research to try to help \nimportant companies like Cummins Engine figure out how fuel is actually \nused in those engines to make them more efficient.\n  We have to talk about reducing the cost of batteries and developing \nlow-carbon fuels such as biofuels. We don't have all the answers. \nIndustry alone doesn't do it alone because some of this is basic \nresearch.\n  We also are involved in funding the development of regional low-\ncarbon fueling infrastructure, including charging stations for electric \nvehicles for those people who choose to purchase those and pumps for \nhydrogen fuel cell cars. Yes, we are inventing the future. You know \nwhat? It feels pretty good.\n  Finally, it would investigate future mobility and intelligent \ntransportation systems like vehicle connectivity and self-driving cars. \nLast week the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association was up here, \nand I went over to the northeastern part of the city, drove a Peterbilt \ntruck with Bendix technology and with the automatic braking systems \nthat are just incredible in a vehicle that has a cubic ratio of about \n480 cubic inches to that engine. What an incredible piece of \nengineering that is.\n  The Department of Energy is always driving us into the future, and \nthat is where we need to go. Our Nation has always been a leader on \ninnovation. To sustain this pace, we must continue to invest in \nprograms like the 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan, which drives \nour economy forward.\n  The automotive industry and all the related suppliers, including \ntrucks, represent about one out of every seven jobs in this country. We \nare in stiff competition with markets that are closed, with markets \nthat try to target our industry and snuff them out of existence. I \nthink that we have to do everything possible.\n  I co-chair the House Automotive Caucus here along with Congressman \nMike Kelly of Pennsylvania, and I would have to say that the \ngentleman's amendment does not take us forward, but backward.\n  I would urge my colleagues to oppose it very, very strongly.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I yield to the gentleman from Idaho.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments. \nGetting back to the amendment, I would remind the gentleman offering \nthe amendment, A, that this is not the tax committee, that any $10 tax \non a barrel of oil would come out of the Ways and Means Committee. I \ndon't see that coming out of the Ways and Means Committee, but it is \nnot included in this bill.\n  The other thing that I would remind the gentleman of is there is no--\nI repeat no--funding in this bill for the President's 21st Century \nClean Transportation Plan, the mandatory funding that was proposed by \nthe administration. There is no funding in this bill for it; so, this \namendment does nothing. It strikes no funding because there is no \nfunding in this bill.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I want to remind everybody that $20 billion \nof the estimated $32 billion each year for this proposed program won't \ngo to roads or bridges, but to these inefficient programs.\n  I guess we are going to the future. We are $19 trillion in debt and \nsoon to be $22 trillion and $23 trillion and $24 trillion in debt. Yes, \nI do understand, in the Department of Energy's fiscal year 2017 budget, \nthe agency requested $1.3 billion for this year and $11.3 billion over \nthe next 10 years to fund the administration's 21st Century Clean \nTransportation Plan.\n  Now, while the budget request this year happened to be mandatory, \nnext year it could be discretionary. The House has not taken action to \ndate to reject the $10.25 tax on every barrel of oil and to this \nfundamentally flawed program.\n  My amendment rejects that tax increase and the Obama administration's \nnew climate change transportation program.\n  I urge adoption of this commonsense amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Sanford\n\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to provide a loan under section 136 of the Energy \n     Independence and Security Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17013).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chair, I think what I have before all of us is a \ncommonsense amendment. It simply says that the advanced technology \nvehicle manufacturing loan program will continue to exist, but there \ncan be no additional loans.\n  The reason that I do so is, when I came and offered this amendment \nlast year, I had a cutting amendment last year, but what was explained \nto me was that, if you cut the program, then you wouldn't have money to \nadminister the existing loans that were out there.\n  So, as a result, I have altered this amendment so that it again \nleaves in place the appropriation, which is more than $5 million, so \nthat you could continue to administer the existing loans that are in \nplace, but there would be no additional loans.\n  Now, why do I think that that is important? I think it is important \nfor a couple different reasons. I think, from a Democratic standpoint, \nwhat we would say is that we all believe in equality and that there \nshouldn't be subsidized loans for major corporations, global \ncorporations, here in the United States while your cousin's pizza \nbusiness is struggling or your friend's landscaping business is \nstruggling. They don't get subsidized loans. Why should a big business?\n  So, from a Democratic standpoint, I think we would hold that belief. \nFrom a Republican standpoint, we would say we need to watch out for the \ntaxpayer.\n  If you look at the default rate on these loans, unfortunately, it has \nbeen relatively high. You would say: I don't know if government is in \nthe best spot to be making these kinds of loans to businesses.\n  I think that ultimately is the role not of government, but of \nbusiness. Let them do what they do. I think from both vantage points it \nis something that makes sense.\n  I would add just a couple of additional thoughts and then I would \nyield.\n  I would say, one, there have been only five loans made since 2007. \nThis is\n\n[[Page H3247]]\n\nnot a huge program. This is a very limited program.\n  Two, two out of the five loans made since 2007, in fact, have \ndefaulted. That is a 40 percent default rate. I don't think that that \nis the kind of thing that we would like to see in government.\n  There have been no loans made since 2011. And then the GAO came in \nMarch of 2013 and said the costs outweigh the benefits of this program.\n  They followed that up with another GAO report in March of 2014 and \nsaid: We recommend shutting down the program unless the Department of \nEnergy can show real demand for the loans.\n  Then they followed that up with a final GAO report in March of this \nyear, and it said that there hadn't been a sufficient level of demand.\n  As a consequence, their words were this: Determining whether funds \nwill be used is important, particularly in a constrained fiscal \nenvironment. This Congress should rescind unused appropriations or \ndirect them to other government priorities.\n  I think the simple issue with this loan program is that there could \nbe other priorities where you take that $4 billion of loan authority \nand let other parts of government use it or turn it back to the private \nsector and use that money much more effectively.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I \nam not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Idaho is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I just want to state that I don't want \npeople who may be listening to this, other Members who may be listening \nto this, to get the impression that we are putting money in here for \nthe Loan Guarantee Program.\n  There is no money in the underlying bill for the ATVM additional new \nloans. The only money in there is to administer the existing loans.\n  I understand what the gentleman is saying. I agree with the \ngentleman. I just don't want Members to think that we are putting money \ninto the program when we are not.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chair, I very, very much appreciate what the \nchairman pointed out. Again, that is why I think it is so important to \nsimply codify this notion that we won't go forward.\n  The money is in there for administration of existing loans. It is \njust saying that we are not going to go out and administer new ones, \ngiven the other needs that exist within both the public and the private \nsector for funds like this.\n  Mr. Chair, I will reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment. Any proposal to sunset the Advanced Technology Vehicle \nManufacturing Program or limit the pipeline of projects that may be \neligible is shortsighted and should be rejected.\n  Why? First, the program is a critical one for the American automotive \nindustry and has supported its resurgence. They have issued more than \n$8 billion in loans to date, and these loans have resulted in the \nmanufacture of more than 4 million fuel-efficient advanced vehicles, \nsupported approximately 35,000 direct jobs across eight States, \nincluding California, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Kentucky, New \nYork, and Tennessee, and saved more than 1.35 million gallons of \ngasoline. Not too bad.\n  The success has been achieved with losses of only approximately 2 \npercent of a total portfolio of $32 billion for the loan programs \noffice. That is a lower percent than most banks have on the loans that \nthey make. What we are talking about here is higher level research, \nhigher level investments in technologies that are yet being born.\n  Why else should we reject this amendment? Instituting an arbitrary \nand immediate deadline for applications to this program would result in \nthe Department losing billions of dollars in loan authority itself. The \nprogram currently has billions in loan requests in the pipeline from \nboth automakers and component manufacturers for projects in 10 States.\n  Thirdly, capping the program of eligible projects will hinder the \nDepartment's ability to issue new loans to support domestic \nmanufacturing of advanced vehicles especially at a time when we are \nasking the industry to meet rising fuel economy standards.\n  It is really amazing what has been done just in the last 15 years. \nWhen we look at some of the vehicles coming out now, we are seeing \nvehicles like the Cruze, 33 miles a gallon. Some are going up to 40, \nsome to 50. It is really amazing what has happened, the transformation \nthat is happening in this industry that we are living through directly.\n  I oppose the gentleman's amendment because I really do believe \ninnovation has always led us into the future. This is the kind of \nprogram that can provide the capital necessary to expand our domestic \nmanufacturing when so much of it is being offshored. It is a major \nissue in the Presidential election this year in both political parties, \nhow we are going to restore manufacturing in this country.\n  We have to do it through innovation. We have to do it in sectors that \nare muscle sectors like the automotive and truck industry that are so \nvital and produce real wealth for this country, not imported wealth, \nbut wealth that we produce ourselves through all the componentry, the \nthousands and thousands and thousands of components that go into these \nvehicles, and the fuel efficiency that makes them competitive in the \nmarketplace of today.\n  I oppose the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chair, I would agree with much of what my colleague \nsaid just a moment ago. I think that innovation is, indeed, the gateway \nto the future, but I would argue that great innovation has been led by \nthe private sector, not by loan guarantees to major corporations.\n  You think about Steve Jobs and his partner opening up that business \nin basically what amounted to the basement of a house. That is not what \nwe are talking about here. I think some of the great innovations will \ncome from small businesses that don't see this kind of financial \nadvantage.\n  Two, I would make the point that this is not about just helping \nAmerican companies. One of the largest loans out there was to Mazda, \nwhich is not an American company. Ford is--that is one of the other big \nloans, but Mazda is not.\n  I would put this in the larger classification of Reagan's words: The \nclosest thing to eternal life is a government program.\n  This is one of those government programs that has not proved \nsuccessful, and I think it is important that we wean government \nprograms. We prune them where they don't make sense.\n  Forty percent is, in fact, the default rate. If you add up all the \nnumbers, it amounts to 2 percent. But most people when they think of \ndefault and what the American Bankers Association would think of when \nthey think of default is divided by the number of loans out there, what \npercent defaulted, and that number happens to be a real 40 percent, not \n2 percent of the aggregate amount of the total loans out there.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  Finally, I would again go back to this simple point. I agree with my \ncolleagues about what they have said on the need for innovation and for \nreform, but I don't think it will be led through a loan program that \nhas seen any number of defaults in the process. That money could be \nredeployed to education and a whole host of our primary needs in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Buck\n\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to research, draft,\n\n[[Page H3248]]\n\n     propose, or finalize the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that \n     was published by the Department of Energy on December 19, \n     2014, at 79 Fed. Reg. 76,142, titled, ``Energy Conservation \n     Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Residential \n     Dishwashers'', the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that was \n     published by the Department of Energy on August 13, 2015, at \n     80 Fed. Reg. 48,624, titled, ``Energy Conservation Program: \n     Energy Conservation Standards for Ceiling Fan Light Kits'', \n     or the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that was published by \n     the Department of Energy on August 19, 2015, at 80 Fed. Reg. \n     50,462, titled, ``Energy Conservation Program: Energy \n     Conservation Standards for Refrigerated Bottled or Canned \n     Vending Machines''.\n\n  Mr. BUCK (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to \nwaive the reading.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, this amendment returns choice to consumers \nand keeps the price of products affordable.\n  The Department of Energy's energy conservation program issues \nefficiency regulations for everyday appliances like dishwashers and \nvending machines. The rules are based on a cost-benefit analysis, but \nthe analysis is vague and skewed to the desired outcome. Rather than \nimproving the lives of consumers, these mandates drive up the cost of \nappliances.\n  To address the rising costs and the crackdown on consumer choice, \nthis amendment prohibits energy mandates on residential dishwashers, \nceiling fan light kits, and vending machines. Individuals should have a \nchoice of whether or not to buy these appliances.\n  As consumer demand for efficiency increases, the market will find a \nway to produce appliances that save more energy. This amendment stops \nthe administration from implementing their radical green energy agenda \non the backs of American families.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. \nSimpson).\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. My colleague's \namendment would prohibit the use of funds at the Department of Energy \nto propose efficiency standards for ceiling fan light kits, residential \ndishwashers, and vending machines.\n  Mr. Chairman, the law in question allows for executive overreach by \nprescribing what industry can and cannot sell and what consumers can \nand cannot buy. Industry has legitimate concerns about the government \nforcing a wholesale change to a market for something as common as a \ndishwasher. This amendment reins back this overreaching regulation, and \nI support this amendment and recommend my colleagues vote ``yes.''\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I oppose the gentleman's amendment. It is just \none more instance where the majority is saddling the consumer with \never-increasing energy bills. We know how the standards have really \nsaved consumers money over the years. I have some figures here that are \nvery interesting.\n  A typical household saves about $216 a year off their energy bills \nnow as a result of renewed standards. As people replace their \nappliances with newer models, they can expect to save more than $453 \nannually by 2030. The cumulative utility bill savings to consumers from \nall standards in effect since 1987 are estimated to be nearly $1 \ntrillion by 2020 and grow to nearly $2 trillion through 2030.\n  Invention does matter. And the application of that to our daily life \nreally matters. The efficiency standards have spurred innovation that \ndramatically expanded options for consumers. It is time to choose \ncommon sense over rigid ideology, and it is time to listen to the \nmanufacturing companies, consumer groups, and efficiency advocates, who \nall agree this rider is harmful.\n  I urge all Members to vote ``no'' on the Buck amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 14 Offered by Mrs. Blackburn\n\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  Each amount made available by this Act is hereby \n     reduced by 1 percent.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I know that the committee has worked \nhard to get a bill that is going to come into the numbers. \nUnfortunately, I disagree with the $1.070 trillion number that is in \nthe Bipartisan Budget Act. I like the Budget Control Act's number of \n$1.040 trillion.\n  A $30 billion difference doesn't sounds like a lot when you are \ntalking about trillions of dollars, but I tell you, to my constituents, \nwith $19 trillion debt, it does make a difference.\n  The funding level of this bill is $37.444 billion. I will be offering \nan amendment, which I offer every year to our spending bills, to cut 1 \npercent across the board. That would yield us $374 million in budget \nauthority savings, and outlays savings of $222 million.\n  I know it doesn't sound like a lot, but it is simply taking one penny \nout of every dollar that is appropriated. And that, quite frankly, is \nthe type of scrimping and saving that our constituents and American \nfamilies are having to do all across this country in order to make \ntheir budgets work.\n  I am fully aware of the strong opposition that many have to making \nthose 1 percent across-the-board cuts. As I have offered these \namendments, many times I am told that cuts of this magnitude go far too \ndeep, that they would be very damaging to our Nation's security, but I \nkind of agree with Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mullin when he said \nthe greatest threat to our Nation's security is our Nation's debt.\n  I think we ought not to be putting future generations at risk, and we \nshould be working toward reducing what our Federal outlays are every \nsingle year and working toward balancing the budget. It means yes, we \nhave to go in and cut that penny out of a dollar and save it for our \nchildren and our grandchildren to get this Nation back on the right \ntrack.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I commend the gentlewoman for her \nconsistency. She always has these amendments to cut 1 percent across \nthe board out of the appropriations bills, and I appreciate her \nconsistent work to protect the taxpayer dollars, but this is an \napproach that, frankly, I can't support.\n  While the President may have proposed a budget that exceeds this \nbill, the increases were paid for with proposals and gimmicks that \nwould never be enacted. This bill makes the tough choices within an \nallocation that adheres to current law.\n  You may not agree with current law, but it is the current law, and \nthat is what we had to go with. Since there wasn't a budget resolution \npassed, what we ended up with is current law; and that is the \nallocation that we have, and that is what we stayed within.\n  I don't think the Appropriations Committee gets enough credit over \nthe last several years for the work we have been doing in reducing \nFederal spending.\n  If you look at the total Federal budget and the amount of \ndiscretionary spending and mandatory spending, at one time it was about \ntwo-thirds discretionary spending and one-third mandatory spending 30 \nor 40 years ago. Then, about 5 years ago, it was one-third \ndiscretionary spending and two-thirds mandatory spending. That is \nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security entitlements.\n\n[[Page H3249]]\n\n  Since we have taken control the last 5 years, that one-third of the \nbudget that is discretionary spending is about 28 percent now. As it \ncontinues to go down in relationship to the entire budget, we cut \ndiscretionary spending more and more.\n  We have made difficult tradeoffs that had to be made in this bill to \nbalance it with our needs. We prioritize funding for critical \ninfrastructure and for our national defense. These tradeoffs were \ncarefully weighed for their respective impacts and are responsible. Yet \nthe gentlewoman's amendment imposes an across-the-board cut on every \none of these programs, even the national defense programs, which are \nvitally important.\n  This makes no distinction between where we need to be spending to \ninvest in our infrastructure, promote jobs, and meet our national \nsecurity needs, like meeting the Ohio-class submarine dates so that we \ncan get the Ohio-class submarine done, so that we can do the \nrefurbishment of our nuclear stockpile, so that we can do the other \nthings that are important on the national defense side of this budget.\n  It makes no distinction between those and where we need to limit \nspending to meet our deficit reduction goals. Therefore, I must oppose \nthis amendment and urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, indeed, the Appropriations Committee \ndoes deserve some credit. But also, passing the Budget Control Act with \nthe 2 percent across-the-board spending reduction in discretionary \nspending deserves some credit also, because it shows the effectiveness \nof what those cuts can do.\n  Governors use this, Democratic and Republican alike. They do it \nbecause their States have balanced budget amendments, and they can't \ncrank up the printing press and print the money.\n  I would encourage my colleagues to take a step toward fiscal \nresponsibility, get inside and cut one more penny out of a dollar. We \ncan do that on every appropriation that we have.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Army Corps of Engineers to implement, \n     administer, or enforce the last four words of subparagraph \n     (B) of section 1341(a)(1) of title 31, United States Code, \n     with respect to crevassing of levees under the Birds Point-\n     New Madrid Floodway Operations Plan.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Missouri and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, in May of 2011, under the strong \nobjections of numerous folks in southeast Missouri and my predecessor, \nthe Army Corps of Engineers activated the Birds Point levee, which is \nthe second time since 1937. This resulted in an extensive amount of \ndamage: over $156 million worth of damage and flooding of over 130,000 \nacres. In that place, homes and communities were completely destroyed \nand crops were lost.\n  After the water receded, many residents simply chose not to ever \nreturn home and back to their community. These are individuals that \nlived there for numerous generations. One community, a small town \ncalled Pinhook in Mississippi County, right in the boot heel, that no \nlonger exists after the activation of that floodway.\n  The amendment that I have today is quite simple, Mr. Chairman. It \nsays, when an activation of the Birds Point levee occurs, we must build \nit back. Not anything else other than if there is an activation, the \ngovernment must build it back. If they destroy a community by \nactivating and blowing up a levee, they must build it back. The \namendment is extremely simple.\n  Had families in the Birds Point floodway had the assurance that a \nplan was already in place, perhaps they would have chosen to return \nback to their home for generations.\n  When river levels rise, safety is always the number one concern. But \nthe Corps of Engineers should never, under any circumstances, breach a \nlevee without already having in place plans for its restoration, \nallowing for residents to return to their lives as soon as possible.\n\n                              {time}  2145\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and give assurance to \nAmericans who live in floodways that their homes and livelihoods \nmatter, and to remove any uncertainty that, should the worst happen, \ntheir lives can return to normal.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  First, let me assure the gentleman that I understand his concerns and \nappreciate his passion for protecting his constituents. I agree with \nhim that, if the floodway is required to be operated in a major flood \nevent, the levee should be restored as soon as possible after the flood \nevent. In fact, the committee report on this bill makes that very \npoint.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment and the impacts of it are not clear. It \nis possible that the amendment would actually increase flood risks for \nother communities within the Mississippi River and tributaries project \narea.\n  Without understanding the effects of the amendment, I must oppose it.\n  Mr. BOST. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Chairman, I do stand in opposition, reluctant \nopposition. I have a tremendous respect for the gentleman from \nMissouri. I understand what he is trying to do, and that is that if the \nactivation of the Birds Point levee does occur, that it should be built \nback.\n  But when you read the language, the concern I have is that it would \nactually stop the activation of the levee in the first place.\n  Understand, when these levees were first built, there were certain \nkey points that were pressure release valves. The Birds Point was one \nof those. So as it rises, the Army Corps of Engineers has explained \nthrough a process of when to go in. And when we say crevasse, we mean \nwe have to actually put explosive charges into the levee to relieve the \npressure so that other areas--this is the way the system was built. It \nwas designed by engineers to work this way originally.\n  The concern that we have is not with the fact that it should be built \nback, because I agree with the gentleman it should be built back. But \nthe way the language actually reads, we are not sure that it would \nactually stop the Army Corps of Engineers from doing what it is that \nthey are required by law to do, and that is to use that pressure \nrelease valve in times of emergency.\n  It is true, we have only had to use it twice since those systems have \nbeen put in place. It is a sad thing when it occurs. It floods a \ntremendous amount of crop land, and because it had not been operated in \nso long, people had built homes in there. Now, that was unfortunate \nthat they built them in that situation, but we cannot endanger all \nother areas for putting language like this forward. I am more than \nwilling to work with the gentleman on trying to make sure that this \nlanguage is correct. We just couldn't be able to do that at this time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, the language of the amendment is \nvery clear, very clear. It does one simple thing. It means, if the \nactivation of this levee ever occurs, that the Federal Government is \nobligated to rebuild it.\n\n[[Page H3250]]\n\n  It is a limiting amendment that is crystal clear. It provides that, \nif there is an activation, that the Federal Government is obligated to \nbuild it back, simple as it is, making sure the Federal Government is \nresponsible for its actions.\n  I ask the body to support the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Missouri \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Walker\n\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. (a) The amounts otherwise made available by this \n     Act for the following accounts of the Department of Energy \n     are hereby reduced by the following amounts:\n       (1) ``Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy'', $400,000.\n       (2) ``Nuclear Energy'', $25,455,000.\n       (3) ``Fossil Energy Research and Development'', \n     $13,000,000.\n       (4) ``Strategic Petroleum Reserve'', $45,000,000.\n       (5) ``Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup'', $2,400,000.\n       (6) ``Science'', $49,800,000.\n       (7) ``Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy'', \n     $14,889,000.\n       (b) The amounts otherwise made available by this Act for \n     the following accounts are hereby reduced by the following \n     amounts:\n       (1) ``Power Marketing Administrations--Construction, \n     Rehabilitation, Operation and Maintenance, Western Area Power \n     Administration'', $2,209,000.\n       (2) ``Nuclear Regulatory Commission--Salaries and \n     Expenses'', $32,132,000.\n\n  Mr. WALKER (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nto suspend the reading of the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chairman, this bill includes over $9 billion in \nappropriations for 22 nondefense programs that are not authorized by \nlaw. Nine of these programs receive a total of $185 million more than \ntheir enacted 2016 level. Several of these programs have not been \nauthorized since the 1980s, and one has never been authorized by \nCongress.\n  My amendment is simple. My amendment would reduce unauthorized \nnondefense accounts to the 2016 levels. My amendment would also cut \naround $185 million and send that money to the spending reduction \naccount.\n  In a time when we, as a Nation, are approaching close to $20 trillion \nin debt, we cannot continue to fund unauthorized accounts in our \nappropriations process. This is a democratic Nation, and the men and \nwomen send the Members of this body, not to slip unauthorized programs \nin appropriations bills, but to have an open discussion on our funding \npriorities.\n  Furthermore, the inclusion of appropriations for these programs in \nthe reported bill is a violation of clause(2)(a)(1) of rule XXI of the \nrules of the House.\n  I applaud Representative Tom McClintock and Conference Chair Cathy \nMcMorris Rodgers for their significant work to raise awareness of the \nproblem of unauthorized appropriations and work towards a solution so \nthat the House actually enforces its rules.\n  This year's Energy and Water appropriations includes over $1 billion \nin appropriations, and six more unauthorized programs that the House \ndid pass in the 2016 Energy and Water bill from last year.\n  If we want to fund a program, we should have an open debate and a \ntransparent process that promotes trust and accountability.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose this amendment. My \ncolleague's amendment would reduce multiple accounts in the bill.\n  This year, the committee continues its responsibility to effectively \nmanage government spending, and we have worked tirelessly to that end. \nFor example, the nuclear and fossil programs see modest increases in \nthe bill to continue our commitment for an all-of-the-above energy \nstrategy.\n  Basic research conducted by the Office of Science is increased by \nless than 1 percent, to support research and operation efforts to \nadvance research and development through university partnerships and at \nthe Nation's national laboratory system.\n  Programs to clean up the legacy of the Manhattan Project and nuclear \nresearch also see minor increases in order to provide cleanup progress \nat sites across the country. These are targeted funds to produce needed \ninvestments to efficiently and safely utilize our natural resources, \nmaintain the Nation's basic research infrastructure in the physical \nsciences, and continue the cleanup of Department of Energy legacy \nprograms.\n  I understand my colleague's desire to reduce the size of government, \nbut this amendment goes too far in reducing the strategic investments \nwe need to make in our future.\n  I, therefore, oppose this amendment, and I urge Members to do the \nsame.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I also oppose this amendment, which will reduce jobs in our country \nand hurt the middle class. There will be less investment in science, \nenvironmental cleanup, energy research and development, all of which \ncreate the future in this country, and have substantial returns on \ninvestments.\n  Since 2003, by the way, the United States has spent $2.3 trillion on \nimporting foreign petroleum. This is a vast shift of wealth. That is \nthe big shift of wealth, and thousands upon thousands of jobs from our \ncountry elsewhere. This amendment only exacerbates this shift of wealth \nfrom the American middle class.\n  The bill funds support in science and R activities necessary for \nour competitiveness. The world is becoming more competitive, not less. \nEnergy is at the center of that.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wyoming \n(Mrs. Lummis).\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Scientific research is an important province of the Federal \nGovernment, and normally I support it; but I support it if it has been \nauthorized.\n  The programs the gentleman from North Carolina has identified have \nnot been authorized. Therefore, it is appropriate that the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina be supported in his amendment to just reduce them \nto the amount that gets us to flat funding. Flat funding is a \nreasonable request for programs that are not authorized.\n  Let's get those programs reauthorized, if that is what the American \npeople want, and the Congress wants, and let's do it in a way that \nmakes sure these programs are authorized in a way that recognizes 21st \ncentury priority.\n  That should happen at the authorizing committee level. If it doesn't \nhappen at the authorizing committee level, a couple of things are \nwrong: either the authorizing committee doesn't have its hands on \nthe steering wheel, or the authorizing committee thinks there needs to \nbe changes that cannot be accomplished if the appropriators keep \nincreasing the funding.\n\n  The incentive for the authorizing committee comes when these programs \nare flat-funded. We should not be funding programs with increases that \nare no longer authorized.\n  This is a problem throughout government. It is a way to save money in \na\n\n[[Page H3251]]\n\ngovernment that is $19 trillion in debt, and I applaud the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina for his conscientious, careful, thoughtful, \nreasoned amendment.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It simply rolls \nback or reduces unauthorized nondefense accounts to the 2016 levels.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, let me respond and tell the story again. \nWe have already gone through this once tonight about authorizations. I \ndon't think we should fund any program that isn't authorized. I don't \nthink we should flat-fund it. I don't think we should fund it. But that \nis, unfortunately, what the Appropriations Committee ends up doing \nbecause the authorizing committees aren't doing their dang job. They \nare not getting out and reauthorizing the programs.\n  One year--and I will tell the story again. I will tell it again and \nagain, I suspect, as we go through all of this--when I was chairman of \nthe Interior Committee, because the Endangered Species Act at that time \nhad not been reauthorized for 23 years, 23 years, I took all funding \nfor listing of endangered species and designation of critical habitat \nout of the bill, zero funded it.\n  We brought the bill to the floor. The biggest supporter of my bill \nand opponent to the amendment to put funding in it for those purposes \nwas the chairman of the Resources Committee. It is the Resources \nCommittee's responsibility to reauthorize the Endangered Species Act. \nBut he supported my amendment.\n  And after all of that, guess what? They still haven't reauthorized \nthe Endangered Species Act.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Wyoming.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. This year, the Land and Water Conservation Fund expired \nin its authorization on September 30. In October, we began \nreauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund and reforming it to \nget it back to its original intent. And before we could complete the \nprocess, the appropriators increased funding and reauthorized it for 3 \nyears.\n  We can't get the reforms we need when appropriators continue to \nappropriate. The burden should be on the authorizers.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Yes, I agree with the gentlewoman. The burden should be \non the authorizers, and they should do their job, and they should \nreauthorize the program.\n  I still haven't seen the reauthorization for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. That was last year. I still haven't seen it. I \nhaven't seen the reauthorizations for any of the programs. The whole \nState Department is unauthorized.\n  Where is the reauthorization?\n  What do you want us to do?\n  We would eliminate about two-thirds of the Federal Government. Now, \nsome people might like that. But we would eliminate about two-thirds of \nthe Federal Government if we just said we are not going to fund any of \nthe Federal programs.\n  So, I mean, it is a debate that goes on.\n  I agree with Congressman McClintock. We have to find a way around \nthis. We have to find a way to address the reauthorization issue \nwithout screwing up the whole appropriation process.\n\n                              {time}  2200\n\n  I think we can do that if reasonable people sit down and try to find \na way around this. I actually think that every committee chairman ought \nto sit down with leadership at the start of a session and say: This is \nmy 5-year plan, and these are all of the programs that are unauthorized \nunder my jurisdiction. This is my 5-year plan to get them reauthorized.\n  They ought to follow through on that work plan.\n  Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North \nCarolina will be postponed.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. DeSantis\n\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the finds made available by this Act may \n     be used to purchase heavy water from Iran.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Chairman, to be clear, the JCPOA requires Iran to \ncap its stockpile of heavy water. It does not require the U.S. to \nsubsidize or to purchase that heavy water.\n  This is a simple funding limitation amendment to an appropriations \nbill. It is similar to language used throughout the bill. It is a \nmatter clearly related to the use of appropriated funds.\n  I listened to this debate in the Senate, and people said: Well, we \nhave to spend U.S. tax dollars on getting heavy water; otherwise, Iran \nis going to sell it to North Korea. But understand, it is already \nagainst international law to ship heavy water to North Korea. So if \nIran were to decide to do that and violate those sanctions, we have a \nway bigger policy issue than simply heavy water purchases, and it would \ncall into question the entire Iran deal.\n  So instead of suppressing illicit nuclear proliferation among rogue \nnations, continuing purchases of Iranian heavy water would subsidize \nIran's nuclear program and allow them to maintain the threshold \ncapacity to make a dash for nuclear breakout.\n  If we want to take heavy water, then we can take it, but we should \nnot subsidize Iran's nuclear program.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the gentleman's amendment. Really, \nthis provision doesn't belong on this appropriations bill. It is an \nissue best considered by the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  This amendment would prevent the Department from spending any fiscal \n17 funds to purchase heavy water produced in Iran and would undermine \nthe Iran deal.\n  This transaction provides the United States industry with a critical \nproduct while enabling Iran to sell some of its excess heavy water as \ncontemplated in the agreement and further ensuring that this product \nwill not be used to develop a nuclear weapon, which is the objective \nthat we all sought when we supported the agreement. Heavy water is \nneeded here in our country. We stopped producing it in 1988 and now buy \nwhat we need from India and other countries.\n  A portion of this heavy water will be used at the Spallation Neutron \nSource at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and by manufacturers for \nfiberoptic cable, MRI machines, and semiconductors.\n  Most importantly, U.S. purchase of this heavy water prevents Iran \nfrom selling it to those who would choose to use it for the wrong \nreasons.\n  Mr. Chairman, as I have stated, I object to this amendment as \nproposed. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the DeSantis \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. It is interesting, Mr. Chair, people talk about the \nIran deal, and what the administration has really been doing is they \nhave even gone beyond the concessions that are in the Iran deal.\n  If you look at getting access now to dollarized transactions, they \nsaid they weren't going to have access to the American financial \nsystem, but effectively, Iran is going to have indirect\n\n[[Page H3252]]\n\naccess to the American dollar. That was never called for by the Iran \ndeal. That is a concession. Nor does the deal require us to spend \nAmerican taxpayer funds to essentially inject into the Iranian regime \nand subsidize the nuclear program.\n  So, Mr. Chair, I think it is a good amendment. I think our Members \nshould vote for it.\n  I yield back the balance of time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings \nwill now resume on those amendments on which further proceedings were \npostponed, in the following order:\n  Amendment by Mr. Weber of Texas.\n  Amendment by Mr. Ellison of Minnesota.\n  Amendment No. 1 by Mr. Farr of California.\n  Amendment by Mr. Garamendi of California.\n  Amendment No. 34 by Mr. Pittenger of North Carolina.\n  Amendment by Mr. Gosar of Arizona.\n  Amendment by Mr. Foster of Illinois.\n  Amendment by Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, as amended.\n  Amendment by Mr. Byrne of Alabama.\n  Amendment No. 14 by Mrs. Blackburn of Tennessee.\n  Amendment by Mr. Smith of Missouri.\n  Amendment by Mr. Walker of North Carolina.\n  Amendment by Mr. DeSantis of Florida.\n  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the time for any electronic vote \nafter the first vote in this series.\n\n\n                Amendment Offered by Mr. Weber of Texas\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a \nrecorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nWeber) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which the \nnoes prevailed by voice vote.\n  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

One of our experts indicated that \nthey didn't know how dangerous the Zika virus will be.\n  Madam Speaker, it is important that we do our job. It is appropriate \nto take the President's request and pass it--$1.9 billion--to do our \njob to fight the Zika virus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/house-section/article/H3262-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOUSE AMENDMENTS TO S. 2012\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, with the House amendments to S. 2012, \nCalifornia is moving in the direction of doing responsible management \nof California's water resources.\n  Since this House has taken action, it is now up to California's \nSenators to no longer ignore the crisis facing our State.\n  We have heard a lot about California's water woes. Some falsely claim \nthis bill prioritizes one area over another. But, also, it includes \ninstead the strongest possible protections for northern California's \narea of origin and senior water rights.\n  It safeguards the most fundamental water right of all. Those who live \nwhere water originates will have access to it. Northern California \nwater districts and farmers are strongly in support of this bill.\n  This measure accelerates surface water storage infrastructure \nprojects, such as Sites Reservoir, which this year would have saved 1 \nmillion acre-feet of water had it been in place already. We can't \nexpect 40 million people to survive on infrastructure designed \ngenerations ago.\n  We have heard wild claims about how this measure could cause harm to \nthe Endangered Species Act. But, in reality, it lives within the \nEndangered Species Act and biological opinions.\n  Wildlife agencies currently base orders to cut off water to people on \nhunches, not data. This bill would provide actual facts to end the \narbitrary decisions we have seen in recent years.\n  Finally, it allows more water to be stored and used during winter \nstorms, when river flows are highest and there is no impact to fish \npopulations.\n  The delta outflows surpassed record numbers this year. As a result, \nvery little water actually got saved and much was wasted, which could \nbe in the San Luis Reservoir.\n  We have to change these policies and save the people's water for \nCalifornia with smarter management.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/house-section/article/H3262-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Duffy (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today after 7:00 p.m. \nand for the balance of the week on account of the birth of his child.\n  Mr. Lamborn (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today after 7:00 \np.m. and for the balance of the week on account of attending his son's \ngraduation from Harvard Law School.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/house-section/article/H3262-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BILL PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Karen L.
