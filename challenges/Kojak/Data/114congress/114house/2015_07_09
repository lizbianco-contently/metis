The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. One of the most difficult and challenging situations \nany family faces is dealing with circumstances surrounding the end of \nlife.\n  Earlier this week, NPR ran a fascinating story on a little-known fact \nthat physicians die differently than the rest of us. They are more \ncomfortable. They are more likely to spend their final days surrounded \nby loved ones. They seldom die in an ICU or even in a hospital setting. \nThat is because doctors understand what works and what doesn't. Doctors \nare very clear about their wishes, and they choose quality of life and \nconcern for their families as well as their own well-being.\n  I have been working in this area of end of life care for more than 6 \nyears. The Ways and Means committee unanimously approved my legislation \nas part of the Affordable Care Act to provide greater support for \nfamilies with that decisionmaking process.\n  It did pass the committee unanimously as part of the Affordable Care \nAct, even despite the furor of the 2009 lie of the year about death \npanels, on the strength of some of the most compelling testimony that \nwas delivered not by expert witnesses, but by Members of the committee.\n  One of our Republican Members discussed how his mother didn't get the \ncare that she needed at the end of her life. Another physician Member \nof the committee explained how he had these conversations repeatedly, \nbut unfortunately they were often much later than they should have \nbeen. There wasn't adequate time for the family to prepare.\n  Well, there has been a sea change on this issue in part because of \nrising public awareness. Support for our bipartisan legislation, the \nPersonalize Your Care Act, which I have worked on for years now with \nDr. Phil Roe, has made great strides forward.\n  We have had advocates like Dr. Bill Frist, former Republican leader \nof the Senate, who has spoken eloquently and written forcefully about \nthe need to help families under these trying conditions.\n  The Reverend Billy Graham has written about how it is Christian \nresponsibility to take this on for ourselves and spare our loved ones \nuncertainty.\n  Dr. Atul Gawande recently published a brilliant work, ``Being \nMortal,'' which quickly climbed to the top of the best seller list for \nThe New York Times.\n  The Institute of Medicine has put out a seminal, over 600-page report \nabout dying in America that talked about the problems and opportunities \nto provide more choices and protect people's wishes.\n  Yesterday was another important landmark where the administration \npublished a proposed fee schedule for next year in which they have \nassigned an activity code with payment for advanced care planning.\n  Now, of course, this is merely a proposal and CMS is still seeking \ncomment, but it is a historic step forward for a decision that will be \nfinalized this fall. It is yet another indication that we can and will \ndo a better job of meeting the needs of America's families under the \nmost difficult of circumstances.\n  We will make sure Americans have all the information they need to \nmake the right decisions for themselves and their family and then to \nassure that those decisions, whatever they may be, are honored and \nenforced.\n  Medicare will pay for thousands of expensive medical procedures, and \nnow, for the first time, the government is placing a value on this \nimportant conversation between a patient and their chosen medical \nprofessional.\n  Now it is the job of the rest of us to do our part to spare our loved \nones. Who will speak for us if we are unable to speak for ourselves, \nand what will they say?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4959-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4959-H4960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROPOSED FIDUCIARY STANDARDS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Jolly) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, most economists and financial advisers have \nrecognized that families across the United States are headed toward a\n\n[[Page H4960]]\n\nmajor retirement crisis. Studies have shown that a majority of \nhouseholds headed by someone aged 59 or younger are in danger of \nsuffering from falling living standards in their retirement years.\n  And so the administration and this Congress should be advancing \npolicies that make retirement counseling, savings advice, and \ninvestment services more accessible, not less. Retirement planning, \nsavings counseling, and investment advice can improve the quality of \nlife and economic stability of every American.\n  Yet recent actions by this administration, however well intended, \nwill make these financial services less accessible and less affordable \nto those who are in most need of them by forever changing the rules \nregarding financial advising related to retirement accounts.\n  Mr. Speaker, for years the community of financial advisers, including \nthose throughout Pinellas County and the Tampa Bay area that I have the \nprivilege to represent, has been governed by what is known as the \nsuitability standard; that is, a financial adviser is required to \nprovide financial counseling and investment recommendations that are \nsuitable for a client based upon that client's financial position and \nfinancial goals. The suitability standard requires advisers to act \nfairly in dealing with clients.\n  This suitability standard has served individual investors well for \nmany years, creating a market for financial services for new and low \ndollar investors seeking basic investment services and thoughtful \nfinancial and retirement planning.\n  But the administration is now in the process of replacing that \nstandard with a new standard called the fiduciary standard. This new \nstandard, under the guise of protecting investors, will actually have \nthe opposite effect. The administration's proposed rule will ultimately \nreduce or, in some cases, eliminate financial counseling, products, and \nservices to new and low dollar investors. The rule will result in the \nelimination of financial products that adequately compensate advisers \nfor their services, and it will increase the cost of compliance on \nadvisers who ultimately will need to pass on those costs to clients \nthrough a higher fee structure. And it will simply cause some advisers \nto cease serving many clients who are, in fact, in most need of \nfinancial services.\n  But worse, Mr. Speaker, the Department of Labor's new rule reflects \nthe approach we continue to see from regulators throughout this \nadministration, an arrogant and demeaning suggestion that industry \nthroughout America is necessarily comprised of all bad actors, and \nunless these actors are forced to do so by this administration, they \nwill no longer do right or do good but for the heavy hand of government \nand the heavy hand of this administration making them do so. It is a \nWashington-knows-best approach that communities across the country \ncontinue to reject.\n  My message today is a simple one: The administration can do better. \nDo not issue the proposed new fiduciary standard rule.\n  The Department received thousands of comments about the proposed rule \nand seemingly ignored them all.\n  Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have sent letters to \nthe Department of Labor expressing the negative impacts that this \nproposal would have on their communities, and we have begged the \nDepartment of Labor to revisit this rule and simply do better on behalf \nof the American people.\n  Congress has also taken action on its own and will continue to do so. \nRecently, the Appropriations Committee included provisions within their \nrespective bills in the House and Senate to halt the administration \nfrom moving forward on this perhaps well-intended but completely wrong \nproposed rule. It was right that we did so.\n  The administration simply must do better. It starts with recognizing \nthat the financial adviser industry is comprised of men and women \nacross this country who provide a valuable contribution to individuals \nand couples seeking retirement guidance.\n  Then let's realize that transparency and sunlight can solve most \nconcerns. But to instead impose a new legal standard that will only \nincrease compliance cost, result in expensive and needless litigation \nand ever more trial attorney fees and will ultimately eliminate \nfinancial counseling to hundreds of thousands of families who need it \nmost, well, Mr. Speaker, that is the wrong answer.\n  Let's keep the suitability standard. Let's trust financial advisers \nfor the good service they provide. Let's strictly enforce the current \nlaw against the very small number of individuals who seek to take \nadvantage of individual investors. Let's protect financial services for \nthose who need them most. And let's revisit a rulemaking process that \nfocuses only on transparency, ultimately providing consumers and \nclients with the information they need to make responsible investment \ndecisions and to responsibly select a financial adviser that is right \nfor them.\n  It is time that this administration begins trusting the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4960-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4960-H4961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, for the record, I am not Mexican, and I \nam not an immigrant. Given the rhetoric of one of the leading \nRepublican candidates for President, it is important to point that out \nat the start before I am accused of being a criminal, a drug dealer, or \na rapist.\n  To be fair, Donald Trump didn't say that all Latinos or all Mexicans \nare rapists, just that the vast majority of Mexican immigrants are \nrapists, drug dealers, and criminals. Clearly, if anyone has firsthand \nknowledge of Mexican immigrants working in the United States, it should \nbe the owner of a hotel, casino, office buildings, or a clothing line. \nBut Trump doesn't seem to be basing his opinions about Mexican \nimmigrants on personal knowledge.\n  To justify his claims, Trump says that most of the women coming from \nCentral America to the U.S. through Mexico and other countries report \nbeing sexually assaulted. On this point, he and I have some agreement. \nWomen and children at the lowest rung of our economic and social ladder \nare incredibly vulnerable to sexual assault and rape. But the leap from \nsaying that most undocumented women are vulnerable to assault and \nsaying most undocumented men are rapists is, as he might say himself, \nhuge.\n  The documentary on PBS Frontline, ``Rape in the Fields,'' was a \npowerful expose on how immigrant women toiling in our fields are \nregularly the victims of rape and abuse because perpetrators recognize \nhow vulnerable immigrant women are. They are afraid to talk to the \npolice, afraid they will be deported, and afraid they will lose their \nchildren. And this fear to report crimes makes us all less safe.\n  Yes, the rape and abuse is sometimes perpetrated by other Latino \nimmigrants, perhaps even Mexicans, but these crimes are also committed \nby men of all colors and national origins, including red, white, and \nblue Americans.\n  So when Donald Trump says on CNN, ``Well, someone is doing the \nraping,'' as further evidence that we should be building a big wall so \nhe can plaster his name on it and keep immigrants out, I think it is \npretty clear The Donald misses the point.\n  The question is: How do we create an immigration system that protects \nus from criminals and that allows people to come with visas and not \nsmugglers so that their work is honored, safe, protected by our labor \nlaws? How do we make sure that these workers who contribute so much to \nAmerica's economy are not afraid to dial 911 and report wage theft or \nassault when someone, anyone, is threatening them or their families?\n  Now, the anti-immigration wing of the Republican Party in this body \nand on the air is saying that Trump may have a point. After all, a \nbeautiful, innocent woman was shot in cold blood by a Mexican immigrant \nin San Francisco just last week.\n  Why wasn't he deported? Why wasn't he held in jail the last time? And \nyou will actually hear this on FOX News: Why is President Obama letting \nMexicans kill beautiful young American women?\n  As the father of two daughters about the age of Kate Steinle, the \nyoung woman who was shot and killed, I pray every night that no one of \nany racial or\n\n[[Page H4961]]\n\nethnic background ever does my daughters harm, and I can only imagine \nthe grief that her family is feeling.\n  When we have felons in Federal custody or State or local custody with \nwarrants for drug crimes who are deported multiple times and come back, \nthis Congress has not done its job, unfairly leaving States and \nlocalities to cope with decades of inaction on immigration, criminal \njustice, and a range of other issues. I have no sympathy for the man \naccused in this crime. Murderers should rot in hell.\n  So if we had a system that allowed people who have lived here a long \ntime, contributed productively to American society, and who have \nchildren and other deep roots in the United States, what if we allowed \nthem to come forward? What if we made them pay for their own criminal \nbackground checks, fingerprinted them, made them prove their identity, \nand check on them every so often to make sure that they are not gaming \nthe system or committing crime?\n  What if we had a system where people came here legally in the first \nplace, if they could prove their identity and that they had no criminal \nbackground?\n  I argue that such a system would allow us to reduce significantly the \nnumber of people who are in this country without legal status. It would \nshrink the size of communities where many people are undocumented, \nwhere people are afraid to call the police so that criminals find it \neasy to blend in and not stick out. Such a system would allow us to \nconcentrate our enforcement and deportation resources on real criminals \nwho should be jailed and then thrown out and kept out.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  I argue that such a system would make it harder for criminals to hide \nand easier for honest, hard-working folks to contribute to their \ncommunities without fear. Unfortunately, that is exactly the system \nthat some Republicans have been fighting against.\n  When a hotel and casino owner gets on his high horse about Mexican \nimmigrants, about crime, rape, and murder, let's think about who is \nstanding between the United States--this country, the one that we love \nand we have sworn to protect--and a modern immigration system based on \ncommon sense, compassion, and, yes, the rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4961-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TIME FOR HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS THAT LOWER COSTS AND EMPOWER PATIENTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, for the past 2 years, my email inbox, mailbox, \nand phone lines have been flooded with reports of canceled health \ninsurance plans, soaring premiums, increased deductibles, and \nexasperated constituents trying to navigate the confusing Washington \nbureaucracy that is ObamaCare.\n  Members of Congress have to buy their health insurance on the \nObamaCare exchanges along with millions of other Americans, and I \nexperienced many of the same frustrations, including the nightmare of \nnavigating a confusing, unfinished Web site.\n  Despite its central promise, the Affordable Care Act has proved to be \nanything but affordable for many North Carolinians, and the Supreme \nCourt's recent decision in King v. Burwell doesn't change that fact.\n  House Republicans are continuing our efforts to minimize the damage \ncaused by ObamaCare. We have passed legislation that would permanently \nrepeal ObamaCare's 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices, which has \nhindered innovation as well as restricted growth and job creation in an \nindustry that has improved the quality of life of millions around the \nworld.\n  We have voted to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which \nwas created under the President's healthcare law and gives a panel of \n15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats sweeping authority to slash \nMedicare payments to providers or eliminate payments for certain \ntreatments and procedures altogether.\n  The House has passed legislation that would change ObamaCare's 30-\nhour definition of full-time employment and restore the traditional 40-\nhour workweek. From adjunct professors to hourly workers, I have heard \nfrom constituents across North Carolina's Fifth District who have one \nthing in common: their hours are being reduced.\n  ObamaCare has placed an undue burden on employers and their employees \nby undermining the 40-hour workweek, which has long been the standard \nfor full-time work.\n  We have voted to make it easier to hire veterans by exempting those \nwho already have health insurance from being counted as full-time \nemployees under the President's healthcare law. No employer should be \npenalized for hiring a veteran, and no veteran should be unemployed \nbecause of ObamaCare.\n  However, the best approach to solving the multitude of problems \nresulting from ObamaCare is to unite behind a complete repeal of the \nlaw and replace it with solutions that lower costs and empower patients \nto choose the care that is right for them.\n  I recently signed on as a cosponsor of H.R. 2653, the American Health \nCare Reform Act. This bill would repeal ObamaCare completely and allow \na standard deduction for health insurance that treats individually \npurchased plans and employer-sponsored plans the same, making sure that \nall Americans receive the same tax benefits for health care.\n  H.R. 2653 would return decisions about healthcare and insurance \ncoverage to patients. It is people, not government, who can best \ndetermine the coverage and services that meet their needs.\n  A government takeover of health care is not what Americans asked for \nand certainly not what we can afford.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4961-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4961-H4962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STAND UP AGAINST RIGHT TO WORK LAWS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, Ronald Reagan once said: ``Where free \nunions and collective bargaining are forbidden, freedom is lost.''\n  When President Reagan made those remarks in 1980, he recognized then \nwhat many can't seem to understand now: efforts to undermine unions are \nan attack on workers' rights.\n  Unions have long been the foundation of our middle class and helped \ncreate the most competitive workforce in the world. The 40-hour \nworkweek, minimum wage, sick leave, workers comp, overtime pay, and \nchild labor laws are just a few of the basic labor rights that unions \nhave championed over the years that many now take for granted; yet for \nall the good that unions have done to empower all workers across this \ncountry, there has been a recent revival in the war against them, and \nthe weapon of choice has been right to work laws.\n  Don't be fooled by the name. The only thing right to work laws do is \nunfairly allow free-riding workers to benefit from union-negotiated \ncontracts without having to contribute their fair share in the fight. \nThe laws do not, as many supporters complain, protect workers from \nbeing forced to become union members. In fact, Federal law already \nrestricts this.\n  In union States, workers covered by union-negotiated contracts can \nonly be required to pay for the cost of bargaining and not for any \nother union activities.\n  However, over the last few years, there has been an alarming increase \nin antiunion sentiment. Currently, half of our States have right to \nwork laws, with Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin recently passing their \nown versions.\n  In my own home State of Illinois, Governor Rauner has made passing \nright to work a top priority. In fact, he is making this a cornerstone \nof his first-term legislative agenda.\n  The idea behind his right to work law is that by increasing the \nnumber of free-riding workers, unions will be forced to drastically \nreduce their budgets, weakening their ability to negotiate stronger \ncontracts and defend the rights of American workers, but the evidence \nclearly shows how misguided this stance is and the attacks on organized \nlabor truly are. For instance, research shows that 7 of the 10 States \nwith the highest unemployment rates are right to work States.\n  On top of that, we know that even if half of the counties in Illinois \nadopt right to work laws, we would see the\n\n[[Page H4962]]\n\nState's annual economic output shrink by $1.5 billion, labor income \nfall by $1.3 billion, and an increase in both racial and gender income \ninequality.\n  If right to work laws are not actually good for the economy, what are \nthey good for? Right to work laws do a great job at harming hard-\nworking middle class families, widening income inequality, and \nweakening unions. Right to work States have seen almost a 10 percent \ndecline in unionization, which has undermined growth in wages and led \nto the deterioration in workplace safety.\n  In right to work States, wages for all workers, not just unionized \nworkers, are over 3 percent lower than in non-right to work States. \nThat is about $1,500 less per year in the pockets of teachers, \nfirefighters, nurses, and other hard-working Americans.\n  Furthermore, injuries and deaths in right to work States are much \nhigher than in non-right to work States. In the high-risk environment \nof construction, where unions have played a fundamental role in \ndemanding adequate safety standards, deaths are 34 percent higher in \nright to work States than in non-right to work States.\n  As you can see, right to work is not right for our country, not right \nfor our States, and not right for our workers. Using right to work as a \nstrategy to lower wages and attract more businesses is not a suitable \nand sustainable strategy.\n  Instead of focusing on attacking unions and middle class workers, \nGovernors should focus on fixing broken budgets and investing in our \nschools, public safety programs, and transportation systems. That is \nthe real recipe for economic success.\n  Let's stand up against right to work laws and stand up for the right \nto organize, the right to a safe job, and the right to a fair wage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4962-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING DR. PETER SCHRAMM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio \n(Mr. Gibbs) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Peter Schramm of \nthe Ashbrook Center at Ashland University in Ashland, Ohio. Earlier \nthis week, the Ashbrook Center, supporters, and friends gathered to \nrecognize Dr. Schramm for his years of service and to name the center's \nlibrary in his honor.\n  Since 1987, Dr. Schramm has been teaching political science at \nAshland; mentoring students; and shaping the minds of the next \ngeneration of teachers, lawyers, and political thinkers.\n  His story starts in Hungary, as a young boy living under the brutal \nSoviet regime. When he was 10, after the Communists crushed the \nHungarian uprising in 1956, Peter's father decided it was time to leave \nHungary and come to America. Peter asked his father why he chose \nAmerica, and he was told: ``We were born Americans but in the wrong \nplace.''\n  After leaving Hungary, the Schramm family found their way to \nCalifornia, thanks to an American dentist his father met shortly after \nWorld War II.\n  With just a few American dollars, Peter's family started a new life. \nHis parents found work, and Peter and his sister went to school. Peter \ndid not know English and had to learn along the way, with the help of \nhis classmates.\n  Eventually, they saved enough money to open a restaurant. The whole \nfamily worked there. Peter continued his studies and worked through \ncollege. He studied history and graduated, taking a few years longer \nthan usual because he was unaware he actually had to graduate. Peter \nwas content to learn for the sake of learning. Years later, he once \nsaid: ``I think it is true that human beings by nature desire to \nknow.''\n  His economic curiosity led him to Claremont for his master's and \ndoctorate degrees. It was there that he studied the classics, focusing \nmore on philosophy than history.\n  When he began teaching, Dr. Schramm insisted on an open discussion, \nencouraging and directing debates among his students.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Butterfield) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express the utter outrage of \nthe Congressional Black Caucus regarding the Calvert amendment, \nscheduled for later this afternoon, which is an amendment to the \nInterior Appropriations bill.\n  That amendment would allow Confederate imagery to remain on graves on \nFederal lands. Don't Republicans understand that the Confederate battle \nflag is an insult to 40 million African Americans and to many other \nfair-minded Americans?\n  The Confederate battle flag, Mr. Speaker, is intended to defend a \ndark period of American history, a period when 4 million Blacks were \nheld as slaves, held as property, as chattel, not as human beings. The \nslaves were bought and sold and mortgaged and gifted as chattel.\n  Mr. Speaker, this period of enslavement continued for more than 200 \nyears and did not legally end until December 6, 1865.\n  Here is the history, Mr. Speaker. Following President Lincoln's \nelection in November 1860, 12 Southern States ceded from the Union in \nresponse to their belief that President Lincoln would free the 4 \nmillion slaves. South Carolina was the first State to cede from the \nUnion, on December 20, right after Lincoln's election.\n  These Southern States formed the Confederate States of America. They \nempowered a military, elected a President, adopted a constitution, and \nadopted a currency. They engaged in a brutal, brutal civil war with the \nUnion. Thousands of lives were lost on both sides of the battle. The \nConfederate flag, Mr. Speaker, was their symbol; it was their flag.\n  The Southern States lost the war. The States then rejoined the Union. \nPresident Lincoln then proposed the 13th Amendment, legally ending \nslavery. That amendment, Mr. Speaker, passed this Congress on January \n31, 1865, and finally was ratified by Georgia on December 6, 1865. \nDuring the period of ratification, President Lincoln was assassinated.\n  For the next 50-plus years, every Black person living in the South \nfaced the possibility of lynching. More than 4,000 Blacks were lynched \nbetween 1890 and 1950, and 136 Black people were lynched in South \nCarolina.\n  There are some now who want to continue to honor slavery and to honor \nbigotry, and this House, Mr. Speaker, must not be complicit.\n  The horrific shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, was an example \nof a 21st century lynching.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  The manifesto left by the Charleston killer stated:\n\n       I have no choice. I am not in the position to, alone, go \n     into the ghetto and fight. I chose Charleston because it is \n     the most historic city in my State, and at one time had\n\n[[Page H4963]]\n\n     the highest ratio of Blacks to Whites in the country.\n\n  He was right, 57 percent.\n\n       We have no skinheads, we have no real KKK, no one doing \n     anything but talking on the Internet. Well, someone has to \n     have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess \n     that has to be me.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, bigotry continues to exist in this country. This \nCongress should not pass any legislation, today or any other day, that \nwould embolden those who continue to hold racist beliefs.\n  The Calvert amendment--the Calvert amendment--is misguided, and it \nemboldens bigotry. I ask my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, \nrespectfully, let's defeat the Calvert amendment this afternoon, and \neven if the gentleman would consider to withdraw his amendment and not \nput this House through this turmoil today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4963-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HELPING FAMILIES IN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Murphy) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, in a terrible \nattack, over 200 people were killed across these United States. This \nheadline should lead every TV news show, hit the front pages, and \ngenerate outrage from across the country, but it did not appear. This \nis not make-believe. The news is real, but no one reported it.\n  We lose more than 80,000 people a year now to suicide and drug \naddiction overdose. That is over 200 people a day. Where is the news?\n  Now, these are the sudden and tragic deaths. Then there are the slow-\nmotion deaths which we can't even count, those who have a mental \nillness and ended up homeless, or have a co-occurring chronic illness, \nsuch as diabetes or heart disease, and face that slow-motion death \nsentence. In fact, people with serious mental illness tend to die 25 \nyears earlier than their cohorts.\n  And then there are the mentally ill who are victims of attacks. Last \nweek, The Washington Post revealed how, in the first 6 months of this \nyear, a person who was in mental health crisis was shot and killed \nevery 36 hours by police. The vast majority were armed, but, in most \ncases, the police officers who shot them were not responding to reports \nof a crime. More often, they were called by relatives, neighbors, or \nother bystanders, worried that a mentally fragile person was behaving \nerratically. The crisis built, and it ended in death.\n  Further, the mentally ill are more likely to be the victims of \nviolence, robberies, beatings, rape, and other crimes. These \nindividuals are also 10 times more likely to be in jail than in a \nhospital.\n  If you are a minority, chances are your mental health treatment comes \nin a prison, not in a community health center.\n  Have we become so numb we no longer notice? Are we so numb, we no \nlonger care?\n  Tragically, government tries to help, but, frankly, it is a mess. The \nchaotic patchwork of current government programs and Federal laws make \nit impossible for those with severe psychosis, schizophrenia, and \nserious mental illness, to get meaningful care.\n  For example, when someone with serious mental illness is haunted by \ndelirium and hallucinations and doesn't even know they are ill, they \nfrequently stop taking their needed medication. They don't follow up on \nappointments and their health declines. Our Federal laws prevent a \ncaregiver from getting their loved one to the next appointment or to \nfollow up on their care.\n  We need to provide treatment before tragedy and get these individuals \nhelp before their loved ones dial 911. The Helping Families in Mental \nHealth Crisis Act, H.R. 2646, provides millions of families the tools \nneeded for effective care.\n  H.R. 2646 empowers parents and caregivers to access care before the \nmental illness reaches the most severe stage. It fixes the shortage of \ninpatient beds, so patients in mental health crisis can get proper \ncare, not be sent to a jail, not tied to an emergency room gurney, and \nnot sent home.\n  It helps reach underserved and rural populations. It expands the \nmental health workforce. It drives evidence-based care. It provides \nalternatives to institutionalization. It integrates primary and \nbehavior care.\n  It increases physician volunteerism, advances critical medical \nresearch, brings accountability to mental health and substance abuse \nparity, and it also provides crisis intervention grants for police \nofficers and first responders. This training helps law enforcement \nofficials recognize individuals who have a serious mental illness and \nlearn how to properly intervene.\n  My bill eliminates wasteful and ineffective programs and directs \nmoney where it is needed most. It restructures the Federal mental \nhealth system to focus on serious mental illness rather than behavioral \nwellness and feel-good fads that yield no meaningful results yet cost \ntaxpayers millions each year.\n  My bill elevates effective programs and helps communities adopt \nprograms to stop the revolving door of mental health crisis, violence, \nincarceration, ER visits, and abandonment.\n  This bipartisan legislation, now with more than 50 cosponsors, marks \na new dawn for mental health in America. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in this effort by cosponsoring the Helping Families in Mental Health \nCrisis Act, H.R. 2646. Let's no longer turn a blind eye and, instead, \nhelp those that need it the most.\n  Whether on the fast road or the slow road, the 200-plus deaths per \nday, the 80,000 deaths per year and unknown number of victims is far, \nfar too many. Compassion calls us to act--and act now. The cost of \ndelay is deadly. For those families who are suffering, how can we look \nthem in the eye and defend our delays to act?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4963-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4963-H4964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONFEDERATE FLAG AMENDMENTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, there are days in this House when morality \nand the values of our country, as articulated in the Declaration of \nIndependence and in the Constitution of our country, summon us to vote \nas Americans, as moral representatives, and as representatives of the \nvalues of our country. Today is such a day, my colleagues.\n  Three Democratic amendments were adopted earlier in the consideration \nof the Interior bill that would end the practice of displaying or \nselling Confederate battle flags and flag merchandise in national parks \nand National Park Service cemeteries. Those amendments were adopted by \nvoice vote. They reflect the strong consensus in this country and, \nhopefully, in this Congress, that a symbol of slavery, sedition, \nsegregation, and secession has no place in our national parks or in the \ncemeteries whose grounds have been hallowed by the veterans who rest \nthere after having served and given their lives in defense of freedom \nand justice and the values of our country.\n  Unbelievably, however, Mr. Speaker, several hours ago, in the dark of \nnight, the chairman of the Interior Subcommittee offered an amendment \non this floor that would effectively strike those amendments which \nsurely reflect the values to which all of us have risen our hand and \nsworn to protect.\n  Today, on the anniversary of the ratification of the 14th Amendment \nto our Constitution--how ironic that we would meet this vote on this \nday--which enshrined the principle of equality for all Americans, we \nhave this shameful Confederate battle flag amendment on our floor.\n  This amendment would keep in place a policy that allows Confederate \nbattle flags in our national parks and National Park Service \ncemeteries, a symbol, as my colleague Jim Clyburn, the assistant leader \nand the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and an extraordinary \nRepresentative in South Carolina, said yesterday was so offensive and \nhurtful to so many millions of our fellow citizens and our fellow \ncolleagues in this body.\n  Even in South Carolina today, where the Confederacy was born, that \nflag is being taken down from the State capitol grounds after both \nRepublican-controlled houses of that State's assembly voted to remove \nit.\n  Certainly--certainly--on this day we ought not to see a Republican-\nled Congress move in the opposite direction. My colleagues, together, \nnot as Republicans and Democrats, but as Americans deeply committed to \nthe values of\n\n[[Page H4964]]\n\nequality and justice and opportunity for all, we ought to remove that \nflag from our national parks, the cemeteries where our veterans rest \nand, I would say further, all public places. That includes the United \nStates Capitol.\n  And I support my friend Representative Thompson's resolution that \nsits now in the House Administration Committee that would remove the \nflag of Mississippi, which contains the Confederate battle flag, until \nsuch time as Mississippians, as South Carolinians did yesterday, make a \nstatement and remove that from their flag.\n  I urge my colleagues, my fellow Americans, the 434 of my colleagues \nthat have raised their hand and sworn to protect and defend the \nConstitution of the United States of America, I urge my colleagues, let \nus do the right thing and reject this amendment and send a powerful \nmessage about what America truly represents: equality, justice, respect \nfor one another, freedom for all.\n  Let us make America--every American--proud of us this day and reject \nthe amendment adopted in the dead of night.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4964-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NEGOTIATIONS ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR CAPABILITY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nAlabama (Mrs. Roby) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the negotiations \ntaking place right now in Switzerland over Iran's nuclear capability. \nWith all that has been going on lately, I fear not enough attention is \nbeing paid to what I believe is one of the most important issues facing \nour country right now.\n  Last week, the Obama administration quietly announced yet another \ndeadline extension to the multilateral negotiations over Iran's nuclear \ncapability, and this week, negotiators blew past that deadline once \nagain.\n  Of course, the goal for the United States and our allies must be to \nprevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. However, recent reports \nout of Switzerland have raised concerns that our negotiators have \nalready conceded too much on major points like uranium enrichment, \neconomic sanctions relief, and inspection access.\n  Mr. Speaker, the very fact that we keep extending the deadline tells \nyou all you need to know about the priorities at play for this \nadministration. It seems that President Obama and Secretary Kerry are \nso concerned with striking a deal--any deal--that they are unwilling to \nwalk away from a bad one as deadlines keep passing.\n  The Boston Globe reported that negotiators have spent their downtime \nspeculating which movie stars would play them in a Hollywood movie \nabout the Iran deal.\n  If this is true, Americans should be outraged. This is an \nextraordinarily important issue that will have an extraordinarily far-\nreaching effect on this country and the world for many years to come.\n  The fact is we have had extension after extension and concession \nafter concession to the point that I am not sure a good deal is even \npossible at this point.\n  A few months ago, I traveled to the Middle East with the Speaker as \npart of his delegation to the region, and we visited countries that \nwould be directly affected by dealing with a nuclear Iran--Israel, \nJordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia.\n  Our allies in the region are rightfully concerned that what is being \nbrokered isn't good at all.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  We cannot forget how high the stakes are here. If a bad deal is \nratified, we aren't just talking about a nuclear armed Iran.\n  We are talking about setting in motion a nuclear race, a chain of \nevents that could allow multiple countries in this very volatile region \nof the world wanting to become nuclear as well.\n  And after seeing the international community reward Iran's hostility \nand obstinance with a nuclear deal, who would blame them?\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the leadership of my colleagues in this \nChamber and in the Senate. And I agree with Senator Corker, who is the \nchairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who wrote a letter \nto the President, ``Walking away from a bad deal at this point would \ntake courage, but it would be the best thing for the United States, the \nregion, and the world.''\n  We may not be able to control the outcome in Switzerland, but we can \ncontrol how we respond if a bad deal is put forward.\n  This Congress can have the final say whether or not to lift sanctions \nin Iran. It can have the final say on the deal, itself, by way of a \nresolution of disapproval.\n  I believe Members of Congress must prepare to stand up and have the \ncourage that it would take to stop a bad Iranian deal from happening. \nFor some, this will take a lot of courage, but it is necessary.\n  We cannot allow President Obama and Secretary Kerry to put their \ndesire for a legacy achievement above the best interests of this Nation \nand our allies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4964-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4964-H4965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONFEDERATE BATTLE FLAG SYMBOLISM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Jeffries) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, had this Confederate battle flag prevailed \nin war 150 years ago, I would not be standing here today as a Member of \nthe United States Congress. I would be here as a slave. Over the last \n150 years, we have made tremendous progress in this country, but we \nstill have a long way to go.\n  As the tragic events in Charleston, South Carolina, illustrated, when \nnine God-fearing, churchgoing African American citizens were killed by \na White supremacist, there is much work that needs to be done to \neradicate the cancer of racial hatred.\n  When Dylann Roof committed this act of domestic terror, his emblem \nwas the Confederate battle flag.\n  Later on today we are going to have a vote on the legitimacy of this \nflag. On Tuesday, it appeared that House Republicans were prepared to \ndo the right thing in support of three amendments to prohibit the use \nof Federal funds for the purchase, sale, or display of the Confederate \nbattle flag on National Park Service land.\n  But less than 24 hours later, House Republicans reversed course in \nthe dead of night under cover of darkness to introduce an amendment \nsupporting the Confederate battle flag, which is nothing more than a \nsymbol of racial hatred and oppression.\n  There are some in this House who have made the argument that the \nConfederate battle flag is about heritage and tradition. I am \nperplexed.\n  What exactly is the tradition of the Confederate battle flag that we \nare supporting? Is it slavery? Rape? Kidnap? Treason? Genocide? Or all \nof the above.\n  The Confederate battle flag is nothing more than a symbol of racial \nhatred and oppression. And I stand here with chills next to it because \nthe red in this flag is a painful reminder of the blood that was shed \nby Africans who were killed when attempted to be kidnapped and thrown \ninto the institution of slavery.\n  The red on this flag is a painful reminder of the blood that was shed \nby millions of Africans who died during the Middle Passage when being \ntransported from Africa to America.\n  The red on this flag is a painful reminder of the blood that was shed \nby African American slaves who were beaten, raped, lynched, and killed \nhere in America as a result of the institution of slavery.\n  What exactly is the tradition the Confederate battle flag represents?\n  We were sent here as leaders to make decisions on the morality of \nAmerica. And where we are, notwithstanding our painful history and the \nlegacy of slavery, we have an opportunity today to make a definitive \nstatement to be leaders, not individuals who cower in fear of some \nnarrow-minded Americans who aren't aware that the South lost the war \n150 years ago.\n  Let's choose racial progress over racial poison. Let's choose harmony \nover historic amnesia. Let's choose togetherness over treason. Let's \ncome together not as Democrats or Republicans, not as Whites or Blacks, \nnot as northerners or southerners.\n  Let's come together as Americans and vote down the Calvert amendment \nand relegate the Confederate battle flag to the dustbin of history, \nwhich is where it belongs.\n\n[[Page H4965]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4965-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         WYOMING COUNTY, 2015 SADD NATIONAL CHAPTER OF THE YEAR\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nMinnesota (Ms. McCollum) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, as you pointed out, I am from Minnesota. \nMinnesota's Governor Ramsey was in Washington, D.C., shortly after the \nattack at Fort Sumter, and he was the first to offer up our support--\n1,000 Minnesotans--to keep our Union together.\n  Minnesota was at the Battle of Gettysburg. Our regiment suffered 82 \npercent in casualties, the greatest loss of any unit at Gettysburg on a \nsingle day.\n  So last night, when the Republican leadership put forward a last-\nminute amendment that would allow for the display and sale of the \nConfederate flag in our national parks, an amendment which we will vote \non today that would allow this hateful symbol which evokes memories of \nracism and a painful period in our country's past to be displayed on \npublic lands, I found myself shocked, outraged, and disappointed \nbecause the people in Minnesota sent me here to strive for what they \nstrive for every day: to build a better, stronger America, an America \nin which we strive to give everyone hope and opportunity, that they too \ncan pursue life, liberty, happiness, and justice.\n  So the flag that we are talking about is a symbol of a time when \nAfrican Americans were enslaved, sold as human commodities. It had been \nused as a rallying cry throughout our history for those who wish to \nkeep our country segregated.\n  And we saw again last month in Charleston this flag being used as a \nsymbol for many who carry hatred in their hearts, a man who carried so \nmuch hatred that he took the lives of nine parishioners because he \nviewed this flag as a symbol of his beliefs.\n  This flag should be no point of pride for any American, and we should \ntake this flag down.\n  Just 2 days ago, without opposition, as I had the honor of being \nranking member as we were doing the Interior bill, this body voted to \nadopt amendments which would prevent the sale or display of Confederate \nflags in national parks.\n  Those amendments were simple, commonsense efforts to place into law \nstandards that the National Park Service had put forward last month. It \nwas a moment of great pride for me.\n  All those new standards would do was bring the Federal Government in \nline with decisions made by many private sector retailers: Amazon, Wal-\nMart, Sears, Disney. And other national retailers have all made the \ndecision to take down this flag because of its racist history.\n  Private businesses are rallying behind a commonsense decision to stop \npeddling hateful symbols. So why in heaven and Earth is the House of \nRepresentatives, the Republican Caucus, working to ensure that the \nFederal Government allows them to be sold?\n  For House Republicans, it appears perhaps the cost of getting the \nvotes to pass the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related \nAgencies Appropriations bill, which panders to polluters, is to wrap \nthemselves in a banner of racism.\n  I think that is wrong, and I urge my colleagues to stand with people \nof great courage and great passion to say ``no'' to hate, ``no'' to \nracism, and ``yes'' to America.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Calvert amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4965-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4965-H4966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CLEAR LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR CRIMINAL ALIEN REMOVAL ACT OF 2015\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia). The Chair \nrecognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to discuss \nH.R. 2964, the Clear Law Enforcement for Criminal Alien Removal Act.\n  This is a bill that I have had introduced every Congress since 2007. \nAnd we have many Members of this body, Mr. Speaker, who have joined as \ncosponsors of this legislation.\n  What it would do specifically is this: It would ensure that State and \nlocal law enforcement officials have the tools necessary to help the \nFederal Government deport criminal illegal aliens from the United \nStates.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  My legislation would require the Department of Homeland Security, \nwhen a State or local law enforcement agency arrests an alien and \nrequests DHS to take custody of that alien, to do a few specific \nthings. Number one, they have to take the alien into Federal custody \nand incarceration within 48 hours and request that the State or \nmunicipality temporarily incarcerate the alien or transport the alien \nto Federal custody. This would allow them to remove this individual \nfrom the country and bar them from coming back.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill also requires the DHS to train State and local \npolice in enforcement of immigration laws, the Federal Government to \nreimburse local and State governments, and to withhold funds from \nsanctuary cities.\n  Now, we have heard a lot about these issues in the last few days, and \none of the problems that we have is the sanctuary cities. Mr. Speaker, \nI have before my colleagues a map that was prepared by the Center for \nImmigration Studies. We now have in this country 200 sanctuary cities. \nI am reading from this map. More than 200 cities, counties, and States \nacross the U.S. are considered sanctuary cities.\n  Now, what happens in these cities is they choose to work around and \nto circumvent or not to abide by Federal law when it comes to \nimmigration policy. That is one of the reasons passing the CLEAR Act is \nso important, holding them accountable.\n  Also, reading from the map, I find it so interesting that the \nDepartment of Justice has never sued or taken any measure, including \ndenying Federal funds, against the jurisdiction that is a sanctuary \ncity. On the other hand, we know that the Department of Justice \nactually sued the State of Arizona for trying to strengthen its \nimmigration laws.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would come to the floor today as we talk about dealing \nwith the criminal illegal alien population and highlighting H.R. 2964. \nI would ask my colleagues: What does your vote record say about your \nactions? Are you strengthening Federal law and abiding by Federal law? \nOr do those actions strengthen sanctuary cities? Do they provide more \naccountability? Is that what you are providing through your vote \nactions? Or is it something that allows a violation of Federal law to \ncontinue?\n  I think it is imperative that we address the issue of criminal \nillegal aliens, that we address the issue of sanctuary cities; and, Mr. \nSpeaker, I think that it is imperative that we move forward with \npassage of the CLEAR Act by this body. It is a simple bill.\n  I encourage my colleagues to read it. It is 21 pages, and you will \nfind in there that it addresses these issues that are front and \nforemost in our minds this day.\n\n[[Page H4966]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4966-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      THE CONFEDERATE BATTLE FLAG\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Clyburn) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I would like, first of all, to thank the \nSpeaker of this House and the other Members who came to Charleston last \nmonth to help us with the ongoing ceremonies for Senator Clementa \nPinckney.\n  I would also like to thank especially my colleagues--Senator Tim \nScott, Senator Lindsey Graham, and Congressman Mark Sanford--for \njoining with us as we stood with the Governor of South Carolina and \ncalled for removing the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the \nstatehouse.\n  This afternoon, at 4 o'clock, as a result of a very definitive vote \nearly this morning of 94-20, the Governor is going to sign the bill, \nand tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock, the flag will be removed from the \nstatehouse.\n  I regret that I am not going to be able to accept the Governor's \ninvitation and be there this afternoon because, around 4 o'clock this \nafternoon, we are going to be voting here on this floor.\n  I understand there will be around 25 votes, and 24 of them, I might \nnot feel all that bad about missing, but one of them, I cannot afford \nto miss because that one vote, the Calvert amendment, will reverse \nvotes taken by this body to join with South Carolina, Alabama, and \nactivities going on in Mississippi to get rid of any official \napplication to this flag, the Confederate battle flag.\n  Now, I think it is important for us to point out that this is not the \nConfederate flag. The Confederacy had three flags. This was never one \nof them. This flag was the Confederate battle flag of the Army of \nNorthern Virginia, Robert E. Lee's Army; and when Robert E. Lee \nsurrendered at Appomattox, he asked all of his followers to furl this \nflag.\n  ``Store it away,'' he said. ``Put it in your attics.'' He refused to \nbe buried in his Confederate uniform. His family refused to allow \nanyone dressed in the Confederate uniform to attend his funeral. Why? \nIt is because Robert E. Lee said he considered this emblem to be a \nsymbol of treason; yet, Mr. Speaker, Calvert puts up an amendment that \nwe are going to vote on this afternoon to ask us to allow this flag to \nbe sold and displayed in our national parks.\n  I was so proud when the decision was made by the National Park \nService, Fort Sumter, a national park where the Civil War started off \nthe coast of Charleston, South Carolina, they decided to take away all \nof these symbols; but the Calvert amendment is saying: No, don't take \nthem away, put them back, and we are going to ratify the action to do \nso.\n  Mr. Speaker, I call upon all of my colleagues who come to this floor \nthis afternoon to remember that it was on this date in 1868 that South \nCarolina--where it all started--South Carolina was the State that gave \nthe votes necessary to ratify the 14th Amendment.\n  To me, this was a very, very important amendment calling for due \nprocess and equal protection of the laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4966-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               A BAD DEAL WITH IRAN IS WORSE THAN NO DEAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Bilirakis) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, in March, before a joint meeting of \nCongress, the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, warned \n``history has placed us at a fateful crossroads.''\n  As a world leader at the forefront of this crossroad, I believe \nAmerica has a responsibility to prevent a nuclear Iran. An Iran with \nnuclear weapons capabilities would further exacerbate and destabilize \nthe region and would certainly inspire an arms race among other \nnonnuclear nations.\n  The Obama administration's foreign policy missteps do not inspire \nconfidence that the current negotiations will conclude any differently. \nAfter numerous delays, negotiations are veering further away from any \ntype of reasonable agreement that would contain Iran's nuclear \nambitions.\n  I do not trust this administration as it approaches the reversal of a \nhalf century of nuclear nonproliferation policy. As Chairman Royce \nstated over the weekend: ``The Obama administration's fundamental \nmisread of the Iranian regime is part of what makes this potential \nagreement so dangerous to our national security.''\n  The sanctions relief numbers that are being reported now are \nstaggering and would directly undercut years of democratic success. \nSanctions are a vital tool when working to keep our citizens and allies \nout of harm's way.\n  In dealing with an aggressive state sponsor of terror, there should \nbe no daylight between the position of Republicans and Democrats in \nCongress, nor Congress with the President or the United States with our \nallies.\n  Civilized nations must stand united against the destructive output \nfrom rogue regimes like Iran. As it stands now, the reported details of \nthe deal will not dismantle the nuclear ambitions of the world's \nleading state sponsor of terrorism.\n  Mr. Speaker, if the past is any indication of the future, we can \nexpect that Iran will continue to employ its stonewalling tactics, \nblocking any real transparency or inspections of its nuclear \nfacilities.\n  Why isn't Iran answering questions asked 4 years ago by the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency about their past activities? How can \nwe trust a country that won't answer simple questions or allow \nscientists to be interviewed? How can we set up a sanctions relief \nsystem that is based on trust and verification if the country has \nproven objectively incapable of trust and transparency?\n  We certainly cannot continue to overlook Iranian compliance failures \nas reported this week in The Washington Post, nor come anywhere close \nto lifting its successfully firm arms embargo. These negotiations will \nhave long-term implications on every country on this planet.\n  I believe the United States has a responsibility to stand with Israel \nand other allies across the globe now more than ever. We must ensure \nour allies know they do not stand alone. With the current negotiations \nextended once again, it appears that the administration simply wants to \nget any agreement.\n  I believe it is a legacy item for the President, Mr. Speaker. This \nadministration's willingness to ignore Iran's troublesome behavior \nthroughout negotiations does not inspire confidence.\n  President Obama promised 7 years ago that he would not allow Iran to \ndevelop a nuclear weapon. He is failing to keep that promise to the \nAmerican people and the rest of the world, in my opinion.\n  The stakes are too high. Negotiations are reaching a critical moment \nas we speak here today. This administration needs to understand one \nindisputable truth: a bad deal is worse than no deal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4966-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4966-H4967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Loretta Sanchez) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, this year marks the \n40th anniversary since the end of the Vietnam war and 20 years of \nnormalized relations between the U.S. and Vietnam.\n  This week, our President hosted the General Secretary of the \nVietnamese Communist Party, Nguyen Phu Trong, a political leader but \nnot an official leader.\n  During that meeting, I know that the two leaders discussed more \nnormalization of economic and military issues, and I know that \nPresident Obama brought up the issue of human rights; but I am going to \nsay this: after 19 years in this Congress of fighting for human rights \naround the world, the Vietnamese Communist Government always promises, \nwhen economic issues are on the table, to do something better with \nrespect to their human rights record, but they never follow through. In \nfact, it gets worse.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, as the co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on \nVietnam, I don't want to focus on what the economic implications are \nand the trade implications are that are going on with respect to \nVietnam, but I want to remind my colleagues about what is happening \nwith respect to human rights in Vietnam.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  Nguyen Dang Minh Man is currently serving a 9-year prison term after \nbeing charged with ``attempting to overthrow the government'' under \narticle\n\n[[Page H4967]]\n\n79 of the constitution of that country. Her crime, she was arrested \nwhile taking photographs during a protest against Chinese encroachment \nof the Paracel and Spratly Islands.\n  Ho Duc Hoa, a community organizer and a contributing journalist for \nVietnam Redemptorists' News, is currently serving a 13-year prison \nsentence for defending human rights and promoting democracy. He has \nbeen charged with ``attempting to overthrow the government.'' He is \ncurrently suffering from harsh treatment in prison, including torture \nand denial to medical care, water, or adequate food.\n  Dang Xuan Dieu, another activist, is currently serving a 13-year \nsentence under article 79 in response to advocating for education--\nimagine this--for education for children living in poverty, for aid to \npeople with disabilities, and for religious freedom in Vietnam. Mr. \nDieu is also a victim of mistreatment and torture in the prison system.\n  Tran Huynh Duy Thuc, a human rights activist and entrepreneur, was \nalso arrested for writing blogs that called for political reform and \nimproved human rights in Vietnam. He only peacefully exercised his \nrights to freedom of expression; yet Thuc was charged of attempting to \noverthrow the government under article 79. He was sentenced to 16 years \nin prison and 5 years of house arrest.\n  These are just four of the so many people in prison in Vietnam.\n  The government of Vietnam continues to deny its citizens their rights \nto freedom of speech, to freedom of assembly, to freedom of the press, \nto freedom of religion. Although Vietnam strives to further its \nrelations with the U.S., it does not grant human rights to its people.\n  I understand that President Obama has agreed to visit Vietnam in the \nnear future, and I strongly urge that not only the President and the \nadministration work on the issues of human rights with respect to the \nVietnamese people, but that we in the Congress continue to push \nbecause, as we know, as Americans, people around the world look to us \nas the shining light of upholding democracy and human rights and \nfreedom and liberty and freedom of the press and freedom of assembly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4967-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, we are quickly approaching one of the \nmost important deadlines in the recent history of the national security \nof the United States, the often postponed end of negotiations to halt \nIran's nuclear weapons program.\n  I support the goal of stopping Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions \nforever, and I have grave fears that the United States is headed down a \nvery dangerous path of concession and surrender to a terrorist regime \nthat has had American blood on its hands since 1979, military and \ncivilian.\n  Each and every day, we read new reports that Iranian leaders are \nsystematically ``moving the goalposts'' on these important \nnegotiations.\n  Let me cite just a few examples. First, any prudent agreement would \nallow ``no notice'' inspections of suspected--not just declared--\nIranian nuclear weapon sites; yet the Iranian parliament has passed \nlegislation banning inspections of their military installations.\n  Senior Iranian officials have also taken it further, declaring: ``Not \nonly will we not grant foreigners the permission to inspect our \nmilitary sites, we will not even give them permission to think about \nsuch a subject.''\n  This attitude would make any agreement totally unverifiable.\n  Secondly, any worthwhile agreement would phase in sanctions relief as \nthe regime proves, over time, that it is complying with all provisions; \nyet President Rouhani has declared: ``We will not sign any deal unless \nsanctions are lifted on the same day.''\n  Why would we allow Iran to boost its staggering economy by providing \nan immediate capital infusion with which to support their relentless \nmilitary, intelligence, and political efforts across the globe?\n  President Obama's explanations have been nothing short of baffling. \nHe told National Public Radio: ``How, if at all, can you prevent Iran \nfrom using its new wealth over the next several years to support Bashar \nal-Assad of Syria, to support Hezbollah, adventures in Yemen, or \nelsewhere? I mean, there's been no lessening of their support of \nHezbollah or Assad during the course of the last 4 or 5 years, at a \ntime when their economy has been doing terribly.''\n  Well, that is the point, Mr. President. The United States should not \nthrow up its hands and actually allow the Iranian economy to be \nstimulated so they have even more money to solidify their place as the \nworld's leading state sponsor of terrorism.\n  Immediate sanctions relief will only provide more resources for them \nto use their elite Quds Force and their proxy militias in Iraq; \ndominate that country; and advance their goals in Syria, Yemen, and \nelsewhere.\n  Of course, they will have more motivation to do so. The tentative \nagreement announced in April and everything we have heard and read \nsince then seems to reinforce the lesson this administration is willing \nto give away much more in return for nothing in the way of changing \ntheir behavior. Once again, we must never forget that Iran has had \nAmerican blood on its hands since 1979.\n  Iran has cheated before and is likely to cheat again; yet the \nadministration makes concession after concession to Tehran, even as \nIran spreads violence in Yemen, Syria, Iraq; threatens the safety of \nour troops in the Middle East; and develops new ICBMs that will put \nAmerica in its ``crosshairs.''\n  My colleagues, Iran's nuclear weapons quest must be blocked \nindefinitely, including the verifiable dismantlement of its weapons \ninfrastructure. They cannot be allowed to remain a ``threshold nuclear \nweapons state,'' only to join the ``nuclear club'' the moment the \nagreement lapses.\n  From where I stand and from what we know today, we must oppose this \nagreement. In fact, no deal is better than a bad deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n\n\n                    Enhancement of Unity in America\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the distinguished \ngentleman from New Jersey for his kindness.\n  Might I rise, really, to follow up to ask America to be unified and \nto be able to have a debate on the floor of the House on a resolution \nthat I offered, H. Res. 342. To the gentleman from New Jersey, it says \n``the enhancement of unity in America.''\n  What it speaks to is for this body to go on the record for saying \nthat divisive emblems and symbols--swastikas or a rebel flag, a \nfighting flag--does not even represent the flag that most people think \nit is--the Confederate flag, this is the rebel flag--to put all those \naway; to be able to educate our children about the excitement of how \ndiverse we are; to be reminded of the history of Reconstruction--\nAfrican Americans who are Senators and Congresspersons; to look at \nschools who now carry names of people who really might be considered \ntreasonists; to be able to stand on the floor today or next week, as \nthose in South Carolina did, in a civil way, so that our children will \nknow that these symbols that divide are not history; and to be able to \nstand together and support the diversity of America.\n  That is what I stand for, and I stand with Houston, who is \nreconsidering many school names at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4967-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4967-H4968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TAKE DOWN THE CONFEDERATE FLAG\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Kildee) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, overnight, House Republicans have \ndramatically and inexplicably reversed their position on taking down \nthis terribly divisive symbol, the Confederate battle flag.\n  While they initially allowed House Democrats' amendments to remove \nthis symbol from our national parks, late last night, they allowed an \namendment on voice, which was challenged. I will be on the floor for a \nrollcall later today to keep--believe it or not--keep the Confederate \nflag as a symbol for sale and for display in America's national parks.\n  Of course, this morning's headlines, the scathing headlines, tell it \nall:\n\n[[Page H4968]]\n\n``House GOP takes step back on Confederate flags.''\n  Unbelievable--it is a shame. It is really a shame that House \nRepublicans last night, very late last night, without warning, \nattempted to turn back important progress on taking down this terrible \nand divisive symbol.\n  This, of course, happens just weeks--days, literally--after nine \nAmericans were slain in an historic Black church in Charleston, South \nCarolina. A terrible and tragic massacre committed by an evil \nindividual, who wrapped himself in that very symbol, and celebrated the \nhate that it stood for.\n  I attended the funeral of Reverend Clementa Pinckney and, with other \nMembers of Congress, grieved with that community in their pain. I saw \nthat community asking themselves a question: Why, why does that hateful \nsymbol, that flag, continue to fly over their State capitol?\n  On the same day that the South Carolina Legislature expressed the \nwill of its people and the American people and voted overwhelmingly to \ntake down this horrible symbol, on the same day that South Carolina \nvoted to take down that hateful symbol, a Member of this House of \nRepresentatives came to this floor and offered an amendment to preserve \nthat symbol in America's national parks--what a shame.\n  Amazon, Walmart, and Sears all have taken that symbol out of their \nstores and no longer sell it; but the Republican leadership allowed and \nwould have allowed on voice vote an amendment to stand that would \npreserve the right to have that symbol sold in our national parks--what \na shame.\n  I hope the American people are watching and paying attention to this \nbecause it is a moment of truth, I think, for this Congress. I hope and \nI pray that Democrats and Republicans--I know the feelings of the \nDemocratic Caucus; we spoke about it this morning--but I hope will be \njoined by Republicans on the other side in turning back this awful \namendment that would say horrible things about the progress that we \nhope that we had made just in the last few weeks.\n  I ask Americans to join us. Use social media, #takeitdown. Express \nyourself. Join with us in rejecting this horrible symbol of hate. Let's \ntake it down.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4968-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE CONFEDERATE FLAG, A SYMBOL OF PRIDE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa \n(Mr. King) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to \naddress you here on the floor of the House of Representatives and being \nrecognized.\n  I have been listening to this debate over the last week or so, and it \nhas troubled me considerably to watch divisions being driven between \nthe American people over symbolism that has now been redefined by a lot \nof Members of the opposite party.\n  I regret, like all of us do in this country, the tragic and brutal \nand evil murders of the nine people in Charleston, South Carolina. I \npray for them and their families. They stood up and showed us an \nexample of faith that I think surpasses any that I have seen in my \nlifetime by forgiving the killer.\n  I am not to that point in my faith, Mr. Speaker, the least that I can \ntell, but that was very moving. They didn't want to see a division \ncreated, they wanted to heal, and they wanted to see Christ's love come \nout of Charleston.\n  Charleston is a wonderful and beautiful city, and I don't know where \nI would go to find nicer people if I couldn't go actually home, Mr. \nSpeaker, so I couldn't say enough good about that.\n  I have listened to this rhetoric that has poured forth over these \ndays. It appears to me that it is now being turned into something that \nis division, rather than unifying.\n  We unified in our grief with the people of South Carolina, the people \nof Charleston. Now, we are seeing the Confederate battle flag be put up \nas a symbol to be redefined as something different than is understood \nby the majority of the American people.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  I grew up in the North, Mr. Speaker, and the Confederate flag always \nwas a symbol of the pride of the South from where I grew up. My family \nand my predecessors and my ancestors were abolitionists, and they went \nto war to put an end to slavery.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have now in my hand a leather-bound New Testament \nBible that was carried in the shirt pocket of my great uncle, John \nRichardson, and it is written inside here. It was presented to him on \nthe eve of his departure for the war in July of 1862.\n  He walked home 3 years to the day with this Bible in his shirt \npocket, it having protected him. It has fly specks on it from laying \nopen by the campfire. It has verses that are written in it. I have \nfound his picture, his musket, his bayonet, his belt buckle, and his \nink file.\n  That is what is left of this man who committed himself to putting an \nend to slavery. Yet, his cousin, my five times great-grandfather, was \nkilled in that effort. Many gave their lives to put an end to slavery.\n  I was standing before the Lincoln Memorial, reading his second \nInaugural Address, and I will read that into the Record, Mr. Speaker. \nThis component is from Lincoln's second Inaugural Address of March 4, \n1865, when he said:\n\n       Fondly do we hope--fervently do we pray--that this mighty \n     scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that \n     it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's 250 \n     years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop \n     of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn \n     with the sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so still it must \n     be said: ``The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous \n     altogether.''\n\n  Mr. Speaker, these are not disputed numbers. The numbers of Americans \nwho were killed putting an end to slavery and saving the Union: \n600,000.\n  Another number not disputed is the number of Black Africans who were \nbrought to what is now the United States to be slaves: 600,000. I take \nyou back to the words ``until every drop of blood drawn with the lash \nshall be paid by another drawn with the sword . . . `The judgments of \nthe Lord are true and righteous altogether.' ''\n  A huge price has been paid. It has been paid primarily by Caucasian \nChristians. There are many who stepped up because they profoundly \nbelieved that they needed to put an end to slavery.\n  This country has put this behind us. It has been through this brutal \nand bloody battle. We have come back together for the Reconstruction, \nand we have healed this country together. I regret deeply that we are \nwatching this country be divided again over a symbol of a free country.\n  When I go to Germany and see that they have outlawed the swastika, I \nlook at them and I think: We have a First Amendment. That can't happen \nhere in the United States because we are open enough. We have to \ntolerate the desecration of Old Glory, the American flag.\n  Yet, we have people here on the floor who say they are offended by a \nsymbol. They are the ones who are putting it up for all to see, and \nthen they are saying that we should outlaw that so the American people \ndon't have a chance to see our heritage.\n  Everything about America's history is not glorious. Everything about \nour history is not right in our judgment, looking back in hindsight, \nbut none of us know what it was like for the people who lived during \nthat time, in that era.\n  We can accept our history. We can be proud of our history. We can \nunify our country. We can grieve for those who were murdered, and we \ncan preserve our First Amendment rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4968-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4968-H4969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SEMINAL MOMENTS IN TIME\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

This is not that flag.\n  We confront seminal moments in time.\n  In South Carolina, the South Carolina Senate and House of \nRepresentatives stood tall when confronting a seminal moment in time, \nand the Confederate battle flag will be removed.\n  I was so proud to hear a relative, a descendant, of Jefferson Davis \ntake to the floor of the House of Representatives in South Carolina and \nproclaim that the flag must come down.\n  Seminal moments in time.\n  We have our opportunity to do that which is right, to do what Dr. \nKing talked about when he said that the arc of the moral universe is \nlong, but it bends towards justice.\n  We can bend the arc of the moral universe toward justice or we can \nturn back the clock, understanding that this is a symbol that causes a \nlot of pain for a lot of people. This symbol would have prevented my \nhaving the opportunity to stand here if it had prevailed.\n  I call upon all people of goodwill to please do the righteous thing, \nnot just the right thing--do the righteous thing.\n  How can you possibly vote for this after you saw the relatives of the \nnine who were killed stand in court before a judge and before the \nperson who was the assailant--the person who actually killed people--\nand say, ``I forgive you''? We have forgiven those who have fought to \nenslave us. We have forgiven.\n  I forgive you.\n  How could you possibly now decide that you will legitimize this \nsymbol of hatred, of slavery, of a bygone era of a time when people \nwere not even proclaimed to be human beings in the minds of many?\n  So this is a great opportunity for this House of Representatives to \nanswer the clarion call of justice and to do as Dr. King indicated, to \nbend the arc of the moral universe towards justice.\n  But it is also something else. It is an opportunity to see where we \nare.\n  There will be a moment in time beyond this time when someone will \nlook back upon these moments and he will look to see where we stood.\n  Where did you stand when you had the chance to stand for \nrighteousness? Where were you when you had an opportunity to vote to \nrecognize justice as opposed to the injustice associated with this \nsymbol?\n  C.A. Tindley was right. So I will leave you with these words:\n\n       Harder yet may be the fight; right may often yield to \n     might. Wickedness awhile may seem to reign; Satan's cause may \n     seem to gain. There is a God that rules above with the hand \n     of power and a heart of love. When we are right, He will help \n     us fight.\n\n  I stand against this symbol. I stand for the American flag.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today the terrorist army of ISIS is \nstronger than ever. It maims, rapes, pillages, burns, and beheads in \nits zeal to commit religious genocide against anyone who disagrees with \nthem.\n  ISIS controls and manipulates the minds of thousands of foreign \nfighters, including those who come from the United States. This is done \narrogantly through American social media companies.\n  The U.S.' answer to the ISIS threat? Well, let's see what it is.\n  Part of the current U.S. strategy is to train foreign mercenaries to \nfight against ISIS. It has had a yearlong American budget of about $500 \nmillion.\n  The program is to equally fund equipment and to train these so-called \nmoderates from Syria to fight ISIS. I call them mercenaries.\n  However, the Secretary of Defense of the United States--Carter--\nadmitted that, even after this 1 year of training, the United States \nhas only trained 60--six, zero--of these moderate Syrian rebels.\n  If I do my math correctly, Mr. Speaker, we are spending about $4 \nmillion apiece on these 60 fighters to go and fight, supposedly, ISIS.\n  This is embarrassingly pathetic. The greatest nation that has ever \nexisted sees ISIS as such a threat that we are going to send 60 folks \nover to try to take care of them.\n  Ironically, there are more Americans who are fighting with ISIS than \nwe have rebels who have been trained to fight against ISIS.\n  The United States obviously is not taking ISIS seriously. ISIS even \nmocks the United States and its 60 fighters on, once again, American \nsocial media.\n  There is more.\n  The President has recently admitted that the United States really \ndoesn't even have a complete strategy against ISIS. Now, isn't that \nlovely?\n  The question is, Mr. Speaker: Is ISIS a national security threat to \nthe United States? That is the question. That is the question that has \nto be answered by the administration and by Congress, and a decision \nneeds to be made by the administration.\n  It is time for the administration to pick a horse and ride it. If \nISIS is a threat, then we must have a plan to defeat them, then \nactively implement the plan, and defeat ISIS.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Commander in Chief needs to lead. He needs to \ncommand or ISIS will continue its reign of terror in the Middle East \nand in other parts of the world.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4969-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4969-H4970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE CONFEDERATE BATTLE FLAG\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Ellison) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, if there is any doubt in the mind of any \nperson as to what this Confederate battle flag stands for, I urge \npeople not to listen to me. I urge you to listen to the secessionists \nthemselves.\n  Here is a quote from the Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which \nInduce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal \nUnion.\n  It reads:\n\n       This sectional combination for the submersion of the \n     Constitution has been aided in some of the States by \n     elevating to citizenship persons who, by the supreme law of \n     the land, are incapable of becoming citizens, and their votes \n     have been used to inaugurate a new policy hostile to the \n     South and the destruction of its beliefs and safety.\n\n  Those persons were Black people. That new policy that was hostile to \nthe South was ending the enslavement of the millions of people based on \ntheir race.\n  Here is a quote from the Vice President of the Confederacy. I think \nhe can speak authoritatively as to what other Confederate flags mean. \nVice President Alexander Stephens said:\n\n       Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite of \n     the American idea. Its foundations are laid--its cornerstone \n     rests--upon the great truth that the Negro is not equal to \n     the White man, that slavery, subordination to the superior \n     race, is his natural and normal condition.\n\n  That is what the Vice President of the Confederate States said under \nbanners like this one as they were fighting and offering the lives of \ntheir own children to maintain slavery.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  This is what the flag represents.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).\n  Mr. CICILLINE. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, last night the South Carolina House of Representatives \nfinally approved legislation to take down this symbol of hatred and \nbigotry and the darkest time in our Nation's history.\n  It is shameful that less than 24 hours after the State of South \nCarolina took this important step for progress and equality that the \nUnited States House of Representatives would consider an amendment that \nwould allow the Confederate flag to be placed in National Park Service \ncemeteries.\n  Let's be clear. This amendment is a symbol of hate, and anyone who \nsupports its being in a place of honor is imposing an insult on anyone \nwho has experienced racism in their lives or believes in America's \nfounding principles of equality, justice, and freedom.\n  150 years ago hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers died to save \nour Union and to defeat all the ugly beliefs that the Confederate \nbattle flag represents.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King was fond of saying that the arc of the moral \nuniverse is long, but it bends toward justice. Our country has come far \nsince\n\n[[Page H4970]]\n\nthe end of the Civil War, but returning this flag to a place of honor \nwould undermine that progress. It is time to relegate this symbol of \nhate to the dustbin of history.\n  Take it down.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Swalwell).\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for \nleading on this issue.\n  It must be throwback Thursday, because just yesterday the South \nCarolina State House voted to take down the Confederate flag. However, \ntoday our House Republican colleagues want a bill, they want an \namendment that will put that flag back up and allow people to salute \nthat same flag across our country in our national parks.\n  It is time to finally, once and for all, take down an ugly flag that \nis nothing more than a tribute to an ugly past. Mr. Speaker, let's \nthrow down this flag. Let's not throw back to an ugly part of our \nhistory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4970-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas).

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund and its impact on both New Hampshire's natural \nresources and our access to hunting, fishing, and outdoor activities.\n  Established by Congress in 1965, the LWCF provides money to Federal, \nState, and local governments to purchase and preserve land, water, and \nwetlands for the benefit of all Americans.\n  As Granite Staters know, we are blessed to call one of the most \npristine ecological environments in the Nation our home. From the \nseacoast region to the White Mountain National Forest to Lake \nWinnipesaukee, outdoor recreation and activities are a vital part of \nNew Hampshire's First Congressional District's economy.\n  In fact, the Outdoor Industry Association found that active outdoor \nrecreation generates $4.2 billion annually in consumer spending in New \nHampshire, supports nearly 50,000 jobs across the State, and produces \n$293 million annually in State and local revenue. Furthermore, over \n800,000 people hunt, fish, or watch wildlife in New Hampshire each \nyear, spending over $560 million on wildlife-related recreation.\n  It is no surprise that the LWCF is a critical part in maintaining and \nstrengthening those numbers, while simultaneously preserving our \nbeautiful State.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4970-8", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CANCER DRUG COVERAGE PARITY ACT\n\n  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, this year, more than 1.5 million Americans \nwill be diagnosed with cancer. Fortunately, innovative research has led \nto more effective and accessible treatments. However, insurance has not \nkept pace with the science, and cancer patients are paying the price.\n  Chemotherapy, previously administered only through injection, is now \navailable for many types of cancer in pill form. Today, oral \nchemotherapy represents 35 percent of all new cancer drugs. However, \ncopayments for oral chemo can be hundreds or thousands of dollars per \nmonth. As a result, it prevents patients from filling their \nprescriptions.\n  A cancer patient should never be forced to make a treatment decision \nbased on finances. That is why I joined Congressman Leonard Lance to \nreintroduce the Cancer Drug Coverage Parity Act, which would require \nhealth insurance plans that cover traditional chemotherapy to provide \nno less favorable coverage for prescribed orally administered drugs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort to ensure \ncancer patients can receive the treatments their doctors prescribe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4970-9", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        START REBUILDING AMERICA\n\n  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee.

Your \naccomplishments will forever be recognized by generations of Americans \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4971-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TAKE DOWN THE CONFEDERATE FLAG\n\n  (Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT.

Mr. Speaker, early this year, I had the opportunity to meet \nwith Ambassador David Saperstein, the U.S. Ambassador At Large for \nInternational Religious Freedom. He is tasked with leading America's \nfight against religious persecution throughout the world. This is a \nsignificant mandate, especially in the Middle East, where Christian, \nJewish, and minority Muslim communities that have been settled in the \nsame areas for millennia are being uprooted, subjugated, and murdered.\n  These aren't acts of geopolitical jockeying or even political \ndomination. These are acts of pure, unadulterated evil perpetuated by \nthose of dark and wicked souls.\n  Fundamental American values, among which are commitments to religious \nfreedom and human rights, will always be the cornerstone of this \nNation's foreign policy.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 1150, the Frank Wolf International \nReligious Freedom Act, because now, more than ever, we need to ensure \nthat former Congressman Frank Wolf's landmark legislation is updated \nfor the 21st century to be able to give us the best tools to promote \nreligious freedom around the globe.\n  I thank Ambassador Saperstein for his work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4971-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4971-H4972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n            REMOVE CONFEDERATE FLAGS FROM OUR NATIONAL PARKS\n\n  (Mr. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n\n[[Page H4972]]\n\n  Mr. HAHN.

Just a couple of days ago, \nthis body voted to remove the Confederate battle flag from our national \nparks.\n  My Republican colleagues are choosing to raise the Confederate battle \nflag again, despite growing opposition by Americans who recognize it as \na disgraceful celebration of the war waged to prolong slavery in this \ncountry.\n  Yesterday, in a stunning sign of progress, South Carolina voted to \ntake down that flag after 50 years of flying it at their State capitol. \nWhy do some here continue to insist on defending this painful symbol of \nracism?\n  This is shameful. In the wake of the devastating murder of Senator \nPinckney and the eight other churchgoers at Emanuel AME, this is a new \nlow for this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4972-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         21ST CENTURY CURES ACT\n\n  (Mr. VALADAO asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. VALADAO.

Mr. Speaker, I was appalled \nby these actions.\n  The tragic events in Charleston led to South Carolina's landmark vote \nlast night to take down the Confederate flag from their statehouse. If \nSouth Carolina can act, certainly and surely, Congress can support our \nnational parks in acting to don't sell that flag.\n  Mr. Speaker, these are America's parks, and they belong to all \npeople.

Mr. Speaker, last night in the South Carolina \nLegislature, we saw Democrats and Republicans join together to take \ndown the Confederate battle flag, many with tears in their eyes and \nstill grieving the nine lives lost in Charleston.\n  While the people of South Carolina move one step past this terrible \ntragedy, many House Republicans want to take our Nation 150 years back.\n  We were scheduled to vote on the Interior Appropriations bill today. \nThe bill was pulled because Members on the other side of the aisle \nobjected to banning the display and sale of the Confederate flags at \nnational park facilities.\n  For years, I have heard all the arguments from those who defend the \ndisplay of the Confederate battle flag, but it is moral cowardice to \nignore this flag's history of White supremacy and treason, to pretend \nit symbolizes anything other than a heritage of hate and human \noppression.\n  The Confederate battle flag does not belong atop our State capitols, \nand it certainly should not be sold or displayed at our national parks. \nIt belongs in a museum of shame, alongside the other relics of hate and \ndivision that tore our country apart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4972-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SHERIFF RALPH LAMB\n\n  (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. TITUS.

Some see it as heritage, and most see it as hatred.\n  I can tell you one thing: we, the people, cannot allow on Federal \ngrounds--we all pay taxes and are citizens of this great Nation--and to \nallow this flag to be sold and to be displayed on Federal land is \nunacceptable.\n  I really hope that, when I gathered together 100 Members of Congress \nin Selma for the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery march, it \nwas not a kumbaya moment in Selma in March; rather, I hope that we will \ndo what we promised this Nation we would do, and that is represent we, \nthe people, by taking down this flag and not displaying it on any \ngrounds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4972-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4972-H4973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PENNSYLVANIA OREO PLANT CLOSURE\n\n  (Mr. BRENDAN F.

Mr. Speaker, last week, many of \nus were proudly waving our flag, celebrating the Fourth of July, and \nalso rooting on the successful women's soccer team in winning the World \nCup.\n  Unfortunately, at the very same time we were doing that, displaying \nour patriotism, the company that makes Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers, \ntwo very well-known American brands, decided that, for the first time \nin 60 years, they would close their legendary Philadelphia plant in the \nheart of my district, laying off over 300 workers because they are \nshipping the jobs to Monterrey, Mexico.\n  Now, keep in mind, this is a company, Mondelez, that is in no way in \nfinancial disarray. In fact, their revenues last year topped $50 \nbillion. This plant that was closed is profitable, but not profitable \nenough.\n\n[[Page H4973]]\n\n  But there is good news. I do congratulate their CEO, Ms. Irene \nRosenfeld, who got a 50 percent pay increase in the last few months at \nthe same very time over 300 workers from my district were getting laid \noff.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is not right.

This is unbelievable, and I say that as \na Southern representative.\n  It is unbelievable, after the unspeakable tragedy in Charleston and \nthe action in the South Carolina Legislature yesterday to remove the \nbattle flag from South Carolina's Capitol grounds. But the House \nRepublican leadership last night chose to accommodate the Southern \nRepublican irreconcilables with an amendment, and now, they are pulling \nthe Interior bill, lest the irreconcilables bring it down.\n  Mr. Speaker, we shouldn't have to debate whether a symbol of hatred \nand oppression in our Nation's darkest hour should be displayed on \nFederal lands.

Mr. Speaker, so I have heard that the Republicans \nhave pulled their Interior Appropriations bill from the floor, and I \nsure hope it is because they have reconsidered their support for flying \nthe Confederate battle flag, overturning an earlier decision of this \nvery body by unanimous voice vote to take it down.\n  Last night, unbelievably, unforgivably, House Republicans acted to \nuphold the Confederate battle flag at the very moment that South \nCarolina was voting to take it down. House Republicans surreptitiously \nrushed to have National Park Service continue to sell this symbol of \nhate and to keep the Confederate flag flying on Federal lands.\n  Even worse, House Republicans tried to cloak this shady move by \nwrapping it in language about our American flag and the MIA-POW flag--\nhow dare they.\n  Sears, Amazon, and many other retailers have stopped selling that \nsymbol of hate, and that is what a Republican State Representative in \nSouth Carolina tearfully called it.\n  It is astonishing that the Republicans are so out of touch.

They \nare constantly provocative and a serious threat toward our ally Israel.\n  We all want to see the threat of war with Iran diminished and to \ndisable their nuclear pursuits, but giving them too much to secure a \nvapid deal will only increase Iran's threat. That is why any agreement \nmust have unassailable standards for inspections any time in any place.\n  Access to all background on their prior military nuclear research \nmust also be in the agreement. The strictest limits on centrifuges and \nenrichments must be there. A breakout time of no less than 1 year and a \nphased performance-based sanctions relief and airtight snapback \nsanctions when Iran violates these standards must also be included. \nAnything less should be rejected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4973-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CALVERT AMENDMENT\n\n  (Mr. LEWIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. LEWIS.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to rule IX, I rise in regard to a \nquestion of the privileges of the House, and I send to the desk a \nprivileged resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 355\n\n       Whereas, at 4 p.m. today, July 9th, the Governor of South \n     Carolina will sign legislation to remove the display of the \n     Confederate battle flag;\n       Whereas, on December 20, 1860, South Carolina became the \n     first State to secede from the Union;\n       Whereas, on January 9, 1861, Mississippi seceded from the \n     Union, stating in its `Declaration of Immediate Causes' that \n     `[o]ur position is thoroughly identified with the institution \n     of slavery--the greatest material interest of the world.';\n       Whereas, on February 9, 1861, the Confederate States of \n     America was formed with a group of 11 States as a purported \n     sovereign nation and with Jefferson Davis of Mississippi as \n     its president;\n       Whereas, on March 11, 1861, the Confederate States of \n     America adopted its own constitution;\n       Whereas, on April 12, 1861, the Confederate States of \n     America fired shots upon Fort Sumter in Charleston, South \n     Carolina, effectively beginning the Civil War;\n       Whereas, the United States did not recognize the \n     Confederate States of America as a sovereign nation, but \n     rather as a rebel insurrection, and took to military battle \n     to bring the rogue states back into the Union;\n       Whereas, on April 9, 1865, General Robert E. Lee \n     surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court \n     House in Virginia, effectively, ending the Civil War and \n     preserving the Union;\n       Whereas, during the Civil War, the Confederate States of \n     America used the Navy Jack, Battle Flag, and other imagery as \n     symbols of the Confederate armed forces;\n       Whereas, since the end of the Civil War, the Navy Jack, \n     Confederate battle flag, and other imagery of the Confederacy \n     have been appropriated by groups as symbols of hate, terror, \n     intolerance, and as supportive of the institution of slavery;\n       Whereas, groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and other White \n     supremacist groups utilize Confederate imagery to frighten, \n     terrorize, and cause harm to groups of people toward whom \n     they have hateful intent, including African-Americans, \n     Hispanic-Americans, and Jewish Americans;\n       Whereas, many State and Federal political leaders, \n     including United States Senators Thad Cochran and Roger \n     Wicker, along with Mississippi House Speaker Philip Gunn and \n     other State leaders, have spoken out and advocated for the \n     removal of the imagery of the Confederacy on Mississippi's \n     State flag;\n       Whereas, many Members of Congress, including Speaker John \n     Boehner, support the removal of the Confederate flag from the \n     grounds of South Carolina's capitol;\n       Whereas, Speaker John Boehner released a statement on the \n     issue saying, 'I commend Governor Nikki Haley and other South \n     Carolina leaders in their effort to remove the Confederate \n     flag from Statehouse grounds. In his second inaugural address \n     150 years ago, and a month before his assassination, \n     President Abraham Lincoln ended his speech with these \n     powerful words, which are as meaningful today as when they \n     were spoken on the East Front of the Capitol on March 4, \n     1865: 'With malice toward none, with charity for all, with \n     firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let \n     us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the \n     nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the \n     battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may \n     achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves \n     and with all nations.';\n       Whereas, the House of Representatives has several State \n     flags with imagery of the Confederacy throughout its main \n     structures and House office buildings;\n       Whereas, it is an uncontroverted fact that symbols of the \n     Confederacy offend and insult many members of the general \n     public who use the hallways of Congress each day;\n       Whereas, Congress has never permanently recognized in its \n     hallways the symbols of sovereign nations with whom it has \n     gone to war or rogue entities such as the Confederate States \n     of America;\n       Whereas, continuing to display a symbol of hatred, \n     oppression, and insurrection that nearly tore our Union apart \n     and that is known to offend many groups throughout the \n     country would irreparably damage the reputation of this \n     august institution and offend the very dignity of the House \n     of Representatives; and\n       Whereas, this impairment of the dignity of the House and \n     its Members constitutes a violation under rule IX of the \n     Rules of the House of Representatives of the One Hundred \n     Fourteenth Congress: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     shall remove any State flag containing any portion of the \n     Confederate battle flag, other than a flag displayed by the \n     office of a Member of the House, from any area within the \n     House wing of the Capitol or any House office building, and \n     shall donate any such flag to the Library of Congress.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The resolution presents a question of \nprivilege.\n\n[[Page H4975]]\n\n                            Motion to Refer\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to refer.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. McCarthy moves that the resolution be referred to the \n     Committee on House Administration.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California is recognized \nfor 1 hour.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, this resolution raises a number of \nimportant questions, and the House would be best served by committee \naction on this measure. Accordingly, I am moving to refer the \nresolution to the Committee on House Administration.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the motion to refer.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I ask for a recorded vote.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman asking for a recorded \nvote on ordering the previous question?\n  Ms. PELOSI. I thought the motion was to refer it to committee.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has not yet put that question.\n  The question is on ordering the previous question.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman may state her parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I will stay where we are until the gentleman \nrules.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask for a recorded vote.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman asking for a recorded \nvote on ordering the previous question?\n  Ms. PELOSI. Yes.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair \nwill reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on \nthe question of adoption of the motion to refer.\n  The vote was taken by electronic

In lieu of the \n     amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce now printed in the bill, an \n     amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the \n     text of Rules Committee Print 114-22 shall be considered as \n     adopted in the House and in the Committee of the Whole. The \n     bill, as amended, shall be considered as the original bill \n     for the purpose of further amendment under the five-minute \n     rule and shall be considered as read. All points of order \n     against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. No \n     further amendment to the bill, as amended, shall be in order \n     except those printed in the report of the Committee on Rules \n     accompanying this resolution. Each such further amendment may \n     be offered only in the order printed in the report, may be \n     offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be\n\n[[Page H4977]]\n\n     considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified \n     in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent \n     and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall \n     not be subject to a demand for division of the question in \n     the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of \n     order against such further amendments are waived. At the \n     conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the \n     Committee shall rise and report the bill, as amended, to the \n     House with such further amendments as may have been adopted. \n     The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the \n     bill, as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to \n     final passage without intervening motion except one motion to \n     recommit with or without instructions.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 \nhour.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMcGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nDuring consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the \npurpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 350 provides for a rule to \nconsider a critical bill that will help millions of Americans and their \nfamilies who are suffering from diseases for which there is no cure.\n  The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the \nmajority and the minority of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and \nmakes eight amendments from Members of both parties in order so that \nthe House may fully debate the merits of this legislation.\n  As is custom, the minority is offered a final motion to recommit the \nbill prior to its passage.\n  I am pleased the House is considering this bipartisan legislation. \nThe Energy and Commerce Committee has spent 14 months working to bring \nour healthcare innovation infrastructure into the 21st century.\n  Today, there are 10,000 known diseases or conditions, and we have got \ncures for 500. There is a gap between the innovation and how we \nregulate our therapies. It is not unheard of to have a company take 14 \nyears and spend $2 billion to bring a new device or drug to market.\n  Members held nearly 20 roundtables and events around the country to \nensure that we involved patients, advocates, researchers, innovators, \nand investors that have firsthand experience and help understand the \ngaps in our current system.\n  H.R. 6 touches each step of the healthcare innovation process: \ndiscovery, development and delivery. This bill attempts to close the \ngap between the fast pace of innovation and our current, often \nburdensome regulatory process.\n  The bill provides exciting new tools to uncover the next generation \nof treatments and cures. H.R. 6 is, indeed, transformative--\ntransformative of the way that doctors and researchers study diseases, \ndevelop treatments, and deliver care.\n  It encourages innovation. It fosters the use of data to further \nresearch. It modernizes clinical trials and takes steps toward the \nfuture of personalized medicine.\n  Not only does this bill take a major step forward in bringing more \ncures to patients, this bill addresses our Nation's ever-increasing \nhealthcare spending. This bill establishes a temporary innovation fund \nwhich is fully offset, including permanently reforming our entitlement \nprograms.\n  Beyond the budget window, these reforms in Medicare and Medicaid are \nestablished to yield at least $7 billion in additional savings for \ntaxpayers; but make no mistake. The biggest cost saver--the biggest \ncost saver--will be finding cures to some of America's most deadly and \ncostly diseases.\n  I am thankful to have worked on many parts of this bill. The \nlegislation contains five bills that I have introduced and other \nprovisions that I helped with the authorship. I would like to take a \nminute to talk about a few of the sections where I have personally \nworked on them.\n  While thousands of Americans are affected by multiple sclerosis, \nParkinson's, and other neurologic diseases, very little accurate \ninformation exists to assist those who research, treat, and provide \ncare to those suffering from these diseases.\n  H.R. 6 actually includes H.R. 292, that I introduced, with Mr. Van \nHollen of Maryland, to advance research for neurologic diseases. H.R. 6 \nwill allow for surveillance systems for tracking key neurologic \ndiseases, which may then be used to help us further understand these \ndevastating diseases and deliver their cure.\n  We are improving patient access to needed treatments by supporting \nexpedited approval for breakthrough therapies and actually making it \neasier to seek approval for new indications of approved therapies.\n  Currently, the Food and Drug Administration approved drugs may be \nonly promoted for the approved indication, even if the sponsor \ndetermines that the drug is an effective treatment for another \nindication.\n  H.R. 6 includes another bill, H.R. 2415, which I introduced with Mr. \nEngel of New York, and would formally establish a program within the \nFood and Drug Administration, which would allow companies with approved \ndrugs or biologics to submit clinical data summaries for consideration \nof a new indication.\n  This would reduce the time to approval and reduce resources required \nto approve new indications of drugs, drugs that have a well-established \nknowledge base and well-established safety information.\n  I introduced H.R. 293, with Representative DeFazio of Oregon, to \nprotect continuing medical education, which plays a vital role in our \nhealthcare system. This improves patient outcomes, facilitates medical \ninnovation, and keeps our Nation's medical professionals up-to-date.\n  With the inclusion of this provision in H.R. 6, we will ensure that \ndoctors continue to have access to these vital tools.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  The provision simply enforces current law, which states that \neducational materials were explicitly excluded from reporting \nrequirements in the Affordable Care Act.\n  Unfortunately, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has \nacted in conflict with the law, but we correct that in H.R. 6 and \nensure that physicians have access to materials and information to keep \nus informed and up to date on medical innovation. With its inclusion in \nH.R. 6, we will ensure that doctors continue to have access to these \nvital tools.\n  We ensure that Americans have access to their critical health \ninformation by identifying barriers to achieving fully interoperable \nhealth records.\n  Mr. Speaker, the United States taxpayer has spent well over $30 \nbillion to ensure that healthcare providers obtain an electronic record \nsystem. However, the investment has not resulted in access to \ninformation in those records and patients across the healthcare \nspectrum.\n  While we have seen widespread adoption of electronic health records, \nour Nation continues to maintain a fragmented healthcare system, making \nit difficult to ensure the continuity for evidence-based care for \npatients.\n  The 21st Century Cures Act would finally set the United States on a \npath toward achieving a nationwide interoperable health information \nsystem. This will be transformative for research and for medical \ntreatment.\n  Finally, along with Mr. McCaul and Mr. Butterfield, we aid patients \nby requiring companies to clarify availability of expanded access \nprograms.\n  Further, with the inclusion of H.R. 2414, which I introduced with Mr. \nSchrader of Oregon, we are requiring the Food and Drug Administration \nto issue guidance on the dissemination of up-to-date, truthful, \nscientific medical information about FDA-approved medications.\n  This legislation passed out of Energy and Commerce's Subcommittee on \nHealth on May 19 on a voice vote, and it passed the full committee on \nMay 21, 51-0, the second time in 3 years that the committee has had a \n51-0 vote, the previous one being on the repeal of the sustainable \ngrowth rate formula.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and \n``yes'' on\n\n[[Page H4978]]\n\nthe underlying bill. 21st Century Cures would not only deliver hope to \nthe millions of American patients living with untreatable diseases, but \nit will help modernize and streamline the American healthcare system.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) \nfor yielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, before I speak on this bill, I want to thank Leader \nPelosi for leading today's efforts to hold House Republicans \naccountable for their divisive Confederate flag amendment.\n  You know, it is stunning to me that my Republican friends decided to \nrefer the minority leader's resolution to committee so we could not \nhave a debate.\n  The legislature in South Carolina could have a debate, but my \nRepublican friends here in the House of Representatives ensured that we \nin Congress cannot have that debate.\n  And the fact is that Americans, I think, are ready to leave behind \nthe discrimination and hate symbolized by the Confederate flag, but my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle seem to have a different idea.\n  Last night House Republicans introduced an amendment to the Interior \nAppropriations bill that simply has no place on this House floor.\n  It would undo the successful Democratic amendment adopted by voice \nthat would have barred the display of Confederate flags in Federal \ncemeteries and barred the National Park Service from doing business \nwith gift shops that sell Confederate flag merchandise.\n  Simply put, while South Carolina voted this week to take the \nConfederate flag down, Republicans in Congress were ready to put it \nback up.\n  And even more troubling, House Republicans tried to sneak this \namendment into the bill late last night, hoping that nobody would \nnotice. We noticed. The American people noticed.\n  And I am ashamed that, in 2015, Congress would even consider a \nmeasure that seeks to perpetuate the hate and racism that the \nConfederate flag represents.\n  Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle, especially the \nleadership, seem to be in a little bit of disarray.\n  The Speaker of the House is trying to distance himself from the \nmeasure, notwithstanding that the Republican chairman of the House \nAppropriations Interior Subcommittee who offered the amendment said \nthat he did so at the request of the Republican leadership.\n  The Confederate flag is a symbol of racism and a reminder of one of \nour Nation's darkest periods of division. It has no place in America's \nNational Parks. Congress should not promote this symbol of hate.\n  And now is the time to come together. I am proud to join with my \ncolleagues who are standing up today for all Americans united against \nhate.\n  I will be asking my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous \nquestion so that we can bring up the Pelosi resolution before all of us \nhere and have that debate and have that vote. I hope my Republican \nfriends will join with me.\n  I just want to say one final thing. The fact that the Interior \nAppropriations bill was pulled from consideration on this House floor \nby my Republican friends because they believed that, without this pro-\nConfederate flag amendment, that they could lose up to 100 of their own \nMembers, is stunning to me.\n  It never ceases to amaze me. Just when I think that this institution \ncan't sink any lower, then something like this happens.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to stand with me and vote \nagainst the previous question so we can actually have this debate, a \ndebate I think the American people would want us to have.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, on the underlying bill before us, H.R. 6, the 21st \nCentury Cures Act, I just want to say that this is the product of \nbipartisan hearings, stakeholder meetings, drafts and redrafts.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the version of H.R. 6 that was passed \nby the Energy and Commerce Committee by a vote of 51-0. A vote like \nthat doesn't happen often, especially in this Congress.\n  I want to commend Chairman Upton and Congresswoman DeGette for \nleading this initiative and tirelessly working to get H.R. 6 to the \nfloor.\n  I think it represents the kind of investments that we should be \nmaking to help families stay healthy and to grow our economy.\n  It provides $8.75 billion in mandatory funding over the next 5 years \nto the National Institutes of Health to spur scientific innovation and \ndiscovery by the country's premier medical researchers and scientists.\n  During the Clinton administration, Congress doubled the NIH budget \nand made a real commitment to keeping America on the front lines of \nscientific research. That investment led to exponential advances in \nmedicine.\n\n  We should continue that progress by once again giving NIH the \nresources they need to make new advances in medicine. We shouldn't let \nour politics limit our ambition.\n  As Members of Congress, we were elected to be leaders, and this is an \nopportunity to ensure America continues to lead the way on new \nbreakthroughs in health.\n  Now, I would have preferred to see the original $10 billion in NIH \nfunding that was included in the bill that passed out of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee, and I hope that we can increase NIH funding back to \nthat level as the bill moves forward.\n  We know without a shadow of a doubt that basic medical research \nproduces results. In fact, NIH-funded research at institutions like the \nUniversity of Massachusetts Medical School in my hometown of Worcester \nhas been the single greatest contributor to advances in health in human \nhistory.\n  Today the average American lives 6 years longer than in the 1970s \nlargely because of pioneering NIH investments.\n  All across the country, NIH-supported researchers are forging a path \ntoward treatment and cures for debilitating diseases that impact \npatients everywhere.\n  But their success depends upon us. Our decision to invest in NIH is \nimperative to their success in improving health for all Americans.\n  Just consider UMASS Medical School as one example. For years, UMASS \nhas been in the forefront of medical innovation because of investments \nfrom NIH.\n  In 2006, Dr. Craig Mello received the Nobel Prize in medicine for his \ngroundbreaking discovery of RNA silencing, which, in layman's terms, \nmeans shutting off bad cells.\n  UMASS has researchers working toward finding cures for AIDS, Down's \nSyndrome, and Lou Gehrig's disease. All of this is possible because of \nour investment in NIH.\n  But I hear over and over again from scientists and medical \nresearchers that they worry about the uncertainty of NIH funding \nbecause of crazy things that we do, like sequestration. They worry \nabout our commitment to advancing basic medical research.\n  Fewer and fewer research grants are being funded. Countries like \nChina, India, and even Singapore are luring away the best and brightest \nAmerican researchers because they are committing to making meaningful \ninvestments in medical research.\n  21st Century Cures helps to reverse that trend, but I worry it is not \nenough. I am pleased to see that H.R. 6 takes a number of steps to \nmodernize clinical trials, improve how the Food and Drug Administration \napproves new drugs and devices, and encourages the development of next \ngeneration treatments through the use of precision medicine, which \nPresident Obama highlighted in his State of the Union speech.\n  Just last week we saw the approval of a major new drug that will \nimprove the quality of life for more than 10,000 people living with \ncystic fibrosis. The investments included in 21st Century Cures will \nhelp us to make more of these kinds of groundbreaking advances a \nreality.\n  Mr. Speaker, for all of the bipartisanship and positive aspects of \nthis bill, I would be remiss if I didn't point out one glaring \ninconsistency.\n  Despite numerous hearings, round tables, and forms on this bill, a \ncontroversial policy rider that restricts access to abortion was added \nto the bill that came before the Rules Committee.\n\n[[Page H4979]]\n\n  It is like the majority couldn't help themselves. They couldn't \nresist an opportunity to add a contentious rider to an otherwise \nbipartisan package to advance medical research.\n  I am pleased that the committee made in order an amendment offered by \nmy friends Barbara Lee, Jan Schakowsky, and Yvette Clarke to strike \nthese controversial policy riders.\n  Unfortunately, the committee prohibited a number of other amendments \nfrom coming to the floor for debate. Out of the 36 amendments submitted \nfor consideration, only eight will be considered on this floor during \ndebate on this legislation.\n  Many of our colleagues came to the Rules Committee last night to \ntestify on their amendments. They raised important issues and made \nsuggestions as to how we can improve this legislation.\n  So while I support the underlying bill, I urge my colleagues to vote \n``no'' on the rule, which prohibits debate on a number of amendments \nworthy of consideration.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Walden), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the \ncommittee, Fred Upton, and Diana DeGette for their great bipartisan \nwork. And we all put a shoulder to the wheel here to get this done.\n  This is really big, 21st Century Cures. All of us have known someone \nafflicted by deadly diseases. Most of us have seen people in our own \nfamilies.\n  My mother passed away as the result of ovarian cancer. My sister-in-\nlaw had brain cancer. I lost a son to a congenital heart defect. My \nmother-in-law had rheumatoid arthritis from a very early age. My \nstepmother died of a stroke. We are all affected.\n  Investing in cures, investing in treatments, investing in innovation \nand doing it right here in America is the best step forward.\n  This legislation would modernize the Nation's biomedical innovation \ninfrastructure and streamline the process for how drugs and medical \ndevices are approved in order to get new treatments to patients and get \nit to them faster.\n  To do this, we solicited input from some of the best scientists in \nthe world, including Dr. Brian Druker of OHSU, Oregon Health Sciences \nUniversity, Knight Cancer Research Center, a true pioneer in the fight \nagainst cancer.\n  This initiative would give hope to countless Oregonians. Like my \nfriend Linda Sindt, a close friend in southern Oregon, she lost her \nhusband Duane to pancreatic cancer. She said this legislation will put \nus on a path to improved survival for pancreatic cancer.\n  Nancy Roach, a colon cancer advocate in my hometown of Hood River, \npraised the bill, saying, ``Investing in 21st century science by \nboosting funding for the NIH makes sense.''\n  Colton and Tiffany Allen are residents of Talent, Oregon. They said \nthis bill will give hope, hope, to individuals like Colton, who \nstruggles with ALS.\n  We owe it to people like Linda, Nancy, Colton, Tiffany, to our \nfamilies, to all Americans and literally people around the globe to \npass this legislation, to tackle these diseases that have no treatment \nor cure, to develop new innovative treatments, provide better health \ntechnology, and ultimately bring hope and better lives for all.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Ms. Slaughter), the distinguished ranking member of the \nCommittee on Rules.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, this is a very important day for me, as a \nmember of the Rules Committee. Rules, as you know, is the process \ncommittee. I want to spend my time discussing the process that has been \ngoing on here.\n  The process that rules have in the House is to really make certain \nthat fairness is presented to all parties.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Whether you are a majority or a minority, you have your rights, but \nthey have been trampled on and abused with increasing regularity under \nthis majority, and we have two glaring examples of that just today. We \nhave glaring examples every day, but let me bring up these two.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is critically important to all of us, and as \neverybody has spoken before makes it clear--and we all agree on the \nimportance of putting more money into major research in the United \nStates--we are falling behind other countries in finding the cures and \nthe innovation for which we have been known for centuries. This is an \nimportant step that we are taking. This is a critically important bill, \nbut process matters.\n  Mr. Speaker, after the committee had voted out this bill unanimously, \nmajor changes were made with no committee input at all. They include \nreduction of the amount of money that the committee had said would be \nput into the National Institutes of Health by $1.025 billion, a very \nsubstantial sum.\n  They added some policy riders that literally made no sense. Why in \nthe world would you put an abortion rider on a thing for medical \nresearch? As far as I know, the NIH and most medical universities doing \nthis research do not perform abortion procedures. It was simply a way, \nagain, to mollify people and make somebody think that, if they vote for \nthis bill, they are doing something that is impossible to do. But like \nAlice in Wonderland, we are all trained here to try to believe six \nimpossible things before breakfast because we are confronted with them \ndaily.\n  Another one is that they changed the pay-fors, which is critically \nimportant to everything that we do.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. So, Mr. Speaker, despite the importance of this bill, \ndespite the fact that it came out of committee unanimously, despite the \nfact that so many people have worked on it, and despite the fact that \ngood things were in it, the process was completely changed after it was \nover by rewriting major portions of it. That doesn't appear anywhere in \nthe rules of the House.\n  Now, not only that, let's think about what happened here this \nmorning. Last night on the Interior bill, which is an open rule, after \nthe Democrat who was up, Betty McCollum of Minnesota, had yielded back \nher time, after the time had been yielded on both sides and the vote \nhad been taken, suddenly another amendment appears at the request, as \nMr. McGovern has said, of the Republican leadership. So they suddenly \ncome up with this. Ms. McCollum was not informed in any way. She had \nabsolutely no knowledge of what was going to happen. That may not break \na specific rule of the House, but it sure does break etiquette. You do \nnot come out onto the floor to try to fool people who are on the other \nside.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again \nexpired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, what happened here this morning, \nobviously, I think Mr. McGovern has stated it precisely. Without the \nability to have that amendment, without that crazy amendment, frankly, \nthat resolution--as far as I am concerned, once you send them back to \ncommittee, you are sending them to interment--we will never see that \none again. But they had to have that in order to get the votes to pass \nthe bill. That is the kind of horse trading and all the things that go \non here. After all the process and procedure that belongs to the \nCongress of the United States, and has for centuries, has been \nabsolutely abused, as I said earlier, and trampled on on a regular \nbasis, Mr. Speaker, it is time we stopped it. Nothing happened here \ntoday except to make this place look stupid.\n  I was born in a border State, in Kentucky. All my life I have lived \nthere. I was educated there, and I was married there. I never saw a \nConfederate flag in all the years of my life. These battle flags that \nthey are putting up appeared in the South after the civil rights \nlegislation. They were the products of Strom Thurmond and the \nDixiecrats. That is when they started to bloom all over. It is a symbol \nof pure hate and revenge or whatever else they want to call it. It \nneeds to go.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again \nexpired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 10 \nseconds.\n\n[[Page H4980]]\n\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. It is the equivalent to my having the German \nGovernment flying the swastika over the Bundestag.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a valuable member of the Energy \nand Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule for \nH.R. 6, the 21st Century Cures Act.\n  The 21st Century Cures Act is one of the best things Congress has \ndone in a long time in my opinion. H.R. 6 is a holistic reform of how \nwe can get cures and treatments to patients who need them. That is what \nthis bill is all about, patients, our constituents, Mr. Speaker.\n  One provision I was particularly proud to author will establish a \ndrug management program which prevents at-risk beneficiaries from \nabusing controlled substances. This program will help protect our \nseniors. It is a fix to Medicare part D, that is a program that is \nreally desperately needed. This commonsense measure has been \nrecommended by GAO and IG, and it is also recommended by CMS.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is utilized by private industry, TRICARE, and State \nMedicaid programs. This bill makes strides to prevent prescription drug \nabuse and promote a healthier America.\n  I urge support for the rule and the underlying bill as well.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Matsui), a member of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule to consider the 21st \nCentury Cures Act on the floor. On the Energy and Commerce Committee, \nwe worked tirelessly with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nto get this bill to a place that we could all agree upon, a place where \nwe provide new mandatory funding for NIH to do the critical research \nthat is a foundation for cures, a place where we tweak FDA processes \nand provide FDA with additional resources to do the new things that \nwill help get treatments and cures to patients faster.\n  As we worked together to find ways to accelerate innovation, patients \nwith rare diseases have been at the forefront of our conversations. It \nis often more difficult to research and develop cures for rare disease \npatients due to their small populations. However, finding cures for \nrare diseases is not just of the utmost importance to the patients with \nthose rare diseases and their families, it is important to all of us. \nYou never know where a cure might come from, and often research and \ndrug development on one disease may turn out to be fruitful for \nanother.\n  Mr. Speaker, we all need to work together to advance cures and \ntreatments. A provision of this bill would encourage public-private \npartnerships to foster better utilization of patient registries that \ngenerate important information on the natural history of diseases, \nespecially rare diseases for which other types of research can be \ndifficult.\n  I also applaud the efforts in this bill to advance the President's \nPrecision Medicine Initiative to accelerate discoveries that are \ntailored to individual patients' needs.\n  The telehealth language in 21st Century Cures recognizes telehealth \nis the delivery of safe, effective, quality healthcare services by a \nhealthcare provider using technology as the mode of delivery, and the \ninteroperability provision makes great strides toward ensuring that our \nhealth IT systems can communicate amongst each other and with patients.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't claim that this bill is perfect. Compromises \nhave been made. I am disappointed that the amount of NIH funding has \nbeen recently reduced from $10 billion to $8.7 billion. I am also \ndisappointed that policy riders, such as the Hyde amendment language, \nhave been inserted after we voted this out of committee, and I look \nforward to voting for the amendment offered by my colleagues Barbara \nLee, Jan Schakowsky, and Yvette Clarke to strike the policy riders \nlanguage. With that, Mr. Speaker, I do, however, support the 21st \nCentury Cures legislation.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. McCaul), the chairman of the Homeland Security \nCommittee.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I commend Dr. Burgess and Chairman Upton for \na bill that is truly visionary that will actually save lives, something \nwe can rarely say we do up here in this place, but I believe this will \nprovide cures for the next century.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are two provisions I am very pleased to see in the \nbill. One is the Andrea Sloan CURE Act, which expands compassionate use \nto those who have life-threatening diseases and gives them greater \naccess to lifesaving medications. Andrea is a friend of mine who, on \nher deathbed, asked me to try to make sure that this didn't happen to \nother people.\n  And finally, I am pleased to see the reauthorization of the Creating \nHope Act, which has now led to the second childhood cancer drug \napproved since the 1980s and the first FDA-approved drug to treat high-\nrisk neuroblastoma.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe that with the passage of this bill we will see \ngreater cures in the future, and we will not only save adults from \ncancers, but also children from this dreaded disease in the future.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Speier), a member of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. Speaker, coming out of committee, H.R. 6 was a bipartisan huge \nleap forward in our efforts to accelerate the development of lifesaving \ncures through medical research. Yet somehow, between the committee and \nthe floor, the majority once again has tacked on antiabortion Hyde \namendment language, which makes no sense at all.\n  It is like the Republicans are cheap stage magicians attracting our \nattention with the promise of critically needed medical advances, all \nthe while stuffing the same old, flea-bitten Hyde provision rabbit into \ntheir hat. We are tired of this tedious stage show. NIH is already \nsubject to the Hyde provisions in appropriation bills. This is just a \nway to continue politics as usual.\n  If H.R. 6 passes under a mantle of bipartisanship, they will pull out \nthe rabbit, wave it around, and say, Look how amazing and wonderful we \nare.\n  I, for one, am sick of the House being run like a boardwalk magic \nshow. Adding this type of language between open, transparent committee \nconsideration and open, transparent floor consideration makes a mockery \nof representative government. Adding an antiabortion rider to bills in \nthe dead of night through sleight of hand turns the substantive \nbipartisan work that is crafted in H.R. 6 into a pathetic imitation of \ncooperation.\n  Since the 114th Congress began, the House has taken 37 actions to \nrestrict abortion access. While I don't agree with this paranoid focus \non women's private and legal medical decisions, it is the majority's \nright to set the agenda; but I cannot stand by while these provisions \nare slipped into an otherwise excellent bill through underhanded \nmaneuvers that run contrary to our democratic process. When similar \nprovisions were slipped into a human trafficking bill, we said no. Why \naren't we saying no today?\n  I am a cosponsor of the original version of H.R. 6, but I cannot let \nthe people's House become the people's House of smoke and mirrors.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Roe), the chairman of the House Doctors Caucus.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today someone \nwho, 45 years ago, graduated from medical school. My first pediatric \nrotation was at St. Jude Children's Hospital. At that time, a majority \nof all those children that I saw as a young medical student died of \ntheir disease. Today, almost 90 percent of those children live.\n  Back in the 1950s, we had a polio vaccine. It was developed with the \nhelp of government funding, and today that would be scored as a cost to \nthe taxpayers. Does anyone think the prevention of polio was a cost to \nthe taxpayers? It was one of the greatest miracles of the 20th century.\n  Just 4 short months ago, my wife died of stage 4 colon cancer. And I \nknow right now that everyone in this Chamber who is listening and \neveryone who is outside watching this has had a\n\n[[Page H4981]]\n\nclose family member or a friend or a relative who has experienced \nsomething similar.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time now we as a nation got serious about curing \nthe major diseases, not treating the disease, but curing the major \ndiseases that are affecting this country and affecting us personally. I \nam more passionate about this bill and excited about passing the 21st \nCentury Cures bill than anything I have voted on since I have been in \nthe Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this rule \nand the underlying bill.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor), a member of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts, for yielding the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the rule and in strong support of the \n21st Century Cures bill that was voted unanimously, in a bipartisan \nfashion, out of my Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  America is the world leader in medical research, and we have got to \nwork to keep it that way. That has been at risk lately because of \ncongressional budget battles. The resources that our researchers need \nto find the cures and treatments of the future have been at risk. Our \ncommitment to medical research has eroded over the years, but this 21st \nCentury Cures bill would put us now on a stronger path forward.\n  I have advocated for more NIH research dollars for many years to \nboost our patients back home suffering from the debilitating diseases. \nI have offered amendments in the Budget Committee to shift money from \ndiscretionary to mandatory because it is mandatory in America that we \nrespond and we research the cures of tomorrow, such as precision \nmedicine like they are doing at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, \nFlorida.\n  Now that we have mapped the human genome, we can find and provide \nprecise cures and treatments to our neighbors and family members with \ncancer.\n  I am disappointed that the amount of money has been eroded. I am very \ndisappointed that the Hyde rider was added at the last minute behind \nclosed doors; it was not voted on in committee, but simply stated, this \nbill is too important not to pass it.\n  I would like to thank my colleague Chairman Upton and my good friend \nDiana DeGette from Colorado for leading the charge. We are firmly with \nyou, and we are with the patients and the researchers in America that \nwill benefit from this terrific piece of legislation.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire to the time remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 17 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 11 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds for the purpose \nof the introduction of my next speaker.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is really a great privilege to recognize the next \nspeaker on our side, the chairman emeritus of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee. In fact, the last reauthorization for the National \nInstitutes of Health occurred under Joe Barton's watch, one of the last \nthings we did at the waning hours of the 109th Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, he did provide additional funding to the NIH; he \nprovided an increase of 5 percent a year for the lifetime of that \nreauthorization. Unfortunately, it was never appropriated to that level \nafter the Democrats took charge in the 110th Congress.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton), the \nchairman emeritus of the Energy and Commerce Committee, for his \nobservations.\n  (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Member from Texas for \nthat generous introduction.\n  Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago, I went to then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor \nand committee chairman Fred Upton and asked permission to create a task \nforce, a bipartisan task force--equal numbers of Republicans and \nDemocrats from the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Appropriations \nCommittee--to work with outside groups and experts to see if there were \nnot some ideas that we could put forward in legislation to improve the \nability to find and implement cures for all the various diseases that \nafflict our Nation.\n  Mr. Upton and Mr. Cantor approved that task force. We had a task \nforce of 24 members. We had an outside group that included several \nNobel prize winners, leaders from Johns Hopkins and MD Anderson, former \ndirectors of NIH and FDA. That morphed in the beginning of this \nCongress to a task force that Diana DeGette and Chairman Upton led \nthemselves. That has led to a bipartisan bill that, as has been pointed \nout, came out of committee 51-0.\n  That is an amazingly extraordinarily positive accomplishment to have \ntotal unanimity in support of this type of a bill. We haven't \nreauthorized NIH since 2006, and that lapsed in 2009. This bill does \nthat. We have taken every innovative idea in the medical community that \nmakes any sense at all and put it into this bill.\n  We are increasing the authorization for spending for NIH. We have the \ninnovation fund, which is a mandatory program for 5 years. It puts a \nlittle under $2 billion a year that is offset; it is paid for; it does \ngo away at the end of 5 years, but for 5 years, it is specifically \ngoing to innovation research that is a fast track to find the cures \nthat are most applicable to the marketplace today.\n  This bill is a revolutionary bill. We need to pass it, Mr. Speaker. \nThere are lots of problems. There are things that are not in the bill \nthat I wanted in the bill, but this is a huge step forward. It rarely \nhappens that Congress can work together to do something that is totally \nfor the benefit of the American people. This is one of those times.\n  We need to vote for the rule, and then we need to vote for the bill, \nand we will move forward, united, to find the cures for the 21st \ncentury for all Americans and, really, to some extent, for all the \nworld.\n  I thank the gentleman for the time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am going to urge that we defeat the previous question. If we defeat \nthe previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to allow \nfor consideration of Leader Pelosi's resolution, which basically says \nthat any State flag containing the Confederate battle flag would be \nprohibited from the House wing of the Capitol.\n  Given what the Republicans, our leadership, tried to do on the \nInterior Appropriations bill yesterday, I think this is especially \ntimely. As I mentioned earlier, while South Carolina voted this week to \ntake the Confederate flag down, Republicans in Congress appear ready to \nput it back up.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nLewis), the distinguished ranking member of the Ways and Means \nSubcommittee on Oversight.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend Mr. McGovern for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I must tell you, my heart is heavy. I am saddened by \nwhat has happened here in America. I thought that we have come much \nfarther--much farther--along.\n  Growing up in rural Alabama, attending school in Nashville, \nTennessee, now living in Georgia, I have seen the signs that said White \nand Colored--White men, Colored men, White women, Colored women, White \nwaiting, Colored waiting.\n  During the sixties, during the height of the civil rights movement, \nwe broke those signs down. They are gone. The only place that we will \nsee those signs today will be in a book, in a museum, or on a video. If \na descendant of Jefferson Davis could admit the Confederate battle flag \nis a symbol of hate and division, why can't we do it here? Why can't we \nmove to the 21st century?\n  Racism is a disease. We must free ourselves of the way of hate, the \nway of violence, the way of division. We are not there yet. We have not \nyet created a beloved community where we respect the dignity and the \nworth of every human being.\n  We need to bring down the flag. The scars and stains of racism are \nstill deeply and very embedded in every corner of American society. I \ndon't want to see our little children--whether they are Black, White, \nLatino, Asian American, or Native American--growing up\n\n[[Page H4982]]\n\nand seeing these signs of division, these signs of hate.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. LEWIS. As a Nation and as a people, we can do better. We can lay \ndown this heavy burden. It is too heavy to bear. Hate is too heavy a \nburden to bear. We need to not continue to plant these seeds in the \nminds of our people.\n  When I was marching across that bridge in Selma in 1965, I saw some \nof the law officers and sheriff deputies wearing on their helmet the \nConfederate flag. I don't want to go back, and as a country, we cannot \ngo back.\n  We must go forward and create a community that recognizes all of us \nas human beings, as citizens, for we are one people, one Nation; we all \nlive in the same House, the American House.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nKansas (Mr. Yoder).\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join the chorus of Americans \nwho are calling out for support and research and innovation to cure \ndiseases that affect every family and neighborhood in America.\n  The rule that we have before us would allow us to debate the 21st \nCentury Cures bill forwarded by the Energy and Commerce Committee on a \nunanimous, bipartisan vote.\n  What this bill would do would increase, by over $8 billion, research \nover the next 5 years to be conducted by the National Institutes of \nHealth. Each year, we spend over $700 billion on care for seniors \nthrough Medicare; yet we spend just $30 billion a year, roughly, \nannually, on curing or researching the cures for every disease that \nplagues our country: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cancer, heart disease, \ndiabetes.\n  In all those diseases combined, we spend just $30 billion a year on \nresearch; yet we spend trillions on health care. We know, each year, \n600,000 people will die of cancer. We know, each year in the United \nStates, 700,000 people will die of Alzheimer's. These are real people, \nreal families that are in anguish over these and many other diseases.\n  It is not just a moral issue; it is an economic issue. By 2050, \nestimates are that our country will spend $1.1 trillion annually to \ntreat health care for people with Alzheimer's alone, over $1 trillion \nannually; yet we spend just $562 million a year researching a cure for \nAlzheimer's, a true definition of penny wise and pound foolish.\n  This 21st Century Cures bill increases our commitment to curing \ndisease, as I said, by over $8 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Each of us has a family member or a friend with a tragic story about \none of these diseases. These diseases know no party affiliation; they \ndon't know center of aisle versus the left or right side of the aisle. \nThey know no State; they have no regional boundaries. They don't know \nthe difference between mandatory and discretionary spending.\n  To cure these diseases is a moral imperative for these families, but \nto cure these diseases is also an economic imperative. If we cure one \nof these diseases, our investment will pay for itself a thousand times \nover. The CBO can't score that; the CBO can't make any recognition of \nthat. This is a savings bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BURGESS. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. YODER. I have a 20-month-old daughter, and this isn't just about \ncuring the disease for our generation; it is about curing the disease \nfor her generation and every generation to follow.\n  Supporting the 21st Century Cures bill bends the cost curve on \nentitlements; it saves our country from going into bankruptcy, and it \nhelps us balance our budget. These investments are not just necessary \nfor our moral imperative to save lives, but they are also an economic \nimperative.\n  All those things together means we ought to have a robust, large vote \nin this House to pass this rule and to ensure that the 21st Century \nCures bill goes forward.\n  I strongly support it, and I ask my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the Southern strategy was and is \na Republican strategy of gaining political support for its political \ncandidates by appealing to regional and racial tensions in this country \nbased on the history of slavery, the history of the Civil War, racism, \nand segregation. That is a history that is indefensible, and so is the \nConfederate battle flag which represents those attitudes.\n  I call upon my fellow colleagues in the Republican Party to denounce \nthis Southern strategy once and for all and to do what it takes to \naffirm the tide of this country, which is to do away with that symbol \nof oppression and racial animist, the Confederate battle flag.\n  Let's remove that flag from our national cemeteries, from our Park \nService, places of purchasing memorabilia.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  We do have before us today a unique opportunity. We have an \nopportunity to lay the groundwork for the future. We have the way to \nlead in the 21st century in providing 21st century cures.\n  To be sure, we are providing additional funding to the National \nInstitutes of Health and we are providing additional funding to the \nFood and Drug Administration, but we are also placing requirements upon \nthose institutions.\n  We all know we have to do things faster, better, cheaper, smarter and \nthat we have to do more with less. That is what the 21st Century Cures \nbill lays before us, and that is why this rule is so crucial and \ncritical today and why I urge its passage.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and \nRelated Agencies.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule and the \nunderlying bill.\n  The bill provides for an increase of $1.75 billion per year in the \nbudget for the National Institutes of Health. I applaud all efforts to \nincrease funding for the NIH.\n  I am a survivor of ovarian cancer, and I am alive today because of \nthe grace of God and biomedical research. So I appreciate biomedical \nresearch.\n  Unfortunately, this increase is not nearly enough to restore the \nNIH's lost purchasing power. Since fiscal year 2010, the National \nInstitutes of Health has seen its budget erode by about $3.6 billion in \nreal terms, an 11 percent cut. If we are serious about funding life-\nsaving medical research, we must raise our level of ambition.\n  This bill also sets aside $500 million of the increase to be spent in \ncertain specified areas of research. I think that this is a wrong \napproach.\n  The people best placed to decide which scientific avenues are worth \npursuing are scientists, not politicians. We should not substitute our \njudgment for theirs.\n  I am also concerned that the bill will lower standards for medical \ndevice approval at the Food and Drug Administration and create a new \npathway for antibiotic approval that, in my view, involves less \nrigorous testing requirements. Again, I think that this is a wrong \napproach.\n  It is our duty to protect the public from potentially unsafe devices \nand drugs. We do not do that by reducing standards.\n  Finally, the majority is yet again using this bill as a vehicle for \nanti-choice Hyde amendment language. Since January, the majority and \nits counterpart in the other Chamber have sought to restrict access to \nabortion no fewer than 37 times.\n  The bottom line on this issue is that we need to trust women and that \nwe need to trust the choices they make. We have to trust women. \nPoliticians have no business meddling in those decisions.\n  For these reasons, I believe that we should reject this bill, and I \nurge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I would point out that once again reauthorization of the National \nInstitutes of Health occurred in this Congress in the waning days of \nthe 109th Congress in December of 2006.\n\n[[Page H4983]]\n\n  Mr. Barton reauthorized the NIH at a $31 million base to increase by \n5 percent per year. We were told at the time that that was not enough \nand, with biomedical inflation at 8.8 percent a year, that it was, in \nfact, a cut.\n  Mr. Speaker, in fact, what happened was then, of course, the \nDemocrats took control of the House and the Senate the following year, \nand they never appropriated the NIH to that 5 percent figure.\n  Now, this is not about Republicans and Democrats. This is about \nfinding cures for the 21st century. The gentlewoman is correct in that \nwe do direct some of the research dollars within the NIH.\n  You will recall, when the stimulus bill passed in 2009, $10 billion \nwent into the NIH right then to be spent that year.\n  We ended up filling up and filing paperwork from leftover projects, \nbut we got very few deliverables out of that. This directs that \nresearch into high-risk, high-reward areas. We need the deliverables \nfrom the NIH.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nColorado (Ms. DeGette), the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce \nSubcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give my thanks to Fred \nUpton for recruiting me to help cosponsor this bill with him, and I \ngive my thanks to all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \nworking together on finding cures from the lab into the clinics for so \nmany diseases that we don't have any treatments for right now. This \nreally is an extraordinary effort that we have made, and it really is \nCongress at its best.\n  I do want to mention that I was disappointed when, after the bill \npassed in the Energy and Commerce Committee 51-0, that in the manager's \namendment the annual riders from the Labor-HHS bill were put into the \nbill. I think it is unnecessary, and I think that it distracts our \nattention from the important mission this bill brings.\n  I will be voting for the Lee amendment, but I would urge all of our \ncolleagues, no matter how you vote on the amendments that are made in \norder in these rules, to please vote ``yes'' for the patients of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  This past weekend, in an op-ed piece that was published online, Mr. \nJames Pinkerton wrote:\n\n       As Abraham Lincoln said a century and a half ago, the \n     Federal Government should only be doing things that people \n     can't do for themselves.\n\n  Medical cures are a great example of something people can't do for \nthemselves at home. That is what we are about this afternoon, providing \nthe rule to allow for the consideration for the cure of the 21st \ncentury.\n  It is an important rule, and the underlying bill is important. I urge \nall Members to support both the rule and the underlying bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman from the great State of \nMassachusetts for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is an emotional time for many of us. This is an \nimportant bill. But we have just gone through an emotional time on this \nfloor, again, raising up the ugliness of the rebel flag.\n  I stand again to try and educate both the public and our colleagues \nabout the damage that this flag has done to so many, for under that \nflag many were killed in the name of slavery.\n  Interestingly, this is the 150th year of the elimination of slavery. \nI think about health care, and I spoke last evening about lupus, sickle \ncell anemia, and triple-negative breast cancer all falling \ndiscriminantly on minority populations. In life, there are still issues \nthat face you because you are different.\n\n  I call upon this House to recognize that, although we have many \nissues to debate, when you pierce the heart of someone because you \nbelieve he is inferior or different--when you want to coddle and \nprotect the rebel flag--I hope we will get to the point between now and \nnext week, as I introduce H. Res. 342 as a privileged resolution to ban \nall signs of hate, that we will rise to be unified together and stand \nunder the American flag.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Womack). The gentleman from Texas has \n8\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Massachusetts has 2 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I ask of the gentleman from \nMassachusetts if he has additional speakers?\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Just I.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Veasey).\n  Mr. BURGESS. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nVeasey).\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to speak about the importance \nof our acting now to do the right thing in regard to the Confederate \nflag.\n  Many of you may not know, but this year marks 100 years of the \nviewing and the premiere of the film that really sparked the re-\nemergence of the Confederate flag, ``The Birth of a Nation.'' We know \nthat film was bigger than ``Star Wars'' and ``Jaws'' and any major \nblockbuster motion picture.\n  That is what ``The Birth of a Nation'' was. It revived the \nConfederate flag. It made the Confederate flag the symbol of hate that \nit is today. It actually helped the re-emergence of the second Ku Klux \nKlan in this country. We know that that is what the Confederate flag \nultimately stands for.\n  It doesn't have anything to do with the Civil War and with the \nbattle, like Mr. Clyburn had pointed out earlier, because that was a \ncompletely different flag. It has to do with segregation and keeping us \nin the past.\n  We need to be able to move past it, Mr. Speaker. I would ask that my \nRepublican colleagues do the right thing and join us in moving forward \nand in letting the past be the past.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Upton), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee \nand the author of the Cures legislation.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, as we all know, we launched this bipartisan \neffort about a year and a half ago, and with tomorrow's House vote, we \nmark a very important milestone in our quest for 21st century cures, \none step closer to the finish line.\n  There have been so many individuals throughout our 18-month journey \nwho have helped us get to where we are today: patients across the \ncountry, advocates, researchers, innovators, experts, academics, \nregulators, some of the Nation's brightest minds, even Nobel Prize \nwinners. To all, we say thank you.\n  Thank you, too, to the hard-working staff, again, on both sides of \nthe aisle, who took the meetings, who did the research, who drafted the \nlanguage, and who sat at the negotiating table for countless hours to \nhelp us develop this incredible product: Gary, Joan, Alexa, Clay, Paul, \nJosh, Robert, John, Carly, Katie, Adrianna, Graham, Sean, Noelle, \nMacey, Mark, Tom, Bits, Marty, Tim, Jeff, and Tiffany.\n  And to the Democratic staff, the staff of our Members, thank you all.\n  Thanks to the House legislative counsel and the CBO for your efforts \nand dedication in working through many, many weekends.\n  Thank you to the Members of both parties, who really did bring their \nbest ideas, who partnered with one another to make their cases, and who \ndelivered so many of the policies that we welcome today because we \nlistened.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Hal Rogers and his staff. The \nAppropriations Committee has been a critical partner in this effort for \nthe last number of months, working with us and developing the right \napproach to achieve our shared goal of helping patients in a fiscally \nresponsible way.\n  I especially want to highlight my partner, Diana DeGette, in her \neffort from day one. She came to my district in Michigan, and I have \ntraveled to Colorado. We have been on a number of road trips for Cures \nacross the country, and I look forward to the next journey down \nPennsylvania Avenue.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Pitts, Mr. Pallone, and Mr. Green for \ntheir really strong partnership. We have made great strides, but our \nwork continues, and we are not going to stop until the ink is dry.\n\n[[Page H4984]]\n\n  I thank Chairman Pete Sessions, Dr. Burgess, and members of the Rules \nCommittee for making sure that this legislation has gotten to the floor \nin a timely fashion.\n  I also want to give a hearty thanks to a young boy named Max, the 6-\nyear-old ambassador for Cures. Yes, although he is faced with the \nchallenges of Noonan syndrome, he has been a little warrior in that \neffort.\n  He joined us when we had a 51-0 vote back on May 21 in the committee, \nand I am delighted that Max will be by our side tomorrow on the House \nfloor for its final passage.\n  Helping Max and others like him is why we are here, and helping my \nfriends Brooke and Brielle, which will be part of my general debate \ndiscussion, is why we are here.\n  With a resounding vote tomorrow, we will send a signal to the Senate \nloud and clear that the time for Cures 2015 is now.\n  I look forward to working with my Senate counterparts on both sides \nof the aisle to continue the momentum of getting this bill to the \nPresident's desk. We have a chance to do something big, and this is our \ntime.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  Mr. Speaker, the 21st Century Cures bill is a good bill. I want to \nthank Mr. Upton and Ms. DeGette for working in a bipartisan way to come \nup with this product. It invests in NIH. It invests in lifesaving \nmedical research. It makes it more possible that we will find cures to \ndiseases like cancers and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, diabetes, HIV, \nand so many other terrible diseases that afflict so many of our fellow \ncitizens.\n  This is important stuff. Who knows, maybe we will even find a cure to \nthe disease that resulted in so many in this House voting for the \ndestructive sequestration initiative that, by the way, cut medical \nresearch and put off the day of some of these lifesaving cures. We need \nto do better than this, but this is an important start, an important \nstep in the right direction, and I hope that my colleagues in a \nbipartisan way will support it.\n  Secondly, as I mentioned before, I want to urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the previous question.\n  I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment I would \noffer in the Record if we defeat the previous question, Mr. Speaker.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. If we defeat the previous question, we will bring up \nagain the Pelosi resolution that my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle chose not to debate. The reason why this is important, the reason \nwhy we should do this is very simple: because it is the right thing to \ndo. Every once in awhile we ought to come together in this Chamber and \ndo the right thing. The Confederate flag is a symbol of hate; it is a \nsymbol of division; it is a symbol of so many things that we all abhor. \nThe time has come to follow some of the other States in this country \nand here in Congress do something the American people can be proud of.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the previous question. \nVote ``no'' on the rule because it is restrictive.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a momentous bill that will be before us today. \nThis is analogous to the time back in the 1970s when the National \nCancer Institute was authorized by Congress in the Nixon \nadministration. This is an opportunity to take that leap forward and \nperhaps deliver some of those cures that so many of our constituents \nhave waited for for so long.\n  Mr. Speaker, we all value institutions and institutional knowledge \nand institutional learning, but, Mr. Speaker, we also acknowledge that \nthere are times when we have got to be disruptive. There are times that \nyou have to forget the past and move into the future, and this is one \nof those times. We are all familiar with the fact that, yeah, the \nneighborhood bookstore may be gone, but we can order stuff online from \nAmazon.\n  Disruptive technology is as important in medicine as it is anywhere \nelse. This bill is paid for. This bill is offset. It sunsets in 5 \nyears' time. But, as I was reminded by my colleague, the gentleman from \nMaryland, Dr. Andy Harris, a few days ago, while this bill is offset, \nwhile we are paying as we go for the increases for the National \nInstitutes of Health and the FDA, what if--what if--one of those \nmoonshots succeeds?\n  In May of 2012, Glen Campbell came and played a concert at the \nLibrary of Congress. This is him and his daughter Ashley. They were on \nthe stage. Glen Campbell went public with the knowledge that he has \nAlzheimer's disease. He struggled at several points during that \nconcert. It was, in fact, amazing to watch him play his instrument. At \ntimes he couldn't remember the words to the song, and Ashley would help \nhim.\n  This is a shot where they did ``Dueling Banjos''--very, very \naccomplished and skilled instrumental work that they both did on their \ninstruments that they were playing. What if? What if we were to deliver \nthat moonshot and provide that cure that would have prevented Glen \nCampbell from falling into the recesses of Alzheimer's illness? What if \nthat cure were within our grasp? What is worse is what if that cure is \non a shelf or in a test tube somewhere and we just haven't quite gotten \naround to its evaluation? This is important stuff.\n  Glen Campbell narrated the soundtrack of my life as I was growing up, \nfrom Delight, Arkansas, a gentleman of our generation who was so \nimportant to so many of us as we were growing up, and he shared with us \nthere on the stage his story and his daughter's story. You can see his \ndaughter Ashley looking at her dad. If we could preserve her ability to \nsmile at her dad for a little longer, wouldn't that be worth some of \nthe fighting that we do here?\n  This bill is offset. This bill is paid for.\n  Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for consideration of this critical \nbill, a bill that will transform and advance the discovery, \ndevelopment, and delivery of treatments and cures.\n  I applaud all Members who have worked on this thoughtful piece of \nlegislation, along with Energy and Commerce staff on both sides of the \naisle. All members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce were asked \nto bring their ideas to the table, and we worked to include as many as \nwe possibly could.\n  I want to express my sincere thanks to all the great attorneys at the \nLegislative Counsel who worked around the clock to deliver us the \nlegislative language. I want to thank Chairman Upton, Representative \nDeGette, as well as Chairman Pitts and Ranking Members Pallone and \nGreen for their leadership throughout.\n  I want to thank all of the staff who have worked so hard over the \npast year; really, literally, all hands were on deck. There is not one \nstaffer of the Subcommittee on Health of the Committee on Energy and \nCommerce that does not have their fingerprints all over this bill. I \ncertainly want to thank J.P. Paluskiewicz, Danielle Steele, and Lauren \nFleming from my office, who have put in that additional effort to help \ndeliver this product.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is an important piece of legislation in front of us \ntoday. We do, unfortunately, have a lot of distractions, but let us not \nbe distracted from providing the tools for the next generation of \ndoctors, a generation that will have more ability to alleviate human \nsuffering than any generation of doctors has ever known because of our \nactions here on the floor of the House today.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:\n\n  An Amendment to H. Res. 350 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, it \n     shall be in order to consider in the House the resolution (H. \n     Res. 355) raising a question of the privileges of the House \n     if called up by Representative Pelosi of California or her \n     designee. All points of order against the resolution and \n     against its consideration are waived. The previous question \n     shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble \n     to adoption without intervening motion except one hour of \n     debate equally divided and controlled by the proponent and \n     the Majority Leader or his designee.\n       Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H. Res. 355.\n     \n                                *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n[[Page H4985]]\n\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nthat all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and \nextend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill, H.R. \n2647.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 347 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2647.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Holding) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1524\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 2647) to expedite under the National Environmental Policy Act and \nimprove forest management activities in units of the National Forest \nSystem derived from the public domain, on public lands under the \njurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management, and on tribal lands to \nreturn resilience to overgrown, fire-prone forested lands, and for \nother purposes, with Mr. Holding in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  General debate shall not exceed 1 hour equally divided among and \ncontrolled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on \nAgriculture and the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee \non Natural Resources.\n  The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Peterson), the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop), and the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas) each will control 15 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support and as an original \ncosponsor of H.R. 2647, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015.\n  Since the inception of the National Forest System in 1905, the \nfundamental mission of the Forest Service has been to manage our \nFederal forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future \ngenerations. As a result, the Forest Service has played a critical role \nin rural America, partnering to produce timber, natural resources, and \njobs, while sustaining the ecological health of the forests and \nsurrounding watersheds.\n  National forests have been extremely successful in creating \nrecreational and educational opportunities for millions of Americans. \nHowever, our forests are facing declining health and simply are not \nmanaged as well as they need to be due to numerous challenges that have \ngrown over the past few decades.\n  Often unnecessary and prolonged planning processes limit the Service \nfrom effectively managing our forests. This also goes along with the \nconstant litigation, or even the threat of litigation in some cases. \nBoth of these situations keep boots in the office instead of in the \nforests and spend money on doing paperwork instead of work in the \nfield.\n  The costs of suppressing and fighting wildfires has been a growing \nchallenge for the Forest Service, with their fire costs increasing from \n13 percent of the Forest Service budget in 1995 to approximately half \nof the annual budget today. This epidemic of declining health and \ncatastrophic wildfires are in direct correlation to policies that have \nled to a dramatic decrease in managed acres. Timber harvests have \ndrastically plummeted from almost 13 billion board feet in the late \n1980s to only 3 billion board feet of timber in recent years. At the \nsame time, the number of acres affected by the catastrophic wildfires \nhas doubled from around 3 million acres during the second record timber \nharvest to 6 million acres now.\n  This bill reverses this cycle by ending the destructive fire \nborrowing problem that robs Peter to pay Paul, and it does so in a \nfiscally responsible manner, with the funds only made available for \nwildfire suppression. In my view, this legislation is the next step to \nbuild upon the groundwork laid by the 2014 farm bill and is an earnest \nattempt to give the Forest Service more authority and much-needed \nflexibility to deal with these challenges of process, funding, \nlitigation, necessary timber harvesting, and much-needed management.\n  H.R. 2647 incentivizes and rewards collaborations with the private \nsector on management activities. It allows for State and third-party \nfunding of projects. The bill reauthorizes the resource advisory \ncommittees, known as RACs, while returning county shares of forest \nreceipts for long-term stewardship projects.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the bill provides commonsense categorical \nexclusions, or CEs, for certain Forest\n\n[[Page H4986]]\n\nService projects. These CEs are routine and have known impacts and will \nexpedite the planning process to get projects up and running.\n  To conclude, this is a thoughtful piece of legislation that will do \nmuch to help the Forest Service to better do its job. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 2647, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of \n2015. This is a bipartisan piece of legislation that will address some \nof the burdensome regulations that have arisen from legal challenges \nand help get our forests actively managed the way we need.\n  For some time now we have been concerned about efforts undertaken by \nextreme environmental groups to twist laws to their liking. The so-\ncalled sue and settle strategy has led to policy changes decided by \nactivists and bureaucrats. These policy changes often ignore \ncongressional intent and fail to take into account constituent input \nand real facts on the ground. Additionally, this means a less \ntransparent and less accountable regulatory process. H.R. 2647 will \nsimplify forest management activities, thereby reducing some of this \nbad behavior.\n  The bill also includes an important budgetary fix to help address the \nrising cost of wildfires. Just this year, the wildfires have burned \nhundreds of thousands of acres and caused millions of dollars of \ndamage.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  H.R. 2647 will allow access for our land management agencies to the \nresources they need to fight wildfires without having to rob their \nother accounts. The current practice of fire borrowing leads to taking \naway resources from productively managing our forests to keep them \nhealthy and less prone to fire. This bill would end this practice and \nensure that agencies have access to the needed resources to fight \nwildfire disasters all year.\n  Again, this is much-needed, bipartisan legislation that addresses \nmany of the issues currently impacting forest management. I urge my \ncolleagues to support H.R. 2647, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham).\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague from Arkansas \n(Mr. Westerman) for introducing this bill and recognize the hard work \ndone by the Agriculture and Natural Resources Committees to bring this \nimportant bill to the floor.\n  For too long, failure to properly manage our national forests had led \nto increased tree mortality from wildfires, droughts, insects, and \ndisease. The Resilient Federal Forests Act gives the Forest Service and \nthe Bureau of Land Management the tools needed to reverse this trend.\n  This bill will allow critical forest health projects to move forward \nby streamlining regulations, will give parishes and counties greater \nflexibility in how they use forestry revenues, and will ensure Federal \nagencies have increased access to fund in order to fight and prevent \nwildfires.\n  These reforms will put more Americans to work through increased \nmanagement activities and timber production. It will give money back to \nour local community for infrastructure and education and will make our \nforested communities safer by reducing their vulnerability to \nwildfires.\n  In my home State of Louisiana, the Kisatchie National Forest covers \n604,000 acres, with 382,500 of those acres in my district alone. In \nall, forestry and the forest products industries accounts for well over \n18,000 jobs and over $1 billion of income in my district.\n  The people of Louisiana know how valuable well-managed forests are to \nthe health of our State and our economy. I would imagine forested \ncommunities throughout the country know this as well.\n  It is time we start being proactive instead of reactive when it comes \nto managing our national forests. The Resilient Federal Forests Act \nwill put us back on track to realize the full potential of our forest \nresources.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. PETERSON. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 \nminutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek), a member of the \nConservation and Forestry Subcommittee.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2647, the \nResilient Federal Forests Act of 2015.\n  I represent northern Michigan, which has over 20 million acres of \nFederal, State, and private forest land. Our forests are a vital part \nof the economy in northern Michigan that generate over $16.3 billion \nper year and creates more than 77,000 jobs. In addition to forestry, \nthe outdoor recreation industry also contributes $18 billion to \nMichigan's economy and over 190,000 jobs to our State.\n  Healthy forests are vital to our way of life in northern Michigan. \nLike most in my district, I grew up exploring these forests, hunting, \nfishing, snowmobiling. It is a way of life for so many, not only for \nthose who live up north, but for the millions who visit the forests \nevery year from all around the country.\n  Sadly, many of our Federal forests are in a state of disrepair these \ndays; they are overgrown, and especially in the Western United States, \nthey are consumed by wildfire.\n  The Forest Service, which is entrusted with managing 10 percent of \nthe continental United States land base, has identified approximately \n58 million acres as being at high risk for catastrophic fire. Even \nworse, by conservative estimates, over 56 billion board feet of timber \nhave simply burned away in wildfires on Forest Service lands over the \nlast 10 years.\n  Over the past 10 years, over a billion dollars of timber rotted on \nthe stump instead of being sold. Those revenues aren't available to the \nU.S. Treasury. The Forest Service couldn't use the funds to buy \nseedlings to replant our devastated national forests. We are literally \nallowing jobs for American families to burn away in our poorly managed \nFederal lands. Nothing about the current process is working.\n  H.R. 2647 takes some very simple steps to allow our forests to become \nhealthier and better managed for the future. This bill would streamline \ntimber harvesting on Federal forests in existing land use plans, while \nreducing the threat of frivolous lawsuits related to forest management.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Womack). The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. In addition, this legislation would allow States and \nFederal forests to react faster to catastrophic wildfire events, \nthereby reducing the future risk to public lands.\n  Finally, this legislation includes a number of collaborative \nprocesses for tribal, State, and private contracting, which will lead \nto healthier and better managed forests.\n  I understand that many of my friends here today may live in areas \nwith a few forests or low risk of wildfire. I ask all my colleagues \nhere today, especially those not in heavily forested areas, to listen \nto your friends from forested districts.\n  Support this bipartisan, commonsense legislation and help improve the \nhealth of our forests.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Committee will rise informally.\n  The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee) assumed the chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4986-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4986-H4987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate insists upon its amendment to the bill (H.R. 1735) ``An \nAct to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military \nactivities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and \nfor defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \nmilitary personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \npurposes,'' agrees to a conference requested by the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon, and appoints the following \nMembers to be the conferees on the part of the Senate: Mr. McCain, Mr. \nInhofe, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Wicker, Ms. Ayotte, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Cotton, \nMr. Rounds, Mr. Graham, Mr. Reed (RI), Mr. Nelson, Mr. Manchin, Mrs. \nGillibrand, Mr. Donnelly, Ms. Hirono, and Mr. Kaine.\n\n[[Page H4987]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).\n  Mr. YOHO. I want to thank the chairmen--Mr. Conaway, Mr. Thompson, \nand Mr. Bishop--for their leadership on this issue.\n  I stand here today in support of creating more jobs and improving the \nhealth of our Nation's forests through sustainable forest management.\n  H.R. 2647, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015, is a bipartisan \nbill that will address the growing economic and environmental threats \nto the catastrophic wildfires. This piece of legislation is hugely \nimportant for my district and the entire southeastern region of the \nUnited States.\n  Florida is home to a multitude of national forests, including the \nApalachicola, Osceola, and Ocala, which span more than 1.2 million \nacres in north central Florida. These forests supply over 10,000 acres \nper year for timber production, creating jobs, lumber products, pellet \nmills for green energy, and paper products.\n  This land also allows for recreational activities like equestrian and \nmotorcycle trails and hunting and fishing. In addition, they produce \nroughly 600 billion gallons of fresh water, and that is all in my home \nState.\n  Due to a lack of proper forest management, the risk of catastrophic \nwildfires has increased dramatically. These emergencies draw critical \nfunding away from the Bureau of Land Management accounts intended to \nprevent wildfires, thus creating a chronic problem that is only getting \nworse.\n  This bills ends that inefficiency by allowing FEMA to transfer funds \nto the Forest Service when these disasters occur, ensuring activities \nlike prescribed burns and other management techniques are adequately \nfunded.\n  This bill improves management practices, helps prevent wildfires, and \nshould be supported by every Member in this Chamber.\n  Again, I commend Chairmen Conaway, Thompson, and Bishop.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta), chairman of the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Economic Development, \nPublic Buildings, and Emergency Management.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Chairman, first, let me thank the chairmen of the \nNatural Resources and Agriculture Committees for working with our \ncommittee on title IX of the bill.\n  Title IX authorizes the President to declare a major disaster for \nwildfires on Federal lands and provide assistance to the Departments of \nthe Interior and Agriculture for extraordinary wildfire suppression \ncosts in excess of the 10-year average. These provisions protect FEMA's \nDisaster Relief Fund and preserve FEMA's wildfire assistance that is \ncurrently available to State, local, and tribal governments through the \nStafford Act.\n  Because this provision was not included in the reported bill, a \nlegislative history document has been developed to articulate the \ncongressional intent for title IX, as well as how it is expected to be \nimplemented.\n  Mr. Chairman, I will insert this legislative history document into \nthe Record.\n\n(Chairman Bill Shuster, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n                             July 9, 2015)\n\n   H.R. 2647: Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015, Title IX--Major \n                 Disaster for Wildfire on Federal Land\n\n\n                          legislative history\n\n       Definition of ``Major Disaster'': By bifurcating the \n     definition of ``Major Disaster'' in the Stafford Act, the \n     Committee preserves the existing definition, and the programs \n     that flow therefrom, and adds an additional definition for \n     ``Major Disaster for Wildfire on Federal Land,'' for which a \n     separate and distinct declaration, process and assistance \n     have been established pursuant to the new Title VIII of the \n     Stafford Act. ``Major Disaster for Wildfire on Federal Land'' \n     meets the definition ``disaster relief'' pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(D) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985.\n       Request for Declaration of a Major Disaster for Wildfire on \n     Federal Land: There are four distinct requirements that must \n     be met before the President may issue a declaration for a \n     major disaster for wildfire on federal land.\n       (1) Each request must be made in writing by the Secretary \n     making the request on behalf of that Department.\n       (2) The requesting Secretary must certify that in that \n     current fiscal year, the Department's wildfire suppression \n     operations account received no less than an amount equal to \n     the 10-year average. This amount cannot include any carry \n     over from previous years and must include any rescissions or \n     reductions. Also, future 10-year averages must take into \n     account the total amount expended on wildfire suppression, \n     including appropriations and assistance provided under Title \n     VIII of the Stafford Act.\n       (3) The requesting Secretary must certify that all funds \n     available for wildfire suppression operations will be \n     obligated within 30 days and there are wildfires on federal \n     lands continuing to burn that will require firefighting \n     beyond the resources currently available.\n       (4) The requesting Secretary must request a specific amount \n     which is the estimate of funds needed to address the current \n     wildfires on federal lands.\n       The Committee does not intend for the respective Secretary \n     to have to make a request for each fire they anticipate will \n     exceed the wildfire suppression operations appropriations. As \n     the definition for ``Major Disaster for Wildfire on Federal \n     Lands'' includes ``wildfire or wildfires'', it is intended \n     that the respective Secretary's request will include all \n     known fires that will require extraordinary resources beyond \n     those remaining in the wildfire suppression operations \n     account of that specific federal land management agency. Each \n     Secretary will make a request for the resources required by \n     that particular department.\n       Assistance Available for a Major Disaster for Wildfire on \n     Federal Land: The only assistance available for a declaration \n     of a major disaster for wildfife on federal land is the \n     transfer of available funds from a new account established \n     for these purposes to the requesting Secretary in the amount \n     requested.\n       The Committee intends for the funds appropriated into the \n     new account established by the President for major disaster \n     for wildfire on federal land assistance will be designated by \n     Congress as being for disaster relief pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(D) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985.\n       The declaration and assistance available for a major \n     disaster for wildfire on federal lands are based on the \n     existing major disaster declaration process delegated by the \n     President to be administered by the FEMA Administrator. The \n     Committee expects the process for a major disaster for \n     wildfire on federal land will be managed in a similar manner \n     through a delegation of the President's authority to the FEMA \n     Administrator. Further, the Committee expects that the \n     account established by the President for a major disaster for \n     wildfire on federal land will be a dedicated sub-account of \n     FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. However, pursuant to the \n     legislative language, none of these funds can be comingled or \n     transferred between these accounts.\n       Once assistance is transferred to the Department of the \n     Interior or the Department of Agriculture, it is not required \n     that the assistance be used only for those wildfires \n     identified in the request. The assistance may be used for \n     wildfires that begin after the declaration or were not \n     identified in the request. Funds transferred may be used for \n     all wildfire suppression operations eligible activities. The \n     Committee anticipates these will be no year funds, available \n     until exhausted.\n       It is entirely foreseeable that a wildfire that begins on \n     or severely impacts federal lands requiring assistance under \n     Title VIII of the Stafford Act could continue to grow, \n     impacting state, local, tribal governments and certain non-\n     profit properties and infrastructure. The provision of \n     assistance under Title VIII of the Stafford Act in no way \n     impacts the ability of state, local and tribal governments \n     and certain non-profits to apply for assistance under FEMA's \n     other disaster programs, if eligible, including the Fire \n     Management Assistance Grant Program, an emergency \n     declaration, or a traditional major disaster declaration.\n       Prohibition on Transfers: No longer can the Department of \n     the Interior and the Department of Agriculture borrow from \n     non-fire suppression accounts to fund the extraordinary needs \n     of wildfire suppression operations.\n\n\n                           section-by-section\n\n       Section 901. Wildfire on Federal Lands: This section \n     defines a major disaster for wildfire on federal lands.\n       Section 902. Declaration of a Major Disaster for Wildfire \n     on Federal Lands: This section establishes the procedure for \n     requesting a declaration of a major disaster for wildfire on \n     federal lands and provides for assistance.\n       Section 903. Prohibition on Transfers: This section \n     prohibits the transfer of funds between wildfire suppression \n     accounts and other accounts not used to cover the cost of \n     wildfire suppression operations.\n\n  Mr. BARLETTA. After watching the floodwaters of Hurricane Irene and\n\n[[Page H4988]]\n\nTropical Storm Lee destroy the homes and upset the lives of my \nconstituents, my first priority has been to protect the programs that \ncome to their aid, namely the disaster relief fund.\n  This is a program that helps families get back into their homes, \nbusinesses reopen their doors, and local municipalities clear the \nstreets so that our communities can recover when the next big storm \nstrikes.\n  I have seen the disaster relief fund provide assistance when it is \nneeded most. Our constituents rely on Federal disaster assistance. It \nshould not be jeopardized under any circumstances.\n  Again, let me thank Chairman Bishop and Chairman Conaway for working \nwith the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, can I inquire as to how \nmuch time remains?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) has \n3 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) has 13 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan).\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of \nthis legislation, and I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for \nyielding me this time.\n  This bill, Mr. Chairman, will streamline the Forest Service planning, \nallowing for more forest thinning, reducing wildfire damage, and \ncreating much stronger Federal forests. More national forest thinning \nmeans fewer forest fires.\n  I served for 22 years on the Natural Resources Committee. Several \nyears ago, I was told that there were 6 billion board feet of dead and \ndying trees in the national forests; yet we were cutting less than 3 \nbillion board feet a year. This was leading to a tremendous buildup of \nfuel on the floor of these forests, leading to millions more acres \nbeing burned because we weren't cutting enough trees.\n  In the late eighties, we were harvesting 10 to 11 billion board feet \na year. We had 3 to 6 million acres lost to forest fires each year at \nthat time. Now, we are harvesting a little over 1 billion board feet a \nyear, and the acreage lost to forest fires has gone way up: 10 million \nacres lost in 2006, 9 million in 2011, and on and on and on. It is a \nshame.\n  Allowing this renewable resource to be used, everything made with \nwood--houses, all types of wood products, everything else made from \nwood--would be cheaper. This would help lower-income people most of \nall.\n  If we allow more trees to be cut, thousands of jobs could be created \nnot just for loggers, but also in construction and in businesses making \nwood products. This also would help lower-income people most of all.\n  We shouldn't just let these forests burn. We should use them to help \npeople. If you want more forest fires, vote against this bill, but if \nyou want to help preserve our national forests and make them healthier \nand help the economy in the process, then you should vote for this \nbill.\n  This is a very moderate response to what has become a big and fast \ngrowing problem. We should not give in to extremists and oppose this \nbill. This is good legislation, and I commend Chairman Peterson, \nChairman Conaway, and Chairman Thompson for bringing this very \nintelligent, sensible legislation to the floor.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Schrader).\n  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to clear up some \nmisconceptions about H.R. 2467 and take a little time to tell you what \nthis bill really is and what it is not.\n  Contrary to a statement put out by the President and some of my \ncolleagues on my side of the aisle, this is not a complete abrogation \nof environmental protections or NEPA process on our Federal lands.\n  This is a streamlined process for a very, very small portion of \nFederal forest land subject to catastrophic natural disasters and \nalready subject to expensive collaborative, resource advisory \ncommittee, or wildfire protection plans--a very narrow subset of our \nFederal forests.\n  For the folks back East, I would like to remind them that, out West, \nforest land occupies a great chunk of our States.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Over half of my State of Oregon is Federal forestland. Most of that \nis managed by the Forest Service or the BLM.\n  Three-fourths of my State is distinctly rural, little access to this \npostrecession recovery. Frankly, indeed, these guys were in a recovery \nfor the last 20, 30 years, when timber harvesting came to a screaming \nhalt under our so-called forest plans. Their recovery, their \nprosperity, is irrevocably entwined with smarter, healthier forest \npolicy that promotes resiliency, which this bill does, and \nsustainability, which this bill does.\n  This bill is narrowly crafted to build upon the growing trust, \nhopefully, between old environmental and timber adversaries by showing \nwhat can be done with good forest policy in a collaborative framework \non our Federal forestlands.\n  Currently, dead, diseased, wildfire-subjected Federal forestland \ncontributes millions of tons of carbon annually to our atmosphere. \nRotting trees are carbon polluters. Burning forests are carbon \npolluters.\n  Our forests need to be cleaned up and made healthy again. If you care \nat all about climate change or the health of our Federal forests or, \nhopefully, the health of rural communities around America, you should \nbe for this narrowly crafted bill to collaboratively build a \nsustainable forest policy.\n  I would like to reiterate that this bill only pertains to a narrow \nset of projects and lands, including areas affected by or likely to be \naffected by these natural disasters.\n  This only deals with lands subject to collaborative processes or \nunder these federally sanctioned resource advisory committees already \nin place or covered by community wildfire protection plans. In other \nwords, these are areas that already have had extensive proactive \nmanagement discussions on these lands with community partners across \nthe environmental and timber resource spectrum. This is exactly where a \nstreamlined NEPA process should be placed.\n  Contrary to information you have received, this is not eliminating \nenvironmental impact statements. It does permit a small exclusion of \n5,000 to 15,000 acres for a narrow type of project.\n  The Forest Service is currently spending hundreds of millions of \ndollars on NEPA compliance, the single biggest factor in limiting the \namount of work the agency can get done on the ground.\n  It also has an innovative approach to restoring forests after a \nwildfire. No permanent roads are allowed to be built, current stream \nbuffers stay in place unless the regional forester has a compelling \nreason to change them, and reforestation is required with an eye to \ncreating more successional habitat, something our environmental \ncommunity has wanted for a long time.\n  You can't accelerate the process here. Where are you going to do it? \nDidn't we accelerate the process a little after Sandy or Katrina?\n  You know, some of our colleagues, some of my citizens, several of my \nconstituents out west are feeling that there is a lack of fairness in \nour disaster policy.\n  It is common practice for radical groups to file a litany of alleged \ngrievances on any forest project that is suggested, mostly just to drag \nout the process and delay good forest policy they disagree with, at \ngreat taxpayer expense. Most of these claims are purely procedural.\n  We must reform this legal gotcha game by forcing these groups to \nfocus on legitimate, substantive claims of impropriety that they feel \nthey can win on. That is fair, and that is what this bonding proposal \nactually does.\n  Folks, for people in rural Oregon and rural America, they are being \nleft behind. The timber economy was the major economy for these \nforested regions for decades. They are not seeing large companies, \nhigh-tech manufacturing moving into their remote areas. These are \ncommunities that have depended on our renewable natural resources for \ntheir livelihood.\n  Our forests are a catastrophe waiting to happen. They are much less \ndiverse\n\n[[Page H4989]]\n\nthan they used to be. This drought is about the worst it has been out \nwest in a long, long time. Our forests are tinderboxes waiting to burst \naflame.\n  Let's begin to work collaboratively. Give local communities the tools \nthey need and have to deal with and prevent these catastrophes, \nfrankly, learn how to work together again to build healthier forests \nand healthier rural communities.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I don't believe I have any additional \nspeakers. I could yield time to the gentleman from Pennsylvania if he \nwishes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. I have some additional speakers. That \nwould be appreciated.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to yield the balance \nof my time to the gentleman from Pennsylvania to finish out.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Minnesota \nyields the balance of his time, which is 8 minutes, to the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania to control.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. I thank the ranking member for his \ngenerosity and his leadership on the important issue of agriculture, \nand certainly on this bill as well.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. \nByrne).\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your work on this critical \nlegislation.\n  The Resilient Federal Forest Act is key if the Forest Service is to \nhave the flexibility it needs to actively manage our Nation's Federal \ntimberland.\n  Now, I come from a State where forestry is critically important to \nour economy and our ecosystem. In fact, forestry is a $13 billion \nindustry in Alabama. Thankfully, my State does not have a serious issue \nwith wildfires due to our active forest management. That said, it does \nnot mean that my area isn't impacted by the wildfire crisis.\n  The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management are forced to \nspend so much money fighting wildfires that they have to take money \naway from other nonfire accounts that, ironically, help prevent \nwildfires, like thinning and controlled burns.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, this bill just makes sense. By simplifying the \nenvironmental process requirements and reducing burdensome regulations \nthat hinder active forest management on Federal timberland, we can help \nreduce wildfires and protect our Nation's forests.\n  So I want to thank the gentleman from Arkansas and others for their \nwork on this bill and the continued leadership on behalf of our \nNation's foresters.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues in this House to support this \nlegislation, and I call on the Senate to act on this bill right away.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Oregon, (Mr. Walden), an Eagle Scout.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the members of the \ncommittee on both sides, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, for \ntheir great work on this legislation. This is really, really important.\n  My colleague from Oregon (Mr. Schrader) spoke eloquently about what \nour State faces and our rural communities face, and that is why this \nResilient Federal Forests Act is so important to beginning to be a game \nchanger, to getting us back into active management of our Federal \nforestlands, to reducing the threat of wildfire, the cost of wildfire, \nthe destruction of wildfire, and the incredible pollution from \nwildfire.\n  As we speak here today on the House floor, brave firefighters are \nstill trying to contain the Corner Creek fire, which has already burned \nnearly 29,000 acres of forestland near Dayville, Oregon, in my \ndistrict--29,000 acres already burned. And unfortunately, this fire \nseason in the West has only just begun.\n  Among the many strong provisions in this bill are streamlining \nplanning, reducing frivolous lawsuits, and speeding up the pace of \nforest management. Several in particular are helpful to our great State \nof Oregon.\n  For national forests in eastern Oregon, this legislation repeals the \nprohibition on harvesting trees over 21 inches in diameter. Now, there \nis no real ecological reason for this. It was a temporary measure put \nin place 20-some years ago, nearly. It remains today. It didn't make \nsense then, it doesn't make sense now, and it will be repealed.\n  This flawed one-size-fits-all rule illustrates, I think, just how \nbroken the Federal forest management has become. So it greatly limits \nthe flexibility forest managers have to do what is right for the health \nand ecosystem of the forests to make them more resilient, more fire \ntolerant.\n  This bill also includes legislation I wrote with my colleagues from \nOregon, Representatives DeFazio and Kurt Schrader, pertaining to \nOregon's unique O Lands. It will cut costs, increase timber harvests \nand revenue to local counties.\n  The BLM is also directed to revise their flawed management plan \nproposals to consider the clear statutory mandate to manage these lands \nfor sustainable timber production and revenue to the counties.\n  Finally, one look at the fires around the West makes clear that the \nstatus quo simply is not working for our forests, for our communities, \nor for the environment. We need to do better. This Resilient Federal \nForests Act will do that. It will bring better and healthier forests \nand healthier communities.\n  I thank the committee for taking up this good piece of legislation \nand encourage my colleagues to approve it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Montana (Mr. Zinke).\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, as a fifth generation Montanan, I grew up in \ntimber country. Our mills and train yards were in full swing, and \nvisitors from around the world flocked to see Glacier Park. Revenues \nfrom the timber industry were reinvested in the community, and \nconservation efforts of the Forest Service helped our timber harvest.\n  Building a strong tourist economy and a strong timber economy are not \nmutually exclusive. That is why I support--strongly support--the \nResilient Federal Forests Act of 2015. It does what it should do. It \nencourages local organizations to work together on collaborative \nprojects that revitalize the economy. But not only that, it revitalizes \nour forests.\n  Think about it. As we debate this bill today, there are two wildfires \nin my home State of Montana, just a few miles from where I grew up. And \nas of today, more than 3.9 million acres across our Nation have burned \nin wildfires this year alone. That is larger than the entire State of \nConnecticut.\n  We are on track for more than double, if conditions don't improve. \nJust last week, the Forest Service, whom I visited, said we are in the \nperfect storm. In the words of the former Chief of the Forest Service, \nChief Bosworth, we don't have a fire problem as much as we have a land \nmanagement problem. That is why this bill is so important.\n  Last week, when traveling across my district, I toured the site of \nthe Glacier Rim fire. This fire is burning the same ground that burned \nin 2003. I was told by people on the ground that the reason why this \nfire is burning is the Forest Service was not able to conduct a salvage \noperation for fear of lawsuits, among other reasons, and those lawsuits \nleft standing timber which cannot be addressed by crews, which only can \nbe addressed by helicopters, and that is a $1 million project. And \nhabitat, it is a member, a part of the core grizzly habitat. It has not \nburned once; it has burned twice in 15 years.\n  So we need more scientists in the woods and less lawyers, and I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in a bipartisan effort to support this bill.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Nevada (Mr. Amodei).\n  Mr. AMODEI. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleagues from \nPennsylvania and Utah and their committee work on this.\n  Management reduces catastrophic wildfire. In the high desert \nrangelands of Nevada, as well as the conifer forests of such mountain \nranges as the Sierra Nevadas around Lake Tahoe, the Ruby Mountains \naround Elko, or the Toiyabes around Austin, Nevada, we have a 100-year \nresource there. Once it burns, it is 100 years before it comes back by \nthe time you take into account those moisture regimens and everything \naffiliated with that. And then\n\n[[Page H4990]]\n\nwhen you have years-long processes after it burns to get permission \njust to go after that, this is great legislation.\n  I want to thank my colleague from the Razorback State for his work on \nit and the other folks that have helped him.\n  One of the reasons that this is so important to our State is, in the \nlast 20 years, just on BLM land, we have burned between 6 and 7 million \nacres. And guess what. We are dealing with a thing called the sage-\ngrouse listing, where they talk about loss and fragmentation of \nhabitat. It is nobody's fault, mostly lightning-caused fires 40 miles \nfrom the end of the nearest dirt road--6 or 7 million acres to \ncatastrophic wildland fire.\n  More management, more restoration, thinning of fuels, and also the \nability to recognize that the funding for this is something that needs \nto be a FEMA-related thing rather than just through the normal budget \nprocess are all great ideas.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their help. On behalf of the people \nof the Silver State, thank you very much.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank all my \ncolleagues, Ranking Member Peterson, who all spoke on this very \nimportant bill.\n  H.R. 2647 is a commonsense, bipartisan solution to start fixing a \nbroken system.\n  Right now, miles of red tape and constant litigation, usually from \ngroups that refuse to come to the table, are preventing our forests \nfrom receiving the active management they desperately need. This leads \nto more catastrophic wildfires and more money diverted from other \npriorities to fight fires.\n  This legislation will aid in reversing this cycle. It gives the \nagencies more flexibility to manage our Federal lands, which protects \nwildlife habitat and surrounding watersheds, spurs growth in the rural \neconomy, and saves time and saves money.\n  I want to thank Mr. Westerman for his leadership on this, Chairman \nConaway, Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Peterson.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Hultgren). The gentleman from Utah is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity of \nbeing here, talking about this significant bill that is going to \nincrease and improve our status quo.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), to \nbegin our portion of this debate, who is the chief sponsor of this \nparticular bill, who has a personal background, actually, having earned \na degree in forestry even from the State of Arkansas.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2647, \nthe Resilient Federal Forests Act. This bipartisan legislation will \ngive the Forest Service tools it needs to better manage our national \nforests.\n  As a professional forester, I see that our forests are in decline and \nlack resiliency.\n  President Teddy Roosevelt, who worked alongside a fellow Yale \nforester, Gifford Pinchot, to create the U.S. Forest Service, are the \ntwo I would credit as the fathers of our national forest.\n  Roosevelt said, ``The Nation behaves well if it treats the natural \nresources as assets which it must turn over to the next generation \nincreased and not impaired in value.''\n  We have problems with our current forest policy that is leaving one \nof our most treasured natural resources less resilient, decreased, and \nimpaired in value.\n  It is not only our forests that suffer. Without forests that are \nhealthy, we have poor water quality, poor air quality, less wildlife \nhabitat, less biodiversity. My bill aims to fix these problems, and it \naims to fix them through proactive and sound management.\n  First, our forests are living and dynamic, but we have a problem of \ndelayed decisionmaking or, even worse, no decisionmaking at all. This \nbill incentivizes collaboration and speeds up the implementation of \ncollaborative projects while safeguarding strong and timely \nenvironmental reviews.\n  We have a problem of not salvaging timber destroyed in catastrophic \nevents, which makes the forest more dangerous, increases future \nwildfire problems, and makes it difficult for reforestation. This bill \nsets up requirements for salvage and reforestation. The Forest Service \nwould have to implement greater reforestation in response to \ncatastrophic events.\n  Typically, less than 3 percent of an area is reforested after a \ncatastrophic event. This is unacceptable. My bill requires 75 percent \nreforestation within 5 years.\n  We have a problem in our rural communities that not only depend on \nour forests for their sustenance, but also provide emergency services, \neducation, and support for the forests and residents who live near the \nforest.\n  As our forests are decreased and impaired in value, our forest \ncommunities immediately suffer and suffer even more in the future.\n  My bill gives counties flexibility in spending Secure Rural Schools \nfunding and puts 25 percent of stewardship contracts into the county \ntreasury for our schools and other public services.\n  There are other policy problems this legislation solves, but none are \nmore important than problems caused by having to spend too much of our \nForest Service budget for reactive fire suppression rather than on \nproactive sound management and fire prevention.\n  This bill ends the destructive practice of fire borrowing in a \nfiscally responsible manner. It creates a subaccount under the Stafford \nAct specifically for fighting wildfire.\n  I would like to thank Chairmen Bishop, Conaway, and Shuster for their \nassistance with this critical bipartisan bill. Our national forests \ndesperately need scientific management to become resilient again.\n  In the words of Roosevelt, I call on us to behave well, to treat our \nforest resources as assets that we will turn over to the next \ngeneration increased and not impaired in value.\n  I look forward to advancing this bill today and call on the Senate to \nact promptly to ease the burdens of the summer fire season.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Our national forests are a public good that are tasked to provide \nmultiple benefits to the American people. These include clean water, \nclean air, wildlife habitat, open space, as well as robust recreation \nand timber economies that provide jobs and partner with Federal land \nmanagers to improve forest health.\n  Everyone agrees that we must increase the pace of restoration work to \nlimit the impacts of catastrophic wildfires and to improve the long-\nterm health of our forests.\n  H.R. 2647 does contain some new thinking and potentially useful \nconcepts that, if done right, could help the Forest Service achieve its \nlong-term goal of healthy, sustainable forests.\n  For example, the bill provides incentives for collaboration, which \nhas been identified as a priority by witnesses from both sides of the \naisle.\n  It also proposes some creative ways to finance forest restoration \nprojects developed through collaboration.\n  H.R. 2647 also offers a potential solution to the devastating impact \nof fire borrowing, the practice of transferring funds away from forest \nrestoration projects for use in fighting wildfires.\n  Throughout the debate over forest policy and this particular bill, \nDemocrats, including myself, have urged the majority to deal with how \nwe pay for the largest and most catastrophic wildfires, which represent \nonly 1 percent of wildfires, but consume 30 percent of the entire \nagency's firefighting budget.\n  I am glad that the majority acknowledges the urgent need to address \nthe fact that over 50 percent of the Forest Service budget goes to \nfighting wildfires, squeezing out funds needed for all other critical \nForest Service programs, most especially those that focus on forest \nhealth.\n  However, these helpful provisions do not offset the many serious \nconcerns that I still have with this legislation, which was developed \nwithout any input from Natural Resources Committee Democrats.\n  In fact, when the Federal Lands Subcommittee held its hearing, the \nbill was still in draft form. This process even left the Forest Service \nwithout\n\n[[Page H4991]]\n\nthe opportunity to provide adequate or meaningful testimony.\n  Instead of working together on a bipartisan basis to improve the \nhealth of our national forests, about which we all care, this bill \nirresponsibly chips away at the environmental safeguards of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act and places tremendous burdens on \nAmerican citizens seeking to participate in the public review process \nof Forest Service projects.\n  For example, H.R. 2647 would ``categorically exclude'' or exempt a \nwide range of timber and restoration projects from critical \nenvironmental analysis and public review. This means that thousands of \nacres of sensitive ecosystems would be much more vulnerable to \ndegradation and damage.\n  The changes to the judicial review process raise serious \nconstitutional concerns, eroding some of the bedrock principles of the \nAmerican legal system that protect the basic rights of citizens to \nparticipate in the Federal decisionmaking process and to hold their \ngovernment accountable.\n\n  If this legislation were to become law, a citizen challenging a \nFederal decision would be required to post a bond equal to the \ngovernment's cost, expenses, and attorneys' fees.\n  If plaintiffs lose, the government is paid out of that bond. But if \nplaintiffs win--and by win, I mean a court has to rule in favor of \nplaintiffs on all causes of action--plaintiffs simply have their bond \nreturned and are precluded from getting an award of attorneys' fees.\n  As our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee can attest, this \nprovision flies directly in the face of American legal precedent.\n  Public lands, including our national forests, belong to all \nAmericans. They are a public good. Bedrock environmental laws, like the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, makes sure that the public voice is \nheard and that critical habitats are protected not only for species \nthat rely on our national forests and grasslands, but also for American \ncitizens who depend on these lands for their drinking water and \neconomic livelihoods or simply to enjoy their treasured beauty.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this legislation, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. DeFazio).\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, I have been working on forest policy for my entire tenure \nin Congress. I have some of the most productive and fabulous forest \nlands in the entire Federal system, both Forest Service and BLM lands, \nunder a unique O management.\n  But here we are again headed into a very, very potentially bad fire \nseason, June record heat, no precipitation. We had very little snowpack \nlast winter, and the heavy fuels are already as dry as they get.\n  We have seen this before. The fires will break out. BLM and Forest \nService can't stop fighting the fires. So they will borrow from other \naccounts, including fuel reduction to protect forest values and \ncommunities, forest health, and a myriad of other programs.\n  This happens year after year after year. It is time to end that, and \nthis bill takes that first step in ending that practice of fire \nborrowing.\n  And that is of tremendous benefit to the resource agencies, the \nresources themselves, and our preparedness and capability of fighting \nfires. That alone gives this bill tremendous merit.\n  It deals with some other longstanding issues in Oregon. We adopted \nsomething called temporary eastside screens back in 1993, I believe, \nsaying you couldn't cut any tree over 21 inches in diameter.\n  It makes no biological sense, and it makes no sense to the premier \nforest scientists in the world, Jerry Franklin and Norm Johnson.\n  You have nonnative fir trees that are growing there, because of \nrepression of fire for the last 100 years, that are 100 years old. They \nare over 21 inches.\n  But they are growing in stands of ponderosas that are 200 years old, \nand they are going to kill the ponderosa stands, the native trees.\n  But the Forest Service can't go in and deal with that issue. With \nthis legislation they finally can.\n  On our unique O lands, there is a provision of the Northwest Forest \nPlan called Survey and Manage, literally crawling around on the forest \nfloor, looking for slugs, snails, calling for owls, and doing all these \nthings 3 years in a row.\n  This, again, is not necessary, according to the premier scientists, \nand is incredibly expensive and time-consuming on the part of the \nBureau of Land Management.\n  In fact, the Bureau of Land Management's new plans--each plan, no \nmatter what the output level, would do away with that practice. So this \nbill does away with that practice, saving the BLM resources and moving \nahead with better management.\n  There are a number of other issues that relate to these O lands. I \nwant to thank Chairman Bishop and Chairman McClintock for working with \nmyself, Mr. Schrader, and Mr. Walden in order to address these issues, \nextending the comment period, developing new management options.\n  BLM is refusing, despite the Oregon Delegation's bipartisan request \nto extend the comment period on these critical management plans. So \nthat itself is also great merit.\n  There are provisions in the bill that I don't like and don't support.\n  We will be given an opportunity with the Polis amendment to deal with \nthe bonding issue and the cost recovery issue, which I don't think \nbelongs in this bill.\n  I have concerns about the magnitude of the CEs for fire recovery and \nsalvage. But, on balance, the other parts of this bill are important to \nthe point where the bill should receive support from people that care \nabout the future of our forests.\n  Mr. Chair, I have been working on forestry issues for a long time--\nnearly 30 years. I represent a district with some of the most \nproductive public timberlands in the entire world. I also represent a \ndistrict that cares deeply--passionately--about the environment and our \nincredible national forests.\n  For 30 years I have been trying to find a middle ground on national \nforest policy--a balanced approach. I believe that having a healthy \ntimber industry, good paying jobs in rural communities, and permanent \nprotection for our nation's most iconic resources--like old growth \ntrees and pristine rivers--are not and should not be mutually \nexclusive.\n  Do I think the bill before the House today is a perfect bill? \nAbsolutely not. But when you are working on a contentious, complex, and \noften emotional issue like national forest policy--there is no such \nthing as a ``perfect bill.''\n  The truth is our national forests are burning up at an alarming rate. \nThey are dying from disease and bugs. Our land management agencies \ndon't have the financial resources or tools to deal with existing \nthreats let alone emerging threats, like climate change. The Federal \nGovernment spends billions of dollars every year to fight fires on \npublic lands, rather than investing those dollars in forest health and \nresiliency to reduce wildfire risks.\n  Our rural and forested communities continue to suffer from double \ndigit unemployment. Even the mills that have retrofitted to process \nsmall diameter logs are struggling to make it. And rural counties \ndependent on timber receipts are failing to keep violent criminals in \njail, sheriff deputies on our roads, and kids and teachers in the \nclassroom.\n  So, again, no. I don't think this is a perfect bill. But, Congress \nneeds to do something to change the status quo for our forests and \nrural communities. We need to have this conversation and work together \nto find middle ground.\n\n\n                            wildfire funding\n\n  And there are some good provisions in this bill. One of the most \nimportant provisions attempts to end ``fire borrowing''--a top priority \nof mine when I was Ranking Member of the Natural Resources Committee \nand a remaining priority of mine as Ranking Member of the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee that has jurisdiction over \nFEMA.\n  Right now, when federal land managers exhaust congressionally \nappropriated dollars to fight fires, the agencies have to borrow money \nfrom other accounts. Often times those accounts fund the very \nactivities--like thinning overstocked plantations, reducing hazardous \nfuels, or completing work in the Wildland Urban Interface--that can \nactually help reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires! That's a \nterrible way to do business.\n  Catastrophic wildfires should be treated like other natural disasters \nand we should stop robbing Peter to pay Paul. The wildfire funding \nlanguage in this bill--while not perfect--moves us in the right \ndirection.\n\n\n                            eastside screens\n\n  This bill also includes provisions that will improve forest \nmanagement in the Pacific Northwest. The bill would remove the \nunscientific\n\n[[Page H4992]]\n\nand arbitrary ``Eastside Screens'' that prohibit the Forest Service \nfrom cutting any tree in Eastern Oregon and Eastern Washington that is \nlarger than 21 inches in diameter.\n  Supporters of the Eastside Screens forget that the 21 inch rule was \nintended to provide interim protection for larger, older trees until \nscientifically based standards for old growth were established. Well, \nguess what? After more than two decades those standards have still not \nbeen established, handcuffing the Forest Service from carrying out \ncommon sense forest projects.\n  Today, even if there is a non-native, 22-inch diameter Douglas fir \ntree that is outcompeting and putting at risk a native, 200 year-old \nstand of ponderosa pine, you can't cut that fir. That would violate the \nEastside Screens.\n  That doesn't make any sense. Yes, we need protection for old growth \nforests and I was the first to pass permanent, legislative protection \nfor old growth in Western Oregon out of the House last year. But, those \nprotections should be scientific and implementable.\n\n\n                               O lands\n\n  The same goes for standards established more than 20 years ago, known \nas Survey and Manage, that literally has land management personnel on \ntheir hands and knees on the forest floor looking for liverworts, \nfungi, slugs, snails, mosses, and 300 other types of flora and fauna \nbefore any forest activity can take place. I am all for robust analysis \nand considering the impacts of human activity on rare and special \nspecies. But we also need to be responsible stewards of taxpayer \ndollars and aware of the consequences of over-analysis, lengthy delays, \nand not taking action.\n  The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) agrees with me. That's why all of \nthe Resource Management Plan alternatives for Western Oregon would \neliminate Survey and Manage.\n  Unfortunately, the BLM still has some work to do on the Resource \nManagement Plans for the statutorily unique O Lands. Despite requests \nfrom most of the Oregon Congressional Delegation to extend the public \ncomment period to analyze thousands of pages of documentation for the \nalternatives, the BLM decided not to award an extension.\n  I want to thank Chairman Bishop and Chairman McClintock for working \nwith me, Rep. Walden, and Rep. Schrader to include language that would \ndirect the BLM to consider additional alternatives for the O Lands-- \nranging from a sustained yield alternative to a carbon storage \nalternative--and to extend the public comment period by 180 days. These \nResource Management Plans will govern management on the O Lands for \nyears to come--perhaps decades--and we must get them right. Taking time \nto analyze new alternatives and giving the public more time to review \nand comment is absolutely crucial.\n\n  I also want to thank the respective Chairmen for incorporating the \nPublic Domain lands within the O land base. These lands in Western \nOregon are already managed in the same manner. Reclassifying the Public \nDomain lands as O Lands will improve management efficiency, provide \nclarity to the BLM, and create additional revenues for the O \nCounties.\n  But, as I mentioned, this bill isn't perfect. In fact, it includes a \nnumber of troubling provisions that should be completely eliminated or \nsubstantially modified before being signed into law.\n\n\n                         Provisions of Concern\n\n  For example, the bill would allow categorical exclusions (CEs) for \nsalvage logging projects up to 5,000 acres in size. That's 20 times \nlarger than the current 250-acre size limitation for salvage logging \nCEs adopted by the Bush Administration. Unfortunately, the Committee \nadopted an amendment during markup that eliminated key restrictions on \nthe construction of temporary roads within the salvage project area. \nThese provisions are a non-starter.\n  The bill allows CEs for projects intended to create early \nsuccessional habitat. I worked with the pre-eminent scientists in the \nworld on pilot projects in Oregon with similar management goals. But \nfor these projects to work and for there to be social buy-in, there \nneed to be strong sideboards for such projects, like green tree \nretention requirements and old growth protection.\n  Language has been added that could exempt the application of \nherbicides from a full environmental impact statement when used to \n``improve, remove, or reduce the risk of wildfire.'' I understand the \nForest Service uses herbicides in limited circumstances to address \nnoxious weeds and other threats through manual application. But such \napplication should remain extremely limited, publicly transparent, and \nrestricted to manual application instead of aerial application. There \nshould be no ambiguity in this language and its intent, nor should it \nexpand herbicide application on public lands.\n  This bill would make it harder for a person with a legitimate \ngrievance against a federal land management agency to sue by requiring \nthat person to post a bond covering the anticipated costs, expenses, \nand attorneys' fees of the government to defend the lawsuit. I \nunderstand you want to limit frivolous lawsuits or lawsuits from \nparties that don't meaningfully engage in the public process. But this \nisn't the way to do it. I will be voting for an amendment later today \nto strike the entire section.\n  Mr. Chair, this bill has some important, balanced provisions. It also \nhas some controversial, unnecessary provisions. We know that this bill, \nin its current form, will not be signed by the president. But I want to \nkeep this conversation moving forward and I want to work with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, House and Senate, to do \nsomething meaningful for our rural communities and national forests. I \nwill support this bill today with the understanding that this \nlegislation still needs work, significant improvement, and further \ncompromise.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock), the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Federal Lands, who has helped shepherd this bill \nthrough the committee process.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, excess timber comes out of the forest one way or \nanother. It is either carried out or its burned out, but it comes out.\n  Years ago, when we carried it out, we had healthy forests and a \nthriving economy. We managed our national forests according to well-\nestablished and time-tested forest management practices that prevented \nvegetation and wildlife from overgrowing the ability of the land to \nsupport it.\n  Revenues from the sale of excess timber provided for prosperous local \neconomies and a steady stream of revenues to the Treasury which could, \nin turn, be used to further improve the public lands.\n  But 40 years ago, in the name of saving the environment, we consigned \nour national forests to a policy of benign neglect. And the results are \nall around us today, not only the impoverished mountain communities, \nbut an utterly devastated environment.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Our forests are now dangerously overgrown. Trees that once had room \nto grow and thrive now fight for their lives in competition with other \ntrees from the same ground. In this distressed condition, they fall \nvictim to pestilence, disease, and catastrophic wildfire. My goodness, \nwe can't even salvage dead timber anymore.\n  This legislation is the first step back towards sound, scientific \nmanagement of our national forests. It streamlines fire and disease \nprevention programs. It expedites restoration of fire-damaged lands. It \nprotects forest managers from frivolous lawsuits, and it does so \nwithout requiring new regulations, rules, planning, or mapping.\n  Mr. Chairman, the management of our public lands is the \nresponsibility of Congress. The bromides of the environmental left have \nproven disastrous to the health of our forests, the preservation of our \nwildlife, and the welfare of our mountain communities.\n  This bill begins to reverse that damage and to usher in a new era of \nhealthy and resilient forests and an economic renaissance for our \nmountain towns.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. I yield 4 minutes to my colleague from Arizona (Mr. \nGrijalva).\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2647, the \nso-called Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015.\n  Before I address the many concerns with the underlying bill, I must \ncommend my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. They have finally \ntaken a step toward addressing the 600-pound gorilla, that is, the \nenormous cost and impact of fire borrowing under the Forest Service \nbudget.\n  I offered an amendment at a committee markup that would have required \nCongress to address the issue of fire borrowing before this bill could \ntake effect, and we have been calling on House Republicans to address \nthe issue for years. My amendment was rejected, but I am glad it \nencouraged the sponsors of this legislation to address the cost of \nwildfires.\n  The newly added title IX is not a perfect solution, however. By \namending the Stafford Act to include wildfires under the definition of \nnatural disasters, this section creates a mechanism to address the very \ndisastrous practice of fire borrowing.\n  There is a small hitch, nevertheless. Congress would still have to \nfund this\n\n[[Page H4993]]\n\nnew disaster relief fund, similar to the process for funding recovery \nfrom Superstorm Sandy, which did not go smoothly, to say the least. \nWhile this might be a positive step, it does not make H.R. 2647 a good \nbill.\n  With regard to title IX, the additional disaster relief fund, \nhopefully the majority will not rob Peter to pay Paul within the Forest \nbudget in order to fund this disaster relief fund or leave title IX \njust as an empty hollow and useless gesture that never gets funded.\n  In the name of forest resiliency and health, H.R. 2647 undermines the \nNEPA process, discourages collaboration, distorts the intent of the \nSecure Rural Schools program, creates an extraordinary burden on \ncitizens' access to the courts, and transforms the judicial review \nprocess.\n  This bill, quite frankly, is not about forest health. It is about \nincreasing the numbers of trees removed from the forest.\n  The White House just communicated its strenuous opposition to H.R. \n2647, and let me quote from that communication:\n\n       The administration strongly opposes H.R. 2647. The most \n     important step Congress can take to increase the pace and \n     scale of forest restoration and management of our national \n     forests and the Department of the Interior lands is to fix \n     the fire suppression funding and provide additional capacity \n     for the Forest Service and Department of the Interior to \n     manage the Nation's forests and other public lands. H.R. 2647 \n     falls short of fixing the fire budget problem and contains \n     other provisions that will undermine collaborative forest \n     restoration, environmental safeguards, and public \n     participation across the National Forest System and public \n     lands.\n\n  Categorical inclusions that are part of title I are not the product \nof thoughtful consideration of the legislation. Instead, they pave the \nway for up to 8 square miles of clear cuts of old-growth trees with \nlittle or no environmental review.\n  Title II reduces to 3 months the time for environmental assessments \nand environmental impact statements for reforestation or salvage \noperations following a large-scale fire. The Forest Service testified \nthat this time limit is unrealistic, encouraging snap judgments that \ncan have horrible long-term consequences.\n  Title III strips away access to the courts that other speakers will \nspeak to as well. You know, think about the group that would dominate \nthe collaborative decisionmaking without any judicial review.\n  The bill also eliminates the Equal Access to Justice Act for \nsuccessful litigants and forces them to do a prebond, a one-sided bond \nrequirement to limit, if not eliminate, citizen activism and public \nparticipation in a problem that they can help solve rather looking at \nthis as a threat.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the legislation.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now \nrise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nThompson of Pennsylvania) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hultgren, \nActing Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the \nUnion, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the \nbill (H.R. 2647) to expedite under the National Environmental Policy \nAct and improve forest management activities in units of the National \nForest System derived from the public domain, on public lands under the \njurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management, and on tribal lands to \nreturn resilience to overgrown, fire-prone forested lands, and for \nother purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H4993-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT ON H.R. 2995, FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016\n\n  Mr. CRENSHAW, from the Committee on Appropriations, submitted a \nprivileged report (Rept.

When the Committee of the Whole rose earlier today, \n12\\1/2\\ minutes remained in general debate.\n  The gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) has 9 minutes remaining, and the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas) has 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Tipton), a former member of our committee, but \nsomeone whose district clearly knows the significance and impact of \nforestlands and how they should be maintained.\n  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, the challenge that we face in the West is \nvery obvious. Overgrown forests, bark beetle devastation, threat to our \nwatersheds, threat to habitat, threat to public property that sensible \npeople have long called for a solution to be able to have rendered.\n  I would like to be able to applaud the hard work of Chairman Bishop, \nthe committee, and particularly the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. \nWesterman) in putting commonsense pieces of legislation forward in H.R. \n2647, the Resilient Federal Forests Act.\n  The concept of being proactive rather than being reactive, putting \nthe health of our forests, protection of our watersheds, habitat for \nwildlife, and saving private property while bringing some control back \nto our States and our communities is long overdue.\n  Forward-looking and innovative legislation like the Resilient Federal \nForests Act speaks to the very heart of responsible forest management. \nThis is a piece of legislation, which is long overdue. We have seen the \nimpact in pilot projects of healthy forests, the opportunity to be able \nto get the forests again in a healthy state, creating abundant ground \ncover and forage for our animals and protecting those watersheds.\n  This is a commonsense piece of legislation that I would like to \nencourage my colleagues to be able to support.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to my colleague from Georgia (Mr. \nJohnson).\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, impartial justice and access to \nthe courts is a right guaranteed to every citizen in this country.\n  Across the street from this Chamber, Lady Justice sits blindfolded on \nthe steps of the Supreme Court so we can all be reminded that justice \nshould be blind. Today, we are debating yet another Republican bill \nrestricting access to the courts to only those with deep pockets.\n  H.R. 2647 continues the alarming trend of Republican-sponsored \nlegislation that proposes to limit the average American's access to the \ncourts so polluters that line the pockets of politicians with campaign \ncontributions can continue to profit.\n  H.R. 2647 requires that a citizen post a bond prior to challenging \nthe United States Government's forest management activities. This bond \nmust cover all the defendant's anticipated cost, expenses, and \nattorney's fees to be paid if the defendant prevails. In the rare \noccasion plaintiffs are successful, they will only be able to recover \nthe amount posted in the bond and only if they win exactly on all \ncounts. The government, however, does not have to cover any of the \nplaintiff's costs.\n\n[[Page H4994]]\n\n  Requiring the posting of a bond that could be as costly as tens of \nthousands of dollars undermines citizen access to the courts when a \nparty believes the government failed to follow the law.\n  The individual consumer, nonprofit organizations, small business, or \npublic interest groups do not have the financial ability to challenge \nlarge corporations or, more often, the Federal Government which \ncitizens believe is harming their communities or environment. By \nallowing citizens to recover their reasonable legal fees when they file \nsuit and win in court, you encourage Americans to participate in public \ndiscourse and to hold the government accountable.\n  Rollbacks to judicial review and imposition of attorney's fees upon \nplaintiffs, along with legislative interference with key judicial \npowers contemplated in H.R. 2647, cripple the ability of those \nconcerned with environmental protection to seek representation and \nredress in the courts.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. May I inquire as to how much time I have left?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Massachusetts has 1\\1/4\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chair, I want to close by reiterating that, instead \nof working together on a bipartisan basis to improve the health of our \nnational forests, this bill irresponsibly chips away at the \nenvironmental safeguards of the National Environmental Policy Act and \nplaces tremendous burdens, as we have just heard, on American citizens \nseeking to participate in the public review process of Forest Service \nprograms.\n  I am glad that the majority acknowledges the urgent need to address \nfire borrowing, but we still have concerns with this proposal and it in \nno way offsets the many other serious problems with this legislation \ndeveloped without any input from committee Democrats or meaningful \ntestimony from the Forest Service.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to present this bill. I also thank all \nthe many people who have worked from three different committees on \nthis: Chairman Shuster of the Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee, Chairman Conaway of the Agriculture Committee, as well as \nthose who work on the Natural Resources Committee. I am very grateful \nfor the Democrats, Mr. Schrader and Mr. DeFazio, who have spoken here \nalready in defense of this bill, and for their help and assistance in \nthis.\n  As the former Chief of the Forest Service said, we don't have a fire \nproblem in our Nation's forests. We have a land management problem, and \nit needs to be addressed quickly. That is exactly what the Westerman \nbill does. It addresses that problem. The status quo, flat out, is not \nworking.\n  The Forest Service has recommended or recognized that we have at \nleast 58 million acres that are in dire need of assistance right now \nbut can easily be burned in this next fire season.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  That is bigger than my home State of Utah, which is still the 11th \nlargest State in the Nation.\n  If you add the higher-end estimates, then you add more acreage into \nthat, which means you would add the State of Utah and Michigan. One-\nthird of the entire forests we have are in danger of being destroyed if \nwe do not do something immediately.\n  The Forest Service right now can only address the problem in 3 \nmillion acres; 58 is the minimum. That simply means it would take them \nover 20 years to address the problem. That is more than my lifetime is \nleft here to try and solve this problem.\n  I realize that I was probably born at a greater distance from the \napocalypse than most of the people here; but at the same time, in my \nlifetime, you can't solve the problem if we keep on with the status \nquo. That is why this bill is essential, and that is why I appreciate \nall the speakers who have gone on today saying why this is the perfect \nfirst step.\n  What is so good about it is, as soon as the President signs this \nthing, the Forest Service can immediately implement everything. These \nare practices and processes that they have at their disposal. They are \nready to move forward with it. All we have to do is give them the tools \nto immediately do that.\n  Now, we realize some of the issues that are there. Funding is a \nsignificant issue. Funding alone will not solve our problem, but we \nhave addressed that; and I appreciate, once again, Chairman Shuster and \nsubcommittee Chairman Barletta, who have come up with--from the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee--come up with a good \nfunding mechanism so that we can address that issue and move us \nforward.\n  That, by itself, does not solve our problems. We have a land \nmanagement issue at the same time. We have a problem with litigation, \nwhich basically stops the efforts of the Forest Service to do their job \nin their tracks.\n  As soon as they become sued, they have to stop moving forward on \ntheir program; they have to spend money to defend themselves in a \nlawsuit, or they have to try and go through efforts to try and cover \nthemselves so they don't get sued in the first place. It does not work.\n  We have heard a lot of comments about the inability of being able to \nsue, as a poor private citizen doesn't have the right to sue if we pass \nour bill. That is ridiculous.\n  This only deals with areas that have been collaboratively worked on--\nthat means where citizens actually got together and came up with a plan \nof action on their forest and, as they move forward to that, some \nspecial interests groups with a whole lot of deep pockets on their side \nstops them in their tracks by a lawsuit.\n  Those are the kinds of groups that are going to have to put up the \nbond. Those are the kind of groups who can no longer say: We are going \nto sue you on 25 different issues. We realize only three of them are \ngoing to be realistic, but we want you to take the time and effort to \nspend your Federal moneys to try and defend all those 25.\n  What we are saying is: Look, if you are going to sue on something, \nsue on something that is realistic. Don't put the entire world on \nthere, and make sure that you are willing to cede on those particular \nissues, in those particular areas.\n  We also have in title I in there that simply says: You can still sue, \nbut you can't get an injunction to stop our work while we go through \nfrivolous lawsuit after frivolous lawsuit.\n  In the last two administrations, not counting this one, but two prior \nadministrations, we have over 11,000 lawsuits that took place simply to \nstop the Forest Service from going forward. That has to be addressed. \nIt has to be addressed. The Forest Service recognizes that, and that is \nwhy former Forest Service employees--as well as the current ones--\nrealize, if we don't have some kind of litigation reform, we will not \nsolve our problems with forest health.\n  We also have to give them the tools so they can move quickly on what \nthey need to do. Categorical exclusion is not something that is evil; \nit is actually something that is essential to move forward. They \nrecognize that they need that tool. That is why I said, as soon as this \nbill is signed by the President, they can implement what they already \nknow to do.\n  What we are asking them is to do an environmental review, but you \ndon't have to do review after review after review. If you have done the \nreview the first time, it is sufficient, and they have the wisdom and \nthe ability to do that. Will that destroy our forests? Heavens, no.\n  What this will do is have the potential of actually saving our \nforests, being able to allow the Federal forest land to be as \nresilient, to be as well managed as the State and tribal forest lands \nare because, in State and tribal forest lands, they don't have to deal \nwith a lot of the issues that stop them from actually solving their \nproblems, but we do on the Federal forest system, unless we move \nforward.\n  That is why I appreciate all those who have spoken so far on the need \nof moving forward on this particular bill. We are in the beginning of a \nfire season that could be catastrophic. We have witnessed the results \nof wildfires in the past. We need to do something now, and we have to \nmove forward.\n\n[[Page H4995]]\n\n  This is a bill that is common sense. It was wonderful to have our \nhearings, listening to the group of people who are experts in this \narea, being excited about the opportunity of having the tools the \nForest Service needs to do their job, having the funding the Forest \nService needs to do their job, and also have the protection from \nfrivolous lawsuits the Forest Service needs to do their job. We must \ngive our Forest Service personnel the tools they need to be successful.\n  If we don't pass this bill because we want something perfect from on \nhigh to come down--first, if we don't pass this bill, we are going to \nhave a devastating situation coming in our forest lands and in our \nNation this coming year.\n  This is an essential step forward. Is it perfect? No. There is a \nwhole lot more that we need to do, and we will still look forward to \nthose issues; we will move forward on these issues, but what this does \nis move us forward in a significant way.\n  Does this bill destroy our bedrock environmental laws? Of course \nnot--the last time I heard people talking about bedrock was talking \nabout Wilma and Fred and Barney. I am sorry; those laws didn't save \ntheir pet dinosaurs back in those days, either.\n  We are not going to change anything; we are not going to move \nforward; we are not going to destroy what we have gained in the past, \nbut what we are going to do is allow the Forest Service to do their \njob, something they are stopped from doing now because of procedural \npractices, because of litigation, because of lack of funding. All three \nof those are addressed in this particular piece of legislation.\n  It is a great piece of legislation, and it needs to go forward. I \nurge everyone in here to realize how we must make steps to move forward \nand pass this bill and get it over to the Senate and onto the \nPresident's desk so our Forest Service can do their jobs.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Chair, I rise to discuss Title IX of H.R. \n2647, the ``Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015.''\n  Each year, several hundred small wildfires occur within the State of \nIndiana. Most of these fires are extinguished by our local fire \ndepartments. While the Hoosier State does not experience the \ndevastating effects of wildfires that the West does, I understand and \nsupport the need to ensure that wildfires on Federal lands are treated \nsimilar to other major disasters so that they have access to funds \noutside the discretionary budget caps. It is important that the \nDepartment of the Interior and the Forest Service, which manages the \nHoosier National Forest in southern Indiana, have access to sufficient \nfunding to suppress wildfires on Federal lands whenever they occur.\n  Earlier this year, the Committee held a hearing and received \ntestimony that made clear that wildfire funding is an issue that needs \nto be addressed. As the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Economic \nDevelopment, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management, which has \njurisdiction over the Robert T. Stafford Act Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), I think it is appropriate to \namend the Stafford Act to ensure similar treatment for wildfires on \nFederal lands.\n  Some may have concerns that amending the Stafford Act will afford the \nDepartment of the Interior and the Forest Service with access to \nprograms and funds intended for other disasters. I agree that these \nagencies should not be eligible for other Stafford Act assistance \nprograms nor should these agencies have access to funds provided to the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency for other types of major disasters. \nBut I am confident that the Stafford Act may be amended to treat \nwildfires on Federal lands as a major disaster without affecting other \nprograms and funding. It is simply a matter of establishing a dedicated \nfunding stream specifically for wildfires on Federal lands to ensure \nthat these agencies have access to funds outside the discretionary \nbudget caps. It is my understanding that this is the intent of Title \nIX.\n  I appreciate Ranking Member DeFazio's interest and dedication to this \nissue. Moreover, I thank Chairman Shuster for trying to address this \nmatter.\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chair, I rise today to express support for \nthe Resilient National Forests Act, and to thank Rep. Bruce Westerman \nof Arkansas for his work on this important issue.\n  Last summer my home state of Washington faced the largest wildfire in \nstate history, burning hundreds of thousands of acres.\n  The amount of damage was unprecedented, but not entirely unexpected.\n  Decades of over-regulation and frivolous lawsuits have hindered \nforest management, and we've all paid the price.\n  In Eastern Washington, the Colville National Forest has been the \neconomic engine for Ferry, Stevens, and Pend Oreille counties--\nproviding jobs, energy, and recreational opportunities. Yet, mills have \nclosed, jobs lost, and of the 945,410 million acres in the Colville \nNational Forest, more than 300,000 are bug infested. This is \nunacceptable.\n  Currently, between one-quarter and one-third of all acres of national \nforest are at risk of catastrophic wildfire and only 2-3 percent are \nbeing treated each year. Dead, diseased, and ready-to-ignite timber is \njust sitting there, rotting away while the U.S. Forest Service and \naffected communities are powerless to remove it.\n  As we speak, there are fires burning across the Northwest--in Eastern \nWashington near my hometown in Stevens County, in the Blue Mountains in \nAsotin County, and nearby in Central Washington and Northern Idaho.\n  We have a responsibility to enact legislation that ensures wildfire \nfighting is properly funded and reduces the risk of future fires.\n  The Resilient National Forests Act is bipartisan, collaborative, and \nwill produce the best possible outcome for all involved parties.\n  With this legislation, the Forest Service will have the tools they \nneed to quickly remove dead trees and to effectively manage the forests \nin Eastern Washington, and across the country.\n  Mr. Chair, I ask this body join me in voting to keep our promise and \npreserve America's great resources for generations to come and call for \nthe Senate to follow suit.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  In lieu of the amendments in the nature of a substitute recommended \nby the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Natural Resources, \nprinted in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original \nbill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment \nin the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee \nPrint 114-21, modified by the amendment printed in part B of House \nReport 114-192. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be \nconsidered as read.\n  The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as \nfollows:\n\n                               H.R. 2647\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

To the extent \n     practicable, the analysis shall consider--\n       (A) the future risks to forest carbon from wildfires, \n     insects, and disease;\n       (B) the amount of carbon stored in products or in \n     landfills;\n       (C) the life cycle benefits of harvested wood products \n     compared to non-renewable products; and\n       (D) the energy produced from wood residues.\n       (2) Sustained yield alternative.--The Secretary of the \n     Interior shall develop and consider an additional alternative \n     that produces the greater of 500 million board feet or the \n     annual net growth on the acres classified as timerland, \n     excluding any congressionally reserved areas. The projected \n     harvest levels, as nearly as practicable, shall be \n     distributed among the Districts referred to in subsection (a) \n     in the same proportion as the maximum yield capacity of each \n     such District bears to maximum yield capacity of the planning \n     area as a whole.\n       (d) Additional Analysis and Public Participation.--The \n     Secretary of the Interior shall publish the reference \n     analysis and additional alternatives and analyze their \n     environmental and economic consequences in a supplemental \n     draft environmental impact statement. The draft environmental \n     impact statement and supplemental draft environmental impact \n     statement shall be made available for public comment for a \n     period of not less than 180 days.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 \nprinted in part C of House Report 114-192.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 203.\n       Strike title III.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 347, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Polis) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike a harmful and \npolitically driven provision on the underlying bill that has the effect \nof limiting stakeholder input and curbing equal access to justice, a \ncore constitutional principle in our Republic, and effectively removes \nan important check we have on arbitrary actions by Presidents and \nadministrations.\n  Absent my language, the underlying bill would hand President Obama a \nblank slate in determining how we run our Western lands. My bill will \nrestore that balance and allow civil society stakeholders and local \nresidents to be able to challenge illegal Federal actions.\n  While I respect and appreciate the impetus for many parts of this \nbill and support them, particularly those aimed at incentivizing \ncollaborative development management plans and fixing the flawed \nfunding structure for wildfire response--very, very important in my \ndistrict--the provision that I am striking in my amendment is truly a \npoison pill for many on my side of the aisle who care deeply about \nequal access to justice and many on the other side of the aisle who \ndon't want to hand President Obama an unchecked control over Federal \nlands.\n  In districts like mine, which are made up of 62 percent Federal land, \nthe Forest Service owns huge amounts of open space that we use, enjoy, \nis a driver of our tourism economy; we recreate as hikers, skiers, \nhunters, bikers; it is used commercially by loggers, utility providers, \nand many, many other groups.\n  I can attest to the fact that these groups, these stakeholders that I \nmentioned whose livelihood and enjoyment depend on these lands, are \nextremely valuable when it comes to providing practical, varied input \ninto managing our Federal lands.\n  This bill, however, would discourage and limit the depth and \ndiversity of public input by expediting the development of forest \nmanagement plans while removing the legal venues that exist for protest \nafter a management plan has been implemented, meaning not only does the \nprovision, like the one I am trying to strike, cripple the transparency \nand effectiveness by limiting the form of expertise we have in planning \nour Federal lands, it also has the potential to repeal some critical \nrights, like the right to protest and legal recourse for potential \nwrongdoing.\n  The provisions I move to strike would effectively eliminate the \nability of citizens, nonprofits, local residents, independent advocacy \norganizations, and others to file lawsuits against potentially illegal \nor improper forest management tools that the executive branch is using.\n  By creating a harmful bonding requirement, which would really exclude \njudicial access for everybody--except the very wealthiest corporations \nand people--and a prejudicial fee-shifting requirement that enables the \ngovernment to act with impunity at the clear expense of the plaintiff, \nwe really break down the core principle of equal access to justice, \nwhich is our right.\n  By prohibiting the courts from issuing any restraining orders, \npreliminary injunctions, or injunctions pending repeal in cases of \npostdisaster operations after broadly defined events, we are only \ncompounding the damage.\n  Again, Mr. Chairman, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle's \nmove to block the court's ability to make sound, thoughtful, and \ntransparent decisions if the executive branch acts illegally really \nwill come at the expense of our local stakeholders for those of us who \nlive in and around Federal land.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I think it is important to realize \nthere is nothing, absolutely nothing in the base bill that prohibits \nany individual or group from filing a lawsuit.\n  What it does do is discourage frivolous lawsuits.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Zinke) to expand \non that.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I stand in opposition to the amendment. We \nhave to reward collaboration and working together.\n  What this bill does not do is discourage NEPA. What it does do, \nthough, is it brings people together to work together. That is what I \nwas sent to Washington, D.C., to do; and that is what all of us were \nsent to do, is work together and move the ball up the field. It does \nnot prevent anyone from filing a lawsuit.\n  What it does do, however, on frivolous lawsuits--and the numbers are \nclear. Between 1989 and 2008, over 1,125 lawsuits were submitted. \nAlmost in every case, those lawsuits ended up costing the Forest \nService that we are so concerned about the money they are spending--\nnumber one is forest fires; number two is litigation.\n  We want the same thing. We want more scientists, less lawyers in the \nwoods, and healthy forests once again to be part of our country; yet \nwhat happens is the collaborative effort--and we made the definition of \ncollaborative very vague so everyone can participate, everybody--it \ndoes not prevent anyone from suing.\n  What it does do is, if you are not going to be involved in the \ncollaborative effort, if you are not going to spend the time and the \nresources, then you have to post a bond, and that bond only covers what \nthe Forest Service would have to defend. We could have made it a lot \naggressive, and we didn't.\n  Mr. Chairman, I stand in opposition.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to inquire as to how much time \nremains on both sides.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Utah has 3\\3/4\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Polis.\n  As my colleague stated, title III would require anyone who challenges \na\n\n[[Page H5003]]\n\nproject on forest land in the Federal court system to put up a bond \ncovering all litigation expenses of the government. Plaintiffs would \nonly get their bond back if they prevailed on all their claim.\n  Further, it would not allow litigants to recover attorney's fees \nunder the Equal Access to Justice Act. While my colleagues across the \naisle have said it doesn't prevent anyone from coming forward, we do \nknow that the impact would be that it would prevent any plaintiffs, \nexcept those large companies with deep pockets, from bringing lawsuits \nagainst these projects, essentially keeping out the average American \ncitizen from having their voice heard.\n  I strongly support this amendment.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. McClintock).\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, Eric Hoffer once said that every great \ncause becomes a movement, which becomes a business, which becomes a \nracket. That is what has happened with environmental litigation.\n  Through many hearings, we have discovered that most of the groups \nlitigating collaborative projects sue just to raise money or to defeat \nnecessary projects through delay. That is their right. No one begrudges \nthem it.\n  But that does not include frivolous litigation designed solely to run \nout the clock on salvage projects or to nullify by delay the \npainstaking work of collaborative groups which often, in good faith, \nspend endless hours and considerable resources in negotiating a plan \nthat is fair to all.\n  I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I have many of my constituents who are \nliving in holdings on Federal lands. What happens if Federal land \nmanagement policy changes their rights-of-way and makes it harder to \naccess where they live? Where are they supposed to come up with the \nhundreds of thousands or millions of dollars that it would take to bond \nunder this scenario to figure out whether what the Federal Government \ndid was legal or not?\n  That is why we need to fix this, Mr. Chairman. And I urge my \ncolleagues to support my amendment to defend the constitutional rights \nof families who live in and around Federal land.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the chance to actually \nhear from the gentleman from California as well as from the gentleman \nfrom Montana.\n  You see, what happens and what has failed to be discussed here is \nthis section only applies to whether it has been a collaborative \nprocess.\n  So real people, citizens, will spend years working together to \ndevelop a collaborative project. And then too frequently outside fringe \ngroups that don't live in the area, but that do have big pockets, wait \nfor those projects to be announced.\n  Then they start to litigate, which has a chilling effect on any kind \nof collaborative work, and it makes the hundreds of hours that those \ncitizens worked to come up with their projects simply moot.\n  That has happened in California. I have been there to see those \nprojects that were stopped by frivolous lawsuits. It is the same thing \nthat happens in Montana and in northern Idaho. In that particular \ndistrict, of all of those lawsuits he mentioned, over 70 percent of \nthose were stopped because of frivolous lawsuits.\n  Now, we are not stopping anyone from suing. What we are saying is you \nput up a bond if you are serious about it and you don't use this as a \nway of simply stopping a process that has been worked out by the \ncitizens and the Forest Service at the same time. That is what this \nmeans, and that is what is going to be taken away.\n  That is why this is so essential and why this part has to be part of \nthis bill. It has to move forward or our Forest Service does not have \nthe tools it needs to preserve our forests and to protect our people \nand to protect our landscape.\n  This amendment cannot pass. It would destroy every effort of the \nForest Service to actually move forward into the future. We oppose it. \nWe oppose it vigorously and in all due respect.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Tipton\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in part C of House Report 114-192.\n  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 33, after line 21, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 505. FIRE LIABILITY PROVISION.\n\n       Section 604(d) of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of \n     2003 (16 U.S.C. 6591c(d)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new paragraph:\n       ``(8) Modification.--Upon the request of the contractor, a \n     contract or agreement under this section awarded before \n     February 7, 2014, shall be modified by the Chief or Director \n     to include the fire liability provisions described in \n     paragraph (7).''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 347, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Tipton) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, Congress has previously authorized fire \nliability provisions for stewardship contracts. My amendment simply \nprovides the same fire liability provisions for long-term stewardship \ncontracts awarded by the Forest Service prior to February 7, 2014.\n  These contracts have valid concerns over their potential liability, \nand it is prohibitively expensive to obtain liability insurance to \ncover the costs of large forest fires.\n  The amendment provides these contractors with the same protections as \nall Federal timber sales and integrated resource timber purchasers and \nother integrated resource stewardship contracts that they already have. \nI urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment, \nwhich would change the parameters of contracts that have already been \nawarded through a competitive bidding process.\n  Stewardship end result contracting is a critical tool used to achieve \nland management goals across our national forests and grasslands.\n  In addition to making the authority for stewardship contracting \npermanent, last year's farm bill directed the Forest Service to make \nthe first liability provisions in integrated resource timber contracts \nequal to liability provisions typically found in timber sale contracts. \nEarlier this year the Forest Service issued rulemaking carrying out \nthis directive.\n  This was a commonsense change, and I agree with the sponsors of this \namendment that this is a worthwhile change. However, their amendment \nwould retroactively extend the updated liability requirement to \ncontracts that were awarded before the farm bill was signed into law.\n  The Forest Service would, therefore, have to modify existing \ncontracts, which is not only a burden for the agency and the contract \nawardees, but it is unfair to companies that did not participate in the \ncompetitive bidding process because of their understanding of the fire \nliability requirements.\n  Congress should not change contracts that have already been awarded \nthrough the competitive bidding process. For that reason, I oppose the \nadoption of this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, we are talking about fairness. We just had \nan amendment that was presented by my\n\n[[Page H5004]]\n\ncolleague from Colorado that talked about fairness, and I think \nChairman Bishop spoke very eloquently in regards to allowing that \nprocess to be able to work through the private sector.\n  Yet, when we are talking about forest health, Mr. Chairman, wouldn't \nit be an appropriate thing to make sure that we have a level playing \nfield when it comes to liability?\n  If we want to be able to get in and actually protect those forests, \nto be able to protect those watersheds, to be able to protect \nendangered species and the other wildlife in the forests, let's make \nsure that we have a process to be able to do that so that that \nliability is not going to become a liability to something that I \nbelieve we all share as common ground, and that is the health of our \nforests.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n  Amendment No. 3 Offered by Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in part C of House Report 114-192.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I have an \namendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 44, after line 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 703. TRIBAL FOREST MANAGEMENT DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture may carry out demonstration projects by which \n     federally recognized Indian tribes or tribal organizations \n     may contract to perform administrative, management, and other \n     functions of programs of the Tribal Forest Protection Act of \n     2004 (25 U.S.C. 3115a et seq.) through contracts entered into \n     under the Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance \n     Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 347, the gentlewoman \nfrom New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham) and a Member opposed each \nwill control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Mexico.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I rise in \nsupport of my amendment that allows the Forest Service to establish a \npilot program to execute contracts with tribes under the Indian Self-\nDetermination and Education Assistance Act, known as 638 contracts. 638 \ncontracts allow tribes to manage and implement Federal programs in \nIndian Country.\n  When I was the New Mexico Secretary of Health, I witnessed how \nsuccessful and beneficial these contracts could be in efficiently \ndelivering services to tribes and their members. Through these \ncontracts, tribes operate hospitals, health clinics, mental health \nfacilities, and a variety of other community health services.\n  Having tribes manage and operate programs in their communities not \nonly recognizes tribal self-determination and self-governance, but it \nalso helps ensure that tribal needs are being met through traditionally \nand culturally appropriate methods.\n  Although several agencies have the authority to execute 638 \ncontracts, such as the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of \nReclamation, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Services, \nthe Forest Service does not currently have this authority. Several \ntribes have expressed to me that they would like to see the Forest \nService have the authority.\n  Many of the pueblos in New Mexico have land in tribal forests that \nare adjacent to national forests, and we know that wildfires and pests \ncan quickly affect entire regions, regardless of who owns the land.\n  In fact, the Las Conchas wildland fire, which is one of the largest \nwildfires in New Mexico's history, started on June 26, 2011, in the \nSanta Fe National Forest. It burned more than 156,000 acres in New \nMexico, including land belonging to the Pueblos of Santa Clara, Ohkay \nOwingeh, San Ildefonso, Pojoaque, Jemez, Cochiti, and Kewa.\n  It is imperative that the Forest Service and tribes actively work \ntogether to co-manage forests. I urge Members to support my amendment, \nwhich will improve the Forest Service's ability to partner with tribes \nin order to work on projects that impact tribal lands and forests.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, \nalthough I may not be in opposition to this particular bill.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the gentlewoman \nfrom New Mexico, as this bill works its way through the process of \nultimately being signed and implemented, if she would be willing to \nwork with us to make sure this contracting authority in the future has \nno unintended consequences.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman for a response.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, absolutely. I \nappreciate that offer. Thank you.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Thompson).\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this \namendment. I want to thank the ranking member from the Conservation and \nForestry Subcommittee for bringing this amendment forward.\n  This amendment obviously allows the Forest Service to create a pilot \nprogram that would execute contracts with tribes to perform \nadministrative, management, and other functions of the program for the \nTribal Forest Protection Act of 2004.\n  Allowing the Forest Service to execute contracts would recognize the \ngovernment-to-government relationship that tribes have with the Federal \nGovernment, and it would be in line with the intent of the Tribal \nForest Protection Act of working with tribes as partners.\n  I certainly would encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 \nminutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan).\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, I want to particularly thank the gentlewoman \nfrom New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham) for yielding and for \nintroducing this important amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying that I know you have all heard, \nwhich is that the shadows of those who live on their land are the best \nprotectors and the best stewards of that land.\n  My wife and I have had the good fortune to plant over 100,000 trees \non our land, with the help of the kids, and I want you to know they are \ndoing well.\n  I am supportive of this amendment because I think it is high time \nthat the American Indians and the Alaska Natives, who are the first \nstewards of our lands, be allowed to better exercise their sovereignty \nand their self-determination in caring for the forests they have called \nhome for untold centuries.\n  We already have 638 contracts that allow the tribes to manage Federal \nlands in Indian Country. This amendment simply adds a partnership with \nthe U.S. Forest Service to that list.\n  By approving this measure, we help create jobs, protect our forests \nall across Indian Country, and we all become better stewards of our \nNation's great resources.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this important \namendment.\n  I want to again particularly thank Ms. Lujan Grisham for her \nleadership on this important issue. I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee for his support of it as well. And I thank the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time \nis remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Utah has 4 minutes remaining, \nand the gentlewoman from New Mexico has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), the sponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment \nas it goes along with the collaborative efforts we are trying to \ninclude\n\n[[Page H5005]]\n\nin the bill with tribal and State governments.\n  I just want to thank the gentlewoman for proposing this amendment, \nand I rise in full support of it.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Kilmer\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 \nprinted in part C of House Report 114-192.\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 807. LANDSCAPE-SCALE FOREST RESTORATION PROJECT.\n\n       The Secretary of Agriculture shall develop and implement at \n     least one landscape-scale forest restoration project that \n     includes, as a defined purpose of the project, the generation \n     of material that will be used to promote advanced wood \n     products. The project shall be developed through a \n     collaborative process.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 347, the gentleman \nfrom Washington (Mr. Kilmer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chair, before I speak to this amendment, I actually wanted to \nstart by expressing my appreciation to the chairman for his work on \nthis important legislation.\n  I grew up in Port Angeles, Washington. I saw firsthand how a downturn \nin the timber industry impacted our region's economy and the livelihood \nof families who lived there. Those experiences were a major influence \nin my decision to pursue a career in economic development and now in \npublic service. It is a big reason I have been working on harvest \nissues that impact the region that I represent.\n  On the Olympic National Forest, I have been proud to help stand up a \ncollaborative, bringing together a group of stakeholders from all \nacross the spectrum to figure out how we can make real progress to \nrebuild the trust that we need to restore our forests and to promote \nharvest levels and to support our local communities.\n  We have begun to see some successes come out of that. I am sure \ncommitted to working to help take actions that lead to better outcomes \nfor our forests and for the local economies that rely on them as an \nimportant asset.\n  I think the bill that is before us today is an honest effort to \naddress the real challenges that are facing our Federal forests. \nImportantly, the underlying bill includes language that would make real \nprogress toward ending the harmful practice of fire borrowing.\n  Now, I have got some concerns about this bill that are going to keep \nme from supporting it today, but I am very hopeful that this is just a \nfirst step in a process that leads to compromise legislation that we \ncan send on to the President and get signed into law to help our \nforests and to help our communities. I would welcome the opportunity to \nbe a part of that process.\n  Mr. Chair, the amendment that I have offered today is focused on an \ninitiative that would support innovative wood products, including \ncross-laminated timber. CLT products offer increased use of responsibly \nharvested wood that could mean more jobs in rural areas of Washington \nState and all other States.\n  These are renewable resources, rather than steel or concrete, that \nwould make our buildings greener. These new wood products are strong \nand fire resistant and may actually be safer in an earthquake than \nnonwood alternatives.\n  We can change the way our Nation constructs buildings by utilizing \nthese new sturdy wood products. More importantly, we can lead the way \non a global timber revolution that can bring lower costs, \nenvironmentally friendly building materials to market, providing more \njob opportunities in rural America.\n  My amendment is pretty simple. It would direct the Secretary of \nAgriculture to develop a significant forest restoration project with \nthe goal of generating the kind of material we can use for these \nadvanced wood products. I would urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I actually rise in \nsupport of this amendment as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nConservation and Forestry of the Committee on Agriculture.\n  It is consistent with the U.S. Forest Service's recognition of the \nimportant role that advanced wood products can play, particularly in \nbuilding construction. New and innovative technologies are yielding \nbuilding products that are greener, stronger, fire resistant, and even \nsafer in response to earthquakes than nonwood alternatives.\n  The bottom line is, when it comes to good, healthy forest management, \nit is just not some of the barriers we are dealing with today in terms \nof harvesting; it is also about driving the market and increasing the \nvalue.\n  It is a three-legged stool for healthy forests. I am very pleased \nwith the underlying bill. I think that is helping on step one. I think \nthis amendment helps us in terms of pushing the market value and the \nvalue of timber, and it is certainly consistent with many of the steps \nthat we took within the farm bill in terms of research for advanced \nwood products.\n  I just am very pleased to support this amendment.\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. While it \ndoes nothing to address our underlying concerns with the bill, the \npromotion of advanced wood products is an important priority, and I \ncommend my colleague from Washington, Mr. Kilmer, for taking on this \nissue.\n  The amendment directs the Forest Service to establish a pilot project \nto promote the production of advanced wood products. Production of \nthese products, like cross-laminated timber, or CLT, is a growing \nmarket with many practical applications. Growing this market here in \nthe United States is an important economic development opportunity, and \nI thank Mr. Kilmer for his efforts in promoting this opportunity.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arkansas \n(Mr. Westerman), the sponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the concept of this \namendment. The gentleman brings out a very important fact that we do \nneed forest products to be able to utilize the resources coming off our \nforests in order to do healthy management.\n  There are many forest products that can be made from smaller diameter \nmaterials that are already out there. We have the science behind it. A \nlandscapewide collaborative project that uses these lower value \nproducts would be a good thing to do.\n  I do challenge the gentleman to support the whole bill so that we \ncould put this into practice, should it be passed, because it would be \nof benefit to the bill and to healthy forests across the country if \nsuch projects were implemented.\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chair, I have no other speakers, so I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, as we finish the last amendment to \nthis very good bill, the gentleman from Washington full well knows how \ndevastating it could be to his community if we do not pass this \nparticular bill and wildfires actually attack his constituents and his \narea.\n  That is why it is extremely important--as we take this last \nopportunity to speak towards this bill and this particular amendment--\nto recognize that this is a bipartisan bill, bipartisan sponsorship, \npassed by a bipartisan\n\n[[Page H5006]]\n\nvote in our committee, passed in a bipartisan vote in the Committee on \nAgriculture.\n  This is a good bill that will move us forward, and it is essential to \nmove forward. I appreciate all the support we have had from both sides \nof the aisle moving this particular piece of legislation forward. I \nurge support of the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, the unfinished \nbusiness is the request for a recorded vote on amendment No. 1 printed \nin part C of House Report 114-192 offered by the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Polis) on which further proceedings were postponed and on \nwhich the noes prevailed by voice vote.\n  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

I agree that doing so will in no way diminish \n     or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space, \n     and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees, \n     or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject \n     matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.\n       I will include a copy of your letter and this response in \n     the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of \n     this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fred Upton,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 7, 2015.\n     Hon. Fred Upton,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Upton: I am writing with respect to H.R. 6, \n     the ``21st Century Cures Act.'' As a result of your having \n     consulted with us on provisions in H.R. 6 that fall within \n     the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means, I \n     agree to waive consideration of this bill so that it may \n     proceed expeditiously to the House floor.\n       The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the \n     mutual understanding that by forgoing consideration of H.R. 6 \n     at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the \n     subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and \n     the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as \n     the bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may \n     address any remaining issues that fall within our Rule X \n     jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the right to seek \n     appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any \n     House-Senate conference involving this or similar \n     legislation, and requests your support for such request.\n       Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter \n     confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of \n     our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the \n     Congressional Record during floor consideration thereof.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Paul Ryan,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                              Committe on Energy and Commerce,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2015.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC\n       Dear Chairman Ryan: Thank you for your letter with respect \n     to H.R. 6, the ``21st Century Cures Act.'' I appreciate your \n     willingness to waive consideration of H.R. 6 so that it may \n     proceed expeditiously to the House floor.\n       I agree that by forgoing consideration of H.R. 6 at this \n     time, the Committee on Ways and Means does not waive any \n     jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or \n     similar legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately \n     consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation \n     moves forward so that the Committee may address any remaining \n     issues that fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. Further, I \n     understand that the Committee reserves the right to seek \n     appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any \n     House-Senate conference involving this or similar \n     legislation, and I will support such a request.\n       I will include a copy of your letter and this response in \n     the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of \n     this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fred Upton,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Pitts), the distinguished chairman of the Health \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I want to first commend Chairman Upton, \nRanking Member Pallone, Congresswoman DeGette, and Ranking Member Gene \nGreen of Texas for their outstanding support and leadership on this.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, the 21st Century \nCures Act, which will help advance the discovery, development, and \ndelivery of new treatments and cures for patients and will foster \nprivate sector innovation here in the United States.\n  I have a whole list of people I would like to thank. I will provide \nthat for the Record. I especially want to thank legislative counsel for \ntheir tireless efforts, the healthcare staff of the Congressional \nBudget Office, and the outstanding team on Energy and Commerce. They \nhave been fantastic, working 24/7.\n  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 6 was reported from Energy and Commerce Committee \nby a vote of 51-0 and advances conservative and fiscal and regulatory \nreforms. Every dollar of advanced appropriations in the bill, which \nwill sunset at the end of FY 2020, is offset by other permanent \nreforms, including billions of dollars in mandatory entitlement savings \nin Medicare and Medicaid.\n  This is no ordinary spending, like the kind we usually see in \nentitlement spending such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and \nObamaCare. This mandatory spending is for 5 years only, and then it \nsunsets. This mandatory spending is fully paid for with mandatory \nspending cuts elsewhere that will not stop in 5 years, but are \npermanent reforms resulting in real savings. By comparison, the Ryan-\nMurray budget deal for healthcare savings yielded much less.\n  This innovative hybrid approach allows us to cut mandatory spending \nand use the savings to fund what would otherwise be a discretionary \nproject, but in this case, it is a 5-year dedicated spending on medical \nresearch.\n  The Congressional Budget Office determined that H.R. 6 will reduce \nthe deficit by $500 million over the first 10 years and at least $7 \nbillion over the second decade. The funds provided to the NIH and FDA \nwill be subject to explicit review and reprogramming through the annual \nappropriations process. Congress can review the dedicated funding and \nallocate it for specific initiatives.\n  Mr. Chairman, by modernizing clinical trials, eliminating duplicative \nadministrative requirements, and perhaps, most importantly, making FDA \nless bureaucratic by advancing the voice and needs of patients in the \ndrug and device approval process, H.R. 6 will make lasting, positive \nchanges to the entire ecosystem of Cures. Over 250 patient groups have \nenthusiastically said ``yes'' and endorsed this legislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to think of the patients \nand vote ``aye'' in support of H.R. 6.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, today the House is considering H.R. 6, the 21st Century \nCures Act, legislation that will further encourage biomedical \ninnovation and the development of new treatments and cures that will \nbenefit millions.\n  More importantly, this legislation will ensure that our country \nremains on the forefront of medical innovation while maintaining the \ngold standard for approvals of medical products.\n  Mr. Chairman, this legislation is the product of numerous forums that \noccurred in Washington and around the Nation that heard directly from \npatients and advocacy groups about what innovations could make a \ndifference in curing diseases.\n\n[[Page H5010]]\n\n  It is a truly bipartisan initiative of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, and I want to thank Chairman Upton; Health Subcommittee \nchairman Mr. Pitts; Ranking Member Green; and our sponsor on the \nDemocratic side, Representative Diana DeGette, for working together on \nthis bill.\n  The legislation includes a number of policy proposals that are meant \nto advance the work that NIH and FDA are already doing to encourage \ninnovation in medicine, and I want to highlight some of those.\n  First, it promotes and supports the best biomedical workforce in the \nworld while also increasing the diversity of that workforce by \nrequiring the NIH to ensure participation of scientists from \nunderrepresented communities.\n  Second, it encourages the development of precision medicine and next \ngeneration treatments.\n  Third, it provides FDA with additional tools to make the drug \napproval process more efficient, such as streamlined data review and \nthe use of biomarkers in clinical experience to ensure that new \ntreatments can reach patients in a timely manner.\n  Fourth, it modernizes clinical trials and supports the inclusion of \ndiverse populations in clinical research through the National Institute \non Minority Health and Health Disparities.\n  Fifth, it facilitates the development of important antimicrobials and \ntreatment for rare diseases and clarifies the regulatory pathway for \nsoftware for medical applications at FDA.\n  Finally--although not finally--there are many, many more positive \ndevelopments in this bill, but I do want to mention last, ensuring \ninteroperability of our health system which will lead to better access \nto health information, coordinated care, and improved outcomes.\n  Most importantly, Mr. Chairman, 21st Century Cures also provides \nmandatory funding to both NIH and FDA to carry out the activities in \nthis legislation, funding that is critically needed if Congress wants \nNIH and FDA to fund innovative ways to cure diseases.\n  However, I am concerned that the very goal this legislation set out \nto achieve to encourage biomedical innovation and the development of \nnew treatments and cures is undermined somewhat by a reduction in \nfunding for NIH from $10 billion to $8.75 billion.\n  This funding level, the larger one, the $10 billion over 5 years in \nthe original bill, enjoyed the unanimous support from the members of \nthe Energy and Commerce Committee and the 230 Members of the House who \nwere cosponsors of H.R. 6.\n  If Congress is truly committed to advancing and encouraging \nbiomedical innovation, we must ensure that the Federal Government \nagencies we entrust with facilitating that goal have the resources to \ndo so, and I hope that, at some point, as we move further, we can go \nback to the $10 billion.\n  I would also urge my colleagues to reject any attempts to make the \ncritical funding included in the legislation for NIH and FDA \ndiscretionary. The NIH ensures the innovation fund was created to be a \nresource to both NIH, FDA, universities, and researchers, including \nthose just beginning their careers.\n  Any efforts to make this funding discretionary threatens the \ncommitment made in 21st Century Cures to encourage innovation.\n  I also want to express, Mr. Chairman, my disappointment over the \ninclusion of controversial policy riders on what was otherwise a strong \nbipartisan bill. This inclusion, added to the bill after unanimous \npassage out of the Energy and Commerce Committee, is a political \ndistraction from the discussion we should be having on the underlying \npolicy.\n  I hope that, tomorrow, my colleagues will join me in supporting \nCongresswoman Lee's amendment which will strike those troubling riders \nfrom the legislation.\n\n  Despite these concerns, I remain totally supportive of the 21st \nCentury Cures Act, as I believe it does take significant steps towards \nenhancing how we discover and develop innovative new medical treatments \nin the United States.\n  Once again, I take great pride in the fact that we were able to do \nthis on a bipartisan basis in our committee and report the bill out \nunanimously.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would urge a ``yes'' vote, and I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the vice chair of the \nfull committee, the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, America really is at its best when we \nare facing challenges, and so many of the challenges that we face today \nare in the area of health care and healthcare delivery.\n  Right now, we know we have over 10,000 identified diseases. We only \nhave cures for 500 of those. This is why we need to work to focus the \nNIH and the FDA on a cures strategy and do this through the legislation \nthat is before us today. Indeed, it is bipartisan, and it carries \ndifferent components of bipartisan legislation.\n  One is the SOFTWARE Act that Representative Green and I have worked \non. Mr. Chairman, getting bureaucracy out of the way and allowing \ninnovation is the goal of the SOFTWARE Act. It would codify the manner \nin which the FDA approaches health IT, including the wonderful apps \nthat we use to help make us healthy.\n  The FDA is the agency charged with ensuring the safety and efficacy \nof drugs and medical devices, but data is not a drug or a device, and \nit makes no sense to regulate it as such. That is why we bring forward \nthe SOFTWARE Act. We support the bill and encourage others to support \nit.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Gene Green), who is the ranking member of our Health \nSubcommittee.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of \nthe bipartisan landmark legislation, H.R. 6, the 21st Century Cures \nAct.\n  Dozens of roundtables and hearings, thousands of responses from \nstakeholders, and countless hours went into crafting this bill. This \nlegislation is the product of months of bipartisan collaboration with \nthe administration and stakeholders. As a result, H.R. 6 is supported \nby more than 370 patient groups, physician groups, and research \ninstitutions across the country.\n  The investments and provisions in this bill will accelerate the \ndevelopment of new tools and treatments for the fight against diseases, \nwhich have a great cost to our economy and an even greater toll on the \npatients and families that suffer from them.\n  After more than a decade of cuts and stagnant budgets, the National \nInstitutes of Health will receive $8.75 billion, and it will not \nincrease the deficit. This influx of investment will be put toward \nsolving today's complex scientific problems and discovering the next \ngeneration of medical breakthroughs.\n  In addition to this much-needed funding for medical research, there \nare so many provisions in this package worthy of support. The 21st \nCentury Cures Act will deliver hope and new treatments to Americans.\n  While some of the provisions are technical in nature, their real-\nworld impact is not abstract. Patients and families deserve to have \ntheir elected officials respond to their needs, and that is what this \nbill does.\n  I want to thank Chairman Upton, Congresswoman DeGette, Ranking Member \nPallone, and Chairman Pitts for their leadership, vision, and \ndetermination to speed the medical progress. This is an example of what \nour constituents want us to do: legislate and solve problems.\n  It was a privilege to be involved in this landmark effort, and I want \nto thank the staffs, legislative counsel, and the countless \nstakeholders who worked tirelessly to craft a bill that lives up to the \npromises of the 21st Century Cures initiative.\n  I strongly support H.R. 6 and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMississippi (Mr. Harper).\n  Mr. HARPER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak about the importance \nof tomorrow's vote on the 21st Century Cures initiative. This takes the \nnecessary steps forward so that we can deliver safe, effective \ntreatments much more efficiently and creatively across America. This \nlegislation would give NIH, along with the FDA, much-needed additional \nresearch dollars.\n  Specifically, imagine how a significant increase in funding could \nspeed up\n\n[[Page H5011]]\n\ntreatments and cures for such debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer's \nand ALS. This legislation gives researchers a fighting chance in the \nhope of finding a cure for so many diseases and disorders. Investing in \nresearch today will pay dividends long into the future and will \nsignificantly reduce costs of treatment.\n  Give families hope. Vote ``yes'' on 21st Century Cures.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I would ask my chairman to proceed with \nanother Republican because the gentleman seems to have more people.\n  Mr. UPTON. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nShimkus).\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I am here on the Democrat side, \ncongratulating them for great work on 21st Century Cures.\n  I was involved in a couple pieces of the legislation that were added, \none on antibiotic resistance and a lot on medical devices, because we \nneed to reform the process. The bureaucracy is tough.\n  So, in streamlining these procedures, we are not questioning or \naddressing or harming individual safety, but what we are doing is \nmaking sure these devices get to where they need it in the quickest \npossible time.\n  This is just a small part of the great work of my friends on this \nside--I hope you don't mind me being over here--and the majority side \nin that it is a tribute to what we can do when we work together. I am \nproud to be part of this team.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. \nDeGette), the Democratic sponsor of the bill who has worked so hard to \nbring us to this day with this bill on the floor.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Chairman, my father-in-law, Lino Lipinsky de Orlov \nSenior, was a true renaissance man. During World War II, he was a \nmember of the Italian resistance, whose family sheltered Jews and \nAllied solders in their apartment. An artist by training, he made his \nway to this country with letters of introduction and became a world-\nrenowned etcher and museum curator.\n  Most importantly, Lino Senior was a wonderful person. Kind to all and \nbeloved by his family and friends, he reveled in life's small \npleasures, creating whimsical drawings for his loved one's birthday \ncards and recounting tales of Italian youth, from idyllic summers on \nCapri to his escapades in the Resistance.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, it was more than a tragedy when in 1988, we lost \nLino Senior to ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS is a debilitating \ndisease that weakens and atrophies muscles, leaving those with the \ndisease the inability to perform even the most mundane tasks, much less \nthe ability to create great art.\n  Last week, at Craig Rehabilitation Hospital in Denver, I met a young \nman stricken with ALS who was already confined to a wheelchair. He was \nthere to support our bill, the 21st Century Cures. But what struck me \nwas, in the 25-plus years since we lost Lino Senior, there has been no \ncure. There has been no real treatment for patients who receive this \ndiagnosis.\n  ALS has been well known and thoroughly evaluated for a long time--\nafter all, it gets its nickname from one of the most popular athletes \nof the 1920s--but we have made virtually no progress in finding a cure. \nThis is not for lack of trying.\n  The ALS community is incredibly active. Plenty of us in this Chamber \nand people all around the country took part in the ice bucket challenge \nlast year. I thank Fred Upton for a lot of things, but maybe the thing \nI should thank Fred for the most was giving me the opportunity to take \nthe ice bucket challenge last year.\n  Thanks so much, Fred.\n  There is real hope, however, though, for ALS and for thousands of \ndiseases for which we lack treatments and cures. Thanks to the mapping \nof the human genome and technological advances like electronic health \nrecords, researchers are poised to discover new breakthroughs that \npromise dramatic improvements for patients.\n  The bill before us today, 21st Century Cures, will ensure that the \ngreat promise of these developments is harnessed by our Nation's \npremiere research facilities, the National Institutes of Health, and \nthe Food and Drug Administration.\n  21st Century Cures is a comprehensive bill which will encourage the \ndevelopment of new treatments and cures. It starts by making a major \ninvestment in research with the creation of a 5-year, $8.75 billion \ninnovation fund at the NIH. We create this fund to give the leaders the \nchance to plan strategically and to give longer term support to \npromising research projects. Ultimately, these investments will help \nproduce new discoveries in the lab.\n\n  Cures then helps to take those discoveries and turn them into \ntreatments for patients. We begin by modernizing clinical trials, \nincluding new efforts to ensure diverse populations participate in \nthese research projects.\n  We allow centralized approval for clinical trials and adaptive trial \ndesigns to eliminate wasteful duplication of effort.\n  We include the patient perspective into every facet of discovering, \ndeveloping, and delivering treatments, so that a conceptual \nbreakthrough can be applied in practical ways.\n  We encourage new disease registries to pool information and help \nresearchers drill into the data to find the unique and sometimes subtle \nneeds of patient populations.\n  We help new scientists begin their careers in research so that great \nminds can tackle our biomedical challenges, and we will unlock the \npotential of modern technologies by facilitating safe data sharing and \nusing digital medicine. We include many of the proposals in President \nObama's precision medicine initiative as part of this.\n  With this bill, Mr. Chairman, we are going to make sure that in the \n21st century, the pace of breakthroughs, treatments, and cures \naccelerates to meet the challenges of our time. A healthier world is \ncoming, and I look forward to getting there as fast as we all can.\n  You know, we couldn't have done this without this team, and I want to \ntake my minute to thank so many people who have helped with this. \nRanking Member Pallone's staff: Jeff, Tiffany, Kim, Arielle, Rachel, \nEric, Waverly; Ranking Member Green's staff: Kristen; Chairman Upton's \nstaff: Gary, Clay, John, Paul, Carly, Katie, Adrianna, Robert, Josh, \nJoan, Bits, Mark, Sean, Noelle, Tom, Leighton--they are the majority; \nthey have a lot more staff than we do--Chairman Pitts' staff: Heidi; \nRepresentative Burgess' staff: JP and Daniel; my unbelievable and \nintrepid staff: Rachel, Elizabeth, Matt, Eleanor, Diana Gambrel, Cole; \nmy wonderful chief of staff who has been with me for 19 years; leg \ncounsel.\n  Most of all, I want to thank my partner and compatriot, Fred Upton. \nYou have been fabulous, and I look forward to taking this over the \nfinish line with you.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Harris), a member of the Appropriations Committee and a \nvery valuable member as we put this package together.\n  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Chairman, curing disease and suffering is something \nthat even this Congress can agree on on both sides of the aisle. This \nis obvious from tonight's debate.\n  Preventative measures are important, but there are still diseases \nthat we don't understand how to prevent, much less treat. And the \npurpose of the cure and innovation fund is, in fact, to accelerate the \ndiscovery.\n  Before I came here, I did research on diseases. Is there anyone in \nthe country who doesn't believe that we will cure diseases like \nAlzheimer's or ALS? It is only a matter of time and the investments \nthat we place in it. As the gentlewoman from Colorado stated, we have a \nlot of the pieces in place in order to create these tremendous new \ndiscoveries, and this bill gets us on the path.\n  There is going to be a lot of talk about cost on the floor, but the \ncost of these diseases is not just measured in dollars. The cost is \nmeasured in families in ways that you can't measure in dollars.\n  Any family who treated a member with Alzheimer's disease, for \ninstance, understands exactly what I mean by that.\n  Now, a lot of those costs are huge. Alzheimer's alone, for instance, \nis hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare and Medicaid expenses \nover the next 10 years. If we can cure it, we can save those.\n\n[[Page H5012]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, it is time to invest in those cures. We simply can't \nafford not to.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from South \nCarolina (Mr. Duncan).\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I lost my father April 14 \nof this year to Alzheimer's. It is a terrible disease. I watched how it \naffected him. I know that there are millions of Americans and American \nfamilies that are dealing with Alzheimer's.\n  The 21st Century Cures Act will focus some resources so we can find a \ncure for Alzheimer's and we can find a cure for these diseases that are \ncosting American taxpayers so much money.\n  I want to applaud the chairman, and I want to urge everyone to get \nbehind the 21st Century Cures Act so we can find a cure for diseases \nlike Alzheimer's in memory of my father, John Duncan.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rush), who is the ranking member of our Energy \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 6, the 21st Century \nCures Act, and I want to thank Chairman Upton, Ranking Member Pallone, \nRanking Member Green, and Ranking Member DeGette for their tireless \nwork and commitment to this issue.\n  Mr. Chairman, this landmark piece of legislation will help modernize \nand personalize health care, encourage greater innovation, support \nresearch, and streamline the healthcare system to deliver better, \nfaster cures to more and more patients.\n  Mr. Chairman, we might live in different regions, we might live in \ndifferent times, we might be of different nationalities, we might even \nbe of different faiths, but when it comes to the overall health of our \nNation, we can surely put aside our differences and do the right thing \nfor the American people.\n  I want to highlight two provisions of my bill, H.R. 2468, the \nMinority Inclusion in Clinical Trials Act of 2015, that were included \nin the 21st Century Cures Act.\n  The first provision will require the National Institute on Minority \nHealth and Health Disparities to include, within its strategic plan for \nbiomedical research, ways to increase representation of \nunderrepresented communities in clinical trials.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  The second will ensure that it remains a priority at NIH to increase \nthe inclusion rates of traditionally underrepresented communities \nwithin the future biomedical workforce.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman such time as he may \nconsume.\n  Mr. RUSH. Simply put, Mr. Chairman, these provisions addressed \npersistent systemic and widespread disparities in health outcomes for \nminority communities.\n  As you know, many diseases, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, \nHIV/AIDS, diabetes, lupus, osteoporosis, asthma, sickle cell, and \nkidney diseases have been studied at length and still afflict minority \npopulations in disturbing numbers and at disturbing rates.\n  Minorities are disproportionately underrepresented in clinical \ntrials. There are many reasons attributed to this disproportionality, \nsuch as a lack of funding.\n  The chief culprit is that research professionals tend to work toward \nsolutions for the cure of diseases to which they have personal \nconnections and have personal experiences.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am so glad that the 21st Century Cures Act does \naddress some of these critical issues. I rise in support of the 21st \nCentury Cures Act, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto vote in favor of H.R. 6.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Bilirakis), a member of the Health Subcommittee.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the 21st Century \nCures Act.\n  This bill represents meaningful reform for patients with rare or \nchronic conditions. I would like to highlight one provision I am so \nproud of, the OPEN Act.\n  There are 1 in 10 Americans who suffer from a rare disease. That is \n10 percent of the country. Over 95 percent of these diseases have no \ntreatments.\n  Patients like Candace and Laura from the Tampa Bay Area need FDA-\napproved safe and effective treatments. Laura has no treatment options, \nand Candace did her own research and took a medication off label and is \nnow in remission.\n  The OPEN Act will incentivize major market drugs and combination drug \nproducts to be repurposed to treat rare diseases and put them on label.\n  The 30 million Americans with rare diseases need your ``yes'' vote. \nVote for this bill. Vote for patients.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Lance), a member of the Health Subcommittee.\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, this is the way Congress should work, in a \nbipartisan capacity. In my 5 years on the committee, this is the most \nsignificant piece of legislation to be voted out of the committee \nunanimously.\n  To those of us who are listening on C-SPAN this evening, this is what \nthe American people demand of Congress, bipartisan cooperation.\n  This bill will save countless lives not only in this country, but \nacross the globe. I am so pleased it includes language coauthored by \nCongresswoman Anna Eshoo of California and me exempting future Food and \nDrug Administration user fees from sequestration.\n  I urge an extremely positive vote tomorrow. I hope that all of our \ncolleagues will support this to indicate to the Senate of the United \nStates that it should move forward as well so that the legislation can \nreach the desk of the President of the United States.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Bucshon), a member of the Health Subcommittee.\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of 21st Century \nCures, an initiative that gives hope to patients and families who have \nbattled or who will battle one of the 10,000 diseases with no known \ncures, like my good friend and mayor of Jasper, Indiana, Terry Seitz, \nwho lost his wife and the mother of their two daughters, Ann Seitz, to \nALS 5 years ago on Thanksgiving Day, the family's favorite holiday.\n  As Mayor Seitz put it, 21st Century Cures gives patients and their \nfamilies the opportunity for hope and the ability to cope. These two \nthings mean the world to those fighting a rare disease who face so much \nuncertainty about what the future may hold. 21st Century Cures turns \nhopelessness into hope.\n  Mr. Chairman, we have a real opportunity today to improve the lives \nof these patients across the country, and we need to seize it.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Mrs. Ellmers), a member of the Health Subcommittee.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to shed \nlight on why the nonpartisan 21st Century Cures Act is important for \npatients everywhere.\n  As a nurse and as part of our team working on this effort over the \nlast year, I can relay that the 21st Century Cures Act is important \nbecause of people like my constituent back home, Ellie Helton.\n  Ellie was a beautiful, courageous constituent of mine. She loved \npeanut butter cups, the color pink, and most of all her family and her \nfriends. At about this time last year Ellie suffered from a ruptured \nbrain aneurysm that took her life at the tender age of 14.\n  The 21st Century Cures Act legislation creates an accelerated process \nby which we discover and develop cures and treatments for patients like \nEllie. This legislation is fully offset and will reduce the deficit by \nmore than $500 million over the first decade.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am so proud to be a Member of Congress who is working \non this legislation with all of my colleagues, and I am so proud of our \nchairman, Fred Upton, for the work that he has done. This is an \nincredible effort, and I am so proud to be a part of it.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Capps), who is also a healthcare professional.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n\n[[Page H5013]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak on behalf of H.R. 6, the 21st \nCentury Cures Act, and I salute the bipartisan authors of this bill.\n  I am a cosponsor of this legislation. I am proud of the many hours of \nwork that members of the Energy and Commerce Committee have put in to \nfind common ground. This is a real achievement. 21st Century Cures is a \ngood bill. It has come a long way, but I lend my support with some \nreservations.\n  Despite bipartisan agreement in committee to provide robust funding \nfor the research initiatives and policies in this bill, the bill before \nus shorts the NIH by over $1 billion, and these funds are the very ones \nthat are critical for cures.\n  It is important that we provide the necessary support that the NIH \nrequires to continue to be the gold standard in research and \ndevelopment.\n  While we all agree that it is important to speed up research and \nclinical trials to get treatments to those in need, I want to reiterate \nmy concerns that this focus on speed should not undercut the work that \nso many have done for years, including many of us here in Congress, to \nimprove diversity in research and clinical trials.\n  While this bill does include my provision to encourage the inclusion \nof children and the elderly in clinical trials, more needs to be done \nto ensure that women and minorities are included as well. This is an \neffort I led during the FDA reauthorization, and it is one that must \nnot be undercut by the Cures effort.\n\n  Finally, I must express my disappointment that once again the House \nmajority has decided to add language to the bill that politicizes the \nbipartisan effort and attacks women's personal decisionmaking.\n  It is a distraction from the important work that we are trying to do \nhere, and I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport the amendment to strip it.\n  The 21st Century Cures initiative is such an important bipartisan \neffort to strengthen our medical research and treatment development. It \ncould be stronger, and I stand willing to work with my colleagues to do \njust that.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Long).\n  Mr. LONG. Mr. Chairman, what an accomplishment it is to have this \nhistoric legislation on the House floor.\n  I want to congratulate the chairman and my Energy and Commerce \nCommittee colleagues for their hard work. We are much closer to moving \nAmerican medical innovation into the 21st century. Part of that is to \nkeep up with the ability to communicate in a modern way with patients.\n  As the chairman knows, I have worked very closely with him and his \nstaff during this past year to draft language to update the Food and \nDrug Administration's oversight of healthcare information on the \nInternet, especially on social media.\n  Millions of people use the Internet to find critical health \ninformation on treatments and other health topics. Unfortunately, \ncurrent FDA regulations do not help communicate accurate, meaningful \ninformation online about healthcare solutions, such as prescription \ndrugs and medical devices.\n  There is enormous potential to improve American lives if we can get \nthe FDA to write workable rules and guidance to communicate information \nwhere people's attention is focused.\n  After all, the FDA itself regularly turns to the Internet to announce \nits activities and inform the public, presumably in a safe and \ninformative way.\n  I have legislation to do this, and I hope to continue working with \nthe chairman to modernize healthcare communications and, thus, help \nimprove the lives of all Americans.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the chairman on the 21st \nCentury Cures to make sure this monumental bill ultimately meets the \nPresident's pen and is signed into law.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. McKinley).\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in favor of H.R. 6.\n  By encouraging innovation and providing more resources for \ngroundbreaking research, we can provide a better future for our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  America has a rich history of scientific discovery, from putting a \nman on the Moon to finding a cure for polio. With the right focus, we \ncan do the same in finding cures for devastating diseases, like cancer \nand Alzheimer's.\n  I want to thank Chairman Upton for his commitment to making \nAlzheimer's one of the neurological diseases on which the CDC will \ncollect data. 21st Century Cures will improve the lives of all \nAmericans by bringing research from the lab to our families.\n  I thank the chairman, the committee, and the staff for all of their \ndedicated work on this.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nIndiana (Mrs. Brooks), a member of the Health Subcommittee.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my \nwholehearted support for the 21st Century Cures initiative. This \nlegislation will change lives, and it will save lives.\n  When Chairman Upton and Congresswoman DeGette introduced this \nbipartisan initiative, they promised it would be different. They used \nwords like ``bold,'' ``transformative,'' ``profound,'' and ``hope.'' \nThey promised hope, and they promised to change lives. Thankfully, they \nhave delivered on these promises and then some.\n  21st Century Cures will profoundly transform our Nation's ability to \ndiscover, develop, and deliver the cures of tomorrow. It will change \nand even save lives, lives like that of Fifth District constituent \nTeresa Altemeyer, who has a form of chronic leukemia.\n  21st Century Cures can make all of the difference. She recently told \nme, as one of the many hundreds of thousands of patients living with \nchronic lingering cancer, ``I am always looking forward to the future \nfor the next therapy that can either hold off my cancer or potentially \ncure it, and in the past the wait for these medications has been \nexcruciatingly slow.''\n  Tomorrow I will be missing the funeral of a dear friend, Judy Warren, \nwho died on Sunday from pancreatic cancer. She would have wanted me to \nbe here tomorrow, voting on this bill. It couldn't save her, but it can \nsave Teresa and many others.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIowa (Mr. Loebsack).\n  Mr. LOEBSACK. I thank the ranking member for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, this legislation, I believe, as Mr. Lance stated, is \nproof that we can accomplish great things when we put aside \npartisanship and unite around a common goal.\n  To that end, I want to thank all of my wonderful colleagues here \ntoday who have worked on this thing for so long. I am new to the \ncommittee, and coming into this and being able to be a part of this is \nreally a great honor for me.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  I want to thank the chair and the ranking member also for my \nprovision to extend and expand the prior authorization program for \nprior mobility devices in this bill, providing certainty to Medicare \nbeneficiaries that these critical devices will, in fact, be covered.\n  I am also excited about the NIH innovation fund, which entails \nmandatory funding, as was mentioned earlier, and will support \nscientists like those working at the University of Iowa.\n  As a result, we will have more groundbreaking advances like the \nUniversity of Iowa researchers' discovery of a biomarker that could \nlead to early detection for the risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women, \na discovery that could save countless lives.\n  While I am disappointed that the NIH funding was cut from $10 billion \nto $8.75 billion, I am hopeful that we can restore this amount as the \nprocess moves forward.\n  Finally, I am really happy that we finally have gotten to a point in \nthis body, at least on this legislation, where we can think longer term \nand not just short term, not just about the costs for this program this \nyear or even for the next 5 years, but think about all the savings that \nthis will entail down the road as well, something that really happens \nfar too often, I think, in this body and over in the Senate as well.\n  I thank my colleagues for their work on this issue. I am really very \npleased to be a part of the process. Thank you for having me as a \nmember of that committee and to be a part of the process.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New\n\n[[Page H5014]]\n\nYork (Mr. Collins), a member of the committee.\n  Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. \n6, the 21st Century Cures Act. This legislation will modernize and \nadvance our healthcare system to help the millions of Americans \nbattling rare diseases. It increases funding for NIH grants used by \nscientists at world class universities like those in my district in \nBuffalo and Rochester, New York.\n  H.R. 6 streamlines the drug approval process at the FDA, helping get \nnew drugs to market faster. Patients are demanding a fresh approach to \ndrug approval and biomedical research. This legislation provides \nAmerica's medical innovators the guidance they need to lead a new age \nof medical innovations.\n  I want to thank Chairman Upton and my colleagues on the Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce for their dedication to this cause. I am proud of \nthe work we have accomplished, and I am confident that this legislation \naccomplishes our goal of incentivizing innovation and defeating \ndisease.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to another gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Gibson), who again had a very positive impact on the \nlegislation that was bipartisan as a part of this bill.\n  Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 6 on behalf of \nthe many Americans who have been impacted by Lyme disease and other \ntickborne diseases. Lyme disease is rapidly becoming a public health \nscourge in the U.S. We simply need to do better at prevention, \ndiagnosis, and treatment.\n  H.R. 6 includes the text of the Tick-Borne Disease Research \nAccountability and Transparency Act, which is a truly constituent-\ndriven effort and represents a significant step forward in bringing \nsolutions for our chronic Lyme sufferers.\n  I would like to thank the physicians, the patient advocates, and \nresearchers that helped in this process, including Dr. Richard \nHorowitz, Pat Smith, David Roth, Jill and Ira Auerbach, Holly Ahern, \nChris Fisk, and other Lyme advocates across the nation, including \nRepresentative Chris Smith of New Jersey and my coauthor and friend, \nRepresentative Joe Courtney of Connecticut.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Chairman Upton, Ranking Members \nPallone and DeGette, and their dedicated committee staff for working \ntirelessly to include members' input and manage an open, bipartisan \nprocess for this important legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, how much time remains on each side?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 11 minutes remaining. \nThe gentleman from Michigan has 14\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia \n(Mr. Allen).\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chair, I rise today to support the 21st Century Cures \nAct and thank the chairman and the Committee on Energy and Commerce to \nkeep America at the forefront of medical innovation by removing \nbarriers that prevent development and delivery of life-improving \ntherapies.\n  However, this is not only an issue of keeping America competitive; it \nis a moral issue. The greatest physician in history said in Matthew: \n``Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters \nof mine, you did for me.''\n  I want to share the story of Brennan Simkins, who was diagnosed with \nchildhood cancer. Brennan has had over four stem cell transplants. He \nis still living today, and he is the student of my wife, who is \nteaching him piano.\n  He is truly a miracle and a blessing to us, but he still requires \nmedications. There are medications out there which are caught up in \nbureaucratic red tape. By passing this bill, we can help patients and \nfamilies across the country, like Brennan Simkins, get access to the \nmedicines of tomorrow.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. UPTON. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Aguilar).\n  Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman from New Jersey \nyielding some time.\n  Tomorrow, the House will vote on the 21st Century Cures Act, \nlegislation that will advance medical research at the FDA and the NIH \nto lead new treatment for cures for countless people. This is \nnecessary.\n  However, what is not necessary is the dangerous language that \nRepublican leadership quietly tucked in the bill that blocks access to \nreproductive care. This is unacceptable.\n  As a member of the Pro-Choice Caucus, I oppose this and other \nattempts to expand restrictions on reproductive care. We cannot allow \nthis type of antichoice language to keep appearing in what is otherwise \nimportant legislation.\n  Today, it is in legislation to further medical research. Before, it \nwas in legislation to fund community health centers and to protect \nvictims of trafficking. Allowing this policy to move forward will move \nwomen's health care backward. We cannot allow these attacks to \ncontinue.\n  Representatives Lee, Clarke, and Schakowsky have offered an amendment \nto strike this destructive antichoice language. Today, I offer them my \nstrong support.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of their amendment and to also \ninsist that we need to stop injecting the Hyde language into parts of \nlaw it doesn't belong.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Mimi Walters).\n  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support \nof the 21st Century Cures Act. This bill is a bold proposal that would \naccelerate our scientists' ability to develop lifesaving cures. Our \nneed for action is now. Currently, more than 10,000 known diseases \nexist in the world; however, we only have treatments for approximately \n500.\n  In my district of southern California, 4-year-old Callan Mullins was \nborn with a severe congenital heart defect. He has undergone four open \nheart surgeries, suffered numerous strokes, been diagnosed with \ncerebral palsy; and at the age of 3, doctors delivered the \nheartbreaking news that he had a brain tumor.\n  Callan is a fighter and a survivor, but his parents are still seeking \nanswers and medical breakthroughs to ensure that he can live life to \nits fullest. The Cures Act would offer hope to the millions of \nAmericans like Callan battling devastating illnesses.\n  I thank Chairman Fred Upton for his tireless work on this bill. I \nurge my colleagues to stand with me as we pave the way for lifesaving \ntreatments and cures.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  Before conclusion of debate, Mr. Chairman, let me just take a minute \nto recognize Chairman Upton and Representative DeGette for their \nsteadfast dedication to this bill.\n  This bill would not have been possible without their work for so many \nyears, beginning when they had these forums where they heard from \npatients and the advocacy groups around the country.\n  The process that they used to actually obtain information that became \nthe basis for this bill was really unusual and was very, I would say, \npopulist and grassroots in a way that I think I would like to see \nemulated in the future because it was so successful.\n  It is further proof, I think, also that when we want to work together \nto achieve great things, we are capable. I know it hasn't always been \neasy, and the staff has had to work around the clock and on weekends \nand during holidays since January, but this is a good bill that I am \nproud to support.\n  I just want to thank not only the members, but also the staff of \nChairman Upton and Chairman Pitts. That is Gary Andres, Clay Alspach, \nJohn Stone, Carly McWilliams, Paul Eddatel, Robert Horne, Joan \nHillebrands, Katie Novaria, Adrianna Simonelli, and Heidi Stirrup.\n  Let me also thank Representative DeGette for her work, her staff as \nwell: Lisa Cohen, Rachel Stauffer, and Elizabeth Farrar; Mr. Green's \nstaff: Kristen O'Neill; and, of course, my staff: Jeff Carroll, Tiffany \nGuarascio, Kim Trzeciak, Eric Flamm, Rachel Pryor, Waverly Gordon, and \nArielle Woronoff.\n  Let me just say this: Obviously, I urge support for this legislation. \nI hope\n\n[[Page H5015]]\n\nthat we get a huge vote, but I think the biggest satisfaction that I am \ngoing to get when this passes and we work to get it passed in the \nSenate and to the President's desk is that every Member of Congress \nknows that, when we go home, there are always events with various \nadvocacy groups.\n  I think, of course, of the pancreatic cancer group because my mom \ndied of pancreatic cancer about 5 years ago, 7 months after she was \ndiagnosed, which is actually a long time. Many people die within 6 \nweeks or 2 months after diagnosis because the diagnosis takes so long \nand occurs too late, effectively.\n  You go to these various events that the groups have. Sometimes, it is \na run; or it is a walk. Diana DeGette mentioned ALS. I went to an ALS \nwalk, I think, about 3 or 4 weeks ago.\n  The typical response--and I am thinking of this last ALS walk--is \nthat someone will come up to you and say: Why aren't you doing enough \nto find a cure? Why aren't you spending more money? Why aren't you \nprioritizing this disease? Why is it so difficult to have a clinical \ntrial or to get involved in a clinical trial?\n  For 20 years, most of the time, when somebody has brought that up, I \nhaven't really had an easy response because, for many of the diseases, \nthere hasn't been really much progress at all.\n  Now, the biggest satisfaction I am going to have--and I have already \nhad it over the last few weeks--is when I go back and I go to one of \nthese events and one of the patients or advocate representatives says \nto me: Well, what are you doing about this?\n  I will be able to say: Well, we have a bill called 21st Century \nCures, and it does a lot of things that could make a difference in \nterms of what your concerns are.\n  That, to me, is the greatest satisfaction, really, of our being able \nto pass this bill tomorrow.\n  I would urge support on a bipartisan basis.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, if I might ask, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan has 12\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. UPTON. I yield myself the balance of the time to close. I won't \nuse 12\\1/2\\ minutes, I don't think.\n  Mr. Chair, I appreciate you being here tonight and the Members, \nknowing that we are going to debate a number of amendments and vote on \nfinal passage tomorrow morning.\n  We have all thanked a lot of people here, a lot of great staff, \nterrific staff, a lot of good Members. I am not sure anyone has \nactually thanked the leadership on both sides.\n  I want to thank John Boehner, the Speaker, not only for giving us \nH.R. 6, but his strong support all the way; Kevin McCarthy, our \nmajority leader; Steve Scalise, our whip; Cathy McMorris Rodgers, our \nconference chair; and on the Democratic side, too, Nancy Pelosi, former \nSpeaker, has been terrific; Steny Hoyer has been in the trenches every \nday on this issue, came and participated in our very first roundtable \nmore than a year ago to see this bill move forward. It is, indeed, a \nbipartisan bill.\n  Every one of us here, as we think about the 434 of us here in the \nHouse, every one of us has taken a different path to get here. We each \nrepresent diverse districts, and despite our differences geographically \nand politically, whether we have an R or a D next to our name, I \ndaresay that there is one thread that indeed binds us all.\n  We are all here to improve the lives of our friends, our neighbors, \nand our family members at home.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  This is Brooke and Brielle. I am in the middle. So look at just \nBrooke and Brielle. They and so many of our friends, neighbors, and \nfamily members are why we are here today. These two little girls from \nmy district in Michigan are bravely battling SMA. They are two of the \nbrightest stars that I know.\n  Our 21st Century Cures effort seeks to capture just a sliver of the \nhope and optimism that countless patients like Brooke and Brielle \nexude, despite insurmountable odds.\n  A year and a half ago, we had an idea. We sat down, Republicans and \nDemocrats, and it was time for Congress to do something positive to \nboost research and innovation and deliver real hope for more cures by \nexpediting the approval of drugs and devices. That is what this bill \ndoes.\n  We traveled the country. We had probably 40 or 50 different \nroundtable and subcommittee hearings all over the place, and we \nappreciated Republican and Democratic participation. We visited with \npatients, researchers, innovators, and health experts from across the \nhealth spectrum. We listened, and we put pen to paper, and then we \nlistened some more. And that is why we are here today.\n  There is not a single person in this Chamber or watching at home \ntonight who has not been touched by disease in some way, and it is \nabout time that we actually do something about it.\n  So as we begin debate on this landmark bill, I can't help but think \nof the patients who are sitting across from their doctors right now \nabout to get news that certainly is going to change their world.\n  It is not just the disease that makes them feel powerless and \nvulnerable. The very system designed to help them has not kept pace \nwith scientific advances. They need the next generation of treatment \nand cures, but they don't have until the next generation to wait.\n  They aren't interested in debating why the timelines, the failure \nrates, the size and the costs of conducting clinical trials are at all-\ntime highs. They know that, despite the promise of scientific \nbreakthroughs, they can't get the therapy that might save them. That is \nwhy we need this bill.\n  We have all said too many early good-byes--too many--and we have seen \nfamilies robbed of a parent that is never going to get to see their \nchild's milestones, like not see them walk down the aisle, maybe not \nsee a graduation, maybe not see a career, maybe not see them raise a \nfamily of their own, and we have seen children that are born without \nthe gift of a future. Life is not always fair. We know that, but we \nhave got to try and do better.\n  The last century and the century before it brought just remarkable \nmedical breakthroughs. From x rays and anesthesia to pacemakers and \ntransplants, the tools to diagnose and treat patients have been \ntransformed over and over and over again; yet for every single disease \nthat we defeat, every condition we cure, there are thousands more still \nplaguing our people. Of the 10,000 known diseases, 7,000 of which are \nrare, there are treatments for only 500.\n  The history of health innovation is indeed remarkable, but now we \nhave got our sights set on this bill, 21st Century Cures. The bill is \nabout making sure that our laws, regulations, and resources keep pace \nwith scientific advances.\n  So what does it take to vanquish a disease? Yes, often billions of \ndollars, millions of hours--that is for sure--thousands of researchers, \nand hundreds--maybe thousands--of failed attempts can go into the \ndevelopment of yet just one single treatment or cure. It is daunting, \nit seems impossible, but still, patients like Brooke and Brielle hold \nout hope.\n  They battle through pain, transcend physical limitations, and live \nlives filled with joy and optimism. Our brothers and sisters, moms and \ndads, grandparents and friends, they all keep faith in the future, in \nspite of suffering. This bill, the 21st Century Cures initiative, is \nfor them. It is for those that we lost, those who grapple with sickness \ntoday, and those who will be diagnosed tomorrow.\n  In this, the greatest century in the world on the greatest country on \nthe planet, Americans deserve a system that is second to none. We can \nand must do better. It is about hope--hope that the burden for patients \nand caregivers is less tomorrow than it was yesterday--and it is about \ntime.\n  So as Brooke and Brielle always say with a smile and a sparkle in \ntheir eyes, ``We can, and we will.'' The time for 21st Century Cures is \nnow.\n  Please join us, Republicans and Democrats, leaders on both sides of \nthe aisle, for the patients that we want to solve these diseases for, \nby supporting this bill, by working with our colleagues in the Senate, \nbut really listening to the voices that call for us to do something \nwell. This is it, H.R. 6. Please vote for it tomorrow.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the 21st \nCentury Cures\n\n[[Page H5016]]\n\nAct. I thank Chairman Upton and my colleagues on the Energy and \nCommerce Committee for all the work they've done advancing this \nimportant initiative.\n  For the past year and a half, we have been listening to experts and \npatients across the country detail how we can proactively address \nAmerica's growing health care needs and areas where cures and therapies \nare lacking.\n  The single best thing we can do? Make sure that our ultimate goal \nshould not be to provide lifelong treatment, but to find life-saving \ncures.\n  It shouldn't take 15 years and billions of dollars to maybe get a new \nmedical innovation approved. We need to remove the unnecessary barriers \nbetween Americans and life-changing innovation.\n  This means prioritizing resources, cutting through red tape, and \nempowering scientists and researchers so they can discover, develop and \ndeliver medical breakthroughs. 21st Century Cures does this.\n  I'm proud to have authored six major provisions in the Cures package. \nThese are bills that modernize HIPAA laws, accelerate the discovery of \nnew cures, create research consortia to treat pediatric disorders, and \nbring our regulatory framework into the 21st century by embracing \ntechnologies that focus on patient-specific therapies and the potential \nfor powerful indicators, like Biomarkers.\n  Mr. Chair, we have a unique opportunity here today. Today we are \noffering hope for the millions of Americans suffering from currently \nincurable and untreatable diseases.\n  Hope for the Eastern Washington dad with ALS who just wants to see \nhis kids grow up.\n  Hope for the high school student with cancer waiting for the FDA to \napprove a clinical trial.\n  This is our chance to help foster an environment where innovation is \naccelerated, not stifled. Where discovery and high paying jobs are here \nin the United States, not abroad.\n  This is our chance to offer the promise of real solutions to the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues join me in taking advantage of this \ntremendous opportunity, and passing 21st Century Cures.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the 21st \nCentury Cures Act, which will help uncover the next generation of \nground-breaking cures and treatments for the thousands of diseases that \ncurrently have none. H.R. 6 will streamline the delivery process, \nenhance research and development, and modernize the regulatory system \nfor approving drugs and medical devices. For patients, families, and \nloved ones affected by serious illnesses, this legislation offers real \nhope.\n  Last summer, I was fortunate to meet a young man named Scott Andrew \nMosley who lives in my district in Henderson, Kentucky. Scott is 13 \nyears old and was diagnosed with Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) at \nthe age of 6. DMD is a recessive X-linked form of muscular dystrophy, \naffecting around 1 in 3,600 boys, which results in muscle degeneration \nand premature death.\n  DMD begins in the legs and over time attacks all the muscles in the \nbody. Young Scott became unable to walk at the age of 9 because of DMD, \nbut has never complained about the hand he has been dealt. He offers \nencouraging smiles to everyone he meets, despite knowing he faces a \ndisease without a cure. Last year, a group of gentlemen in the \nHenderson community rallied together and volunteered to remodel and \nrefit Scott's bedroom with his own shower and equipment necessary to \ntransfer him from bed to bath. These gentlemen volunteered their time, \ntalent, and money to help Scott and his family because it was the right \nthing to do.\n  Mr. Chair, as a Member of this esteemed body, I believe it is our \nduty and obligation to pass the 21st Century Cures Act so that people \nlike Scott Mosley can have hope for a cure for DMD and so many other \ndiseases. Many other Kentuckians and Americans across this country are \nalso in need, and passing the 21st Century Cures Act will bring them \nhope, and it also is the right thing to do. My thoughts and prayers \nremain with Scott and the Mosley family, and I thank them for the \nopportunity to speak on their behalf.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of \nH.R. 6, the 21st Century Cures Act. Unanimously passed out of the House \nEnergy and Commerce Committee with a 51-0 vote, the 21st Century Cures \ninitiative will encourage innovation in biomedical research and \ndevelopment of new treatments.\n  With $8.75 billion in mandatory funding over the next five years \ndelivered to the newly created National Institutes of Health and Cures \nInnovation Fund and $550 million for the Food and Drug Administration \nover the next five years, it is clear that Congress is committed to \ninvesting in health research. Developing a better system of funding \ntowards high-risk high reward research and research by early stage \ninvestigators is crucial to finding better health outcomes. With a \nbetter focus on infectious disease, precision medicine, and biomarkers, \nI strongly believe that we will finally address these areas of unmet \nmedical needs, which are often the most pervasive issues in our health \nsystem.\n  The modernization of clinical trials by supporting a more centralized \nsystem, moving to more adaptive clinical trial designs, and creating a \nnational neurological disease surveillance system will help to develop \nbetter data and provide more patient success stories. The legislation \nalso allows for better sharing of clinical trial information for \nresearchers and scientists for more efficiency across the board. Also, \nthe bill ensures that strategies will be developed to cast a wider net \nfor clinical trials in order to increase minority representation.\n  Last October, I wrote a letter urging the White House to take into \nconsideration UT-Southwesten's existing particle therapy research \ninfrastructure and expertise in leading cancer treatment research in \nthe U.S. when selecting the planning grant award recipients. The \nplanned center would serve as a research adjunct to an independently \ncreated and funded, sustainable clinical facility for particle beam \nradiation therapy. Currently, the planning grant includes pilot \nprojects that will enable a research agenda in particle beam delivery \nsystems, dosimetry, radiation biology, and/or translational pre-\nclinical studies.\n  Mr. Chair, the advanced planning grant the UT Southwestern Medical \nCenter received in February 2015, is exactly the type of medical and \ntechnological advancement the DFW Metroplex and country needs and is \nthe type of federal investment we need to continue to lead the world in \nstate-of-the-art medical research. Not only is this grant a major \nadvancement for STEM, it is a crucial step in the right direction for \ncancer research and those affected by cancer here in the United States.\n  This legislation provides new funding opportunities for innovative \ncancer treatment approaches such as the development of America's first \nHeavy Ion Center for cancer therapy and would pave the way to keep \nAmerica at the forefront of medical research and state-of-the-art \ncancer treatment.\n  While H.R. 6 contains many provisions regarding the biomedical \nresearch workforce, clinical trials, FDA improvements, I am most proud \nof the initiative's provisions regarding mandatory funding for the NIH \nand FDA. I strongly believe that the Congress has not placed enough \nimportance on scientific research and this is a way to get us back on \ntrack. Investing in innovation will yield high rewards for the medical \ncommunity, especially patients. I am proud to support H.R. 6, the 21st \nCentury Cures Act.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nThompson of Pennsylvania) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hardy, Chair of \nthe Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported \nthat that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 6) \nto accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of 21st century \ncures, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H5016-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5016-H5017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IRANIAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, July 7, the \nObama administration once again ignored a deadline for the Iranian \nNuclear Agreement while failing to set a new date to conclude \ndiscussions on what could prove to be some of the most important \ndiplomatic negotiations of our lifetimes.\n  In March of 2015, I joined 367 Members of the House in sending a \nletter to President Obama requesting that any agreement would be \nprovided adequate congressional oversight and approval. This was a \nbipartisan effort because both Democrats and Republicans alike \nrecognized the magnitude of the challenges we face in confronting the \npossibility of a nuclear Iran.\n  The United States must promote an agreement that first and foremost \nadvances our national security and the security of our allies in the \nregion. A clear indicator of future performance has always been past \nperformance. Unfortunately, Iran has a decades-long history of \nobfuscation when it comes to their nuclear program.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must ensure that negotiations do not result in simply \ndelaying Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon for just a few short \nyears but, rather, a strong deal that would prevent the current regime \nfrom ever obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n\n[[Page H5017]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, as talks continue into the weekend, I am hopeful that \nnegotiators will remember that no deal is better than a bad deal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H5017-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5017-H5018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONGRESSIONAL PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS: CONFEDERATE FLAG\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hardy). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson \nColeman) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority \nleader.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, earlier today, the distinguished \ngentlewoman from California introduced a privileged resolution, not too \ndifferent from the one my friend and colleague Mr. Thompson brought to \nthe floor just last week. Mr. Speaker, that resolution called for the \nimmediate removal of the Confederate battle flag from the Capitol \ngrounds. And my colleagues across the aisle moved quickly to banish \nthat resolution to die in committee.\n  Earlier today, the original home of the Confederacy argued, but \nagreed, that the Confederate flag and the history it represents belong \nin a museum. They decided that the flag should not serve as a bright, \nwaving reminder of the discrimination and disparity of treatment for \npeople of color that still lingers in communities across our country--\nhateful sentiments that resulted in the loss of nine lives at Emanuel \nAME Church in Charleston.\n  They decided that that flag should not hang high above the halls of \nState government, forcing all those who see it to wonder whether the \nemotions and ideology so closely tied to it are present in the hearts \nand minds of those who serve in that statehouse.\n  They decided that the flag had flown long enough, and that taking it \ndown would be one small but critical step in healing the deep divisions \npresent in their State.\n  They stood against the symbol of bigotry, they stood against years of \ncomplacency, and they stood for the principles of equality, justice, \nand unity for this Nation. They will take that flag down tomorrow.\n  But Republican leadership in this body refuses to do that. They took \nthe path of cowardice and turned a blind eye to the struggles of \ngenerations of Americans. They used backhanded tactics last night to \nmuddle the language of the Interior and Environment Appropriations \nbill, including language intended to satisfy Members who would rather \nsee that flag fly.\n  The fallout from that language led to the disappearance of that bill \nfrom today's scheduled debate and resulted in the chairman of that \nsubcommittee disowning the final product.\n  Leader Pelosi's resolution offered another opportunity for my \ncolleagues across the aisle to stand on the right side of history, but \nthey turned that chance down resoundingly.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's not mince words. While I stand with my brothers \nand sisters of the South, the Confederacy itself fell far below even \ncommon decency for fellow man, violating human rights and taking \nadvantage of every part of the lives of the men and women they \nenslaved, sometimes for profit and sometimes purely for pleasure.\n  The Confederacy used extreme violence and terrorism to subjugate \nmillions purely on the basis of the color of their skin, and started \nthe deadliest war ever to take place on U.S. soil to defend a \ndisgraceful system. That flag is a symbol of the Confederacy's effort \nto keep that system intact. That is why, Mr. Speaker, before the \nholiday, I stood in this very spot on the floor to denounce the hate, \nbigotry, malice, discrimination, and division that the Confederate flag \nstands for.\n  But I also reminded my colleagues that a symbol, while significant, \nis only a stand-in for something far stronger. A symbol will never have \nthe strength of a bullet fired from the barrel of a policeman's gun at \nan unarmed Black man because of ingrained bias. A symbol will never \nhave the impact of a prison sentence that permanently prevents a young \nperson from becoming a full-fledged member of society, a fate far more \nlikely to befall a person of color. A symbol will never eradicate Black \nand Latino wealth like the predatory loan structures that put their \nhomes underwater in a recession at rates that dwarfed their White \npeers.\n  But if we are not even willing to get rid of a symbol, as this body \nhas so clearly expressed its disinterest in doing, how can we possibly \nmove on to the real underlying problems, issues like education for \nyoung people, affordable housing, and access and training for jobs.\n  Removing a symbol is an easy thing to do, an easy thing that would \nhave signaled one country, indivisible, with liberty and justice for \nall.\n  Today, Republican Members across the aisle did more than just stand \nup for that symbol of hate and that symbol of degradation. These \nMembers treated me and those issues that are vitally important and \nextremely sensitive to me in a manner that was both disrespectful, \ninsensitive, and very hurtful, Mr. Speaker.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Nonetheless, this will not go away. We will continue to raise this \nissue every day that it is needed, every week that it is needed, every \nmonth that it is needed, until my colleagues can recognize that a \nsimple act of decency, the removal of this symbol of hate and \ndisrespect and slavery, a mark on our history that needs to be removed.\n  Once we do that, Mr. Speaker, once we do that simple, little thing, \nand that is to stand together in taking down that ugly symbol that that \nflag represents, then we will be able to get on with the serious and \nimportant work that needs to be done to lift up this economy on behalf \nof all people.\n  That will be education for all people, and higher education that is \naffordable for all people, Mr. Speaker. It will be affordable housing. \nIt will be jobs and job training. It will be adequate preschool \nprograms and afterschool programs. It will be recreation programs and \ncharacter-building programs.\n  It will be safe communities. It will be equal opportunity for all \nbecause that is the country that we live in, and that is the reason \nthat we have this Congress, and that is the reason that I am here.\n  I, for one, will not be silent on this issue until we see this change \nthat the 21st century demands.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Becerra).\n  Mr. BECERRA. I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for yielding, \nand I stand with her and what she has just said.\n  Mr. Speaker, sometimes, we forget how privileged we are, the Members \nof Congress, who have a chance to stand in this hallowed Chamber. We \nare the representatives of the people. We get elected to speak for the \nAmerican people. We get elected to act on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  Very few Americans, throughout the history of our country, have had \nan opportunity to stand right here where we are today and say that we \nactually can get things done, not just for the American people, for the \npeople of the world, because there has never been a democracy like the \nUnited States of America.\n  There has never been a country that has had an opportunity to do so \nmuch for so many, and there has never been a democracy that has a \nchance to prove to the world that we know how to get this done and do \nit right.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we stand here in this Chamber, we have to admit, we \nhave to be prepared on behalf of the American people to stand up, to \nstep up, to do what is right, and to do what the American people expect \nus to do.\n  Now, they know we have to speak for them, but they don't want us just \nto talk. The time to just talk on so many issues has come and gone.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think the American public would agree that the time to \njust talk about what to do about the Confederate battle flag has come \nand gone. The time to just talk about what to do about the Confederate \nbattle flag came 150 years ago when the chance to heal was upon us.\n  As President Lincoln said in his second inaugural address: ``With \nmalice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as \nGod gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we \nare in, to bind up the nation's wounds.''\n  If we needed to talk, Abraham Lincoln said it all. Lincoln wanted us \nto act, to move, to get things done for the American people.\n  The time to talk came after one after another Black church was \nsuspiciously burned down throughout this country, and we knew something \nwas going on.\n\n[[Page H5018]]\n\nThat was the time to talk about what we needed to do.\n  The time to talk was before a man, driven by hate and animosity, on \nJune 17, entered Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South \nCarolina, to carry out a vicious plan to start a race war--because we \nhave seen these signs of danger growing for the disregard for life.\n  That would have been a time to talk and heal, before that man, crazed \nwith hate, walked into Mother Emanuel Church; but, Mr. Speaker, after \nnine innocent, God-loving, God-fearing Americans were taken from their \nfamilies, from their church where they were praying, from their \ncountry, the time to just talk is over.\n  It is time for us to step up. It is time for us to stand up because \nthat is why we get elected, to do what the people expect us, on their \nbehalf, to do.\n  320 million Americans cannot get up and say, It is time to remove the \nConfederate battle flag from any grounds where we reflect the \ngovernance of a democracy. They encharge us to do that, and the time to \ntalk has ended.\n  When we see on the floor of the House, last night, an opportunity for \nthe Congress to register itself and say, We hear you, America, you want \nus to act, and you want us to take down that Confederate battle flag in \nwhatever symbolic way we can, including selling that symbol here in the \nCapitol, we had an opportunity.\n  In fact, we had an opportunity that was golden because it seemed like \nwe had a bipartisan vote to do exactly that; but, in the dead of night, \nsomething happened. Some people decided to hide behind the dark cloud \nand change what we had just done.\n  When we take to the floor here, we may only be talking, but as my \ncolleague from New Jersey said, we are going to do much more because \nthe time to talk has just ended. It is time to act. It is time to step \nup.\n  We all have an opportunity. We all have an obligation to stand up.\n  Tomorrow morning, at 10, the Confederate battle flag will finally \ncome down from above the South Carolina Capitol once and for all. Mr. \nSpeaker, the Confederate battle flag has no place but a museum in the \n21st century.\n  Let us all together, those of us privileged to be in this Chamber, \nalong with our fellow Americans, forge a path forward as a Nation that \ncelebrates our bright future, not our dark past. It is time to take the \nConfederate battle flag down. It is time for us to step up.\n  It is not a time to hide behind procedural motions, behind votes in \nthe dead of night, and it certainly is not time for us to assemble a \nbipartisan group of Members to talk about what we need to do about the \nConfederate battle flag.\n  It is time to do the work of the people, and they want us to act. \nThere should be no doubt about it. The American people are speaking \nvery forcefully. Don't just talk; act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I say with great pride, having served in this Chamber \nfor many years, I believe the people's Representatives in the people's \nHouse are getting ready to act; and no act during the dead of night, no \neffort to derail this effort will succeed because the people have \nspoken and spoken in the words of the nine people who are no longer \nwith us.\n  We do it with grace, but we will do it with power because we \nunderstand this is not a time to just talk; it is a time to act--and we \nwill act.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Representative Becerra, thank you so much for \ntaking your time and being here with us today, and thank you so much \nfor your eloquent words.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Hahn).\n  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to also thank the gentlewoman \nfrom New Jersey for allowing me to add my voice to this discussion.\n  Certainly, all Americans were devastated by the brutal murder of nine \npeople, including Senator Pinckney, while they were attending Wednesday \nnight Bible study at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. Their \nkiller was motivated by racism, bigotry, and even had pictures of \nhimself displaying Confederate memorabilia.\n  The people of South Carolina and their political representatives have \nengaged in serious conversations about race, about healing, and how to \ndeal with their State's history.\n  South Carolina's Governor signed a bill a few hours ago to take down \nthat Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the State capitol \nwhere it has flown for 50 years, and as South Carolina was moving to \ntake down that flag, some right here were moving in the opposite \ndirection.\n  Earlier today, I took to this House floor to express my outrage that \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle had offered a surprise \namendment last night to allow the Confederate battle flag to be \ndisplayed in our national parks and at Federal cemeteries, just a \ncouple of days after this body voted to remove that Confederate battle \nflag from our national parks.\n  Many of my colleagues, including those participating in this Special \nOrder tonight, joined in speaking out; and as a result, I think we \nsucceeded in stopping them from bringing that amendment to a vote.\n  We are here now because we recognize that it is not enough to keep \nthe Confederate flag from being displayed or sold at national parks. \nRight now, here on the grounds of the United States Capitol, where we \nand our staffs work and visitors from all over come to visit, the \nConfederate battle flag and other images of the Confederacy are still \nvisible; and that, we believe now, is unacceptable.\n  I am proud to serve in the United States House of Representatives, \nwhich is known as the people's House; yet here in the hallways of our \noffice buildings and elsewhere in the House of Representatives, \nincluding this side of the Capitol Building, there are State flags on \ndisplay which include imagery of the Confederacy.\n  Many of the residents of the wonderfully diverse district which I \nrepresent in California and many other Americans from all across our \ncountry find these images offensive, insulting, painful, even \nthreatening.\n  If we are to truly be representative of the people and if we want the \npeople, all of the people of this great Nation, to feel welcome and \ncomfortable here in the people's House, then we cannot continue to have \ndivisive symbols associated with hatred, with bigotry and oppression on \npublic display.\n  Therefore, let me add my voice to those of my colleagues in calling \nfor the removal from the House of Representatives of any flag \ncontaining any portion of that Confederate battle flag.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the gentlewoman from California for \nsharing her wisdom with us and her encouragement.\n  Mr. Speaker, I really am touched by what we experienced in \nCharleston, South Carolina, the kind of grace and mercy that the \nfamilies of those who were felled by this domestic terrorist on the \nchurch in Charleston, South Carolina.\n  I know that, even in this Chamber, there are friends that I have \nacross the aisle who would gladly vote with me and vote with my \ncolleagues to remove that flag and that imagery and that symbolism from \nany of our government properties if they would simply be given the \nchance.\n  In honor and respect of the loss of life and the grace and mercy and \nthe healing and forgiveness that was demonstrated by the families of \nthose who lost their lives in Charleston, South Carolina, and in \nrecognition of the courageous steps that the South Carolinians did in \nvoting to take down that flag and for the Governor to sign that and to \nwatch, tomorrow, when history is being made, to take down that flag, I \npray that our House is given the opportunity to vote our conscience \nbecause I know that I have colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nthat feel the same way that I do, that believe in the greatness of this \ncountry and that believe in justice and liberty for all and believe \nthat those symbols that remind us of the mistakes that we have made \nbelong in the annals of history, to be remembered, but never to be \nrepeated.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H5018-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5018-H5025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1930\n                        CONFEDERATE BATTLE FLAG\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Babin). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n[[Page H5019]]\n\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to be recognized by \nyou and address you here on the floor of the United States House of \nRepresentatives, this great deliberative body.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special \nOrder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Iowa?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor tonight to take up \na topic that I think is going to be of interest to all Americans, but I \ncan't dive into that topic immediately without first referencing my \nreaction to these long days of debate that have taken place here in \nCongress about opening up a subject that had been put away by this \ncountry since about 1865.\n  I grew up as a Yankee well north of the Mason-Dixon line. I saw the \nConfederate flag in multiple applications. It always was a symbol of \nsouthern pride and regional patriotism and a symbol that said to them \nthat the South was proud to be the South, but I never saw it as a \nracist symbol.\n  But it had drifted into a symbol of an artifact of history until such \ntime now as it has been seized upon by those who are using it to divide \nAmerica again.\n  I regret that they have gone through these days of this ritual of \nexcoriating the Confederate flag. I regret that that has been brought \nup. And one would think that, if it was that offensive, that they would \njust let it drift back into history as a relic of history rather than \ntry to resurrect it as a symbol of something that they can't seem to \nlet go of.\n  But, for us, we are a country that every component of our history has \nnot been as noble as we would like. Every country in the world has had \ndifficulties along the way. We have risen above our difficulties, Mr. \nSpeaker, and we have adjusted to them and have put them behind us.\n  But we cannot be eradicating or erasing the history of our country. \nIt is important that we do keep it in front of us so that we can \nevaluate the lessons learned and move forward and make progress. That \nwas the reconstruction era. That goes clear back to right after 1865, \nand I regret that those old wounds have been peeled open again.\n  It is ironic that the gentleman would talk about President Lincoln's \nsecond Inaugural Address and binding up this Nation's wounds. They have \nbeen bound up. They have been healed up. And now they are open again, \nregretfully, Mr. Speaker. So I will package up that component of my \nresponse.\n\n\n                           The Supreme Court\n\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. I will now shift over to the topic that I came to \nthe floor to address, and that is the topic of the Supreme Court from \nthe marriage decision, the decisions that actually came down from the \nSupreme Court--I believe it was a week ago last Thursday and Friday.\n  On Thursday, there was a decision from the Supreme Court on \nObamaCare, the King v. Burwell case, where the majority decision of the \nSupreme Court concluded that the law, as passed by the United States \nCongress, doesn't mean what it says.\n  It means instead, according to the majority of the Supreme Court, \nwhat they think the President would have liked to have had it said if \nhe had actually been dictating the language there.\n  But we have to vote, Mr. Speaker, on the language that is in the \nbill, not the language that should have been in the head of the \nPresident and the Speaker of the House at the time.\n  That is why we have had a Supreme Court who, over the last \ngeneration, has been textualist. This has emerged from the Rehnquist \ncourt and should have survived and been enhanced under the Roberts \ncourt, that the law means what it says and the Constitution means what \nit says and, furthermore, it needs to mean what it was understood to \nmean at the time of ratification.\n  We do have a language that moves and changes and morphs along the \nway. And the language that is written into the Constitution, into the \nvarious amendments that are there and written into our laws, we can't \nsimply say that because we have a different way we utilize language \ntoday, that somehow the people who ratified it had a meaning that \nconformed to the morphed language of the modern world. And I would have \nthought that Chief Justice Roberts would have been one of those who \nwould have adhered to that.\n  I can think of times when the Court has said to this Congress: You \nmay have intended one thing, but the language in the bill that you \npassed and was signed into law actually means something different. So \nyou can either live with the decision of the Court or you can set about \nchanging the language so that the language actually does what you \nintended it to do. It is a simple understanding of simple construction \nunder the law in the Constitution.\n  An example, Mr. Speaker, would be the ban on partial birth abortion \nthat passed here in this Congress in the nineties. It went before three \nFederal courts and then was appealed to the Supreme Court.\n  And the Supreme Court concluded that the ban on partial birth \nabortion that Congress had first passed was vague in its description of \nthe act itself and that Congress didn't have findings that partial \nbirth abortion was not necessary to save the life of the mother.\n  So it was struck down by the Supreme Court, and that means they sent \nit back to us. They said: Congress, fix that. And I got involved in \nthat.\n  I want to tip my hat to Congressmen Steve Chabot of Ohio, who was the \nchairman of the Constitution Subcommittee at the time, and Jim \nSensenbrenner, the chair of the full Judiciary Committee. We held \nhearing after hearing. We rewrote the definition of ``partial birth \nabortion'' so that it was precise and clear and understandable, and we \ncomplied with the Court's directive.\n\n  In those hearings, we brought witnesses that put into the \nCongressional Record a mass of evidence that concluded that a partial \nbirth abortion was never necessary to save the life of the mother. We \ndid those things to conform to the directive of the Supreme Court \nbecause they read the text of the law.\n  But today we have a Supreme Court that concludes that--well, the text \nmay say one thing, but we think the President would have preferred it \nto say something else. And so did most of the people, maybe, that voted \nto pass ObamaCare, that very partisan piece of legislation. Maybe they \nintended for it to say something else, too, but it didn't.\n  So the Supreme Court inserted the words ``or Federal Government'' \ninto the statute that said an exchange established by the State. The \nSupreme Court essentially wrote into that ``by State or Federal \nGovernment,'' alleging that the language was vague.\n  That is appalling to me, Mr. Speaker, to think that in the United \nStates of America, a country ruled by the rule of law, that we could \nhave a Supreme Court who--no one has a higher charge to read the \nlanguage, to understand it, to call the balls and strikes, as the Chief \nJustice has said.\n  I think he forgot to say that you are supposed to also call whether \nit is fair or foul. Well, I think it is foul. It is a foul ball for the \nSupreme Court to think that they can change the language of the law.\n  If they sent it back here, Congress then had an obligation to adjust \nthe policy to our intent from now, maybe not the intent at the time \nthat it was passed, because those years have moved.\n  Then subsequent to that, the very next day, Friday--a week ago last \nFriday, as I recall--the Supreme Court came with a decision, a decision \non same sex marriage. I have some experience with this, Mr. Speaker, \nand it falls along this line.\n  In 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court, in reading the mirror of our 14th \nAmendment, which is in our United States Constitution--and the mirror \nof it is written into the Iowa State Constitution--they concluded that \nsame-sex marriage was the law of the land in Iowa. And their conclusion \nwas that it fell underneath the equal protection and due process \nclauses of the 14th Amendment--the mirrored component of the 14th \nAmendment that was in our Iowa constitution.\n  There are 63 pages in the Varnum v. Brien decision in the Iowa case. \nI read that decision. I read all 63 pages. But\n\n[[Page H5020]]\n\nnot only that, I poked through it. I read it. I looked at the ceiling. \nI contemplated. I looked back down at the words. I tried to absorb the \nkind of legal rationale that would get you to the point where you could \nconclude that under equal protection or due process, that marriage \nreally was between one adult and another entity, whatever sex or gender \nthat entity might be. And they wrote that under the protection of the \n14th Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause and due process, that, \nquote, homosexuals have a right to public affirmation, closed quote.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know of no place in law, I know of no place in \nsociety, I know of no place in history where there is an individual, \nlet alone a group of people, a self-labeled group of people that have \nany claim to public affirmation, public approval conferred by the \ncourt. But that was the key to understanding this litigation that has \nmoved forward since 2009.\n  It brings us into 2015. And we have a decision in the Supreme Court \nthat commands all States, if they are going to recognize any marriage, \nto recognize same sex marriage and for all States to also provide the \nreciprocity of recognizing marriages that take place in other States, \nas those individuals may come through or move into their States. That \nis that right of reciprocity. It is in the Constitution, reciprocity.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, for the Supreme Court to essentially create a new \nright, a right to same sex marriage manufactured out of the 14th \nAmendment of the Constitution of the United States, that was ratified \nin 1868--and, by the way, it ties into this dialogue about the \nConfederate flag and all the rhetoric that we have had in this Congress \nall week long. It ties into it in this way:\n  The 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution were ratified in the \naftermath of the Civil War. They were established, first, the 13th \nAmendment, to free the slaves because the people in the legislature at \nthe time didn't believe that a clear statute that freed the slaves was \ngoing to actually have the impact that a constitutional amendment \nwould. So they passed the 13th Amendment to establish that there will \nbe no slavery in the United States anywhere, ever.\n  The second was the 14th Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause and \nthe Due Process Clause and the clause says that all persons born in the \nUnited States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof shall be American \ncitizens. All of that to ensure not only that the freed slaves would be \nfree and they would have equal access to all their rights of \ncitizenship but that their children would also be citizens and that \nthey would have equal protection under the law. That was the essence of \nthe 14th Amendment.\n  We are asked to believe that somehow those who wrote and ratified the \n14th Amendment in 1868 had secretly put some subtle language into it \nthat they somehow knew we would discover in 2015 that says, there shall \nbe same sex marriage in all of America, and the Supreme Court will find \nit, and they will impose it upon the rest of the country because they \nare the enlightened five of nine in black robes.\n  Well, the Supreme Court has had a terrible record, a terrible record \non dealing with large domestic issues. In 1857, Dred Scott, they \nthought they could resolve the slavery issue. The Supreme Court was \nstacked in favor of the South. Five from the South and one from \nPennsylvania that was sympathetic to slavery. They had a 6-3 operation \ngoing on. And they essentially declared that blacks could not be \ncitizens, and they could not be free. They could not be citizens, and \nthey could not be freed by States. And that if a slave owner owned a \nslave, they owned that slave in any State that that individual might \ngo. That was the decision of Dred Scott.\n  They thought they had put the issue away. It came back to haunt this \ncountry over and over again. And it was part of the conflict that began \nin the next decade, within 1862, and that brought about the death of \n600,000 Americans and split this country apart and it has taken years \nto put us back together. The Dred Scott decision.\n  Fast forward 100 years. They took prayer out of the public schools. \nWe honored that decision. We stopped praying at least openly in our \npublic schools. Now the question is: Can a football team without the \ncoach kneel on the grass and pray before a ball game?\n  We are a First Amendment country. Freedom of religion. And we are \ndealing with this kind of assault on free religion because the Supreme \nCourt in Murray v. Curlett in 1963 dumped that on us; 1973, Roe v. Wade \nand Doe v. Bolton. Then you have the Lawrence v. Texas decision.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  And it goes on and on and on, Mr. Speaker. Up to this point, the \ndomestic life of America has been dramatically transformed by order of \nthe Supreme Court, the people least connected to the will of the \npeople. When they separate themselves from the text of the statute and \nthe text in the understanding of the Constitution, we are in a place \nwhere the Supreme Court then has put themselves above the law, above \nthe Constitution, and above the will of the people.\n  One of the people that understands that as well as anybody in this \nUnited States Congress is my friend from Texas, Mr. Louie Gohmert, who \nspeaks to us often in these Chambers. I know about his marriage, and I \nknow about his conviction to the rule of law and the Constitution.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Texas, Louie Gohmert.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. I am very grateful for my very dear friend--not just \nfriend, but dear friend--from Iowa, and I am pleased that he would take \nthe time to talk about this. He is making some great points.\n  The Dred Scott decision, if you really look at it, was decided by a \nmajority who had great aspirations that the media was going to love \nwhat they did. Instead of looking at the words of the Constitution and \napplying those words, they were playing to the elite media, and the \nelite media was completely wrong. Slavery was the worst abomination and \nblot on this Nation's history, and it is tragic that the Supreme Court \nplayed an active role in that.\n  It is tragic that in the seventies, as you pointed out, from the \nsixties, the seventies, the Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court has \ncontributed to tens of millions of murders--tragic. But I guess as a \nformer judge and a former chief justice, nothing infuriates me more \nthan for a judge or justice to believe that they are completely above \nthe law. I know what it is to recuse myself. I know what it is for \njudges who are friends of mine who had strong feelings about a case, \nbut they knew that they would not be fair and impartial and so they had \nto recuse or disqualify themselves.\n  With regard to marriage, we had one Justice, Sonia Sotomayor, who has \nmade comments indicating a massive question over her impartiality. But \nif you take two Justices about which there is no question, they were \ntotally disqualified. They were very partial, and they were \nopinionated. Going into this opinion, they had long since made up their \nminds.\n  In fact, one columnist reported on the last marriage, a same-sex \nmarriage, that Justice Ginsburg performed. She emphasized the word \n``Constitution'' when she said, ``I now pronounce these two men married \nby the powers vested in me by the Constitution of the United States.'' \nThat is a Justice who was completely disqualified.\n  Do you wonder, well, what actually disqualifies a judge? The law is \nvery clear about that, and Congress does have the authority to dictate \nthe terms by which a judge may sit on the Supreme Court or may sit on a \nparticular case. This law, 28 U.S.C. 455 (a) part--(b) gets into a \nnumber of different options--in (a) there is no option. This is an \nemphatic requirement for a Justice.\n  We know that Justice Kagan had performed a same-sex marriage before \nthis opinion. So we had two Justices who, under the laws of the United \nStates as allowed by the United States Constitution's clear reading, \nwere disqualified. They were lawbreakers in order to dictate \nlegislation on a social issue over which they have no authority by \nvirtue of the Constitution and the 10th Amendment. Yet they violated \nthe law, they violated the Constitution, and they violated their oath.\n  It is dishonorable to be a justice in any court and violate your \noath, violate the law, and violate the Constitution. But the law is \nwanting to assure\n\n[[Page H5021]]\n\nthe American people that we are going to be so far above question that \nnot only do you have to disqualify yourself if you are partial, you are \nbiased, you are prejudiced in a case, but ``if your impartiality might \nreasonably be questioned'' is the language, then you have to. It is a \n``shall.'' You shall disqualify yourself.\n  Mr. Speaker, two Justices violated the law, violated the \nConstitution, violated their oath, were dishonorable, and dictated law \nthey have no business dictating.\n  There is just one final point I would like to make, and I brought \nthis up on C-SPAN yesterday, but I have been giving it some thought. \nWhat would be a good way to really get a grip on what nature would \nindicate? And my friend knows I was there in Iowa with him after that \nridiculous decision by the Iowa Supreme Court and the three judges that \nwere up for retention that year were eliminated, as they should have \nbeen. But having read that Iowa decision back then, I was amazed that \nthe Iowa Supreme Court said this is a no evidence matter.\n  We have different standards: substantial evidence, beyond a \nreasonable doubt, and preponderance of the evidence.\n  They said this is a no evidence issue. There is no evidence of any \nkind from any source to indicate a preference for marriage between a \nman and a woman as opposed to marriage between two men or two women.\n  I think it is a very important point to say, well, I would be willing \nto put up everything I will make for the rest of my life, that it would \ngo in to a bet, because I have that much faith in what Moses said and \nwhat Jesus said.\n  Moses said that this is from God, that a marriage is when a man shall \nleave his father and mother and a woman leave her home and the two will \nbecome one flesh. That is a marriage. Jesus repeated: You know the law. \nMoses give you the law. Here is the law.\n  And He repeated the very words of Moses, and then He added a line and \nsaid: What God has joined together, let no man pull apart.\n  So I have such faith in the words of Moses and Jesus, I would be \nwilling to stake anything I make the rest of my life that my kids would \notherwise get that we could take four couples of man and woman as Moses \nand Jesus said and find a place that we could place them where they are \nisolated but they have everything they need to live and have a good, \nfull life, and then take another place, an island or such, and put four \ncouples of men, all men that love each other, and put them in such an \nisolated island situation where they have everything they need to be \ncomfortable and live, and then have an island where we have four \ncouples of women that love each other, they are going to stay together. \nAnd then let's come back however many years you want to wait to come \nback, at least 25, and you could go 200 years, and let's go back and \nsee what nature has to say about which couple it prefers to sustain a \ncivilization. Which couple is preferred by nature? You and I believe \nnature is God, as the Founders did. Which one is preferred? And I am \nwilling to bet everything that I make the rest of my life that in those \nsituations where just nature has to take its course, the couples of man \nand woman will be the one that proliferates and continues to exist and \nlive on to produce further generations.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think that is what the people of Iowa found so \noffensive that they had judges that were so completely ignorant of \nnature and nature's God that they could say that there is no evidence \nin nature or anywhere else to indicate a preference for a couple \nbetween a man and a woman.\n  I know people have raised issues, but you need to be able to see \nsomeone you love in the hospital, you bet. We ought to make sure State \nlegislatures fix that problem. If you love somebody, they are your \npartner, you care about them and they care about you, you don't want to \njust stalk anybody you want, but if there is a mutual love, admiration, \nand respect, you ought to be able to see them in a hospital. You ought \nto be able to transfer property and leave property. We ought to be able \nto address those things in the law.\n\n  But when it comes to the building block for future generations and \nfuture civilizations, I can promise you that if it is not built on \ncouples that are man and woman, as Moses and Jesus said, then that \ncivilization will not endure. It is just the law of nature.\n  I love the people of Iowa. I love the fact that they came out and let \nit be known that these judges who were educated far beyond their \nintellectual capability needed to step down because the people of Iowa \ncould figure out that there was evidence to support marriage being \nbetween a man and a woman.\n  So I appreciate the time the gentleman has yielded to me. Thank you \nfor continuing to stand for what is right, even when we have Supreme \nCourt Justices that violate the law, the Constitution, and their oath.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the \ngentleman from Texas. I appreciate his presentation here tonight and \nthe many times and many hours that he has spent on the floor. I also \nwould say for the record that the gentleman from Texas, Judge Louie \nGohmert, who had the temptation to legislate as a judge and understood \nconstitutionally how to go about that, resigned his seat as a judge and \nran for the United States Congress because he is, at heart, a \nlegislator with a deep respect and appreciation for the rule of law, \nthe statutory construction, and the Constitution itself.\n  Congressman Gohmert did come to Iowa and rode the judge bus. We \ntraveled around from town to town and gave speech after speech. There \nwere some folks to greet us there that weren't very happy with our \npresence. I don't think their mothers were very proud of them, Mr. \nSpeaker, but I think Louie's mother can be very proud of him.\n  I look across the Midwest, in the heart of the heartland, and you \ncan't think about the heart of the heartland without thinking of \nKansas. I know the gentleman that represents the vast reaches of the \nwestern at least two-thirds of Kansas, if not more, has arrived here \ntonight, and he has demonstrated his faith and his commitment to family \nin a lot of ways. I have been able to see that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. \nHuelskamp).\n  Mr. HUELSKAMP. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to visit tonight about a \nvery radical decision. I appreciate the discussion of my colleagues \nfrom Texas and Iowa outlining some of the background.\n  I was born in 1968, and what this Court would have us believe is that \n100 years before I was born, somehow secretly written into this \nconstitutional Amendment was language that invalidated laws in every \nState of the Union at that time. They want us to believe the authors of \nthis constitutional Amendment, the 14th Amendment, violated their own \nState laws at the time and just didn't know it. That is silly. That is \nutter nonsense. And only if you lived in Washington, D.C., in some \nbubble and spent your weekends or your summers vacationing in Western \nEurope, not in western Kansas where I am from, could you dream up \nsomehow the Constitution dictated that you would overrule, override, \nundo--this is five unelected black robe attorneys that are going to \ndictate to 50 million Americans that you are wrong on the definition of \nmarriage. You are wrong. 2,000 years of human history is wrong. The \nauthors of the 14th Amendment were wrong, and 31 States are wrong. Let \nme go through that. We are talking about dozens and dozens of States \nthat adopted by a vote of the people.\n  Again, let's roll back 2 years ago in the Winter decision. This same \nCourt, the exact same Court, said: Do you know what? It is up to the \nStates to decide.\n  They actually declared themselves wrong 2 years previous to that and \nset to deny the vote, the right to vote to short-circuit the democratic \nprocess. Now recognize, folks have strong opinions.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  Even the President of the United States--President Obama and I both \nagree on this point; there are strong opinions on both sides, but what \nis happening here is the folks that can't win in the State of Kansas, \ncan't win in 30 other States, have decided that they are going to try \nto find five people, five people to overrule 50 million.\n\n[[Page H5022]]\n\n  Let me give you an example. My home State of Kansas, when we passed \nour Kansas marriage amendment, which I was proud to be the author of, \n417,675 men and women voted to declare that marriage is only between a \nman and a woman. Five lawyers across the street said, You are all \nwrong--every one of them.\n  You go to the State of California, in 2008, 7,001,084 Californians \nwere declared to be wrong by five people across the street, five people \nwho have already fled town. They have left town. They won't even stay \nhere; they don't even show up in public. They go behind closed doors, \nmake up their mind, come out, and rule.\n  This is exactly what our Founders were afraid of with judicial \ntyranny of folks trying to dictate, to mandate, take their personal \nbiases, and mandate them on California, mandate them--let me pick a \nState at random--the State of Maine, 300,848 folks in Maine. How about \nin Alaska? 152,965 people that these 5 people said were wrong.\n  Total across the entire Nation, there were 51,483,777 people that \nthis court, these 5 people, not the entire court, 5 people decided you \n51,483,777 people, you are wrong. Those five were wrong 2 years ago--or \nat least one of them was wrong. They changed their mind 2 years ago.\n  If you look at the Holy Father's latest encyclical that has been much \ndiscussed, it talks about the rule of law and how if you start \nviolating laws that becomes a pattern--and here, we have a pattern of \nthis Court deciding to ignore the clear Constitution and decide to \nimpose their biases.\n  As I understand, the dissent was frightening. This is not only \nimposing their biases against traditional marriage; these five people \ndon't like marriage as 51 million Americans understand that.\n  In the dissent, it talked about not only that, they have opened the \ndoor to plural unions; and it is coming. They referenced a Court case. \nThis is where this Court is headed, and it is totally out of step, not \nonly with 51 million Americans, but with their own Court decision 2 \nyears ago, but also with the whole idea of our Constitution, that \nsomehow it is living and breathing and then five people.\n  I mean, this is the same margin by which we have had atrocious \ndecisions throughout history of this country. You go not far from \nthis--and my colleague from Iowa knows this--you go not far from here, \nyou go down, I think it is a floor down, where you had a decision by \nthe same U.S. Supreme Court, just a few different folks, decided \ncertain people didn't have rights and made a decision, an atrocious \ndecision. They were wrong. I think the Court is wrong today.\n  Again, the idea that somehow they know better is the elitism that I \nthink is driving folks crazy, and it is not just on this issue. My \ncolleague from Iowa has pointed out, again and again, it is concerns \nabout immigration, it is concerns about education, it is concerns about \nspending, about overregulation where you have folks inside a bubble in \nWashington, D.C., they read every week.\n  Every day, I guess, they read the New York Times and think they are \ndoing a great job; they read The Washington Post, but they don't read \nand listen to real Americans. Again, they travel and vacation in \nwestern Europe.\n  Many times, we see them using Court decisions in the arguments that \nhave no basis not only in our jurisprudence, but in our history and are \nusing that which is outside--I have never served in the U.S. Senate; I \nprobably never will, and I have no desire to do that, but I have got to \nwonder, when each of these five that decided to overrule 51 million, \ndid anybody ask them: Do you think you are smarter than the rest of \nAmerica? Did anybody ask them?\n  Actually, when they did ask them, they said: We can't tell you how we \nare going to rule.\n  There is no doubt that at least four, perhaps five, of these judges, \nthese attorneys, these lawyers made up their mind before they got the \ncase and said: This is the decision. Here is what we want to reach. \nHere is the outcome. Let's make something up so we can at least claim \nthere is an argument.\n  There is no logical argument; there is no legal argument. All there \nis, is the utter power, the claim that we get to dictate what the rest \nof America will accept.\n  As a pro-life American as well, we have to go 42 years ago. A court \ntried to do the same thing. And at that time, in '73, and I am guessing \nJanuary 24, 1973, I was a little tyke. Thank goodness I was born before \nthe Roe v. Wade generation. I saw some of those folks run around today, \nclaiming they were part of that generation.\n  Part of that generation, one-third of those are gone. At that time, \nthe Court said they were going to impose abortion on all of America \nthrough all 9 months. Do you know what, they walked away and said: We \ngot it all done.\n  What they found out is the American people are resilient. When they \nsee outrageous decisions like this, it might take them weeks, it might \ntake them months, it might take them a year, it might take them \ndecades, but they will be pushing back. They will be pushing back and \ndemanding that, when you put your thumb into the eye of 51 million \nAmericans, you put your thumb in the eye of 2,000 years of history, you \nput your thumb in the eye of millions of millions of children that \ndeserve a dad and a mom, a married dad and a mom, and say: Do you know \nwhat, you don't count; you don't count.\n  That is what this Court is saying. We spend billions of dollars every \nyear trying to replace a mom and a dad. Here we are today because of \nfive people across the street--again, five people deciding for the rest \nof us. This was not interpretation of the Constitution; this was just \nutter legal nonsense.\n\n  There are two ways to respond to this. One is a Federal marriage \namendment. I have introduced that a couple sessions in a row. That is \nthe way you amend the Constitution. The way the left amends the \nConstitution is they get five votes.\n  Folks have been worried about a constitutional convention; and I \nalways joke that, well, they have one every time they issue a ruling. \nThis one was a constitutional convention, utter legal fiction and \nnonsense. They know it; they all know this.\n  They are probably drinking cocktails tonight, laughing about our \ncomments on the floor saying: Well, yeah, everybody knows that.\n  So we are just under some fiction. We are trying to figure out, okay, \nhere is the decision we want; here is how we get there. A Federal \nmarriage amendment is one option, but that is difficult.\n  A second one that we have to worry about--and it was noted in the \noral arguments, it was noted in the opinion of the majority and the \nminority, because of this decision, mark my words, mark the words of \nthe dissenters--is they will use this decision to attack religious \nliberties of Americans who still believe, 51 million and plenty of \nothers, that marriage is between a man and a woman.\n  They are not going to stop. Ten years ago, they said they would stop \nat civil unions. That was all they wanted; then, well, maybe want \nsomething else. Now, it is not only do they want marriage, the next one \nwill be to say, if you disagree with me, you not only have to bake a \ncake, you have to participate in other ceremonies in other ways. It \ngoes on and on.\n  That is why I have introduced, along with others, the First Amendment \nDefense Act, which I call upon those who believe in marriage, and even \nif you don't believe in marriage but believe in the supremacy of the \nAmerican people rather than five attorneys, we bring that to the floor \nand defend the rights and liberties of Americans and the thousands, \nperhaps tens of thousands, perhaps millions of churches that say, Do \nyou know what, we don't agree with that, and we will not have the \nFederal Government imposing their way--these five people.\n  Now, I am just one. We got 435 in this body, 100 in the other body, \nand the Court just said: Do you know what, that doesn't matter.\n  That is the definition of tyranny, and from tyranny, good things do \nnot come. Our Founders understood that.\n  When you consolidate power--and as my colleague said: What difference \ndoes Congress make anymore?\n  The decision the day before suggested they get to rewrite the law, \nand the marriage decision was they get to rewrite the Constitution. \nThis is a fundamental decision on the history of our\n\n[[Page H5023]]\n\ncountry, the history of our Constitution, where the future goes, and \nthe history for and the future for our children.\n  I appreciate my colleague from Iowa, his efforts for many years. I \nwill not apologize on behalf of 417,675 Kansans who voted for marriage. \nIf those five Justices are asking them to apologize, they will not. \nThey will continue to defend God's lawful marriage, and they will do \nthat proudly and will continue to defend the State, and our U.S. \nCongress should do the same.\n  I appreciate my colleague from Iowa's leadership. These are one of \nthese things that it is not easy.\n  Congressman, I appreciate your leadership on this and not giving up \nfor the right thing.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gentleman from Kansas, but I would ask \nif he will yield to a question before he retires.\n  You mention your constitutional amendment to preserve marriage \nbetween a man and a woman. I would ask if you would be prepared to, if \nyou can, from memory, quote that into the Record here tonight.\n  Mr. HUELSKAMP. I am not prepared to quote it. I know what the vote \nwas.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. The essence of it, if you could?\n  Mr. HUELSKAMP. The essence is marriage is reserved between one man \nand one woman. It is a very simple definition, a very historical \ndefinition, and it was adopted by 417,675.\n  Do you know what was interesting? I never once told the State of \nKansas that, if five people wanted it, that was the rule of law in \nKansas--no. We had to go through an open process, have the debate, have \nthe campaign, get it through the legislature.\n  We tried 2 years in a row; it didn't happen. Finally, in 2005, it got \non the ballot. It went up. Everybody had their up and down American \nexperiment of democracy and decided.\n  I will tell you at the time--and Steve understands this, my \nCongressman--that people said: We don't need to do that. The Court \nwould never overrule that. There is nowhere that is in the \nConstitution.\n  It is very clear; marriage is between a man and a woman. That is the \nthing, marriage predates government. No matter what these five \nunelected lawyers appointed for life--with full benefits, I might add, \nand health care--outside of ObamaCare, that is another issue--no matter \nwhat they say, they are not changing what a marriage is.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. I would like to reiterate this point that as you \ndebated this in Kansas, I am one of the authors of the Iowa's Defense \nof Marriage Act. Ours says differently than I think all the other \nStates.\n  All the other States say marriage is between one man and one woman. I \ninsisted that the language say between one male and one female because \nI didn't want to be in a debate about what a man was and what a woman \nwas.\n  I didn't know that, within the last couple of months, we would be \nhaving that debate nationally, but I think our debate is more \nspecific--however, overruled by the Supreme Court of the State of Iowa.\n  I didn't get around to mentioning that we voted three of those \njustices off the bench, swept them off. There were only three up for \nretention ballot in 2010. We voted them all off of the bench.\n  I still ask this question, which is, as precise as our language is, I \ncould not divine any right to same-sex marriage in the Constitution, \nnot in the 14th Amendment, not in the Iowa Constitution that is \nmirrored to the 14th Amendment; but the Supreme Court found it anyway.\n  Is it beyond the realm of possibility that, if your amendment becomes \nincorporated into our Constitution that a more liberal court, or this \nCourt itself, might find a way to rationalize their way around no \nmatter how we write it?\n  Mr. HUELSKAMP. That is absolutely true. I mean, where can they end \nup?\n  Again, when it becomes an issue of bias, and our colleague from Texas \ntalked about that, two justices that clearly demonstrated bias in the \nState of Kansas, that would be a basis for not ruling on the case and \nperhaps not even being on a court.\n  I mean, those are illegal. I am not an attorney, but we recognize \nthat would be highly unethical in the State of Kansas, but apparently, \nthat is the way you get things done nationally, to impose your will.\n  One thing that, again, I mention in passing that we can't forget is \nwhat this does for our children, what this does for our children by \nattempting to fundamentally destroy and redefine marriage.\n  I have been asked: Well, how does it affect your marriage?\n  When you make marriage anything, you devalue what really is marriage. \nThe last thing we need to be doing in this society is devaluing \nfamilies, devaluing marriage, and attacking the basis of our society. \nOur Founders understood that.\n  I don't know what these Justices, what their history was growing up, \nwhat led them to change their mind and impose that on the rest of \nAmerica; but that is why our Founders said: Here is the Constitution. \nYou can interpret it, but you shall go no further.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. They understand that in Kansas, they understand \nthat in Iowa, and I suspect they understand that in Florida.\n  As I look over, I see the gentleman from Florida--I am looking at two \ndoctors here--the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).\n  I thank the gentleman from Kansas for coming down tonight, as well as \nthe gentlemen from Florida and Texas, and the other folks that might \nshow up.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. \nYoho).\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Iowa, Kansas, and \nTexas for coming down here to share your thoughts on this important \nitem.\n  Mr. Huelskamp, you brought up about diluting the institution of \nmarriage, and if we keep going down this path, it will be worth \nnothing.\n  If we keep diluting the value of our money, it is worth nothing; and \nif we keep diluting the value of the things that have made our society \ngreat, the nucleus family, if we keep doing that, it becomes more \nwashed out.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  Roughly 2 weeks ago the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision on Obergefell v. \nHodges demonstrated yet again the highest court in the land legislating \nfrom the bench.\n  The ruling was disappointing not only for the fact that the court had \nnot four States to redefine marriage, but even more so because it \nremoves millions of American from the democratic process of choosing \nfor themselves who and what defines marriage.\n  I personally and millions--you brought up 51 million--hold a \ntraditional view of marriage between one man and one woman. And I am \nproud to say that I have been married to my wife Carolyn for over 40 \nyears. God bless her because we know that is a tough job.\n  However, the Constitution grants people, the voters, the ability to \ndecide whether or not to recognize same-sex marriage.\n  Chief Justice Roberts in his dissent made a valid point, which I am \nsure is shared by many Americans. He said those who founded our country \nwould not recognize the majority's conception of the judicial role.\n  And then he continued: They certainly would not have been satisfied \nby a system empowering judges to override policies, judgments, so long \nas they do so after a quiet extensive discussion.\n  With this type of legislation from the bench, what is the point of \nthe States' rights. I think that is what this gets down to because 30 \nStates wanted to define and have the right, according to the 10th \nAmendment, that it is a State's rights issue.\n  If you live in that State and they decide what marriage is and you \ndon't like it, you have the freedom to move or challenge us through the \nState system.\n  I think it is a sad day in America when we have to, as a country, \nredefine who we are as a Nation, we have to redefine what marriage is, \nan institution that has been around and ordained by God for over \nthousands of years, 2,000-years plus, to come down to this point in our \nsociety.\n  We have got a book that we have lived by, and I am going to hold this \nup for the viewers. This is, in total, the Declaration of Independence \nand the Constitution. And you can see it is a very thin book. It is not \nepic in volume, but, yet, it is an epic in ideology\n\n[[Page H5024]]\n\nof what a nation stands for, a nation of laws.\n  We have the three branches of government. I have been up here for \n2\\1/2\\ years, and what I hear over and over again is we are in a \nconstitutional crisis.\n  And being in Congress for the last 2\\1/2\\ years, I see a lot of \ndysfunctionality. And if we don't do our job, you get other branches of \ngovernment fulfilling that job and overstepping their boundaries.\n  I agree with Justice Antonin Scalia when he stated in his dissent: A \nsystem of government that makes the people subordinate to a committee \nof nonelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy.\n  Wow. Those are powerful words. A system of government that makes the \npeople subordinate to a committee of nine unelected lawyers does not \ndeserve to be called a democracy.\n  We cannot allow our Constitution to be eroded, and I will continue to \nfight for the States' rights and stop this continued Federal power \ngrab.\n  I look at Justice Roberts, some of the dissension in his ruling, and \nRoberts forcibly criticized the majority: Sidestepping the democratic \nprocess and declaring that same-sex couples have the right to marry \nwhen, in his view, such a right has no basis in the Constitution. The \ncourt's decision, he complained, orders the transformation of a social \ninstitution that has formed the basis of human societies for millennia.\n  We are redefining that.\n  And then he goes on to the Kalahari bushmen and to the Han Chinese, \nthe Carthaginians, and the Aztecs. Just who, Roberts laments, do we \nthink we are?\n  The other three justices echoed Roberts' sentiment, sometimes in even \nmore strident terms.\n  Justice Scalia characterized the decision as a judicial putsch and \nsuggested that, before he signed on to an opinion like the majority, I \nwould hide my head in a bag. This is from our Supreme Court justices.\n  I think it is a sad state of affairs that, in the three branches of \ngovernment, that we are out of balance.\n  We, as Member of Congress, are the most powerful branch. It is the \nway our Founders set our country up. It is the longest living democracy \nand constitutional free republic in the world. The reason for that is \nthe checks and balances.\n  I would like, Mr. Speaker, to say to you and to my colleagues that \nour three branches of government are seriously out of balance.\n  And at times during human history, when the government oversteps its \nboundaries, whether in total or in the different branches, and they \noverstep the boundaries of the Constitution, it is not only our duty, \nbut it is our responsibility as Americans and as the people's House in \nthe United States of Congress to stand up and rein in government and \nhold those other branches accountable.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the House floor to \nmake sure that we are the ones that stand up and say: Enough is enough. \nWe have had enough.\n  Mr. KING of IOWA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the fine gentleman from \nFlorida for his presentation, his understanding of this, and his \nconviction on constitutional issue after constitutional issue, \nincluding reminding us this is a constitutional republic that we live \nin.\n  I would like to now recognize the husband of Roxanne Babin, the \ngentleman from Texas whom I get to count as a good friend here in this \nCongress, who has stood up on principle time and again.\n  Mr. Speaker, I recognize that we have 8 minutes left in our time. So \nwe will try to judge it accordingly.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the gentleman from Iowa \nand good friend. I appreciate recognizing my wife in the gallery as \nwell.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding time, and I thank him for his \nleadership on this very important issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand here today deeply and bitterly disappointed and \nsaddened by the recent actions of five unelected U.S. Supreme Court \njustices and their decision to defy the will of the American people and \ndisregard the rule of law.\n  As a strong defender of traditional marriage and State sovereignty, I \nbelieve it is absolutely wrong that five unelected members of the U.S. \nSupreme Court overruled tens of millions of Americans, including many \nin my home State, the State of Texas, who voted to enact State statutes \nand State constitutional amendments to define marriage as between one \nman and one woman.\n  Under this ruling, five members of the Supreme Court invalidated the \nvotes of over 50 million Americans. That is deeply disturbing and \nalarming. And the dissenting justices raised this very concern.\n  Traditional marriage has been under assault as courts and some state \nlegislatures have sought to both redefine marriage as something other \nthan between a man and a woman.\n  Most seriously, they are now taking action to penalize and \ndiscriminate against those who have religious and conscience \nconvictions against the redefinition of marriage.\n  Over 30 States and tens of millions of Americans acted through the \nlegislative and election process to keep marriage between one man and \none woman within their respective States.\n  Unfortunately, various courts took it upon themselves to sidestep the \ndemocratic process and to silence those voices with their reprehensible \nactivist decisions.\n  By circumventing the votes of American citizens, the Supreme Court's \nsweeping decision now sets the Government on a collision course with \nreligious freedoms guaranteed in the First Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution.\n  Americans with religious conviction will now be forced into a \nposition of great uncertainty. If their religious beliefs conflict with \nsame-sex marriage, they may lose their business license and they could \nbe subjected to prosecution or even litigation.\n  Some are even calling for ending tax exemption status for any church \nor religious organization that opposes same-sex marriage. This is \nalarming and it demands action.\n  We have seen the attacks led by IRS bureaucrats like Lois Lerner on \nconservative groups in the past, and we can expect the same under these \ndiscussions. As elected leaders, we cannot and must not back down.\n  We have an obligation to fight for the religious protection of our \nconstituencies against such judicial activism and the consequences that \nwill come from it. I have met with local pastors in Texas over the past \nfew weeks, and they are very, very concerned about this ruling.\n  Congress wants to take immediate action to restore each States' \nability to determine their own marriage laws and to protect individuals \nand institutions with deeply held religious convictions regarding \ntraditional marriage to ensure that they do not face discrimination \nbecause of these convictions.\n  As an unwavering advocate for protecting the traditional marriage, I \nstrongly support and have cosponsored a constitutional amendment to \ndefine marriage as between one man and one woman.\n  We should also pass the First Amendment Defense Act to protect \nchurches, Christian schools and colleges and business owners from being \ncoerced by the government to act against their religious convictions in \nregards to acceptance of same-sex marriage.\n  In the 36th Congressional District of Texas, where I have spent my \nentire life, people are very distressed over the Supreme Court's \nredefinition of marriage and its impact on their ability to freely \npractice their faith. They realize, as do I, that, under the Supreme \nCourt's decision, things are going to get worse as this collision \ncourse is set in motion.\n  We will see more lawsuits spring up that challenge the faith of \naverage American families who hold their beliefs dearly, as well as \ntheir churches, schools, and charities.\n  Under such uncertainty, I stand in strong solidarity with my \nconstituents, our local and State leaders, and the like-minded \ncolleagues that I have had the great privilege of listening to tonight \nand having your time yielded to me. I serve with you folks in Congress \nthat we will never back down on this issue.\n  I will work tirelessly on all fronts to defend traditional marriage \nand the\n\n[[Page H5025]]\n\nprotection of religious liberties granted under our U.S. Constitution.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, and \nI appreciate very much his commitment to many causes, especially this \ncause.\n  I recognize the gentleman from California that has arrived, and I \npoint out that we are down to 3 minutes.\n  I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa) to hear what \nhe might have to say about this topic.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Iowa. Thank \nyou for a little bit of time on this.\n  It is indeed something I know a lot of people are grieving over with \nthe Supreme Court decision, first on the morality issue.\n  Those of us that believe in the Bible, that believe in God, feel that \nthe Bible is pretty clear on this subject of homosexuality and the \napplication of marriage.\n  But even more so, beyond that, it is a choice. People can choose to \nfollow that path of biblical values or they can choose not. They will \nmake that decision, and they will be held accountable for that decision \none way or the other.\n  So what I am looking at is that the court, in this ruling, has \nusurped the process of the American people in the legislative process \nand replaced it with the opinions of five court members.\n  Where that ruling was on Friday, the following Monday, the court \nupheld that the people would draw their own lines in Arizona and, by \nextension, California.\n  So the people's voice is heard on district lines as seen by the \ncourt, but the people's voice is ignored when California passed two \ndifferent initiatives to uphold marriage.\n  So there is not even consistency on the court on what the \nConstitution is supposed to mean on the people's voice, and that is \nvery troublesome.\n  It indicates to me that we are not far from a constitutional crisis \nwith the way this court usurps the people's voice and the legislative \nprocess.\n  So I appreciate the time from the gentleman here tonight. Thank you \nfor your leadership on this important issue.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, we have heard from a list of solid \nconstitutionalists here this evening that are not only committed to \ntheir oath to support and defend the Constitution, but, also, each \ncommitted to their own marriage throughout these years that, if we \nadded them up, it is well over a century of us together. Marilyn and I \nare 43 years.\n  I am steeped in the Constitution and the rule of law. I have great \nrespect for the Supreme Court of United States, but I have greater \nrespect for the supreme law of the land, which is the Constitution of \nthe United States.\n  If the law doesn't mean what it says and if the Constitution can have \ndivined within it certain rights that are imagined only by this court \nand not imagined by the people that ratified the very language that \nthey are ruling upon, then what have we come to?\n  I believe that this decision, this Obergefell v. Hodges decision on \nmarriage, right behind the decision of King v. Burwell--that, if the \ncourt continues down this path, Mr. Speaker, they will render our \nConstitution an artifact of history and this country will not respect a \ncourt that doesn't respect the language and the text of the \nConstitution.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  We are here to reject and criticize the decision of the Supreme Court \nthat imposes same-sex marriage on all of America and requires each of \nthe States to recognize with reciprocity those marriages. That is a \ndecision this Congress couldn't make for the American people, and it is \na decision that should be left up to the States.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will submit that I am one who is prepared to support \nthe simple elimination of civil marriage because this government has \ngotten into it so far that holy matrimony will not be protected from \nthe further litigation in this Court unless we separate it from civil \nmarriage itself.\n  The next litigation that comes will be that that sues our priests and \nour pastors to command them to conduct same-sex marriages at their \naltars, and that is where the First Amendment freedom of religion comes \ninto conflict with the distorted view of the 14th Amendment which is \npart of this Obergefell, and that, Mr. Speaker, will be a \nconstitutional crisis.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H5025-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5025-H5027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          A MATTER OF HISTORY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Russell). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I heard earlier discussions from my \nfriends--and I literally mean that, friends; I am not being sarcastic, \nthey are friends--talking about the shootings. It sounds like they were \ncertainly racist shootings in South Carolina when an evil man shot \nbrothers and sisters of mine as fellow Christians.\n  Now there is this big race to go after the Confederate flag. So, Mr. \nSpeaker, I saw this article by Daniel Greenfield and felt like this was \nworth noting, historically, information that Mr. Greenfield has \npublished this month. Just touching on parts of the article--I started \nto say ``he,'' but it says ``Daniel.'' Maybe it is a man, maybe it \nisn't. I don't want to be biased based on a name.\n  But anyway, in his article he says, talking about President Obama: \n``When Obama condemned Christianity for the Crusades, only a thousand \nyears too late, in attendance was the Foreign Minister of Sudan, a \ncountry that practices slavery and genocide. President Obama could have \ntaken time out from his rigorous denunciation of the Middle Ages to \nspeak truth to the emissary of a Muslim Brotherhood regime whose leader \nis wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against \nhumanity, but our moral liberals spend too much time romanticizing \nactual slaver cultures.\n  ``It's a lot easier for our President to get in his million-dollar \nCadillac with 5-inch thick bulletproof windows, a ride Boss Hogg could \nonly envy''--Boss Hogg being a reference to the name of the show \n``Dukes of Hazzard''--``and chase down a couple of good ole boys than \nit is to condemn a culture that committed genocide in our own time, not \nin 1099, and that keeps slaves today, not in 1815.\n  ``Even while the Duke boys''--again, references to ``Dukes of \nHazzard''--``the Duke boys were chased through Georgia, President Obama \nappeared at an Iftar dinner, an event at which Muslims emulate \nMohammed, who had more slaves than Robert E. Lee. There are no slaves \nin Arlington House today, but in the heartlands of Islam, from Saudi \nmansions to ISIS dungeons, there are still slaves, laboring, beaten, \nbought, sold, raped, and disposed of in Mohammed's name.\n  ``Slavery does not exist under the Confederate flag eagerly being \npulled down. It does exist under the black and green flags of Islam \nrising over mosques in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and America today.\n  ``In our incredibly tolerant culture, it has become politically \nincorrect to watch the General Lee''--talking about a car--``jump a \nfence or a barn, but paying tribute to the culture that sent the slaves \nhere and that still practices slavery is the culturally sensitive thing \nto do. In 2015, slavery is no longer freedom, but it certainly is \ntolerance.''\n  The article goes on: ``Slavery was an indigenous African and Middle \nEastern practice, not to mention an indigenous practice in America \namong indigenous cultures.''\n  The author here is talking about, for those who don't understand \nindigenous cultures, he is talking about Native Americans. There were \nNative Americans that had slaves, just like in Africa and Middle \nEastern practices.\n  The article goes on: ``If justice demands that we pull down the \nConfederate flag everywhere, even from the top of the orange car \nsailing through the air in the freeze frame of an old television show, \nthen what possible justification is there for all the faux Aztec \nknickknacks? Even the worst Southern plantation owners didn't tear out \nthe hearts of their slaves on top of pyramids.''\n  This is a reference that obviously in history we understand Aztecs \ndid pull out hearts of slaves that they sacrificed on top of pyramids.\n  Anyway, the article says: ``The romanticization of Aztec brutality \nplays a crucial role in the mythology of Mexican nationalist groups \nlike La\n\n[[Page H5026]]\n\nRaza promoting the Reconquista of America today.''\n  I wasn't aware of that, but the article says: ``Black nationalists \nromanticize the slave-holding civilization of Egypt despite the fact \nthat the narrative of the liberation of the Hebrew slaves from bondage \nplayed a crucial role in the end of slavery in America. The endless \nstories about the `Amazons' of the African kingdom of Dahomey neatly \nfit into the leftist myth of a peaceful matriarchal Africa disrupted by \nEuropean colonialism, but Dahomey ran on slavery.\n  ``The `Amazons' helped capture slaves for the Atlantic slave trade. \nWhite and Black liberals are romanticizing the very culture that \ncaptured and sold their forefathers into slavery. 'In Dahomey,' the \nfirst major mainstream Black musical was about African Americans moving \nto Dahomey. By then, the French had taken over old Dahomey and together \nwith the British had put an end to the slave trade.\n  ``The French dismantled the `Amazons' and freed many of Dahomey's \nslaves only for the idiot descendants of both groups to romanticize the \nlast noble stand of Dahomey fighting for the right to export Black \nslaves to Cuba and condemn the European liberators who put a stop to \nthat atrocity.\n  ``If we crack down on romanticizing Dixie, how can we possibly \njustify romanticizing Dahomey or the Aztecs or Mohammed?\n  ``If slavery and racism are wrong,'' which clearly they are, the \narticle says. ``If slavery and racism are wrong, then they are wrong \nacross the board . . . Dahomey and Mohammed had bought, sold, and \nkilled enough Black lives to be frowned upon.\n  ``If we go back far enough in time, most cultures kept slaves. The \nRomans and Greeks certainly did. That's why the meaningful standard is \nnot whether a culture ever had slaves, but whether it has slaves today. \nIf we are going to eradicate the symbols of every culture that ever \ntraded in slaves, there will be few cultural symbols that will escape \nunscathed. But the academics who insist on cultural relativism in 19th \ncentury Africa reject it in 19th century South Carolina, thereby \nrevealing their own racism.\n  ``And so instead of fighting actual modern-day slavery in Africa and \nthe Middle East, social justice warriors are swarming to invade Hazzard \nCounty.\n  ``Most of the cultures of the past that we admire, respect, and even \nromanticize had slaves, but when we look back at their achievements and \neven try to forge some connection to them, it does not have to mean an \nendorsement of their worst habits. This is a concept that liberals \nunderstood but that leftists reject.\n  ``The recent hysteria reminds us that the nuanced reason of the \nformer has been replaced by the irrational, destructive impulses of the \nlatter. The left is so obsessed with creating utopias of the future \nthat, like the Taliban or ISIS, it destroys the relics of past \nsocieties that do not measure up to its impossible standards. And then \nit replaces them with imaginary utopias of the past that never existed.\n  ``As Ben Carson pointed out, we will not get rid of racism by banning \nthe Confederate flag. Even when it is used at its worst by the likes of \nDylann Storm Roof, it is a symptom, not the problem. Roof was not \nradicalized by the dead Confederacy, but by the racial tensions kicked \noff''--I am not sure I want to say that.\n  But, anyway, interesting take, but all of this talk about eliminating \nany references or uses of things that remind us of the horrors, the \nabomination that slavery was in the United States should be eliminated. \nThat is what we are hearing.\n  And so, Mr. Speaker, in thinking about that--and the suggestion was \nmade by my friend, another judge from Texas, Judge Carter, so I had to \ngo look it up. I think there is an entity that was so evil in \nsupporting slavery, in fighting against civil rights, in fighting \nagainst the Christian brother that Martin Luther King, Jr., was, \nfighting against those who wanted equality that the Constitution \nguaranteed, we ought to look at those symbols, and we ought to look at \nwhat they stood for and perhaps ban any political organization from \nparticipating in Congress for upholding the abomination that slavery \nwas to this country.\n  So I was able to get a copy of this platform, this political platform \nfrom 1856. This is the number one plank in the platform of this hideous \npolitical organization, and this is what they believed and they \nasserted.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  I am reading from the number one plank in their party platform: \n``That Congress has no power under the Constitution, to interfere with \nor control the domestic institutions of the several States, and that \nsuch States are the sole and proper judges of everything appertaining \nto their own affairs, not prohibited by the Constitution''--then, here \nit goes--``that all efforts of the abolitionists, or others, made to \ninduce Congress to interfere with questions of slavery, or to take \nincipient steps in relation thereto, are calculated to lead to the most \nalarming and dangerous consequences; and that all such efforts have an \ninevitable tendency to diminish the happiness of the people and \nendanger the stability and permanency of the Union, and ought not to be \ncountenanced by any friend of our political institutions.''\n  That was the official number one plank in this hideous political \norganization's platform from 1856.\n  They go on. Here is number three: ``That by the uniform application \nof this Democratic principle to the organization of territories, and to \nthe admission of new States, with or without domestic slavery, as they \nmay elect--the equal rights, of all the States will be preserved \nintact.''\n  They are saying they want to preserve slavery in any State that wants \nto have it.\n  They finish up by saying: ``Resolved, That we recognize the right of \nthe people of all the Territories, including Kansas and Nebraska, \nacting through the legally and fairly expressed will of a majority of \nactual residents, and whenever the number of their inhabitants \njustifies it, to form a constitution, with or without domestic \nslavery.''\n  It sounds like something the Ku Klux Klan would have done. They are \ndemanding that they have the right to have slavery, the worst \nabomination in the history of America, that even Thomas Jefferson put \nin his original draft of the Declaration of Independence that it was a \nhorrible grievance against the King of England for allowing slavery, \nthis horrible abomination, from ever starting in America.\n  Well, they didn't learn their lesson. This hideous political \norganization's platform in 1860 said they were adopting all the things \nthat they had said in 1856 about the right to keep this heinous, \noffensive slavery intact.\n  They include this, though, additionally in their platform of 1860: \n``Resolved, That the enactment of the State Legislatures to defeat the \nfaithful execution of the Fugitive Slave Law, are hostile in character, \nsubversive of the Constitution, and revolutionary in their effect.''\n  They want to make it clear that not only were they avid supporters of \nslavery in America, but that it was their right to own people in \nAmerica. This disgusting political organization also found the fugitive \nslave law to be, as they say, hostile in character, subversive of the \nConstitution.\n  Again, this sounds like something from the Ku Klux Klan. Will we want \nthe Ku Klux Klan participating here on the floor when this is their \nhistory? It is the worst abomination.\n  The horrors of slavery finally were overcome, largely by abolitionist \nchurches and pastors, people who believed that it had to stop, that \npeople couldn't be treating brothers and sisters in such a way.\n  It took the life work and even laying down of the life of Martin \nLuther King, Jr., to push us to the level where brothers and sisters, \nas he was in Christ, could treat brothers and sisters as equal people. \nThat is where we should have been all along. It is where he was pushing \nus to be against the hideous type things from 1856 and 1860.\n  If we are going to eliminate everything that reminds us of a hideous \npast that supported slavery and the oppression, the horrors that \nslavery entailed--breaking up of families, molestations, the beatings, \njust the horrors--John Quincy Adams was right. God could not continue \nto bless America while we were treating brothers and sisters by putting \nthem in chains and bondage.\n  He was right. So many abolitionists were right. Daniel Webster was \nright.\n\n[[Page H5027]]\n\nRepublicans that stood up to these hideous political organizations were \nright. There should be no place for slavery in America.\n  If we are going to have a complete cleansing of this country of \nanything, any symbol, then this platform from the Democratic Party in \n1856 and 1860--and it wasn't the Ku Klux Klan; it sounded like it, and \nthere were a lot of Democrats who were members of the Ku Klux Klan. I \ndon't know that you can find Republicans that were members of the Ku \nKlux Klan, but there were certainly plenty of Democrats that were.\n  I think it is time not for the Washington Redskins to change their \nname, but for the Democratic Party to change its name because all you \nhave to do is go online and look up the history of the Democratic \nParty. It is one of oppressing African Americans. It is one of \nsupporting slavery and the horrors that occurred in the United States, \neven up through the 20th century on into the 1860s.\n  I think we had a Democratic Senator who was a member of the Ku Klux \nKlan. I think he has got a lot of things named after him. I hope that \nmy friends who will ultimately want to change the name of the \nDemocratic Party because of its horrible history will also want to \nchange the names of things that were named after somebody that was a \nbig supporter of the Ku Klux Klan.\n  The fact is the families of the victims in Charleston, South \nCarolina--brothers and sisters in Christ, for those of us who are \nChristians--wow, did they send a powerful message. I didn't see or hear \nthem demanding the Confederate flag be taken down. I heard them forgive \nthe one--the evil, horrible person--that committed such a vile act on \npeople at a prayer meeting, of all things.\n  They showed the kind of love Jesus showed, the kind of love that was \nembodied by Father Damien, whose statue is right down at the southern \nentrance of this building beneath us right now. The plaque on his \nstatue--God forgive anybody who would ever want to change this, because \nit is so powerful--are the words of Jesus in John 15:13: ``Greater love \nhath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''\n  Jesus did that; Father Damien did that; Martin Luther King, Jr., did \nthat--many have so that we could have the freedoms we have today, many \nof our American military forces have, not just for your freedom, but \nfreedom around the world.\n  Let's recognize the good with which we have been blessed. Let's stop \nthe name calling, the race baiting, the division politics. Let's fuss \nand disagree over issues, but let's quit trying to tear this country \napart because of things of the past in which not one person in this \nroom would have taken part in.\n  Let's work together. Fuss, disagree, push for what we believe is best \nfor the country, but let's stop the race baiting because, if we are \nreally going to go there, we have got to end the Democratic Party. Its \nhistory is so interwoven with starting, keeping, trying to push slavery \non beyond anything that it should have been through.\n  We don't need to end the Democratic Party. We just need to work \ntogether in the present. That doesn't mean we can't disagree. We do all \nthe time. Let's stop the race baiting. Let's look at the example of the \nvictims' families in Charleston, South Carolina, and say: Wow, there \nare incredible believers and followers of Jesus Christ. That is \nsomebody we can emulate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H5027-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Payne (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \nattending a funeral in district.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/house-section/article/H5027-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Karen L.
