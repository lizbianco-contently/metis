The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, in our fast-changing world, the global \neconomy looms large. America has long been the leader in promoting \nfreer and fairer trade, promoting the economy at home while \nstrengthening ties overseas. The current issue that is before us now \ndeals with a trade promotion authority and the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, an agreement with 12 countries, representing almost 40 \npercent of the global economy.\n  After the recent bipartisan vote in the Senate on the trade promotion \nauthority and related package, attention now shifts to the House where \nwe are likely to be voting on this in the next couple of weeks. Many \nconfuse support for the trade promotion authority with the TPP, the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership. They are two distinct items.\n  The Trans-Pacific Partnership is an ongoing series of negotiations \nwhich has yet to be concluded. Indeed, one of the reasons we are \nlooking at trade promotion authority now, establishing the rules of the \ngame and how Congress will evaluate and process it, is to make sure \nthat we get into the final stages.\n  Trade promotion authority historically, something we have done \nrepeatedly in the past, provides for Congress to vote on an up-or-down \nbasis on a trade agreement once it is finalized. This is what happens \nin negotiations routinely in the United States, an up-or-down vote. I \nfind it somewhat ironic that some of my friends in organized labor \nthink that it somehow should be negotiated in Congress, that it ought \nto be subject to amendment in Congress. Yet there is no labor union \nthat I am aware of that has its contracts voted piecemeal. Members \naren't allowed to amend. It is up or down, and that is what is \nnecessary to be able to reach a conclusion with these negotiations.\n  Some are demanding that Members of Congress oppose an agreement that \nis not yet completed. Well, I, for one, am not going to support or \noppose an agreement until I can see what is in it and until the \nagreement is finalized. Until it is finished, I am going to continue to \nwork to make it as strong as possible.\n  I have been working on provisions to strengthen enforcement, \nestablishing a trust fund to make sure that provisions in trade \nagreements have the resources to make sure that they are, in fact, \nenforced, such as having provisions known as the Green 301 that has \ngreater strength to be able to enforce environmental provisions. This \nmakes a difference for my community.\n  Oregon's small- and medium-sized businesses, family farmers, \nwinemakers, bike manufacturers say that enhanced trade authority is \ncritical to creating more jobs at home and increased value for \ncustomers. That is something that gets lost in this debate because, as \na result of our policies promoting freer trade between countries, \nAmericans have seen their standard of living increase. Americans today \nare paying less for clothing, less for food, less for electronics as a \nresult of the benefits of these agreements. Some estimates say it is \nabout $8,000 per family.\n  Well, we will see what the current trade agreement looks like when it \nis completed. As I mentioned, the trade promotion authority is \nnecessary to reach the final stages.\n  Thanks to the efforts of my friend and my constituent Senator Ron \nWyden, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, this trade \npromotion authority that we will be dealing with makes it mandatory \nthat everybody in the country will be able to look at the final \nagreement for 60 days before the President even signs it, and then it \nwill be public for another 90 days--5 months, essentially--before \nCongress will vote up or down on whether or not it is worthy of our \nsupport.\n  Well, I will do what I have done in trade agreements in the past. I \nwill consider each element with the same principles: Is this package \ngood for the people I represent in Oregon? Does it align with our \nvalues? Will it be a net positive for areas that I care about, like \nlabor and the environment? More fundamentally, are we going to be \nbetter off with an agreement or with none?\n\n[[Page H3646]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/house-section/article/H3646-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               PUTTING A STOP TO MISMANAGEMENT AT THE VA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, in 2014, Congress passed legislation with \nbroad bipartisan support to improve access to and the quality of care \nfor veterans in response to the nationwide scandal over manipulated \nwait times at the VA.\n  The Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and \nTransparency Act created a 3-year program to allow veterans to seek \ncare from private providers if they live too far from a VA facility or \ncannot otherwise get an appointment within 14 days.\n  It also gave the VA Secretary the authority to fire senior executives \nfor poor performance and required a top-to-bottom study of the entire \nDepartment to be completed within 1 year of enactment.\n  When government failure is exposed and legislation aimed at restoring \naccountability is enacted, it makes sense that action would be swift \nand immediate, people would be fired, and wrongs would begin to be made \nright. Unfortunately, that has not been the case at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs.\n  While there are as many as 1,000 employees that could potentially \nface disciplinary actions, the VA has punished a total of eight for \ninvolvement in the scandal. We continue to hear about unacceptable \npatient wait times, unanswered benefit inquiries, patient safety \nconcerns, medical malpractice, flagrant mismanagement, infighting, \ncorruption, and years of construction delays that total millions of \ndollars.\n  Frustration, anger, outrage, Mr. Speaker, these are just a few of the \nwords that describe how I and other Americans felt when we read these \nlatest stories about problems within the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. The continued ineptitude at the highest levels of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs is simply unacceptable. It is past time \nto put an end to this agencywide pattern of mismanagement.\n  Last month, the House continued its efforts to fulfill the commitment \nwe have made to those who have served by approving several pieces of \nlegislation to further improve accountability at the VA.\n  We also passed legislation to increase access to education programs \nfor veterans and to encourage small businesses to hire them. While it \nwill never be enough, this legislation is a positive step forward in \nmeeting our responsibility to America's veterans.\n  However, Congress cannot transform the VA alone. It is the \nPresident's responsibility to ensure changes are made within the agency \nand that employees are held accountable for their actions. \nUnfortunately, that is not happening.\n  Every day, we hear only more stories about further misdeeds. \nPresident Obama must commit to reforming the VA with more than just lip \nservice. America's veterans deserve a meaningful, decisive plan to \nright the many wrongs.\n  As a country, we are uniquely blessed. We live in a nation where each \nof us has the possibility of nearly limitless fulfillment and \nprosperity in the world's finest democracy. That unparalleled freedom \nand opportunity has been made available to us because of the profound \nsacrifices of those who have fought for and defended our Nation.\n  America's veterans deserve better than the inexcusable misconduct and \nneglect that we have seen over the last few years at the VA. It is \ncritically important that we provide high-quality, timely care for \nthose who have sacrificed so much to our country.\n  Republicans are committed to that principle and to the veterans of \nthis country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/house-section/article/H3646-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3646-H3647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      URBAN FLOODING AWARENESS ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress continue to debate \nwhether or not climate change is real, Americans are paying the price. \nTo the climate doubters that I serve with, I will remind them that \nthere are over 200 peer-reviewed scientific studies that conclude that \nclimate change is real and that man contributes to it, and there are \nzero peer-reviewed scientific studies that say the opposite.\n  Climate change often brings images to mind of melting icecaps and \nrising sea levels, but the effects of climate change are being felt \nevery day by people around the country. Climate change is causing even \nmore destructive storms which, when combined with our aging \ninfrastructure, is resulting in cities around the country being \npummeled by urban flooding.\n  A little more than 2 years ago, residents in my district endured \ntheir second 100-year flood in a mere 3 years. A 100-year storm means \nthat there is a 1 percent chance that a storm of that magnitude will \nhappen every year, but folks in Chicago are experiencing these storms \nwith greater intensity and frequency.\n  The morning after the rains bombarded Chicago in 2013, I visited \nnumerous community members and their homes. The damage I saw was \ndevastating: thousands of homes and businesses flooded; tons of \ncarpeting, furniture, and memories are ruined; businesses shattered; \nand entrepreneurs' dreams crushed, along with millions of dollars in \ndamages.\n  Throughout the region, we saw the closure of schools, libraries, and \neven hospitals were forced to relocate patients. That kind of \ndevastation cannot be ignored. Our constituents cannot be ignored.\n  In Chicago, over the past century, we have seen countless storms that \nhave caused pipes to back up into houses and dump upwards of 1.5 inches \nof rain in a single day. What is more, rains of more than 2.5 inches a \nday are expected to increase another 50 percent in the next 20 years.\n  The National Climate Assessment, released by the Obama administration \nlast year, predicted that the frequency and intensity of the Midwest's \nheaviest downpours will more than double over the next 100 years. That \nmeans even more trouble for our Nation's already deteriorating \ninfrastructure and the cities around the country that rely on that \ninfrastructure to keep them safe. Storm drains are outdated; sewers are \ninadequate, and families are at risk.\n  Whether it is because of flooded pipes or the lack of permeable \nsurfaces in our cities, our constituents are paying the prices. \nThousands of households in America are affected every year by urban \nflooding, yielding catastrophic economic, environmental, and social \ndamage in some of our country's largest cities. Basements with water \ndamage decrease property values by an estimated 10 to 25 percent.\n  But the impacts don't end there. Chronically damp houses can cause \nrespiratory problems and higher insurance costs. Additionally, almost \ntwo out of five small businesses cannot open after experiencing a \nflooding disaster. Urban flooding erodes streams and riverbeds and \ndegrades the quality of our drinking water sources and the health of \nour aquatic ecosystems.\n  It is time we come up with a national response to this growing \nproblem. That is why I am proud to introduce the Urban Flooding \nAwareness Act. This legislation will finally create a definition of \nurban flooding to be used when designing flood maps and will require a \nfirst-of-its-kind study to analyze the costs associated with urban \nflooding and develop solutions. It would also help us better protect \ndownstream communities from the flooding impacts of development in \nupstream areas.\n  Existing regulatory and policy mechanisms are not adequate for this \ntask. It is time we develop new strategies. By identifying the most \neffective and economical remedies to urban flooding, we are better \npreparing our communities to defend themselves against the devastation \ncaused by increasingly intense weather.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  And investing in real solutions to this problem now is the only way \nto avoid higher costs down the road. We can learn from our successes \nand investigate innovative new strategies for funding crucial new \nprograms that eliminate flood risk and damage. Our cities need the best \ntools available if they are going to survive this era of supersized \nstorms.\n\n[[Page H3647]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/house-section/article/H3647-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            THE RAINS OF MAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the rains came down and the floods \ncame up. And although Texas did not receive Noah's 40 days and 40 \nnights of rain, the recent 10 days of rain were of Biblical \nproportions.\n  The whole State received the incessant rain. And about the time we \nthought it was all over on Saturday morning, it all happened again \nSaturday night, flooding many of the same homes and communities \nthroughout the State.\n  In Houston, six, so far, have died. Statewide, there are now 24 \ndeaths. Eleven are still missing in Hays County when the Blanco River \nrose so fast at night it trapped people in over 200 resort homes that \nwere on the river--homes that eventually washed away. Many of Texas' \nrivers--the Trinity, the Colorado, the Brazos, and the San Jacinto--\nrose at rapid record rates and are still out of their banks.\n  Weather experts, Mr. Speaker, said so much rain fell in Texas in May \nthat it was enough moisture to cover the entire State in 8 inches of \nwater. That is a lot of rain. Seventy counties have been designated \ndisaster areas. But the rainbow news, Mr. Speaker, is that many, many \nvoluntarily helped their neighbors and strangers survive the troubled \nwaters of the floods.\n  Here is just one example. The hard rain in Dallas flooded the Trinity \nRiver. Dallas is in north Texas. The Trinity River flows south down to \nsoutheast Texas near Houston, and the added rain in southeast Texas had \nthe Trinity River the size of the Mississippi River.\n  As the river rose in southeast Texas, a herd of cattle were trapped \nin the middle of the river on high ground. This high ground was \neventually going to be overcome with water and the cattle would be \nwashed out to sea. The river at this point is between the two small \ntowns of Liberty and Dayton, about 6 miles apart, separated by U.S. \nhighway 90.\n  So Sunday, in a scene reminiscent of the 1800s roundups, cowboys \nmounted airboats--yes, airboats, Mr. Speaker--to force the hundreds of \ncattle into the river and have them swim to safer ground. The only area \nthat had high ground was U.S. highway 90. The highway was above the \nwater, even though water was on both sides of the highway.\n  The roundup took several hours because, Mr. Speaker, cattle are \nhardheaded. They did not want to leave the high ground and swim to a \nhighway. So it took several hours to do this. Even the cowboys were \nlassoing calves and tying them to the airboat so they wouldn't drown. \nFinally, after many hours, all the cattle were forced up on U.S. \nhighway 90 between Liberty and Dayton, Texas.\n  Now, what do you do with them? Well, the cowboys, now on horses, \nalong with citizens and other volunteers, herded the cattle down U.S. \nhighway 90 to Dayton, Texas, through Main Street of Dayton, Texas. The \ncitizens came out with their kids to see the cattle drive through \nDayton, Texas, and they moved these several hundred of cattle to a rail \nyard where they will be kept, that is the highest area in the county, \nuntil the flood waters finally are diminished.\n  Of course, local businesses helped out: a local store, Casa Don Boni \nin Liberty; and, of course, the Sonic, always present in Dayton, \nsupported the volunteers with food and drinks; and other businesses as \nwell helped. This is an example of how, during a troubled time, tough \ntimes, Texans are helping each other survive this catastrophic \nflooding.\n  So, now, Mr. Speaker, that the rains that came down and the flood \nthat came up have subsided and the earth has returned to its dry land, \nour prayers go out to the ones who lost family, friends, and property. \nGod bless every one of them. And we also give grateful thanks to those \nthat helped each other during the floods of May.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/house-section/article/H3647-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNIZING LE GRAND UNION HIGH SCHOOL AND DOS PALOS HIGH SCHOOL IN SAN \n                       JOAQUIN VALLEY, CALIFORNIA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two exemplary high \nschools in my district: Le Grand Union High School and Dos Palos High \nSchool.\n  In California's San Joaquin Valley, one of the most economically \nchallenged regions of the Nation, having access to a quality education \nis critical for our young people, and these two schools shine on both \nthe State and national levels.\n  Recently, both Le Grand and Dos Palos were acknowledged by the U.S. \nNews & World Report's annual grading as among the top high schools in \nAmerica. Not only are Le Grand High School and Dos Palos among the best \nin Merced County, but they both ranked among the top five high schools \nin our region. Their accomplishments show how our students, with the \nright encouragement and support, in fact, can succeed.\n  Students, regardless of their socioeconomic status or being college \nbound, deserve a quality education that prepares them for the road \nahead. And both Le Grand and Dos Palos High Schools are doing just \nthat. Mr. Speaker, 81 percent of the students at Le Grand High School \nand 97 percent of the students at Dos Palos High School qualify as low-\nincome.\n  These are challenging and difficult areas. I am proud to say that, at \nboth Le Grand High School and Dos Palos, approximately half of all \nenrollees are in AP classes and taking the end-of-year test for college \ncredit. Now, what does that mean? It means that every day these \nstudents are actively seizing opportunities to change their lives for \nthe better, and for that, we are glad.\n  Mr. Speaker, when our students succeed, our Nation succeeds because, \nafter all, they are the future of America. The great success of these \nstudents would not be possible without the amazing support of both the \nfaculty and the staff at both high schools. These are the teachers and \neducators who see promise in our students and inspire them to follow \ntheir dreams and progress, teachers who have dedicated their \nprofessional careers to public education in America.\n  To Le Grand Union High School Principal Javier Martinez, the Le Grand \nUnion High School faculty and staff, their board of directors, and the \nLe Grand student body, job well done.\n  To the Dos Palos High School Principal Heather Ruiz, the Dos Palos \nHigh School faculty and staff, the Dos Palos-Oro Loma School District \nBoard of Trustees, and to that student body, again, a job well done.\n  Let me take this opportunity to say a big thank-you to all of you, \nand congratulations in achieving the Silver Medal Award given annually \nby the U.S. News & World Report. Your collective academic achievement \nis a source of pride not only in our community, but throughout the \nNation.\n  Most importantly, all of you are making a difference, making a \ndifference for our students. Thank you for setting the example, and \nthank you for the difference you are making in their lives. It is an \nhonor and a privilege to represent you, and keep up the good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/house-section/article/H3647-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3647-H3648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nKansas (Mr. Pompeo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an issue that is \nincredibly important not only to America, but to the folks who I \nrepresent in south central Kansas. We need to make sure that in south \ncentral Kansas we have the opportunity to access markets all over the \nworld and to sell the great products that we make.\n  Mr. Speaker, it sometimes sounds like just statistics, but in 2014, \n$12 billion in goods from over 3,000 companies were exported outside of \nKansas. In the Fourth District alone, over $3.8 billion was exported, \nmaking Wichita and south central Kansas one of the three top exporting \nmetros in the entire United States of America.\n  When you visit Wichita, you can see that. If you travel around south \ncentral Kansas, you will find great aerospace companies, companies like \nLearjet, Cessna, Beechcraft, and Airbus, manufacturing goods that are \nsold all across the world. They need access to these markets overseas. \nWe make the 737 fuselage right in Wichita, Kansas.\n\n[[Page H3648]]\n\n  And we all know the hundreds of small businesses that supply them, \nmachine shops like DJ Engineering and McGinty Machine, that hire \nhundreds of people in good-paying jobs that are dependent on the \ncapacity for south central Kansas to ship their products around the \nworld, companies like Rubbermaid and Case New Holland that makes farm \nequipment and Coleman that makes camping goods.\n  This doesn't begin to mention all the petroleum products that move \nout of Kansas. And, of course, we sell lots of agricultural products as \nwell. Kansas is the top exporter of wheat, with over $1.5 billion per \nyear. It ranks second in the export of meat products and third in \ncattle.\n  International trade is incredibly important to the people of south \ncentral Kansas. These aren't just numbers. These are about real, hard-\nworking Kansans and good-paying jobs.\n  We need to make sure, here in Congress, that we provide outlines for \nour President to go negotiate deals with both Europe and Asia such that \ncompanies like Excel that makes lawn mowing equipment in Hesston, \nKansas, can continue to grow. It is their objective to double over the \nnext 5 years. They cannot do so without the capacity to sell their \nproducts into Europe and to Asia.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, there is much controversy about some pieces of \ntrade promotion authority in some of the trade agreements. I have read \nthe document as it currently stands. I can assure everyone who is \nlistening today that this Congress will retain its full authority to \napprove every agreement that is entered into to make sure that it is, \nin fact, in the best interests of reducing taxes, reducing tariffs, and \nreducing regulatory barriers so that Americans and Kansans can sell \ntheir products all across the globe.\n  Sometimes the word ``trade'' gets bandied about, but what it really \nmeans is the capacity for innovation, creativity, the rule of law, and \ncompetitiveness to triumph around the world. Those are the hallmarks of \nthe people of south central Kansas. If we get these trade agreements \nright, we can enhance the lives of so many folks all across the Fourth \nDistrict of Kansas.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \njoin me in supporting passage of trade promotion authority when it \ncomes before the House for a full vote. It is about trade, which is \nabout jobs, which is so important for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/house-section/article/H3648-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCELEBRATING THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY'S WATTS BAR NUCLEAR FACILITY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, on June 1, 1796, Tennessee became the \n16th member of these United States. For some 200 years, Tennessee has \nbeen a part of the innovative vanguard that makes this country great, \nwhether it be through culture, science, or even our fabulous barbecue.\n  Last week, I had the opportunity to tour the latest energy innovation \nthe State of Tennessee has to offer--the Tennessee Valley Authority's \nWatts Bar Nuclear facility. With the construction of Watts Bar Unit 2 \nnow approximately 98 percent complete, TVA will soon mark the 21st \ncentury's first new American nuclear unit to come online. And I am so \npleased, Mr. Speaker, that today The Hill newspaper has an article \nabout this very facility.\n  The project is indeed to be celebrated. It is a model of safety and \nquality. The dedicated TVA employees at Watts Bar have put in a million \nhours of work without a lost-time accident. At the same time, they have \nmaintained a quality acceptance rate above 97 percent. That also should \nbe celebrated. Together with Watts Bar Unit 1, the complete facility \nwill be able to power 1.3 million homes in the Tennessee Valley.\n  Mr. Speaker, America must pursue an all-of-the-above energy policy \nthat includes nuclear. Nuclear is a clean, responsible option and one \nthat strengthens our Nation's energy security grid. Unfortunately, \nthough, the EPA, the Obama administration, has proposed sweeping \nregulations that wage a war on coal while also dismissing the benefits \nand the power of nuclear energy.\n  Under the EPA's Clean Power Plan, Tennessee is actually penalized for \ntaking a leading role in providing the region and the country with a \nclean and reliable source of energy. When drafting the Clean Power \nPlan, the EPA counted the Watts Bar Unit 2 as being completed and \noperating at 90 percent efficiency.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  It is not online yet, it is not complete, and it is not yet helping \nto power homes and businesses.\n  As a result, Tennessee's emission targets under this rule are more \ndifficult to reach because the State is not able to count the emission \nreductions from this cleaner plant towards its required cuts.\n  Rather than recognizing TVA's forward-looking work to construct Watts \nBar 2, EPA unfairly, and significantly, increased the emission \nreduction rate for Tennessee.\n  I was sent to Congress to ensure that the needs of my constituents \nare represented here in Washington. As the vice chair of the House \nEnergy and Commerce Committee, I will continue my efforts to stop the \nEPA from its overreach and to stop them from implementing this \nadministration's special interest agenda, which has no regard for the \neconomic impact or energy needs of the people of Tennessee.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is important, and I want to thank the TVA team for \nshowing me the Watts Bar facility and for allowing me to have a \nremarkable visit, and I encourage them in their continued good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/house-section/article/H3648-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3648-H3649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SCHOOL MILK NUTRITION ACT OF 2015\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I recently teamed up with \nCongressman Joe Courtney of Connecticut to introduce H.R. 2407, the \nbipartisan School Milk Nutrition Act of 2015.\n  Between 2012 and 2014, schools across the country served 187 million \nfewer pints of milk, despite an increase in public school enrollment. \nMr. Speaker, this is an alarming statistic considering milk is the \nnumber one source of nine essential nutrients in young Americans' diets \nand provides many significant health benefits.\n  The School Milk Nutrition Act, which has the strong support of the \nInternational Dairy Foods Association and the National Milk Producers \nFederation, seeks to reverse the decline of milk consumption in schools \nthroughout Pennsylvania and across the country.\n  To help achieve this goal, the bill would reaffirm the requirement \nthat milk is offered with each meal and also give schools the option of \noffering low-fat flavored milk, rather than only fat free.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get behind this \nlegislation and become a cosponsor of the School Milk Nutrition Act of \n2015.\n\n\n       The Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support Act of 2015\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, with this past week being \ncelebrated and remembering Memorial Day--Memorial Day having just \npassed--it is important that we continue to remember and honor our \nfallen soldiers and the new generation of heroes who equally deserve \nour respect, our gratitude, and the promise of continued support.\n  This is why I recently joined with New York Congressman Charles \nRangel to introduce H.R. 2516, the Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine \nSupport Act of 2015.\n  This bipartisan legislation would allow Veterans Affairs health \nprofessionals, including contractors, to practice telemedicine across \nState borders if they are qualified and practice within the scope of \ntheir authorized Federal duties.\n  Currently, overly cumbersome location requirements can make it \ndifficult for veterans, especially those struggling with mental health \nissues, to get the help they need and deserve.\n  Mr. Speaker, under current law, the VA can only waive the State \nlicense requirement for treatment if both the physician and the patient \nare located in a federally owned facility.\n\n[[Page H3649]]\n\n  The Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support Act of 2015 removes \nthese barriers and allows the VA to provide treatment through \nphysicians free of this restriction. Veterans will no longer be \nrequired to travel to a VA facility but, rather, can receive \ntelemedicine treatment from anywhere, including their home or a \ncommunity center.\n  Mr. Speaker, these brave men and women put so much on the line each \nand every day in service to our country that when they return home it \nis our shared duty to be there for these heroes by making lifesaving \nresources readily available.\n  This legislation will eliminate the multiple layers of bureaucracy, \nallowing our veterans to have greater access to mental and behavioral \nhealth services, especially in rural areas.\n  I rise today and ask my colleagues in both parties to get behind this \nbipartisan, commonsense legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, sadly, 22 veterans commit suicide every day. Let's end \nthat crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/house-section/article/H3649-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OBAMACARE RATE HIKES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, it has now been more than 5 \nyears since President Obama signed his landmark achievement, which he \ncalled the Affordable Care Act, into law. At that time, the President \nand the Democrats in Congress promised that their massive Federal \ntakeover of our healthcare system would lower costs on American \nfamilies. Affordability was its central selling point.\n  But 5 years later, they must face the facts. Their law, which they \nforced on the American people, is a failure.\n  According to yesterday's much-anticipated Congressional Budget Office \nreports--an independent agency--insurance premiums are expected to \nincrease even more significantly next year than they did this year.\n  One insurer in New Mexico, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, called for a \n50 percent increase in premiums. And New Mexico is just the tip of the \niceberg. Tennessee is also seeking an increase of 30 percent.\n  The average West Virginia family--the State I am blessed to \nrepresent--pays about the same as the residents in the State of New \nYork, which is $17,105 a year on their health insurance. That is $271 \nabove the national average.\n  We cannot pretend that the Affordable Care Act is anywhere close to \n``affordable.'' ObamaCare adds taxes, regulations, and unfunded \nmandates onto the American consumers. The limited choice in health \ninsurance plans is harming families and their budgets.\n  In my district in West Virginia, there is only one insurance provider \nthrough the exchange. And this one plan is asking for a rate increase \nas high as 21.6 percent.\n  President Obama has routinely and blatantly forced his failed \npolicies on the American people. According, again, to the independent \nCongressional Budget Office report of February 4, 2014, ObamaCare has \nkilled 2.5 million jobs a year.\n  Who are these 2.5 million Americans who have lost their jobs thanks \nto ObamaCare? They are disproportionately low-wage workers. The people \nwho are hurt the most by ObamaCare are the same ones who ObamaCare was \nsupposed to help. What we really should call it is the ``Non-Affordable \nCare Act.''\n  West Virginians who get their healthcare insurance through their work \nare paying some of the highest rates in the United States for premiums \nand deductibles, according to a report from The Commonwealth Fund. The \n33,421 West Virginians who are currently enrolled in ObamaCare cannot \nafford to have their rates hiked yet again.\n  Many Americans are left wondering how much more will we have to pay \neach year because of the Non-Affordable Care Act. To make matters \nworse, the Non-Affordable Care Act has added $1 trillion in tax \nincreases. This is money taken out of the pockets of hard-working \nAmerican families.\n  The top Democrat leader here in Congress famously said on March 10, \n2010: ``We have to pass the Affordable Care Act to find out what's in \nit.'' You should know what it is before you vote on it--come on. Well, \nit has been 5 years since the bill was shoved through Congress, and the \nAmerican people deserve better.\n  We must halt ObamaCare's takeover of the U.S. healthcare system and \npass commonsense reforms that lower costs for hard-working families and \nexpand access to health care. The State of West Virginia and the Nation \nneed lower costs and personal control over healthcare decisions, not \nmore Federal Government intervention.\n  The budget that was recently passed by the House and the Senate \nrepealed ObamaCare--including all of its taxes, regulations, and \nmandates--and ObamaCare's outrageous requirement that the taking of \nunborn human lives be covered as so-called ``health care.''\n  Republican healthcare plans pave the way for patient-centered \nhealthcare solutions. We need to focus on reform that will help \nreconnect doctors and patients and give patients better care through \nmore options.\n  The goal of patient-centered healthcare reform is to empower the \npatients. Republicans in Congress have multiple proposals to address \nthe healthcare issue. Republicans propose increasing competition and \ntransparency in the health insurance market and stopping frivolous \nlawsuits against doctors and hospitals.\n  Americans should not be forced to buy into something that simply \ndoesn't work. The Non-Affordable Care Act does not work. The estimated \npremium increases that were announced yesterday are yet another example \nof the failings of this bill and this President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/house-section/article/H3649-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Bush's strategy of denying mass \nmurderers safe havens to kill Americans anywhere was admitted \nsuccessful. I am grateful my two oldest sons served in Iraq to protect \nAmerican families.\n  President Obama's failure to achieve a status of forces agreement in \nIraq and his failure to uphold his declared red line in Syria led to \nmurderous advances of ISIL/Daesh, which he publicly dismissed as junior \nvarsity.\n  I hope President Obama changes course for victory in the global war \non terrorism, which began with the declarations of war in 1997 against \nAmerica with a goal of death to America, death to Israel, and mass \nslaughter of Muslims who do not submit.\n  President Obama's legacy should be peace through strength, not \nweakness, as future attacks threaten American families.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President by his \nactions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/house-section/article/H3650-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SUPPORTING THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, the Export-Import Bank is a critical \nresource for small- and medium-sized businesses in Rhode Island's First \nCongressional District and all across this country.\n  In fact, over the last 8 years, the Ex-Im Bank has provided more than \n$20 million in insured shipments, guaranteed credit, or disbursed loans \nfor companies in my district, enabling them to export products valued \nat nearly $50 million.\n  The Ex-Im Bank provides financing that enables these companies to \naccess foreign markets, compete in the global economy, and create good-\npaying jobs here in America. American jobs are supported by the Ex-Im \nBank, 164,000 American jobs. It generated $675 million for the \ntaxpayers in 2014, and the default rate for the Ex-Im Bank was less \nthan one-fifth of 1 percent, 0.175 percent.\n  Support for the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank is bipartisan. 180 \nDemocrats have signed a discharge petition to force a vote on \nreauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank before it expires on June 30, and many \nRepublicans have publicly supported reauthorization.\n  I have had the opportunity to meet with companies in my district that \nrely on the Ex-Im Bank, companies like the Cooley Group in Pawtucket \nthat designs, develops, and manufactures a diversified industry-leading \nportfolio of premier engineered coated fabrics used across an array of \nindustrial, commercial, and military applications.\n  This issue is too important for the usual partisan politics that \nWashington has grown used to. We need to stand up for small- and \nmedium-sized companies and reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank before the end of \nthis month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/house-section/article/H3650-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ALZHEIMER'S & BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS.

Mr. Speaker, a recent poll shows that a great \nmajority of the American people continue to oppose President Obama's \nimmigration policies. The new Rasmussen Reports national survey found \nthat 77 percent of likely voters view illegal immigration as a serious \nproblem in America today. Just 19 percent do not.\n  Most voters, 63 percent, believe that controlling our borders is more \nimportant than providing a legal status to those already in the country \nillegally. This is the highest level of support for border security \nsince 2011. And almost three-fifths of voters think that a pathway to \ncitizenship for illegal immigrants will just encourage more unlawful \nimmigration. Just one-quarter disagree.\n  As in prior polls, Mr. Speaker, a strong majority of voters, 62 \npercent, feel that the United States is not aggressive enough in \ndeporting illegal immigrants. A similar percentage of voters want to \nuse our military along our southern border to prevent unlawful entries.\n  It is time for the President to heed voters' views on illegal \nimmigration and to enforce immigration laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/house-section/article/H3651-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE AWARENESS DAY\n\n  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, today I am wearing orange in \nrecognition of the first annual National Gun Violence Awareness Day. \nOrange is the safety color hunters wear to alert others of their \npresence, and this is the perfect color to represent safety with \nrespect to firearms and the value of human life.\n  Last week, as we honored our troops and celebrated Memorial Day \nweekend, a wave of gun violence ripped through the city of Chicago, \nwounding more than 50 people and killing 12. Among the victims were a \n17-year-old boy, a 15-year-old girl, and a 4-year-old child.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to act now. We can't equip every American \nwith an orange hunting vest, but we can surely take sensible approaches \nto reduce the threat of gun violence in our communities.\n  This Congress, I have introduced H.R. 224, which would require the \nSurgeon General to compile a report on the public health impact of gun \nviolence. This commonsense gun bill can help us understand the public \nhealth impact of gun violence and prevent future shootings.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with me and support \ncommonsense legislation to curb the violence that plagues our Nation. \nAnd I want to say happy birthday, Hadiya, and happy birthday, Blair \nHolt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/house-section/article/H3651-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                     SUPPORT OUR NATION'S TRUCKERS\n\n  (Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina.

It \nfurthers the great American conservation ethic of John Muir, of \nTheodore Roosevelt, and of the many others who helped to preserve the \ngreat wild places we cannot imagine today living without.\n  As we advance toward a cleaner economy, we must protect the $646 \nbillion outdoor recreation economy, which employs more than 6 million \npeople nationwide.

That is a \nglaring gap in our system that must be addressed today.\n  Far too often, the only thing standing in the way of treatment is the \nnegative stigma associated with this disease. The stigma of treatment \nand medication, the stigma of anger and instability, the stigma of fear \nof the disease itself.\n  At a time when there are 10 times more people with mental illness in \njail than in State-funded psychiatric beds, we are not doing our job to \nhelp our loved ones wage this silent battle alone.\n  Last month during Mental Health Awareness Month, we recognized and \nthanked organizations like the Massachusetts Association for Behavioral \nHealth for their critical work to fill the gaps in our system and wipe \naway the stigmas that deter so many from pursuing treatment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/house-section/article/H3652-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE AWARENESS DAY\n\n  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. ADAMS.

The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 \nhour.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield \nthe customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), \nmy friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nDuring consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the \npurpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 287 provides for a \nmodified open rule for separate consideration of H.R. 2578 and H.R. \n2577. Under this rule, any Member may offer any amendments to the bills \nin question that comply with the rules of the House. It\n\n[[Page H3653]]\n\nalso provides for 10 minutes of debate on each amendment considered. \nThis approach has been what we call a standard rule for appropriations \nbills and was established and has been followed for this last year and \nthe year before, and I believe it has been effective and, really, a \ngood way for this body to be able to effectively operate, allowing each \nand every Member of this body the chance to offer their amendments.\n  This rule also accomplishes two important goals:\n  First, it reflects the majority's commitment to an open and \ntransparent appropriations process. This rule will also allow for all \nMembers to bring to this body their ideas that they have that they \nbring from back home, perhaps ideas from their own individual \nconstituents about how we can make this appropriations process even \nbetter. I think it is important that Members of Congress be given an \nopportunity to do this in the appropriations process, and that is \nexactly what we are trying to do today for a robust opportunity for \ndiscussion. If an amendment complies with the rules of the House, it \ncertainly will be given an up-or-down vote, if that Member chooses to \ndo so.\n  Secondly, this rule provides for reasonable time constraints. It is \nmy belief that if Members' ideas are heard and the process by which we \nconsider appropriations bills is done on a timely basis, then the House \nwill benefit, and so will the American people, so that we work \neffectively and efficiently at the same time. This rule, I believe, \nstrikes a good balance, allowing all Members an opportunity to offer \nnecessary amendments but also allowing the House to get its work done.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  I estimate that we will spend about 18 hours in the process to get \nthese bills done. Throughout this open process, the House will be able \nto make two great bills, I think, even better.\n  Mr. Speaker, the open process by which these two bills will be \nconsidered, if the rule is adopted, is not only a good thing, but I \nthink it says something about the work that the Rules Committee is \ndoing. I am proud to support these two underlying bills because they \nmake tough decisions, and they prioritize the responsibilities of the \nFederal Government. We simply do not have enough money to spread around \nto not have to make tough decisions. These are tough decisions that are \nmade.\n  Yesterday, at the Rules Committee, both of these bills were equally \naddressed on a bipartisan basis, and both the ranking member and the \nchairman of the subcommittee said they worked well together.\n  Obviously, not everybody was happy with how much money they had to \nspend, but both of the ranking members--the Democrats who were \npresent--addressed our committee and said that they were treated \nfairly, that they were treated respectfully, and that it was an open \nand transparent process to achieve good things for the bills.\n  That is the hope that I have as we come to the floor today in that \nyou will see groups of Members who will come to the floor with an open \nopportunity as a result of what we did in the Rules Committee, knowing \nthat the process that took place back in the Appropriations Committee \nwas well done.\n  Alarmingly, however, yesterday, we learned that President Obama has \nthreatened to veto both of these bills because, as I quote him, they \n``drastically underfund critical investments.''\n  Let me see if I can break this down for you. It is our job to \ndetermine what those appropriations levels would be. We heard from the \nPresident of the United States when he presented his budget, and year \nafter year after year, the President of the United States has failed to \nreceive more than only several votes on his budget.\n  I believe that what we have done by working carefully and \nmeticulously through the budget process and through the appropriations \nprocess gives us a better angle on the needs and the priorities of \nthese agencies from a congressional and, I believe, a ``back home'' \nexperience.\n  The people of this country elected their Representatives, and their \nRepresentatives have come to Washington and have had a fair and open \nprocess, notwithstanding that we are not spending as much as people \nwant us to spend.\n  I believe that the President is saying that he will veto these bills \nbecause he does not believe that we simply continue to spend more and \nmore and more. This President has an insatiable appetite that we saw \nand have seen year after year after year.\n  Based upon his words, I would say back to him: Mr. President, please \nlook at the merits of the work that the House of Representatives is \ndoing on a bipartisan basis. We are trying to live within the \nparameters of a budget that has been established and that was voted on \nby Members of this body, that has the vast majority of the Members of \nthis body to say, when compared to the President's budget, this is the \nbudget that I believe best represents not only what we can accomplish \nbut what will work in the best interests of the American people, our \nconstituents. Mr. President, they are the same ones that you have \nacross this great Nation. Mr. President, we are asking you to take a \nsecond look at how you will listen to us and to watch the process that \nis going on here. I think it will develop itself into a better way for \nus to do business, and I would encourage the White House to look at \nthat.\n  Mr. Speaker, a great nation simply cannot spend money that it does \nnot have and be a great nation for very long. This last month, we \ncrossed over the terrible, terrible threshold of going from $17 \ntrillion to $18 trillion in debt, and we continue to add up this debt \nand live off that debt and add to the debt with the spending that we \ndo. We believe that what we have got to do is become more responsible \nwith the taxpayers' dollars and the future of this great Nation.\n  The law of the land and the law that the President has signed \nrequires Congress to act within the requirements of the Budget Control \nAct. These were agreements that were made with the President. That is \nwhat we are sticking to, and that is what these bills do; yet the \nPresident, once again, is telling us: Please set aside the agreement \nthat was made. I don't now like the thing that I agreed to, that I \nsigned into law.\n  In some instances, they were some of the President's own ideas.\n  We need to understand that the American people want and expect us to \nsee problems and to solve them and to stick to it. That is what this \nbudget process is about, and that is exactly what this appropriations \nprocess is about.\n  Look, I disagree with the President. I believe that what we need to \ndo is to live within the agreement of the Budget Control Act. My party, \nthe Republicans, have worked to lower discretionary spending from \nnearly $1.5 trillion in 2009, where we were, to today in 2015, $1.014 \ntrillion.\n  That is the difference between 2009 and 2015, years in which \nexcessive and out-of-control spending could have taken place but for \nthe discipline of the Republican Party and the discipline of our \nMembers and, might I say, of the American people, who have heard our \ncall for having a plan, a plan which carefully moves America into the \nfuture, that lessens the amount of debt the American people have to \ntake on, and that makes better opportunities for our children and \ngrandchildren not to have to pay back our excessive spending just \nbecause we are a group of people who thinks it is smarter than the \npeople back home. We aren't.\n  They get also, Mr. Speaker, that we have to have a defined goal. We \nhave to do exactly what they do back home, and that is to be \nresponsible about a family budget, about a State budget, about a \nFederal Government budget.\n  That means disciplined accountability and a plan that you are willing \nto stick to. That is exactly what we have done. We have worked hard to \nlower discretionary spending over these years, and the effort has saved \nmore than $2 trillion over this period of time and, I believe, over \nwhat would have been spent.\n  I think this is a big win for the American people, and I think it is \na big win for people who want, need, and expect Members of Congress to \ncome to Washington and stick not only to a plan, but to a disciplined \napproach in trying to balance together the needs of this great Nation \nand its people and the need for us to look over the horizon at what our \nfuture would be.\n\n[[Page H3654]]\n\n  I think that we have lowered spending and that we have had a chance \nto shrink the size of government. Certainly, what we are trying to do \nis to work at lowering the deficit or the amount of money that would \nhave been added to that deficit. These are the discussions that people \nback home have with their Members of Congress: What lies ahead? And how \nare you going to be able to make tough decisions?\n  I hope that the President of the United States is listening to this \nbecause we are, on a bipartisan basis, having these same discussions in \nthe House of Representatives and in the committees on which our Members \nserve. Now is the time not to go back to liberal, reckless spending \nopportunities. They will always abound.\n\n  It is always easier to spend somebody else's money. I just don't \nthink it is right, so the Republican Party is here on the floor today \nwith two more appropriations bills, and it is going to sell to the \nAmerican people the confidence that we have that we can make this \ngovernment work more effectively and more efficiently--yes, with fewer \ndollars but with greater opportunities for efficiency.\n  I believe that both of these bills strike what is a balance, a \nbalance between funding critical projects while making smart financial \ndecisions. These two can be accomplished, and that is why we are trying \nto work together to prioritize it.\n  H.R. 2578, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act of 2016, focuses on the true governmental interest: \nfighting crime; making decisions about how we keep terrorists at bay; \nkeeping the American people safe; and supporting the U.S. economy at \nthe same time by making critical investments in science, space, \nexports, and manufacturing. Certainly, in tough economic times, tough \ndecisions are required, and that is exactly where we are.\n  Yesterday, we had a chance to hear from two Members of Congress--\nRepublicans--one of them, the gentleman from Houston, Texas (Mr. \nCulberson), the subcommittee chairman. He talked about the bill \nreflecting smart but fair decisions. The decisions that he spoke about \nwere that the legislation provided $51.4 billion in total \ndiscretionary, which was $661 million below the President's request.\n  H.R. 2578 also prioritizes vital programs that are, essentially, \nbuilt around law enforcement--Federal law enforcement--and their \nability to aim at the problems that our citizens see and that, \ncertainly, our law enforcement sees and to put a priority on national \nsecurity and public safety and initiatives that also aim for job \ncreation and economic growth. These are part of the priorities that \nhave to be taken up, and, in fact, they were.\n  The second bill, H.R. 2577, the Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2016, I \nbelieve, similarly had many of the same characteristics.\n  First of all, they are going to stick to exactly what we talked about \nin the budget, and they are going to have to strike a balance--a tough \nbalance--but one which is based on the priorities of essential programs \nand on making responsible reductions to low-priority activities.\n  This bill provides $55.3 billion in discretionary funding, which is \n$9.7 billion below what the President wanted. Once again, the President \ndoes not want to stick to the budget agreement--an agreement which he \nsigned into law--but that is what this body is going to do.\n  We are going to live within the law, and living within the law is \nwhat the American people expect as part of the plan. This bill allows \nfor important investments in national transportation infrastructure, \nincluding investments in our national highways, railways, and airports. \nIt also provides help to people who are in dire need of affordable \nhousing options.\n  Mr. Speaker, I learned a long time ago, when I became a scoutmaster \nfor the Boy Scouts of America, that needs always outpace resources. \nNeeds are always out there, and they are something that you just simply \nwant to continue to be a part of, but money is not always the answer.\n  Sometimes, a prioritization of the needs that you have to meet will \nthen define you to a better process, one which people can then better \nunderstand. That is what we are doing here today.\n  Like most Members, who will have an opportunity as a result of the \nwork that we did last night in the Rules Committee, I have ideas that, \nI think, can help improve H.R. 2577. One of those ideas, I have brought \nto the floor many, many times in a bill; and during the debate on \nfunding, I think I will have good ideas that will help make our country \nstronger--in this case, make transportation stronger.\n  It became clear to me a number of years ago that government \nsubsidized rail service on Amtrak does not make economic sense. What we \nhave looked at is that Amtrak takes money. Years and years and years \nago, they agreed that they would quit taking government subsidies and \nwould run the railroad as an east and west operation.\n  Instead, what did they do? They became a cross-country hauler. Every \nsingle long-distance route that Amtrak provides--those of more than 400 \nmiles in length--operate at a loss every single month. There are 11 \nroutes that cost double the amount of revenue that they create. That is \nwhy I have offered two important opportunities, which were amendments, \nto eliminate this.\n  The first would eliminate the funding for Amtrak's long-distance \nroutes, which have a total direct cost of more than twice the revenue. \nThat means, if the cost is twice the revenue, then it would be \neliminated.\n  The second would eliminate the funding for Amtrak's worst performing \nline, the Sunset Limited. The Sunset Limited, which is an east-west and \nwest-east operation is subsidized for every single ticket and for every \nsingle train by over $400 in government subsidies, a loss totalling \n$41.9 million last year alone.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Mr. Speaker, these are just some of the ideas. Mr. Speaker, you will \nbe hearing about lots of them over the next 18-some hours of debate \nthat will take place. This is a good thing about this rule. Members \njust like myself will have a chance to come and put their ideas as \nopportunities on the floor for other Members to consider. I think that \nis why we are here today, to work together on a process that will make \nour country even stronger.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their \nremarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, the \nchair of the Committee on Rules and my friend, for yielding the \ncustomary 30 minutes for debate.\n  I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise today in \nopposition to the rule and underlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of both H.R. 2578, \nthe Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nAct, as well as H.R. 2577, the Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. Both, in my \nopinion, are woefully inadequate and underfunded pieces of legislation \nthat serve as a slap in the face to hard-working Americans and a \nreminder of my Republican colleagues' shortsighted and irresponsible \nattempt at achieving a balanced budget.\n  Last night, in his testimony before the Committee on Rules on H.R. \n2577, Ranking Member David Price made a statement that was not only \nprofound but incredibly accurate. He responded to Republican sentiments \nthat slashing domestic appropriations in isolation is a necessary evil \nby stating that ``a great nation must invest in its future.''\n  Indeed, the importance of this investment cannot be overstated. For \ntoo long, we have forced austerity measures upon appropriators that \nprevent the funding of programs that create jobs; bolster our economy; \nrepair and improve our Nation's decrepit highways, transit systems, and \ninfrastructure; that fund medical research; and provide safe, decent, \nand affordable housing for poor and vulnerable families, the elderly, \nand disabled.\n  It both saddens and frustrates me that my Republican friends continue \nto go after domestic programs that would unequivocally improve the \nlives of so many Americans while at the same time refusing to address \nthe real drivers of the fiscal crisis, which are tax expenditures and \nmandatory spending.\n  It is unconscionable to me that we, as a nation, cannot come up with \nthe\n\n[[Page H3655]]\n\nmoney to fund projects that repair and improve our country's \ntransportation infrastructure. I pointed out yesterday in the Committee \non Rules that aside from all of the bridges that I talked about from \nFlorida that are in need of repair, right here in Washington, the \nMemorial Bridge that leads from Virginia into this city is in need of \nrepair.\n  The initiative that provides grants to local law enforcement and \nfirst responders would also improve in our country. But we provide \nourselves with an unlimited budget to fight foreign wars without a \nmechanism to pay for those costs. Enough already, Congress. How about \nan authorization for the use of force rather than the methods that are \nemployed now for ongoing, undetermined, indefinite--it appears--wars?\n  The solution to our current fiscal circumstances lies not in \nwithholding of necessary funding for essential domestic programs, but \nin comprehensive reform that considers--yes, considers--tax increases \nin addition to entitlement and appropriations cuts. That is how we \nbalanced the budget in 1994 and to a relative degree in 1997, and we \nhad, at that time, 4 years of balanced budgets. Adherence to these \nRepublican budget limits self-imposed by sequestration is ineffective, \ndetrimental to our national progress, and just plain wrong.\n  The Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations measure before us today \nis the instrument used to provide funding for many vital programs and \nagencies, such as the Department of Justice, Commerce, NASA, and the \nNational Science Foundation. Despite the importance of fully funding \nthese agencies, this bill is a prime example of the mindless austerity \nof sequestration and the misguided priorities of my Republican \ncolleagues.\n  Time won't permit to add context to how we got to sequestration, and \nmy friend from Texas, the chairman of the Committee on Rules, is \nabsolutely correct. The President did sign this measure, but that was \nat the instance of an awful lot of negotiations and the government \nbeing shut down.\n  I don't stand here and point fingers at either side in this regard. I \nsaid yesterday in the Committee on Rules, and I repeat here, it is the \nfault of 435 voting Members of Congress that we allow for this measure \nto put us in the position that we are in on these two measures as well \nas others to come.\n  For example, this bill fails to adequately fund several Department of \nJustice grant programs and outright eliminates others, programs and \nfunding that are critical to many State and local law enforcement \nactivities. Specifically, the bill cuts $180 million from the Community \nOriented Policing Services hiring program. This effectively eliminates \na program that would put an additional 1,300 police officers on the \nstreets. At a time when the relationship between many of our \ncommunities and law enforcement is strained, why are we decimating a \nprogram dedicated to building trust and mutual respect between the \npolice and the communities they serve?\n  In another startling policy decision by the majority, this bill \neliminates, in its entirety, several other important programs, \nincluding the substance abuse program.\n  I come to the floor today from a meeting this morning dealing with \ninstitutions for mental disease in which the community of persons who \nwork in substance abuse, addiction, and mental health are pleading for \nthe changes necessary for them to be able to address the significant \nproblem that our population faces from veterans, to civilians, to \nchildren, and to the elderly, and yet what we did in this measure is \neliminate the Substance Abuse Treatment program.\n\n  We eliminate the Violent Gang and Gun Crime Reduction initiative at a \ntime when we are witnessing, in our Nation, serious gun violence, and \nmany of us today are about the business of trying to highlight, at \nleast on this one day, the epidemic of gun violence in our society and \nhow it has cost lives and treasure.\n  This program, as offered, eliminates the National Center for Campus \nPublic Safety.\n  Perhaps the most indicative of the misplaced funding priorities by \nthe majority is the gun policy rider--yep, yep, a rider, not part of \nthis bill, just kind of tacked on like we tacked on something having to \ndo with Cuba. We just tack these riders on, and this has been attached \nto this legislation.\n  Not only has the majority completely eviscerated important violence \nand gun crime reduction programs, they have attached a policy rider \nthat cancels out a narrow, targeted reporting requirement on the sale \nof certain long guns sold in four border States. The purpose of this \nrequirement is to discourage straw purchasers from buying weapons for \nMexican drug cartels. This reporting requirement has been proven to be \neffective. Courts agreed that it does not restrict Second Amendment \nrights, so why is the majority including this irresponsible gun rider \nin a bill that largely funds public safety? The irony of this provision \nshould not be lost on any of us.\n  Finally, in addition to cutting funding to important public safety \nprograms, this bill showcases my Republican colleagues' remarkable \nability to bury their heads in the sand when it comes to climate \nchange, employing their ill-conceived strategy of defunding any program \nthat might help us understand and address this important issue. This \nlegislation intentionally underfunds the Geosciences directorate at the \nNational Science Foundation and the Earth Science Office at NASA, where \nscientists are studying the most effective ways to respond to climate \nchange.\n  The second bill, H.R. 2577, provides $55.3 billion in discretionary \nfunding for transportation and housing programs for fiscal year 2016. \nWhile this allocation appears to be an increase from fiscal year 2015, \nafter inflationary adjustments, including declining Federal Housing \nAdministration receipts and increasing Section 8 renewal costs, this \nbill actually designates $1.5 billion less than last year's enacted \nlevel.\n  The shortcomings of this piece of legislation are so numerous that I \nwould far exceed the time allotted to me if I were to attempt to \ndiscuss them all. Instead, I will just graze the surface by addressing \njust a few of the most egregious provisions.\n  This bill reduces funding for Amtrak by 18 percent from last year's \nlevel and $1.3 billion below the President's request. This reduction \neliminates funding for positive train control, a technology that the \nTransportation Safety Board has stated publicly may have prevented last \nmonth's tragic Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia, and provides no \nfunding for intercity passenger rail or the installation of additional \nsafety mechanisms.\n  It also slashes funding for the Federal Transit Administration's \nCapital Investment Grant program, cuts TIGER funding by $400 million--\nit does have a placeholder for something that may take place in the \nfuture--and it reduces the Federal Aviation Administration's capital \nprogram, which impedes the FAA's ability to implement its NextGen \nprogram as well as maintain and improve aging facilities.\n  In addition to its funding inadequacies, as has become custom under \nRepublican leadership, this bill offers up legislative handouts to the \ntrucking industry and other powerful interests at the expense of the \nsafety of our constituents. Specifically, it is going to allow trucks \nto carry longer trailers across the country, make it harder for the \nDepartment of Transportation to mandate that drivers get more rest \nbefore they hit the road, and forbid the Department from raising the \nminimum insurance it requires trucks and buses to carry.\n  I wonder if we ever really talk to truckers and really ask them do \nthey want to carry trains on roads--that is what it amounts to--and do \nthey need the rest that they have requested for years. None of us are \nagainst the trucking industry, but these measures allow for something \nthat should not occur. The latest data which is available shows that \nnearly 4,000 people died in accidents involving large trucks.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Last week, there were no less than three in the constituency I serve, \nincluding a 17-year-old extremely bright young girl who lost her life \nat the instance of a trucking incident.\n  Most of these 4,000 people were riding in another vehicle or were \npedestrians. That is a 17 percent increase from the year 2009.\n  These provisions will make our highways less safe and do not belong \nin an appropriations bill. Trucking regulations should be openly \ndebated as part\n\n[[Page H3656]]\n\nof a comprehensive surface transportation bill, which, incidentally, we \nhave been assured is on the horizon.\n  Currently, one out of every nine bridges in our country is \nstructurally deficient, and congestion has never been worse. At the \nsame time, our population is expected to grow by 70 million over the \nnext 30 years. Knowing this, we must not continue to wait for our \nbridges to collapse, our public transit systems to malfunction, and our \nhighways to deteriorate before we agree to provide adequate funding.\n  Just as it does for transportation and infrastructure initiatives, \nH.R. 2577 makes dramatic cuts to funding for housing support programs \nfor poor and vulnerable individuals and families. One of the most \nstriking of these reductions is the one levied against the public \nhousing capital fund, making it only slightly higher than the monetary \namount allocated in 1989, without accounting for inflation.\n  I held a housing forum on Saturday in the congressional district that \nI am privileged to serve, and I saw the pain that was expressed by the \npeople in long waiting lines for section 8 housing and in the \ndeteriorating public housing that is in that 30-year at-risk period. It \njust pains me even to talk about it and then to come up here and in \nthis very week do more, if we follow our Republican friends, to cut \nthese programs.\n  This bill also reduces funding for the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development's Choice Neighborhoods initiative. It slashes funding \nfor Healthy Homes and lead hazard control grants, exposing the most \nunderprivileged children to toxic lead poisoning.\n  It transfers money from the housing trust fund to fund the HOME \nprogram, taking funding away from a program which is reserved for the \nmost economically disadvantaged and in the most need of assistance, and \ndoes nothing to increase access to safe and affordable housing for the \nelderly or disabled.\n  In short, this legislation undermines the continued viability of our \nNation's infrastructure and threatens our country's economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  I fear that without these necessary investments in transportation, \nhousing, science, commerce, and justice programs, the negative \nimplication of Representative Price's statement will become a reality. \nWe will fail to remain a great Nation because we will fail to \naccommodate the demands of the future.\n  For these very important reasons, and many more that I could express, \nI oppose both the rule and the underlying bills, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I know that I see one of our colleagues from the Rules Committee who \nwants to come speak, but I want to take just a second and respond in \nkind for my party, and that is that my party does recognize that there \nis much that does get accomplished because of the efforts of this \ngovernment and the efforts of this Congress that fund good ideas and do \nthings.\n  A number of years ago, we became faced with, however, a circumstance \nwhere what lies in our immediate future is too much spending, which \nmeans that this country has to borrow money. It is money that needs to \nbe paid back.\n  But in the process of taking money, setting priorities, and spending \nmoney, there also is something called interest on the debt. And that \nis, if money were free and you could just borrow money but not pay \ninterest for it, I am sure we would not mind how much we borrowed.\n  But the bottom line is that is not the reality. The reality is that \nwe have to pay for money that we borrow. And that debt which we have to \npay money back for means that every single year the amount of money \nthat we pay and that comes out of the pot of money gets larger and \nlarger and larger. And paying back debt competes against money that we \ncan spend on behalf of people.\n  And so, at some point, if you just buy off on that we have got to \nspend more and more and more, that means that we have to take more as \ndebt and pay more of interest. And that competes in a marketplace, in a \nbudget, against projects that we would like to do and that do actually \nhelp people and that do focus on the most needy and the most vulnerable \nin our society.\n  But we are spending, Mr. Speaker, an incredible amount of money. And \nwe are trying to learn over time how to become more efficient, how to \nmake our cities even better, how to create jobs, and how to educate \npeople and to bring them forth in a mature way. That is what every \ngreat nation really will be ultimately charged with: how can you make \nyour country better not just today, but for the future.\n  And so Republicans do stand for not spending more than what we make \nso that we have more that we can make in a balanced budget today and \nspend in a way that creates a better future for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  The bottom line is, over the last 6 years, we have gone from a debt \nof $9 trillion to $18 trillion. Some could say that was while we slept, \nbut that is not true. It happened while we were trying to offer better \nopportunities and resolve.\n  So, for the last 5 years, Republicans have said we are going to quit \nthis runaway spending, we are going to make tough decisions, and we are \ngoing to protect this great Nation at the same time. But we are asking \nfor the American people to also recognize what we are doing, Mr. \nSpeaker. And just as I speak to you today, I speak to people back home, \nas other Members of Congress do to their constituents, and say we are \ntrying to balance what we do over time with the efficiencies that keep \nthis great Nation great.\n\n  I will be honest with you. We live in the greatest Nation in the \nworld. And thank God we are Americans. We trust in God, but we also \ntrust in discipline to make this great Nation even better. And that is \nwhat appropriations bills are about: priority, making this great Nation \nstill great tomorrow with discipline. And discipline has a lot to do \nwith our ability to be a great Nation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 12 minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from Texas has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Before making my remarks, I just want to say in a challenging way to \nthe chairman of the Rules Committee that if we were to fix a bridge, it \ntakes people to fix that bridge. And the people who fix that bridge \nspend their money in the local areas and pay taxes, which brings \nrevenue back in. And that is why we need to fix bridges, in my \njudgment.\n  I am pleased at this time to yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), my good friend with whom \nit is a pleasure to serve with on the Rules Committee.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding, and I \nwant to associate myself with his remarks.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this rule, which \nprovides for consideration of the Transportation-HUD and CJS \nappropriations bills.\n  First, let me express my astonishment at the big giveaways to the \ntrucking industry in this Transportation-HUD bill. This bill is loaded \nup with pet projects of the trucking industry that threaten the health \nand safety of the traveling public.\n  The lack of regard for the safety and well-being of those on the \nroads and bridges is stunning. It is hard to believe that some of the \nprovisions that are contained as policy riders in these appropriations \nbills are actually there.\n  This bill should focus on strengthening America's infrastructure, \nrepairing crumbling bridges, investing in public transportation, and \nmaking our roads safer, but instead puts the trucking industry in the \ndriving seat, leaving the average American left behind.\n  The bill would, one, increase truck weights in Idaho and Kansas; two, \nallow twin 33-foot trailers on interstates; three, delay full \nimplementation of DOT's hours of service rule, which requires minimum \nrest periods for truckers; and, four, prohibit the Department of \nTransportation from increasing minimum insurance requirements for big \ntrucks and motor coaches.\n  Mr. Speaker, with all that we know, it is simply outrageous that we \nwould allow bigger and heavier trucks on our highways.\n\n[[Page H3657]]\n\n  Today's bill is intended specifically to appropriate funds, not \nauthorize new policy. Yet this is exactly what these policy riders are \ndoing. They don't belong on this bill.\n  Furthermore, there was not a single hearing on these trucking riders: \nnot one subcommittee hearing, not one full committee hearing. These \nissues are important enough where they should be openly debated as part \nof a comprehensive surface transportation authorization bill, not \ntacked on to an appropriations bill. They don't belong here. But this \nprocess has become so corrupted that anything goes. Committees of \njurisdiction are routinely disregarded and disrespected.\n  Making these controversial policy changes before the Department of \nTransportation finishes their comprehensive truck size and weight study \nthat was required by MAP-21 would be irresponsible. We should allow the \nDepartment of Transportation the time it needs to get their study \nright.\n  Simply put, these trucking industry riders will make our highways \nless safe at a time when our infrastructure funding is woefully \ninadequate and our roads and bridges are crumbling.\n  In just the past 4 years, we have seen a dramatic 17 percent increase \nin the number of truck crash deaths and an alarming 28 percent increase \nin injuries. Instead of advancing safety measures to make our roads \nsafer, Congress is about to roll back significant safety laws and \nregulations that will result in more deaths and more injuries on our \nroads and highways. In fatal truck and car crashes, 96 percent of the \nfatalities are occupants of the passenger car.\n  Mr. Speaker, public opinion is clear: Americans do not want bigger \ntrucks or tired truck drivers on the road. Seventy-six percent of \nAmericans opposed longer and heavier trucks, and 80 percent were \nopposed to increasing truck driver working and driving hours.\n  Yet here we are with authorizing language on an appropriations bill \nto make our roads less safe. Why are my friends doing this? It might be \ngood policy for fundraising purposes, but it is lousy policy for the \nAmerican people.\n  These dangerous riders don't belong here. They threaten the safety of \neveryday Americans on the road, and we ought to insist that they be \nremoved.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also wish to express my concern about the dangerous \nand backward-thinking riders that are included in both the CJS and \nTransportation-HUD Appropriations bills regarding Cuba.\n  Obviously, there are several Members here in this House who are \nnostalgic for the cold war, who are still living in the past. I just \nwant to say, thanks to the leadership of President Obama and this \nadministration, we are making real progress in normalizing relations \nwith Cuba and connecting them with a 21st century economy. We are \nending an embarrassing, dumb, and counterproductive policy that by all \naccounts has been a miserable failure for the last five decades.\n  In 2011, after President Obama reinstated the rules allowing Cuban \nAmericans to visit their relatives on the island and permitting all \nAmericans to send remittances to Cuba, hard-liners used the \nappropriations process to prevent the policies from being implemented. \nThankfully, Senate Democrats kept the hard-liners' provisions out of \nthe omnibus bill, and legislation reversing the modest but hopeful \ntravel and remittance reforms never reached the President's desk.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  As a result, hundreds of thousands of trips between the U.S. and Cuba \nhave taken place every year since, reuniting families and increasing \nthe number of Cubans receiving the economic support they need to run \ntheir own businesses and lead more independent lives.\n  Instead of celebrating the progress, hard-liners are once again \ntrying to shut down the new openings for greater citizen diplomacy \ncreated by this administration. This is the wrong thing to do for \nAmerica; this is the wrong thing to do for American companies, and it \nis the wrong thing to do for the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, for the first time in six decades, the United States \nGovernment is encouraging citizen diplomacy, greater travel and trade, \nand telecommunications and other industries to build relationships and \nstronger ties with counterparts among the Cuban people and new \nentrepreneurs.\n  American businesses are already seeing the potential for economic \ngrowth. That is why JetBlue and other airlines are expanding charter \nservices and planning commercial routes, why ferry companies are \nplanning to set sail for Havana, why Airbnb and Netflix are hoping to \nbuild real businesses in the Cuban market, why Governors in red and \nblue States alike are trying to position companies in their States to \nsucceed.\n  The provisions in these bills are antibusiness. Airlines and maritime \nbusinesses have already taken steps to initiate travel service to and \nfrom Cuba based on the administration's December 17, 2014, \nannouncement, and these provisions in these bills will block them.\n  Even the United States Chamber of Commerce strongly opposes these \nprovisions, and they have sent a letter to Congress basically making \nthe case why we ought to have better and more open travel and trade \nwith Cuba.\n  It is why Americans across the country and Cuban Americans in \ncommunities where they live are so deeply committed to a policy that \nputs the cold war behind us and puts our country on a path to creating \na new and brighter future with Cuba.\n  Simply put, these provisions in these appropriations bills are trying \nto pull the plug on new efforts by U.S. citizens and U.S. companies to \nexpand their presence in Cuba. As the policy moves forward, they keep \ntrying to pull us back into the cold war and a policy that has failed \nfor over 50 years.\n  Let's be clear. The Transportation-HUD Appropriations bill would \nground new commercial or charter flights that came into being after \nMarch 15, 2015. JetBlue and Tampa International Airport are just two \nbeneficiaries of the President's new policy who would be adversely \naffected.\n  With new ferries leaving port, as much as $340 million would be \npumped into Florida's economy. These provisions would hold back that \neconomic growth, hurting American businesses in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, \nOrlando, and Miami.\n  Mr. Speaker, the CJS bill would shut down U.S. exports to Cuba in \nways that will affect telecommunications firms now in negotiations to \nopen up phone and Internet connections on the island.\n  Do we want Cubans to be better connected to the outside world? I \nthought the answer was a huge bipartisan yes, but apparently not. The \nugly truth is that these provisions in these bills are hiding their \nreal intent, and that is to shut down the growing connections between \nCuba and the United States and our citizens and U.S. companies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would just say to my colleagues that these provisions, \nfirst of all, do not belong in appropriations bills. They are \nauthorizing language. They don't belong even in this debate.\n  I would suggest to them that these appropriations bills aren't going \nto see the light of day as long as these provisions are in this bill. I \nwould urge my colleagues to put the cold war behind them and to get rid \nof these provisions, and let's move on to a better and more productive \nrelationship.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, the beautiful part about these last two \nspeakers is that the rule allows them to come to the floor and to \npresent an amendment to strike or to add anything that they would like \nto add into this bill. That is the beauty of what we are trying to do \nhere today, Mr. Speaker.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern).\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I would just respond to the chairman by saying the \nthing about this rule that is so frustrating is that important \namendments are only given 10 minutes of debate, 5 minutes on each side. \nSome of these issues are important and deserve more than 5 minutes of \ndebate.\n  We are not going to have debates. We are going to offer amendments \nand then, essentially, vote. I am not so excited about the way this \nrule has been constructed, especially given the fact that very little \ntime is being allotted to discuss some of these important issues.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I would ask that you ask my good friend, \nthe chairman of the Rules Committee, if he\n\n[[Page H3658]]\n\nis ready to close. I have no additional speakers at this time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman asking. I have \nno further speakers and, in fact, would, as we have done many times, \nallow the gentleman to offer his close, and then I would also.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  These bills exemplify the recklessness and the foolishness of the \nmajority's almost exclusive focus on domestic appropriations for \ndeficit reduction, while leaving the main drivers of the deficit \nunaddressed. We cannot continue on this path if we intend to maintain \nour country's economic competitiveness.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule and underlying bills, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my two colleagues who \nserve on the Rules Committee, the gentleman Mr. McGovern and the \ngentleman Mr. Hastings.\n  They are both not only extremely committed men to their constituency, \nbut also to bettering this House of Representatives. Their voice and \ntheir words and their opportunities of which they stand up for, I have \ngreat respect for, and want to thank them for the character in which \nthey have come after today's not only debate, but yesterday's debate \nthat took a number of hours as we heard from four Members of this body \nabout their ideas about how we should pursue these two appropriations \nbills today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to confine my comments to a perspective, and that \nis satisfaction that I have for the way in which this process is \nworking today. I understand, as acknowledged in the very beginning, we \nhave an issue with how much money we are going to spend.\n  I recognize we are back at 2008 levels in 2015 in most of these \nbills. I do acknowledge that. I do acknowledge that we are asking--\nrequiring--on government a chance to run their agencies--spend money \nback at 2008 spending levels.\n  I think that the process that we are going through will also be an \nadvantage ultimately, sure, in the short-term, but ultimately, where we \nwill look at this as a prioritization basis, where we will empower the \ngovernment, if they work with us and if we work with them, to \nunderstand how we can keep this country great--even spending less \nmoney--how we can continue to prioritize the decisionmaking to where we \ncan pick and choose what needs to be done.\n  Look, it doesn't make me happy. It makes no Member of this body \nhappy. Certainly, the Speaker, the gentleman from Florida, would \nrecognize--you have needs in your district. I do, from Dallas, Texas, \nhave needs in my immediate district and districts that are around.\n  The overwhelming need is all of us--and that is not to spend more \nthan we can say and justify for our future because the dollars that we \nspend are borrowed. The dollars that we borrow and spend show up on our \nbottom-line debt, and it impacts everybody.\n  The bottom line is we have to pay back interest on that money, just \nlike any family that takes out money on a home loan or a credit card or \nsomething else. They have to be able to understand that takes away \nbecause they are paying for that, their ability to spend money in a \ndifferent way.\n  Our Republican majority is well aware of the demand that is placed on \nus, that we cannot go and do all the things that we would wish to do, \nbut we have accepted and taken a pledge that we have given to the \nAmerican people that they do get an understanding--that is we are not \ngoing to keep in the circumstance of spending money based upon taking \nout a loan because it is not good for our children, our grandchildren. \nIt is not good for our future.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, we have had a chance to debate these two bills in \nthis one rule. I think, once again, as I stated earlier, it is a \ncommitment to transparency and openness that this body has and every \nMember retains here on the floor. You saw part of it today.\n  Through this open modified rule, each Member will have the \nopportunity to submit their ideas to two underlying bills, H.R. 2578 \nand H.R. 2577. Through this rule, the House will be able to work its \nway through majority rule floor votes and to make sure that the vital \nappropriations process is vigorous, is timely, and reflects the will of \nthis body.\n  When this rule is adopted, a robust debate will take place in a way \nthat will allow us to fund these important measures, over $100 billion.\n  I think that, as we talk about this, you can see, Mr. Speaker, that \nthis body is getting its work done. It is getting its work done. We \npassed a budget. We will pass the appropriations bills.\n  We go home every weekend; we look our constituents in the eye, and we \nhave to justify what we are doing. We are following a process that we \nsaid we would do. It is for the betterment of this country, to keep \nthis country strong.\n  I am proud of the Members of this body; and, as a Republican member \nof our leadership team, I can tell you that we intend to follow through \nwith the process, the promise that we make to the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the underlying bills, for this rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question \non the resolution.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jolly). The question is on the \nresolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15-\nminute vote on adoption of this resolution will be followed by a 5-\nminute vote on approval of the Journal.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and

Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Culberson) and the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Fattah) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Today, I am very pleased to present to the House the fiscal year 2016 \nCommerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill \nwith my colleague, Mr. Chaka Fattah of Pennsylvania.\n  I would like to begin by thanking my ranking member Chaka Fattah of \nPennsylvania. It has been a pleasure to work with him. We have worked \ntogether closely on this legislation. I appreciate Mr. Fattah's \napproach to the bill. His input has improved the bill considerably. I \nlook forward to working with him and all the members of the \nsubcommittee as we move forward and go into conference with the Senate \non this important legislation. I also want to thank Chairman Hal Rogers \nof Kentucky and Ranking Member Nita Lowey of New York for their help in \nputting this legislation together.\n  This is my first year chairing the Commerce, Justice, Science, and \nRelated Agencies Subcommittee. It is an extraordinarily important \ncommittee that oversees so many noble and worthwhile efforts that the \nFederal Government is engaged, both in preserving and protecting lives \nand property of the American people and advancing scientific research \nand space exploration.\n  I am especially grateful to Chairman Hal Rogers for his trust in me \nin this extraordinarily important assignment. I want to thank him also \nfor his generous allocation to this subcommittee. As the Congress under \nthe Republican leadership has done our very best to live within our \nmeans, as every American must do, every business and every private \ncitizen knows how important it is to only spend the money that you have \non hand. Don't spend more than you have got. We have in this Republican \nCongress done our very best through the appropriations process to live \nwithin our means.\n  Our subcommittee has--with that in mind, I am a personal follower of \nDave Ramsey's advice. I do so in my personal life and try to do so in \nrepresenting the people of west Houston--don't spend more money than \nyou have got, and the money you have got you want to prioritize--and we \nhave in this subcommittee prioritized the many agencies that we have \nresponsibility for. In priority order, we have approached it with law \nenforcement number one and made sure that the FBI has got the resources \nthey need to do their job of protecting this Nation against terrorists \nand espionage, cyber espionage. They are a growing problem that we see \nin so many ways. The enemies of the United States have figured out how \nto hardwire Trojan horses and back doors into telecommunications \nequipment. The FBI has just done a spectacular job of protecting this \nNation in the area of cyber espionage and terrorism, and we have made \nthe FBI a top priority in this legislation and made sure that they have \ngot all the money that they need to do their job.\n  We have also prioritized the work the Department of Justice is doing \nin enforcing our laws. We have made sure that scientific research, \nspace exploration are prioritized, and America will preserve its \nleadership in the world in space exploration.\n  We have made sure that weather forecasting is funded and taken care \nof.\n  Managing the Nation's fisheries is extraordinarily important.\n  As you work down that list of priorities, we have made sure those at \nthe top of the list are fully funded and those that tend to fall \ntowards the bottom--we have just simply had to drop some programs that \nare no longer authorized, the length of time for which Congress \napproved them is expired, or they weren't fulfilling the function for \nwhich they were originally intended.\n  But we in the bill before us today, Mr. Chairman, have provided $51.4 \nbillion in funding for this year, which is a $1.3 billion increase over \nlast year but $661 million below the President's request. The \nPresident's budget assumed a number of tax increases and fee increases \nthat are simply not going to happen. We, again, wanted to live within \nour means and do our very best to minimize the debt that we are passing \non to our children and grandchildren, so we have done our best in this \nenvironment to fund the priority programs while reducing funding for \nactivities that are not essential to the operations of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Once we have taken care of the FBI and made sure they have got the \nfunding they need to protect this Nation in an era of evolving threats, \nwe have also included funding, Mr. Chairman, for 55 new immigration \njudges. Our committee has jurisdiction over these executive branch \njudges who handle immigration cases. Because of the tremendous backlog \nof immigration cases, we have added 55 new immigration judges to reduce \nthat backlog and made sure at the same time that we are providing for \nfully funding the U.S. Attorney's Offices, the Marshals Service, the \nDrug Enforcement Agency, the ATF--Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives--and our prison system.\n\n  Now, for State and local law enforcement, Mr. Chairman, the \nsubcommittee has increased funding for priority programs such as the \nByrne Formula Program and the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program \nfunding, which compensate State and local taxpayers for the cost of \nhousing people who are in the country illegally and have committed \ncriminal acts in violation of State law and are housed in State prison \nfacilities--that is the responsibility of the Federal Government--and \nwe have funded that program to the highest extent that we can.\n  We have also funded youth mentoring programs, which have done such \ngreat work. We have created, in addition, Mr. Chairman, in this bill a \n$53 million community trust program that will fund police body cameras, \nbody camera demonstration programs, and justice reinvestment \ninitiatives.\n  I want to say a special thanks to our Texas State Senator Royce West, \nwho just concluded the Texas legislative session. Texas became the \nfirst State in the Union to pass legislation controlling when, where, \nand how body camera data can be provided to law enforcement or in a \ncriminal trial to make sure to protect the privacy rights of \nindividuals. We respect that. In our legislation we make sure that \nState law controls when, where, and how police body camera data will be \nused.\n\n[[Page H3661]]\n\n  We have also made sure, Mr. Chairman, that NASA is fully funded in \nthis legislation. We have provided an $18.5 billion funding level this \nyear for NASA, which is a $519 million increase and is equal to the \nrequest we received from the President.\n  We have made sure to preserve America's leadership role in manned \nspace exploration, planetary science, and made sure that we are also \ncontinuing to advance aeronautics research that NASA does such an \nextraordinarily important job in.\n  We have funded the continued development of the Orion crew vehicle at \nthe level asked for by the White House and increased our resources for \nthe Space Launch System to speed up when we will use that important \nlaunch system to get Americans back into orbit.\n  We have made sure that the National Science Foundation is fully \nfunded. We increased the funding level for the National Science \nFoundation by $50 million above the historically high level they had in \nlast year's bill.\n  We also included full funding for the very important BRAIN \nInitiative, which Ranking Member Fattah has championed over the years, \nwhich promises to unlock the secrets of the single most important organ \nin the human body and promises great things for the future.\n  Mr. Chairman, we have also funded the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, prioritizing weather forecasting and \nfisheries management in particular.\n  We made sure the Joint Polar Satellite System is funded, as well as \nthe Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite series.\n  We have, though, in order to live within our allocation, had to \nreduce funding in some other areas, eliminating those that no longer \nwere necessary, those whose authorizations had expired, and, in fact, \ncut funding for more than a dozen bureaus and agencies that can operate \nwith a little less.\n  Let me also point out in conclusion, Mr. Chairman, that we have in \nthis legislation extraordinarily important oversight language that \nrequires each agency under our jurisdiction to submit a spending plan \nto the subcommittee. We have capped the life cycle costs for poorly \nperforming programs. And we have also withheld some funding for the \nDepartment of Justice until the new Attorney General can demonstrate to \nus that the inspector general's recommendations regarding sexual \nharassment and inappropriate conduct are being implemented. I cannot \nstress that highly enough. When I met with the new Attorney General, \nthat was one of the first things I brought to her attention.\n  We have also required, Mr. Chairman, that agencies that purchase very \nsensitive information technology or telecommunication systems conduct a \nsupply chain risk assessment in consultation with the FBI to be sure \nthat there are no hardwired Trojan horses or back doors in that \ncommunications equipment or computer equipment being purchased by the \nFederal Government in those agencies under our jurisdiction.\n  We are also requiring quarterly reporting on immigration judge \nperformance and requiring agencies to provide inspectors general with \ntimely information.\n  Finally, Mr. Chairman, I want to point out that our legislation today \ncontinues Second Amendment protections that have been built into the \nbill before. We have withheld funding, for example, to make sure that \nthe United Nation's arms control treaty there has been some discussion \nabout is not funded.\n  We have also prohibited the transfer or housing of GTMO prisoners \ninto the United States.\n  But above all, the bottom line on this legislation is we want to \nensure that the law as enacted by Congress is enforced. If an agency \nwants to have access to our constituents' hard-earned tax dollars, Mr. \nChairman, they are going to need to demonstrate that they are enforcing \nthe law as written by Congress, not based on some memorandum or some \ninternal document. The law as written by Congress is fundamental to our \nentire system of government. Our liberty lies in the enforcement of \nlaw. It is the most fundamental principle of a republic. This great \nNation was founded on that principle that no one is above the law and \nthe law shall be enforced equally and fairly to everybody with due \nprocess.\n  Through our work on this subcommittee with the checks and balances \nthat we have built into this legislation, the agencies under our \njurisdiction are going to need to demonstrate that they are enforcing \nthe law as written by Congress in order to entitle them to access to \nour taxpayers' very precious and hard-earned tax dollars.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H3662]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH02JN15.001\n\n\n\n[[Page H3663]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH02JN15.002\n\n\n\n[[Page H3664]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH02JN15.003\n\n\n\n[[Page H3665]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH02JN15.004\n\n\n\n[[Page H3666]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH02JN15.005\n\n\n\n[[Page H3667]]\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Let me first, since this is my first appearance on the floor since \nthe tragic news of the Vice President's son's death, offer my \ncondolences. I am sure all of my colleagues and the people of \nPhiladelphia consider the Biden family one of our own since they are \nnearby neighbors.\n  I also want to offer my sincere condolences and concern for the \npeople of Texas, given the tragedy of the deaths and the severe weather \nincidents there that have occasioned the flooding.\n  We rise today in moving an appropriations bill, the Commerce, \nJustice, Science bill. The chairman and the ranking member from New \nYork have assisted the subcommittee in its work. I want to thank the \nsubcommittee chairman for all of the cooperation that has been \nextended.\n  He has pointed to a number of the circumstances in which he has \nhelped make sure that priorities that we were interested in were \naccommodated in the bill, and I want to talk a little bit about that.\n  One is in the area of brain science, neuroscience. The BRAIN \nInitiative is critically important. We have some 50 million Americans \nsuffering from brain-related diseases or disorders. Fifty million in a \ncountry of a little over 300 million is a very significant number.\n  The diseases themselves, everything from Alzheimer's to epilepsy, \nautism, brain cancer--in the case of the Vice President's son--a whole \nhost of challenges that cost our country in not just financial ways, \nbut affect so many families.\n  I want to thank the chairman for his continued cooperation and work \nwith me on what I think is the most important area of scientific \ndiscovery that we need to be focused on as a nation.\n  Also, in the area of youth mentoring, the work in terms of supporting \nour efforts to make sure that millions of the Nation's young people \nhave the appropriate guidance that they need, such as the great \ncongressionally chartered organizations like the Boys & Girls Clubs of \nAmerica; the YMCA; and Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, which is \ncelebrating their 100th anniversary this month. I want to thank him for \nthat.\n  I could go on through a laundry list of areas, manufacturing and the \nlike, in which we have worked very closely together; and there is \nnothing that could be improved upon in terms of the process between the \ninteractions between the majority and the minority on this bill.\n  There is an elephant in the room, no pun intended, in the sense that \nthe majority has an absolute view about the budget allocations, given \nthe Budget Control Act, and see that as something that limits our \nability to meet the challenges of our great Nation.\n  The minority has the view that we need to move away from that budget \ncontrol agreement and move away from these automatic caps and meet the \nneeds, as the Constitution indicated that the Appropriations \nCommittee's job was, to meet the needs of our great Nation. We know \nthat there are needs that are not going to be met.\n  The chairman just talked about how important our system of laws were. \nWell, in this bill, we fall short, at least at this moment, of what we \nneed to fully do to fund the Legal Services Corporation, which was \nestablished under a Republican administration; but it provides \nservices, not to Democrats or Republicans, but to Americans all across \nour country, to provide access to the courts and to make sure that they \ncan have due process in civil litigations. We know that we are short \nthere.\n  We have a constitutional responsibility to fund the Census. We are \ngoing to, at this moment, fall shy of that.\n  Now, we hope that we will improve this bill. We can't improve the \nprocess, but we can improve the product as we go toward a conference \nwith the Senate.\n  There are areas related to NASA, even though we funded above $18 \nbillion, which is a historic commitment to NASA, that we still are not \ndealing with the pressing issues of fully funding Commercial Crew which \nrequires--we have now paid out $500 million to our Russian counterparts \nto transport astronauts to the International Space Station, and we are \ngoing to have to continue that longer than we need to because we are \nnot able, under the allocation, to meet our responsibilities and the \nneeds on the Commercial Crew appropriations.\n  Now, Galileo, 400 years ago, pointed us toward Europa. I agree with \nthe chairman that the need to fully explore and to bring back a sample \nand to do everything else necessary to fully understand what the \npotential may be is an important effort, but also funding space \ntechnology and our Commercial Crew Program--and I know the chairman \nagrees with me--are going to be important efforts for us to try to \nimprove in this bill as we go towards conference with the Senate.\n  The minority can't shirk its responsibility to point out these \nshortcomings. Having pointed them out, I do want to make the point, \nthough, that the working relationship is one that I think appropriately \nreflects the kind of process we want to have in the House. We want all \nviews to be considered, and I know that every offering of a view from \nthe minority has been fully considered by the chairman.\n  I thank him, and I want to thank his staff, and I want to thank my \nstaff of the committee because they have worked very hard for us to \ncome to this moment.\n  We are at a point in the process in which the majority will have its \nway. There eventually will be a Senate bill, but we also have to weigh \nin the administration's viewpoint in order to have a law of the land.\n  The administration has issued a statement on this bill, and in \nappropriate ways, it compliments the subcommittee for its foresight on \na range of points, but it also strongly recommends changes in \ndirections in appropriations in a variety of areas that the \nadministration thinks would hold our country back.\n  I think that there is a lot to be said about fiscal prudence. We need \nto make sure that we are operating in a fiscally responsible way.\n  This Nation at its founding, at the point in which we had to separate \nourselves from the British, we borrowed a few dollars. It costs us \nsomething at almost every point in the history of our country, as in \nthe case for most families and most businesses, in which you have to \nmake investments and which sometimes those investments cause you to \nhave an imbalance for a moment or for a period of time.\n  There is a reason why we have mortgages, so that people can buy \nhomes, and we invest in student loans so that young people can get an \neducation. There is a need for our country, from time to time, to look \nbeyond the immediate balance of the books to understand what our \ncalling is.\n  We say, sometimes, that we are an exceptional nation. Exceptionalism \nrequires us to have some foresight. We know that this is an age of \ninnovation and scientific discovery. Some have suggested that there is \nnothing new under the Sun, but we know that that is not so.\n  Just in recent months, we found the largest volcano on Earth--just \ndiscovered. We found in drought-stricken parts of Africa, deep down \nunderneath the earth, some of the largest aquifers of water. We have \nnow discovered a warmblooded fish for the first time ever and a new \nspecies of bird in China. This is not an age in which discovery is not \npossible.\n  This is a time for our country where we should be investing in \nscience and innovation. We have a need to as a country, as I mentioned, \nof just some 300-million plus, when we compete against billion-plus \npopulated countries like China and India, we can't afford to leave any \nof our young people in the shadows. We can't afford to not invest in \nscience and innovation.\n  I want to thank the chairman for what he has done. I want to tell him \nthat we will continue to work with him as we go forward because I \nbelieve what we have here today is not a perfect bill, but the \nfoundation for what will be, I think, the best Commerce, Justice, \nScience bill that could be produced.\n  It is a beginning of that process, and I want to thank him. I look \nforward to the debate in the amendment process.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, it is my privilege to yield such time as \nhe may consume to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the \nchairman of the full committee.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. I thank Chairman Culberson for yielding me \nthe time.\n\n[[Page H3668]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I am proud to announce my support of this bill. It \ncontains $51.4 billion for effective, proven programs within the \nDepartments of Justice and Commerce, as well as NASA and the National \nScience Foundation. Within that total, funding is targeted at programs \nthat are vital to our economic development, our public safety, and \nnational security.\n  These important programs, overall, receive a boost of $1.3 billion \nover last year, allowing us to make critical investments in law \nenforcement, counterterrorism, cybersecurity, and science and research \nactivities.\n  For example, the legislation increases funding for the Department of \nJustice by $852 million above last year's levels, enhancing the way we \nprotect and secure communities across the Nation. That increase will \nprovide the FBI with greater resources to fight terrorism and cyber \ncrime.\n  It will also allow the DEA to amplify activities, including $372 \nmillion to combat prescription drug abuse, what the CDC calls a \nnational epidemic that is taking more lives than car wrecks.\n  Funding is targeted to high-priority national grants with increases \nfor violence against women programs and the Byrne JAG Program.\n  The bill also creates a new community trust initiative that will help \nimprove the safety of communities across the Nation and work to \nfacilitate a supportive relationship between these local communities \nand the police. This includes funding for body camera pilots and \nresearch, training, justice reform efforts, and upgraded statistics \ncollection.\n  Mr. Chairman, the bill also directs funding toward key programs that \nwill help secure America's role as the leader in scientific innovation, \ngrow our economy, and promote job creation. For instance, NASA receives \na $519 million increase above last year, keeping us on the forefront of \nthe space frontier.\n  The National Science Foundation receives a $50 million increase, \ndirecting funds to programs that will spur U.S. economic \ncompetitiveness. To help protect communities from devastating natural \ndisasters, we provided $5.2 billion for NOAA to help boost weather \nwarning and forecasting efforts.\n  As with any appropriations bill, Mr. Chairman, the committee had to \nmake some tough choices to live within a tight budget allocation, but \nthat is what the Appropriations Committee does. We make hard decisions.\n  I believe that this bill does that in a very responsible way, \neliminating unnecessary or unneeded programs, reducing funding for \nother lower-priority programs. This sort of smart budgeting will help \nimprove the way our government operates and show that we can live \nwithin our means.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate Chairman Culberson for his \nsuccessful first go as chairman of this subcommittee. He wanted this \ntour and is happy to have it and is doing a good job with it, Mr. \nChairman, and I am proud of him.\n  I think he and Ranking Member Fattah and their subcommittee have \ndrafted a good bill that I am proud to have before the House today. As \nalways, I want to thank the staff for their tireless work in drafting \nand bringing this bill to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the fourth appropriations bill we have brought \nto the floor this year, and I am glad we are progressing at a great \npace on these very important bills.\n  I am told that this is the earliest and quickest start to \nappropriations bills in recorded history. I am proud of the work that \nour committee is doing and, I think, doing good work.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  So I urge my colleagues to continue this forward momentum and vote in \nfavor of this very important and very well done Commerce, Justice, \nScience funding bill.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman \nfrom New York (Mrs. Lowey), the ranking member and a great leader for \nour team on Appropriations.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I would like to take a moment to congratulate \nChairman Culberson on his first Commerce, Justice, and Science bill, as \nwell as Ranking Member Fattah and full committee Chairman Rogers for \ntheir efforts. I know how hard they worked to try and put together the \nbest bill possible.\n  Before I go further, I want to thank my friend, Ranking Member \nFattah, and join him in expressing our heartfelt condolences to the \nVice President on the loss of his son. I just can't imagine the pain \nthat one feels at such a tragedy. I know our hearts and prayers go out \nto the Biden family.\n  The pictures of the floods in Texas were so horrifying, and I know \nhow hard everyone was working to minimize the loss of life. I also want \nto express my condolences to Chairman Culberson as well.\n  The House Republican ``work harder for less'' budget resolution was \nopposed by every Member on my side of the aisle in part because it \nreally makes it impossible to give hard-working Americans the \nopportunity to succeed. Democrats want to end the sequester, and we \nneed more reasonable and realistic budgeting that could help families \nafford college, a home, and a secure retirement.\n  The insufficient overall allocation for discretionary investment \nhurts initiatives in all the appropriation bills that grow the economy, \ncreate jobs, and make us more secure. While I appreciate the chairman's \nefforts, the grossly inadequate allocation creates shortcomings that \nare evident in the fiscal year 2016 Commerce, Justice, and Science \nbill.\n  Instead of providing the desperately needed investments in community \npolicing and improving the juvenile justice system, the COPS hiring \nprogram would receive no funding, and the Office of Juvenile Justice \nwould receive $68 million less than fiscal year 2015 and $156 million \nless than the President's request. These failures are particularly \nshameful, given the inclusion of a number of gun riders, including \nlanguage blocking a reporting requirement on multiple purchases of \nrifles or shotguns by individual buyers. We must eliminate riders such \nas these that prevent law enforcement from sensibly addressing gun \ncrimes.\n  While Violence Against Women prevention and prosecution programs \nwould appear to receive an increase above both fiscal year 2015 and the \nPresident's fiscal year 2016 request, it is actually below the request \nwhen you account for a transfer in Victims of Trafficking grants. \nSimilar gimmicks are also included in the portion of the COPS program \nthat would be funded.\n  The Legal Services Corporation would fare far worse: $75 million \nbelow fiscal year 2015, $152 million below the request. This is \nunacceptable for a vital service that provides legal help for hard-\nworking Americans.\n  Turning to science, the bill continues the majority's practice of \nburying its head in the sand instead of focusing on the stark climate \nchange realities. As in previous years, the bill severely cuts funding \nfor NOAA climate research by 19 percent below fiscal year 2015, a $30 \nmillion decrease. We should be supporting, not hindering, this \nimportant work to help save our environment.\n  The bill also cuts Geosciences and Social, Behavioral, and Economic \nSciences of the National Science Foundation by $257 million below the \nfiscal year 2015 level, an approach universally opposed by the \nscientific community.\n  Rather than properly preparing for the constitutionally mandated 2020 \nCensus, the mark is $387 million below the President's request for the \nU.S. Census Bureau. Failure to provide these funds now will only cost \ntaxpayers more in the long run, as the Census Bureau would be unable to \nthoroughly develop and test innovative, cost-saving business practices. \nDeveloping a well-designed and thoughtful Census now could save up to \n$5 billion in 2020 Census costs.\n  As in other bills, the majority has included a number of \ncontroversial riders. In addition to those on firearms I already \nmentioned, another provision is aimed at placing restrictions on \nexports to Cuba.\n  However, despite the numerous shortcomings, I want to thank the \nchairman again for his work related to the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System, Byrne Justice Assistance Grants, and the \ncommunity Backlog Reduction Program to process sexual assault kits. \nThese evidentiary kits have historically gone untested for decades, \ngiving violent and culpable offenders the ability to strike again. So \nit is important we fund this program at a workable level.\n\n[[Page H3669]]\n\n  I want to make it clear that Democrats are more than willing to \nsupport bills that include adequate spending levels to ensure public \nsafety, promote economic growth, and that exclude unnecessary riders. \nUnfortunately, although this bill does such wonderful things, and I am \na great supporter once again of all the brain research, the important \ninvestments that are being made to address Alzheimer's, autism, and \nother serious, serious diseases of the brain, the bill does not make \nappropriate investments that hard-working Americans need but, instead, \nadvances misguided policy changes. I urge my colleagues to vote against \nthis bill.\n  Thank you again to our chair and ranking members.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Jolly), my colleague on the Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I want to compliment the chairman for a bill \nthat invests responsibly in law enforcement, space science research, \nocean and marine resources, and weather sciences. I also want to thank \nthe chairman for his support of an innovative data collection \ninitiative in this bill to improve fish stock assessments and research \nof the fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  As we discussed in many of our hearings, we as a nation need to \nutilize all tools and technology and work with all fisheries sector \nparticipants, including recreational, for-hire, and commercial, that \nprovide the most accurate assessment of the health of our fish stocks, \nincluding the red snapper species so critical to our quality of life in \nGulf States like Florida and Texas as well as our regional economies. \nThis innovative data collection initiative will better enable the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service and the regional council to make more \ninformed decisions about the length of various fishing seasons.\n  Mr. Chairman, without constantly improving and accurate and \nquantifiable data, data that is believed to reliably reflect the \nfisherman's experience on the water, our commercial and recreational \nfishermen, alike, find it difficult to understand decisions by \ngovernment to shorten fishing seasons and limit catches.\n  To be clear, this new provision included in this year's CJS bill is \nintended to provide the National Marine Fisheries Service Southeast \nRegional Office new tools to utilize data collection efforts from our \nrecreational, for-hire, and commercial fishermen, from State and local \nofficials, from third-party researchers, and from academia. Data \ncollection and research focus on the unique stock assessment challenges \nof Gulf fisheries. By working with our recreational, for-hire, and \ncommercial fishermen, and by engaging them directly in data collection, \nNMFS Southeast Regional Office will ultimately collect more and better \ndata and will begin to restore trust between the sectors and \nregulators.\n\n  This public-private effort will allow officials tasked with managing \nour fishery resources to strike the right balance: balance for our \nrecreational fishing communities' quality of life and right to fish on \nour waters, balance for our regional economy fueled by the commercial \nand for-hire fishing industry, and balance for our strong interests in \nstock rehabilitation, species preservation, and protecting our critical \nnatural resources.\n  Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with you as we continue to \nwork through this appropriations process on this important provision, \nas well as working with NOAA and the NMFS Southeast Regional Office, \nduring implementation of this funding to stand up to this critical \ninnovative stock assessment initiative and make it a success for \nFlorida and for all five of our Gulf States, including your home State \nof Texas.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The chairman and the staff have done a remarkable job working on a \nwhole range of issues related to fish, not just in the Gulf of Mexico \nand Texas, but throughout the questions around salmon in Washington \nState and the issues related to even our part of the country where we \nfish a little bit. So I want to thank the gentleman for his comments.\n  I now yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the great State of \nCalifornia (Mr. Honda), my colleague on the subcommittee, who has \nreally helped us on the subcommittee, particularly around areas related \nto innovation and science and advanced manufacturing.\n  Mr. HONDA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this \ntime.\n  Let me start by thanking Chairman Culberson and Ranking Member Fattah \nfor their ongoing enthusiasm and support for many of the key programs \nfunded by this bill. I am grateful for their support, including \nprovisions addressing key concerns of mine such as the growing rape kit \nbacklog and long delays in testing DNA evidence; preventing the \npolitically motivated termination evaluation of a fundamental science \nobservatory, SOFIA; and ensuring the Federal Marine Debris program, \nwhich will focus on plastics in our Nation's waterways and oceans. \nDespite the inclusion of these and other beneficial programs, this bill \nunfortunately falls short of supporting a robust and effective \nportfolio of Commerce, Justice, and Science programs.\n  This bill was crafted under the restrictive spending cap imposed by \nsequestration. This unworkable funding cap has forced unacceptable cuts \nthat greatly weaken key programs serving our country. For example, at a \ntime when the funding for the constitutionally mandated decennial \nCensus should be on a significant ramp-up, this bill underfunds the \nCensus Bureau by $387 million.\n  At the direction of Congress, the Census Bureau is testing sweeping \nreforms to Census methods that would reduce the overall cost of the \nenumeration substantially by bringing the Census into the 21st century. \nBut without sufficient money next year, the Census Bureau may have to \nabandon plans for a modern Census and go back to the more costly, \noutdated, manual 2010 design, which will end up costing $5 billion \nmore--$5 billion. We cannot afford to waste $5 billion. We need to be \nfiscally responsible and have an understanding of cuts beyond the time \nscale of a 1-year funding bill, which means investing in the Census \nnow.\n  Additionally, this bill severely underfunds and deprioritizes earth \nscience. The bill proposes generous funding to support NASA for \nplanetary science but seems to overlook the most important planet of \nall--our own. That is why I offered an amendment in committee to fully \nfund the earth and geoscience research at NASA and NSF instead of the \n$520 million underfunding being proposed.\n  Research in the earth and helio sciences helps protect lives, \nbusiness, and infrastructure because economic and public welfare \nconsequences of natural hazards such as droughts, hurricanes, space \nweather, and earthquakes can be devastating. As our climate continues \nto change, this research is even more important, and yet this bill \nproposes to cut earth and geoscience research. We should be increasing \nfunding in these fields to better understand natural systems and allow \nfor more informed policy decisionmaking and not cutting them.\n  Additionally, this bill seeks to micromanage the NSF by singling out \nearth science and social sciences as lesser research priorities. This \nis a prime example of political meddling into scientific research. The \ndraconian spending caps have forced the cannibalization of these and \nother essential programs and resulted in a bill that is unworkable.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  We need to adopt the President's proposed overall funding levels to \nensure that key programs such as the Census and NASA's Earth Science \nResearch Program are able to be effective and serve our Nation.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, at this time I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins), my colleague and good \nfriend from the committee.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. I thank the Chairman for his good work.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have the honor of serving on the Appropriations \nCommittee, which enables me to have input into our spending priorities.\n  This bill has a number of important programs. I want to highlight \ndrug courts. Drug courts have a proven track record. Drug courts are \neffective and efficient. Drug courts work.\n  A respected pastor and community leader in my State said: ``Prisons \nare\n\n[[Page H3670]]\n\nfor people we are really scared of, not just mad at.''\n  The drug epidemic continues to ravage my State, and drug courts give \na needed alternative to sending those suffering from addiction to jail. \nDrug courts allow individuals to undergo treatment, get help staying \nclean, and reenter society as a productive individual.\n  West Virginia drug courts are succeeding. Earlier this year, West \nVirginia honored the first 1,000 adults and juveniles to successfully \ncomplete the program.\n  While no single program will solve the drug epidemic, we must \ncontinue to support programs that work. This bill maintains critical \nfunding for a number of other programs that will help those trying to \nend this crisis.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lee), a fellow appropriator.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me thank our ranking member for yielding \nbut also for his very steady and competent leadership of this \nsubcommittee on our behalf. Also, I want to thank the chairman for his \nconsistent work at bipartisanship, even though this is still yet \nanother funding bill brought to the floor that woefully underfunds our \ncritical Federal programs.\n  The fiscal year 2016 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill \nreally should reflect our Nation's commitment to growing our economy, \nkeeping our communities safe, and driving innovation. Instead, it makes \ncritical cuts to programs at a time when they are needed most.\n  In the Justice title, this bill includes no funding for the Community \nOriented Policing Services Hiring Program and a $68 million cut to \njuvenile justice programs from fiscal year 2015.\n  It also includes a $75 million cut to the Legal Services Corporation, \nwhich provides critical legal services to low-income Americans. Given \nwhat is happening in communities around the country, especially in \nterms of communities of color and law enforcement, these are truly \nunwise and misguided cuts.\n  Under the Science title, the National Science Foundation, which funds \ncritical research at the University of California at Berkeley in my \ncongressional district, is funded at $50 million below the fiscal year \n2015 enacted level. These cuts are a huge blow to investments we should \nbe making in scientific research to keep our Nation competitive.\n  In the Commerce section, this bill also includes cuts to critical \nprograms, such as a $274 million cut to the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, and funds the Census Bureau at $387 million \nbelow the President's budget request.\n  Add to all of this an inappropriate policy rider about exports to \nCuba and you have a bill that, despite the hard work of the chair and \nour ranking member, is deeply flawed.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Emmer of Minnesota). The time of the \ngentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. LEE. Finally, let me just say we need to stop starving our \ncritical Federal programs. We need to protect our communities in crisis \nand drive scientific breakthroughs in the future.\n  In committee, I sponsored an amendment along with Ranking Member \nLowey to increase COPS Hiring funding and also introduced an amendment \nto require jurisdictions receiving Byrne-JAG grants to put their \nofficers through training to better work with diverse communities that \nthey protect and serve. Congressman Lacy Clay has championed this idea, \nand later in this debate we will enter into a colloquy regarding this \nimportant issue, and I want to thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor their support.\n  Mr. FATTAH. May I inquire of the time remaining on both sides?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 7 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Texas has 12 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, at this time it is my pleasure to yield \n2 minutes to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce), my good \nfriend.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise for the purpose of engaging in a \ncolloquy with the gentleman from Texas, the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies.\n  I want to thank the chairman and Ranking Member Fattah for their \nefforts to forge a truly bipartisan bill to fund critical programs \nwithin the Departments of Justice, Commerce, and the scientific \ncommunity. This diverse bill provides a wide range of support, from \ncontinued scientific research in space to the funding our law \nenforcement officers need to keep our families and communities safe. It \nis truly a diverse, vital bill.\n  Chairman Culberson, please permit me one point of clarification in \nthe bill. The NASA budget includes a space operations account. This \naccount provides funding for everything from space communications to \nresearch on the International Space Station to supporting space launch \ncomplexes. I would like to specifically discuss the space \ncommunications function within this account.\n  Regardless of age or mission, NASA must be able to communicate with \nthe system it has in orbit. The space and ground networks that comprise \nNASA's space communications system are the foundation for all of NASA's \norbital work. The network provides constant, real-time communications \nfor all aspects of our space mission, from the unmanned probes at the \nvery edges of our solar system to the ISS and Hubble Space Telescope. \nWithout this capability, our Nation would be jeopardizing the safety of \nour manned operations and depriving the world of the discoveries made \nby our space systems.\n  It should be a commitment of the House to ensure that the funding for \nour space operations ensures strong support for the infrastructure and \nsupport needed to maintain strong and capable space communications.\n  Again, I thank the committee for its work in crafting this \nlegislation and strongly supporting space communications in the past. \nIt is my understanding that the committee has provided the space \noperations account with nearly $130 million more than it did in fiscal \nyear 2015, and that it intends to support a robust level of funding for \nthe space communications component within this account.\n\n  Is that understanding correct? I yield to the gentleman.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  I want to thank my good friend and colleague from New Mexico. He is \nabsolutely right. We have increased funding for the space operations \naccount by $129.5 million, and we will make sure that that funding is \nadequate to support the space communications components with that \nincrease.\n  Mr. PEARCE. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the \ngreat State of Texas (Mr. Cuellar), a fellow appropriator.\n  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the ranking member for \nyielding, number one. Number two, I want to thank him for the steady \nleadership he has provided as the ranking member. I also want to thank \nmy good friend from Texas, John Culberson. We go back to the State \nlegislature. I thank him for his leadership on this one particular \nissue that I want to bring up today, and that is the work that we are \ndoing together in adding 55 new immigration judges--the largest amount \nof immigration judges that we are going to have at one time.\n  So I want to thank him for working together to add that money, as \nwell as the accountability for those judges. We have got to make sure \nthat we not only have the judges, but we have got to make sure that \nthey move those cases with all due process given to everybody--and to \nmove them as soon as possible. I also thank him for the work that we \nhave done on Stone Garden and other border law enforcement needs.\n  Why do we need those new judges? Because right now there are more \nthan 450,000 pending cases. There is a large backlog of immigration \ncases. There are about 250 judges right now, with about 58 courtrooms \nacross the Nation, but we need to do more.\n  If you look at the casework of an immigration judge, that person will \nhandle about 2,100 cases. If you look at a Federal judge, that judge \nwill handle about 440 cases. You can see the large amount of cases that \nwe have.\n  So, basically, some of those cases are taking about 2\\1/2\\ years to \nhandle, and therefore we need to make sure that we\n\n[[Page H3671]]\n\nhave the judges in place to handle the backlog that we have.\n  Just to give you an example, just in the last 6 months, 170,000 \npeople crossed the border. Therefore, we need those judges.\n  To conclude, I want to thank the chairman and his staff, as well as \nthe ranking member and his staff.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), my good friend.\n  Mr. WALBERG. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today deeply concerned by the increase of heroin \nand opioid abuse in Michigan and around the country.\n  In Jackson, six heroin-related deaths have happened since March. In \nApril, in Monroe County, three people overdosed in a 24-hour period. \nLast year, Lenawee County, my home county, had seven drug-related \ndeaths in the first three quarters. Sadly, we hear similar stories in \nfar too many communities across Michigan.\n  Today's CJS Appropriations bill includes essential funding to assist \nStates and localities to combat drug-related problems, including over \n$400 million to advance strategic plans to address the growing heroin \nand opioid epidemic and $372 million to tackle prescription drug abuse.\n  It will take all of us working together--concerned citizens, \ntreatment providers, law enforcement, elected officials at every \nlevel--to fight this growing epidemic and keep our homes and streets \nsafe.\n  I appreciate the work of the chairman of the committee on this, and I \nsupport it.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. \nEddie Bernice Johnson), who has led the Democratic effort in terms of \nscience, and I particularly thank her for her leadership on NASA.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, let me express my \nappreciation and respect for the chair as well as the ranking member of \nthe subcommittee.\n  I really do respect the work, but I do rise in opposition to H.R. \n2578. It represents a missed opportunity to help the Nation's research \nand innovation enterprise at a time when that help is urgently needed.\n  Until the mismatch between the House budget resolution and the needs \nfacing our country is addressed, we are going to continue to fall \nbehind, both in our efforts to maintain our global competitiveness and \nour efforts to maintain R capabilities we need right here at home.\n  As ranking member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, I \nwould like to use some of my time to address some specific concerns \nthat I have with the bill, which I elaborate on in my statement for the \nRecord.\n  In short, the bill's report language would make arbitrary and \nideologically driven cuts to NSF social sciences and geoscience \nresearch programs. In addition, the bill's funding would put NSF's new \nheadquarters building at risk, adding cost growth and schedule delays.\n  With respect to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nin addition to the funding cuts, I am particularly concerned about the \nreport language that would gut the critical forensic standards \nactivities already underway at NIST, as well as the bill's language \nthat would covertly, without any hearings, debate, or authorizing \nlegislation, eliminate an entire agency, the National Technical \nInformation Service.\n  The bill would also make significant cuts to NOAA's budget, including \nclimate research and NOAA's Polar Follow On weather satellite program.\n  Finally, the bill would make deep cuts to NASA's Earth Science \nProgram, disrupting activities that will help us better understand our \nhome planet and the climate change that is occurring right now.\n  Mr. Chairman, in closing, as I said before, the bill is a missed \nopportunity, and I cannot support it in its current form.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2578. While I respect the \nwork put into the bill by my colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee, I am afraid that it represents a missed opportunity to help \nthe nation's research and innovation enterprise at a time when that \nhelp is urgently needed.\n  As other speakers have noted, this bill is the result of a \nfundamentally flawed House budget resolution that provides insufficient \nallocations for critically important activities of the federal \ngovernment, including investing in our future. Until that mismatch is \naddressed, we are going to continue to fall behind, both in our efforts \nto maintain our global competitiveness and our efforts to maintain the \nR capabilities we need here at home.\n  As Ranking Member of the House Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee, I would like to use my remaining time to address some \nspecific concerns I have with the bill.\n  With respect to the National Science Foundation, I have two specific \nconcerns beyond the overall funding level. Following the direction \ncontained in the report accompanying this bill would result in a 15-20% \ncut to each of the social sciences and geosciences directorates at NSF. \nLet me be clear. These are arbitrary and ideologically-driven cuts that \nreflect a lack of understanding of how science works, and a lack of \nunderstanding of the great importance of these fields of research to \nour national interests. Moreover, with these cuts we stand to lose a \ngeneration of talent and expertise in fields essential to the wellbeing \nof this nation, and we may never recover from that loss.\n  Second, I must comment on the flat-funding for the NSF operations \naccount. NSF is already in the midst of building a new headquarters in \nAlexandria, and the funding provided to NSF in this bill may very well \nresult in delays and therefore increased cost for that building. This \nis a clear-cut case of the Congress being penny-wise and pound foolish.\n  With respect to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, I \nam concerned about the funding cuts to all of the accounts. I am \nparticularly concerned about the report language that would gut the \ncritical forensics standards activities already underway at NIST, and \nthe bill language that would covertly, without any hearings, debate, or \nauthorizing legislation, eliminate an entire agency, the National \nTechnical Information Service. NTIS performs both essential and \nperhaps nonessential activities. This bill would throw out the baby \nwith the bathwater without any consideration given to the consequences.\n\n  The CJS bill we are considering today fails short in a number of ways \nin its treatment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration. It cuts the NOAA budget 5 percent below current \nspending and more than 13 percent below the President's request. This \ncut will have a significant impact on NOAA's ability to provide local \ncommunities and decision-makers with the information they need to \neffectively manage the nation's resources and protect the lives and \nproperty of every American.\n  I am especially concerned about the lack of support for NOAA's \nefforts to maintain continuity in our polar observing capabilities. The \nPresident's budget request included $380 million to fund a Polar \nFollow-on program. This program would help mitigate a potential gap in \nthis critical data by building robustness into our satellite \nconstellation. As many of you know, accurate weather forecasts and \nwarnings are vital for the economic security of the United States, and \nwe must ensure NOAA has the resources it needs now to ensure the long-\nterm health of our satellites.\n  Additionally, I am concerned about the bill's $30 million dollar cut \nto NOAA's climate research activities. Addressing climate change is our \nmost pressing environmental challenge and NOAA's climate research \nfurthers our understanding and the implementation of effective \nadaptation and mitigation strategies. We should be doing more to combat \nclimate change, not less.\n  Finally, with respect to NASA, while I'm pleased that the Committee \non Appropriations has proposed a strong top-line for the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration that is consistent with the \nPresident's overall request, I am troubled by the way that funding is \nallocated. In particular, I cannot support the deep cuts made to NASA's \nEarth Science program. Given the leadership role NASA plays nationally \nin studies of the Earth system, including climate change, these cuts \nwill do serious long term damage if enacted into law.\n  In addition, I question the proposed reduction to the Orion crew \nvehicle program from the FY 2015 funding level, especially given the \nconcern expressed in the report language about NASA's ability to test \nall human-rated systems on the first Exploration Mission-1. I also \nquestion the proposal to fund the Safety, Security, and Mission \nServices account, which is critical to maintaining a world class \nworkforce and infrastructure, below the President's request.\n  Mr. Chairman, in closing, as I said before, this bill is a missed \nopportunity, and I cannot support it in its current form.\n  I yield back.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross).\n\n[[Page H3672]]\n\n  Mr. ROSS. Thank you, Chairman Culberson, and thank you for presenting \nthis bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of an important amendment that \nwill be offered by my colleague, Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer, to \ndefund the Department of Justice program known as Operation Choke \nPoint.\n  Created under the guise of a program to root out banking fraud and \nmoney laundering, Operation Choke Point has been used by administration \nbureaucrats to pressure and force banks to end relationships with \nlegitimate businesses it considers objectionable or a ``reputational \nrisk.''\n  This administration has targeted legitimate small businesses such as \nfirearm and ammunition dealers, cigar shops, pawn stores, payday \nlenders, and others. The backdoor effort to target legitimate law-\nabiding businesses it does not like and to coerce banks to choke off \nrelationships with these legitimate businesses is contrary to our \nNation's fundamental principles of freedom.\n  In voting to defund Operation Choke Point, I will be voting to rein \nin this out-of-control administration and its assault on small, legal, \nlegitimate businesses.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Lipinski), a gentleman who, in this House, has spent a \ngreat deal of time providing leadership in terms of small businesses \nand connecting them up with our research institution.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. I thank my friend for yielding and for his work on the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I want to say that, Mr. Chairman, I understand the constraints that \nthe chairman is working under, and I appreciate his work on those items \nthat were mentioned by Ranking Member Fattah and other Members on this \nside.\n  I rise in opposition to this bill because it fails to fund scientific \nresearch at levels we need to spur innovation and remain competitive as \na Nation. In particular, I want to call attention to report language in \nthe bill that will result in cuts to the social sciences and \ngeosciences of over $250 million.\n  The NSF is the largest single source of funding for basing research \nin our country in a variety of fields, and that is especially true for \nthe social sciences.\n  Some will say these cuts are needed to prioritize research in other \nareas, but this approach of limiting funding for social science is \nmisguided for several reasons.\n  First, other areas of research are already heavily prioritized at the \nNSF. In fiscal year 2015, the NSF will spend only 3.7 percent of its \nbudget on social science research--clearly not an outsized priority.\n  This is especially true when you consider that social science \nresearch saves lives and money. It was NSF-funded social science \nresearch that developed the kidney transplant program that has led to \nthousands of successful donor-patient pairings that had not been \npossible before.\n  Spectrum auctions conducted by the FCC were made possible by economic \nresearch sponsored by the NSF. These auctions raise billions of dollars \nfor taxpayers and will free up chunks of spectrum so we can stay at the \ncutting edge of wireless technologies.\n  Social science research is also critical for cybersecurity, as we \nhave heard from many expert witnesses in the Science, Space, and \nTechnology Committee. Most cyber breaches occur because of human \nfactors, and social science is vital in addressing this grave security \nrisk.\n  For these reasons, I am urging my colleagues to oppose these cuts and \nto oppose this bill. We need to do better for scientific research for \nthe sake of our country, our economy, and our jobs.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, could I inquire as to how much time \nremains on each side?\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The gentleman from Texas \nhas 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 1 \nminute remaining.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to my good friend from \nWisconsin (Mr. Duffy).\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chairman, one of the greatest innovations that has \never been developed by man to connect people from every corner of the \nEarth, whether in cafes or homes or in schools, is the Internet.\n  The reason the Internet has expanded and grown around the world and \nhas been such an engine for innovation is the fact that the Internet \nembodies the American idea of free speech. That very idea of free \nspeech in the Internet is under attack because the administration and \nsome people in this institution want to see the core functions of the \nInternet be transferred to a foreign body that doesn't share our idea \nof free speech.\n  Let's keep the Internet open. Let's make sure that we continue with \nthe great American idea of free speech not just here in America, but in \nevery corner of the globe because the Internet will embody that idea of \nfree speech.\n  The Internet was made in America. Let's keep the core functions of \nthe Internet in America.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I have one remaining speaker, so I reserve \nthe balance of my time to close.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, it is a distinct privilege to yield 3 \nminutes to the gentlemen from Texas (Mr. Smith), the distinguished \nchairman of the full Science, Space, and Technology Committee, my \ncolleague and good friend.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, the chairman of \nthe Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee of the Appropriations \nCommittee for yielding me time.\n  I thank the chairman, also, and his staff, especially John Martens, \nLeslie Albright, and Ashley Schiller, for working with the House \nScience, Space, and Technology Committee.\n  I especially appreciate the chairman's support for prioritizing the \nfunding of the basic research at the National Science Foundation. This \nresearch--especially in the areas of math and physical sciences, \nbiology, computing, and engineering--holds the promise of breakthroughs \nthat will trigger technological innovation, jump-start new industries, \nand spur economic growth.\n  This bill ensures that NSF is transparent and accountable to American \ntaxpayers about how their hard-earned dollars are spent and that NSF-\nsupported research is in the national interest.\n  The House CJS Appropriations bill also addresses concerns about the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's costly satellite \nprogram. In addition, this bill encourages NOAA to include private \nsector involvement in the space-based weather industry.\n  Finally, I thank Chairman Culberson for his reprioritization of NASA \nplanetary science, which implements the Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee's NASA authorization reported in April.\n  I further look forward to working with Chairman Culberson and \nChairman Rogers to fully fund the Orion and Commercial Crew programs so \nthat we can once again launch American astronauts on American rockets \nfrom American soil.\n  Again, I thank my friend from Texas, Chairman Culberson, for his \nenthusiasm and initiative and urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Culberson and the staff of the Commerce-\nJustice-Science Appropriations Subcommittee, especially John Martens, \nLeslie Albright and Ashley Schiller for working with the House Science, \nSpace, and Technology Committee. I particularly appreciate your support \nfor prioritizing the funding of the basic research at the National \nScience Foundation.\n  This research, especially in the areas of math and physical sciences, \nbiology, computing and engineering, holds the promise of breakthroughs \nthat will trigger technological innovation, jumpstart new industries \nand spur economic growth.\n  This bill also supports other language in the America COMPETES \nReauthorization Act of 2015, which passed the House two weeks ago.\n  It ensures that NSF is transparent and accountable to American \ntaxpayers about how their hard-earned dollars are spent and that NSF-\nsupported research is in the national interest.\n  The National Science Foundation has played an integral part in \nfunding breakthrough discoveries in numerous scientific fields such as \nlasers, the Internet and nanotechnology.\n  However, NSF has also approved dozens of grants for which the \nscientific merits and national interest are not obvious, to put it \npolitely.\n\n[[Page H3673]]\n\n  These include a climate change musical, a Norwegian tourism study, a \ngrant on human-set fires in New Zealand in the 1800's, a study of \nlawsuits in Peru in the 1600s, and a grant on the causes of stress in \nBolivia.\n  This bill supports the policy that every NSF public announcement of a \ngrant award must be accompanied by a non-technical explanation of the \nproject's scientific merits and a certification of how it serves the \nnational interest. This reinforces the standards set forth in the \nAmerica COMPETES Act of 2015.\n  The House CJS appropriations bill also addresses concerns about the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) costly \nsatellite program.\n  It ensures that appropriate oversight access is given to the Office \nof the Inspector General, the Government Accountability Office, and \nNOAA's own Independent Review Team. Likewise, recommendations from \nthese bodies will help guide the satellite programs as they move closer \nto their anticipated launch dates.\n  In addition, this bill encourages NOAA to include private sector \ninvolvement in the space-based weather industry.\n  NOAA's costly satellite programs have historically been plagued with \nmanagement problems. Encouraging NOAA to purchase services from the \nprivate sector will allow for a more robust, cost-effective and \nefficient weather forecasting system that will help save lives and \nproperty.\n  I look forward to offering an amendment shortly, with Chairman \nCulberson's support, to further enhance NOAA's weather research of \nnear-term, affordable and attainable advances in observational, \ncomputing and modeling capabilities. The amendment will result in \nsubstantial improvements in weather forecasts.\n  Finally, I thank Chairman Culberson for his re-prioritization of NASA \nplanetary science, which implements the Science Committees' NASA \nAuthorization reported in April.\n  I further look forward to working with Chairman Culberson and \nChairman Rogers to fully fund the Orion and Commercial Crew Programs so \nthat we can once again launch American astronauts on American rockets \nfrom American soil.\n  The Commercial Crew program will allow the U.S. access to the \nInternational Space Station without depending on Russia. The Orion \nprogram will expand human reach into deep space and serve as an \nemergency backup for the Commercial Crew program.\n  As we move forward with a Conference with the Senate, I hope that we \ncan identify ways to support these programs more robustly, perhaps by \nmoderating the growth of other accounts such as Earth Science, which \nhas increased 63 percent since 2007 while other areas of NASA have \nremained flat.\n  Again, I thank my friend from Texas, Chairman Culberson, for his \nenthusiasm and initiative on this bill and urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I have no additional speakers, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  We are going to move into a process of amendments in which the House \nwill work its will, but I think the general debate has illuminated a \nhost of areas where we agree and a few areas where we disagree.\n  The last speaker, my good friend from Texas, Lamar Smith, who has \ndone a lot of work, as he mentioned, there are some areas where we \nremain in disagreement, which is the notion that we should make some of \nthese changes in terms of science prioritization are issues that not \njust are there disagreements between the parties, but there is vast \nconcern in the scientific enterprise in the Nation, that we would \ninterject perhaps a viewpoint into science that would move away from \nmerit-based processes.\n  On that point, I look forward to the amendment process, and I thank \nthe House for listening to our points of view.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  As we conclude the debate on this bill, it is important for all of us \nhere today to know that, Members of the House, this process is open. \nMembers can come down to the floor and offer an amendment, 5 minutes \nper side.\n  We have in this bill prioritized our funding, as we all do in our \nprivate life and our business life. Following the good advice of \nfinancial guru Dave Ramsey, you don't spend money you don't have, and \ntry to eliminate debt at all possible costs.\n  We in the majority have done our very best to make sure that we are \nliving within our means. Although the budget caps--I know there is a \ngreat deal of frustration among my Democrat colleagues on the \nlimitations on spending. That is the law that was suggested initially \nby the White House.\n  It is important that we do all that we can to minimize the debt that \nwe pass on to our children and grandchildren. The budget caps are \nreality, and we have, within the limitations that we have, prioritized \nthe funding in this bill to make sure that law enforcement is number \none; the FBI and the Department of Justice are taken care of; that the \nNational Science Foundation, in fact, is funded at a historically high \nlevel. We have given them a $50 million increase.\n  We have also funded NASA at a historically high level since the \nApollo program. I would certainly like to see the American space \nprogram given more. As more money becomes available, if we find an \nopportunity as we move through conference, of course, we will work hard \nto make sure that we will plus-up funding for the sciences and space \nexploration everywhere we can.\n  I heard my colleagues mention the Legal Services Corporation, which \ndoes important work in representing the poor. We will certainly do our \nbest to find additional funding there.\n  I will also be filing legislation to give attorneys a tax deduction, \ndollar for dollar, for work that they do donating their time to the \npoor. I think that is a far better way to get legal services to the \npoor, through the Tax Code, rather than by appropriating our taxpayers' \nhard-earned tax dollars.\n  In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I want to point out to the Members that, \nabove all, this legislation will ensure that the laws, as enacted by \nCongress, are enforced. If Federal agencies want the privilege of \nspending and using our constituents' hard-earned tax dollars, they will \nneed to demonstrate through their spending plans, through their \npresentations to this committee, that they are actually enforcing the \nlaw as written by Congress.\n  We will, throughout the course of the year, engage in vigorous \noversight to ensure that our money is not only wisely spent, that it is \nprudently spent, that it is only spent when absolutely necessary, but \nthat our constituents' hard-earned tax dollars are only spent to \nenforce the law as written by the people's elected representatives.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us today in voting for this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2578.\n   The Internet is one of the great American success stories in our \nhistory, benefitting billions of people around the world. Congress has \na longstanding and bipartisan commitment to a global, open Internet, \nfree from governmental control. Our support for the decentralized, \nmulti-stakeholder approach to Internet governance has enabled its \ngrowth as an unparalleled platform for economic opportunity and \ndemocratic participation.\n   Last year the National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration (NTIA) announced that the U.S. government would take an \nimportant step to transition technical functions of the domain name \nsystem to the multi-stakeholder community. This transition of the \nInternet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to the private sector has \nbeen a U.S. policy goal for two decades, through Republican and \nDemocratic administrations alike.\n  Since NTIA's announcement, the multi-stakeholder community has \nstepped up to the plate to craft a transition proposal and enhanced \naccountability measures needed in the absence of U.S. government \nstewardship. NTIA has articulated specific criteria for the transition \nproposal and made clear that any plan must advance our vision of a free \nand open Internet.\n   Despite this significant progress, H.R. 2578 includes language that \nblocks NTIA from using funds to relinquish the IANA functions. This \nlimitation of funds is not only unnecessary, it sends the wrong message \nto the international community. Our diplomats point to the IANA \ntransition announcement as a key factor helping us win allies and \nsupport for an Internet free of government control. As the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce stated, this funding restriction ``could result in harm to \nU.S. businesses and Internet users as a whole.''\n\n[[Page H3674]]\n\n   While I oppose this provision in H.R. 2578, I agree with my \ncolleagues that the IANA transition must be conducted carefully and \ntransparently. That's why I'm working with my Republican colleagues at \nthe Energy and Commerce Committee on legislation to ensure NTIA \nimplements the IANA transition consistent with the principles we all \nsupport. Our legislation will address concerns about transparency and \naccountability, while reaffirming our commitment to the transition.\n   While I cannot support the funding restriction in H.R. 2578, I stand \nready to work with my colleagues on responsible oversight of the IANA \ntransition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  During consideration of the bill for amendment each amendment shall \nbe debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the \nproponent and an opponent and shall not be subject to amendment. No pro \nforma amendment shall be in order except that the chair and ranking \nminority member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective \ndesignees may offer up to 10 pro forma amendments each at any point for \nthe purpose of debate. The Chair of the Committee of the Whole may \naccord priority in recognition on the basis of whether the Member \noffering an amendment has caused it to be printed in the portion of the \nCongressional Record designated for that purpose. Amendments so printed \nshall be considered read.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2578\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following sums are appropriated, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes, namely:\n\n                                TITLE I\n\n                         DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE\n\n                   International Trade Administration\n\n                     operations and administration\n\n       For necessary expenses for international trade activities \n     of the Department of Commerce provided for by law, and for \n     engaging in trade promotional activities abroad, including \n     expenses of grants and cooperative agreements for the purpose \n     of promoting exports of United States firms, without regard \n     to sections 3702 and 3703 of title 44, United States Code; \n     full medical coverage for dependent members of immediate \n     families of employees stationed overseas and employees \n     temporarily posted overseas; travel and transportation of \n     employees of the International Trade Administration between \n     two points abroad, without regard to section 40118 of title \n     49, United States Code; employment of citizens of the United \n     States and aliens by contract for services; rental of space \n     abroad for periods not exceeding 10 years, and expenses of \n     alteration, repair, or improvement; purchase or construction \n     of temporary demountable exhibition structures for use \n     abroad; payment of tort claims, in the manner authorized in \n     the first paragraph of section 2672 of title 28, United \n     States Code, when such claims arise in foreign countries; not \n     to exceed $294,300 for official representation expenses \n     abroad; purchase of passenger motor vehicles for official use \n     abroad, not to exceed $45,000 per vehicle; obtaining \n     insurance on official motor vehicles; and rental of tie \n     lines, $472,000,000, to remain available until September 30, \n     2017, of which $10,000,000 is to be derived from fees to be \n     retained and used by the International Trade Administration, \n     notwithstanding section 3302 of title 31, United States Code: \n     Provided, That, of amounts provided under this heading, not \n     less than $16,400,000 shall be for China antidumping and \n     countervailing duty enforcement and compliance activities: \n     Provided further, That the provisions of the first sentence \n     of section 105(f) and all of section 108(c) of the Mutual \n     Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n     2455(f) and 2458(c)) shall apply in carrying out these \n     activities; and that for the purpose of this Act, \n     contributions under the provisions of the Mutual Educational \n     and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 shall include payment for \n     assessments for services provided as part of these \n     activities.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Goodlatte\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 10, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(decreased by $23,600,000)''.\n       Page 28, line 22, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(decreased by $2,733,000)''.\n       Page 30, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $293,000,000''.\n       Page 47, line 7, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(decreased by $45,000,000)''.\n       Page 49, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(decreased by $52,500,000)''.\n       Page 72, line 7, after the first dollar amount, insert \n     ``(decreased by $270,000,000)''.\n       Page 72, line 7, after the second dollar amount, insert \n     ``(decreased by $266,900,000)''.\n       Page 72, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(decreased by $4,000,000)''.\n       Page 72, line 14, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(decreased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the amendment be considered as read and printed in the \nRecord.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment restores necessary funding for the Federal \nPrisoner Detention program.\n  The Marshals Service assumes custody of individuals arrested by all \nFederal agencies and is responsible for the housing and transportation \nof prisoners from the time they are brought into Federal custody until \nthey are either acquitted or transferred to the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons' custody for incarceration.\n  The FPD program provides housing, medical care, and transportation \nfor Federal prisoners housed in non-Federal facilities and has an \naverage daily population of approximately 45,000 prisoners. This \nfunding is critical to ensuring that the United States Marshals Service \ncan provide safe, human care and custody for the approximately 204,000 \nFederal prisoners it will be responsible for in fiscal year 2016.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. Chairman, the fiscal year 2016 Commerce, Justice, Science \nAppropriations bill falls nearly $400 million short of the funding \nnecessary to maintain the Marshals Service's prisoner detention \noperations. This matter must be corrected. My amendment would simply \nreduce less critical accounts to make up for this astounding shortfall.\n  This amendment reduces youth mentoring programs by $45 million, \nleaving a generous sum of $50 million for youth mentoring.\n  My amendment also zeros out the new, unauthorized grant program to \nimprove police-community relations. While this concept may have merit, \nthe creation of such a program is the responsibility of the House \nJudiciary Committee.\n  This amendment also reduces funding for the International Trade \nAdministration by 5 percent and for the Community Relations Service by \n20 percent.\n  Finally, my amendment leaves $30 million in funding for the Legal \nServices Corporation to administer existing grants and to promote pro \nbono efforts.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Culberson), \nthe chairman of the subcommittee, who has worked with my staff very \ndiligently on a number of issues related to this matter, and I would be \nprepared to withdraw this amendment in lieu of all the difficulties he \nhas in finding funds for the priority he has but, nonetheless, hoping \nthat he will acknowledge that this is a priority that has been \nshortchanged and that we need to make sure that not only are these \nprisoners able to be held, and held according to law, but also that it \ndoes not give rise to prisoners being released in circumstances where \nthey otherwise should be held in incarceration.\n  So I am hoping that, if the gentleman would agree moving forward to \nhelp us try to find additional funds for this account, perhaps the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania would be willing to help as well, and I \nwould be willing to withdraw the amendment.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee to ensure that these prisoners are \nnot released. I will work diligently with my colleague from \nPhiladelphia to find additional funds as we move forward in\n\n[[Page H3675]]\n\nthe process. The last thing we want is these people being released.\n  It has been a privilege for me to work with you and your staff. I am \nvery privileged to follow in the footsteps of your colleague from \nVirginia, Frank Wolf, who was chairman of the CJS Subcommittee, and I \nhave continued that close working relationship. We will do everything \nwe can to find funding to make sure that these Federal prisoners are \nnot released early. That is a subject near and dear to my heart. I am \nvery sensitive to it.\n  We had a Federal judge in Texas running our prisons for 25 years, \nWilliam Wayne Justice; and I sued him, as a State representative, to \nend his control over the prisons because one of the main things he was \ndoing was causing the early release of prisoners to go victimize \nTexans, which is utterly unacceptable. So this is a top priority. I \nwill work with the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fattah).\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I obviously would work with the chairman on this and a \nwhole range of other items. The offsets that you have identified would \nbe very problematic, from my point of view. But I will work with the \nchairman. We need to make sure we fully fund the U.S. Marshals Service.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the chairman and the ranking member.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Guinta\n\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 10, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(reduced by $5,000,000)''.\n       Page 42, line 24, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.\n       Page 44, line 6, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom New Hampshire and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to \nthe Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill to increase the \nfunding for our Nation's drug courts by $5 million.\n  Drug courts keep people in treatment and can be one of the most \neffective intervention programs for those suffering from drug \naddiction. And just as important, these courts reduce crime, save \nmoney, and serve families and children affected by substance abuse.\n  Drug and substance abuse directly impacts our States, communities, \nlaw enforcement, and families across the country. In the past 5 years \nalone, in my home State of New Hampshire, overdoses have increased \nfivefold. Last year in the Granite State, deaths from heroin and \nillicit drug use exceeded auto-related deaths in the State. Drug use \nand abuse have devastated countless families from the Granite State.\n  Drug courts are transforming the criminal justice system across our \nNation by creating a systematic response to substance abuse and crime \nas an alternative to incarceration. It is not every day that we get to \ndirectly save lives in government. The drug courts program has proven \nto do just that.\n  I would also like to acknowledge and thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Congressman Lynch, for working with me on this amendment \nto ensure this much-needed funding.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment as we continue to tackle \nthe drug abuse epidemic that is plaguing communities around our Nation.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GUINTA. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's \namendment.\n  Drug courts are a proven way to get a good outcome for people who are \narrested for drug offenses. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nFattah) and the subcommittee have already funded the drug courts at $41 \nmillion, $5 million above the request. I think the gentleman's \namendment is a worthwhile increase, and I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  Mr. GUINTA. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time \nin opposition, even though I am not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, on that, I want to say something, and then \nI will yield to my colleague.\n  I led the effort in my home State to create drug courts when I was in \nthe State senate before any of my gray hairs. They have worked out \nspectacularly well in many places throughout the country. So I support \nthe gentleman from New Hampshire's amendment.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Lynch).\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from New \nHampshire (Mr. Guinta). He and I were of a similar mind in terms of \nthis amendment, and I am delighted that the chairman has accepted the \namendment.\n  We understand the good that drug courts do in our society and in our \nsystem. It actually combines the resources of family, the courts, law \nenforcement, substance abuse agencies, our local and town governments, \nState governments, and, of course, the Federal Government as well.\n  Drug addiction in the United States is an epidemic that affects every \ncity and town across America, and it cuts across every demographic. It \nleaves in its wake shattered lives and families and costs taxpayers \nhundreds of billions of dollars annually.\n  The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that the total overall \ncost of substance abuse in the United States, including lost \nproductivity and health and crime-related costs, exceeds $600 billion \nevery year. The institute also reports that drug addiction treatment \nhas been shown to reduce associated health and social costs by far more \nthan the costs of treatment, itself. Drug courts can be the first step \non the road back for those suffering with addiction.\n  Drug addiction is a disease, and people under the influence often act \nout of character. Society is beginning to recognize that we need to \ndeal with addiction and its outcome in a way that can have a positive \neffect on individuals and their families and communities. I believe \ndrug courts offer this opportunity by providing a support system and a \nroad map for moving forward.\n  The drug courts are specialized dockets which handle cases involving \ndrug- and/or alcohol-dependent offenders charged with nonviolent \noffenses determined to have been caused or influenced by their \naddiction.\n  I have visited many of the prisons in my State, and I would say, in \nsome cases, 80 to 90 percent of those inmates who are in there have \ndual addictions at the root of their problems.\n  I do want to recall the support that we received in the past from the \nformer chairman, Frank Wolf of Virginia, who is a good and decent man, \nand we miss him here. But I am glad to see that the current chairman is \nof a similar mind, and I want to thank him as well.\n  Mr. GUINTA. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to echo the sentiments of the gentleman from \nMassachusetts. This is a worthwhile attempt to try to help and heal \nfamilies, address our process of incarceration, but also to make sure \nthat we are doing the right thing for families across not just our \nregion in New England, but across the country.\n  I would also like to thank Appropriations Committee Chairman Rogers \nand Subcommittee Chairman Culberson for their hard work not just on \nthis component, an amendment to the bill, but the overall bill and the \ncommitment to this particular issue. Again, I would urge my colleagues \nto support the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H3676]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Reichert\n\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 10, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $1)''.\n       Page 4, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $1)''.\n       Page 7, line 8, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $100,000,000)''.\n       Page 42, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $100,000,000)''.\n       Page 43, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $100,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Washington and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Culberson and \nChairman Rogers for working together with Representatives Pascrell, \nDent, and Herrera Beutler to develop this amendment.\n  I rise today to offer this critical amendment with the colleagues \nthat I just mentioned. This amendment increases the Edward Byrne \nMemorial Justice Assistance Grant Program by $100 million and decreases \nthe Census Bureau by an equal amount.\n  Last year, the COPS Hiring Program received bipartisan support and \nwas funded at $180 million in the omnibus. Unfortunately, the \nunderlying legislation completely eliminates the COPS Hiring Program.\n  While we cannot restore COPS Hiring Programs and add them back into \nthe bill due to House rules governing consideration of appropriation \nmeasures, we can help ease the burden and mitigate the impact of the \nprogram's elimination on local law enforcement by passing this \nbipartisan amendment.\n  To continue to meet the needs of police departments across the \ncountry, this additional $100 million for Byrne JAG should specifically \nbe used for grants to police departments for hiring. Ensuring the \nsafety of our communities and neighborhoods should be one of our first \npriorities, and we cannot do without a sufficient number of police \nofficers.\n  Mr. Chairman, the police officers and law enforcement agencies across \nthis country are asked to do more and more with less and less, and let \nme just give you some examples.\n  When I was the sheriff in Seattle, I provided deputies to Federal \ntask force efforts, the Joint Fugitive Task Force; the Joint Terrorism \nTask Force; the HIDTA Task Force, the High Intensity Drug Trafficking \nArea Task Force; the fusion center; and I could go on with some others.\n  The role that local law enforcement plays in the efforts of Federal \nlaw enforcement are integral. They are interconnected. They can't be \nseparated. It is a team effort from the Federal law enforcement \nagencies to the local law enforcement agencies. And sometimes people in \nthis Chamber get confused as to what the local law enforcement's role \nis when it comes to Federal responsibility.\n  I will just give you an example of one of my own personal \nexperiences. Early in my career as a police officer, a sheriff's deputy \non the streets in the mid-seventies, I made a traffic stop. I came \nacross a young lady who happened to be in the employment of somebody \nwho was connected to a crime syndicate within the Washington State area \nwho was operating human trafficking operations from Texas to Anchorage, \nand not only that, but they were involved in drug trafficking.\n  So I developed this informant as a patrol officer driving around in \nmy patrol car. You would never think that I might have the opportunity \nto bust a big case like this. But this is just an example of the day-\nto-day activity that police officers operate in, and they collect this \ninformation. I took it to the Federal agency responsible. I went to the \nDEA.\n  I had a secret meeting in a hotel room in downtown Seattle. The \ninformant wouldn't trust the Federal operatives, but she trusted me. So \nI had to bring her there. We came up with a plan for me to travel to \nTexas. It is a long story. I won't get into the rest of it. But I think \nthat everyone in this room gets the picture of how critical it is for \nus to integrate Federal and local law enforcement and that we have a \nresponsibility, as the United States Congress, on the House side and on \nthe Senate side, to support those efforts.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  As matter of fact, Mr. Chairman, I was hired under a Federal grant in \n1972 called the PEP program. I would not have had a 33-year career if I \nwasn't hired with Federal money. So this $100 million is going to be so \nmuch appreciated by our men and women.\n  I want to mention just one other criminal aspect of this bill. It is \nnot perfect. No bill is perfect. The law enforcement community is not \nperfect. We are not perfect. Congress is not perfect. The community is \nnot perfect. We need to stop looking at the negative and the bad in all \nof these organizations together and start looking at the good, come \ntogether, and figure out a solution to bringing police and community \ntogether.\n  Today there aren't enough cops on the street. The community policing \nprogram has, in some parts of this country, been eliminated or cut \nback. So school resource officers are gone in some communities. \nStorefront officers are gone. They are gone, Mr. Chairman, and we need \nto bring them back. We can do it together. We can solve this problem \nand keep our community safe.\n  I appreciate the gentleman and the time you have allowed me.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, even \nthough I am not in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I gladly yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Culberson), my chairman, if he has any more to add on \nthis matter before I yield to my colleague over here.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I thank the gentleman, just to say that, as you know, \nwe discussed in full committee that the purpose of our bill was to \nshift the COPS hiring because it has not been reauthorized a number of \nyears over to the Byrne JAG Program, which can be used for hiring \nbecause these are grant applications that can be tailored for your \nspecific community. You can be sure the money is targeted precisely for \nyour needs in Seattle or Philadelphia, so the Byrne JAG Program money \ncan indeed be used for hiring police officers.\n  I strongly support the gentleman's amendment because it will allow \nmore community hiring of police officers, and that is a good thing. God \nbless all our law enforcement officers, and we can't give them enough \nsupport.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nPascrell).\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member and my brother \nin the Law Enforcement Caucus, David Reichert, from Washington.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who have joined in a strong show of \nbipartisan support for the COPS program, Ms. Herrera Beutler and Mr. \nDent included.\n  Let us be clear what this amendment does. The Reichert amendment \nincreases funding for the Byrne JAG by $100 million for hiring \npurposes, a critical step--I think, an important message.\n  Our amendment is supported by the major voices in the law enforcement \ncommunity, including the National Association of Police Organizations, \nthe Major County Sheriffs Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, \nand the Sergeant Benevolent Association, so I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  But despite all of the debate about community policing happening \nacross our Nation, as Mr. Reichert referred to, the American people \nneed to know that, despite what our amendment does, the underlying bill \neliminates the Federal COPS Hiring Program. It is simply unacceptable \nthat every year we ask the law enforcement community to do more and \nmore with less and less.\n  Mr. Chairman, in last year's House bill, the COPS program was cut by \n$109 million, 61 percent. So we can pontificate all we want about how \nwe are behind the police officers of this country,\n\n[[Page H3677]]\n\nbut what we continue to do with successful programs, successful \nprograms by any account, cut and cut. We were able to restore some of \nthe money thanks to David Reichert and a few other people from both \nsides of the aisle, thanks to you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member.\n  This year--this, despite being joined by over 150 of our colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle in asking the committee to support the \nCOPS program--you gutted it. We can't even amend it. It is done. It is \nover.\n  As a cornerstone of the Federal Government's efforts to assist State \nand local law enforcement, COPS Hiring has funded over 127,000 public \nsafety officer positions. David Reichert was on the front line. He can \nspeak to the issue over and over again. He has been there and done it. \nI just can talk about it.\n  Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member, it is plain and simple. Fewer \ncops on the beat mean more crime on the street. Fewer cops on the beat \nmean more crime on our streets. I ask you--I ask you to do everything \nin your power, as you have done in the past--to restore what I think is \nprobably one of the most efficient programs in the entire Federal \nGovernment, the COPS program.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, let me say in conclusion that I join with the chairman. \nI support this amendment. I support the COPS program.\n  For 20 years, the Federal Government has been engaged in this, \nlaunched under President Clinton, which has reduced crime in our \ncountry, has saved lives, has made communities safer. And even though \nthere is some disagreement about the authorization, there is no \ndisagreement, I don't believe, that we should be providing resources. I \nthink the gentleman articulated on the front end of this discussion how \nintertwined local police are with our Federal law enforcement efforts \nand how critically indispensable they are in these efforts.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. Chairman, if I could point out to my good friend from New Jersey \nwhat we have done is simply shift the program over to the Byrne JAG \nProgram, because with Byrne JAG you can customize your application for \nNew Jersey, for Philadelphia, or for Seattle. You can hire police \nofficers under the Byrne JAG Program. We shifted the program over to \nByrne JAG because it is far more effective and can be tailored to your \ncommunity.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment because with this \namendment we are restoring the funding for the COPS Hiring Program, but \ndoing it through a far more effective and locally tailored program, the \nByrne JAG Program. So I would urge all my colleagues to support this \nbipartisan amendment.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, we are in agreement, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Reichert).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Poliquin\n\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 10, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $44,000,000)''.\n       Page 6, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $8,000,000)''.\n       Page 7, line 8, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $36,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Maine and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maine.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, families in northern, central, western, and downeast \nMaine are some of the hardest working, most honest people you can find \nin the country. They expect and they want a more effective and a more \naccountable government that works for them, sir, and not against them.\n  Now, one of the most important jobs of the Federal Government is to \nmake sure that we protect American workers against unfair and unlawful \ntrade practices. This is very clear in our Constitution, and the \nFounding Fathers made this clear to us all.\n  Today, here in Washington, the International Trade Administration is \nresponsible for enforcing these trade rules. Last year, three of our \nmajor paper mills in our district, the Second District of Maine, in \nBucksport, Old Town, and Millinocket, closed. Mr. Chairman, 1,000 of \nthe most skilled paper makers in the world are no longer working, and \nthose 1,000 paychecks are no longer flowing to their families to help \nthem care for their kids.\n  This year in central Maine, in Madison, Maine, a fourth paper mill is \nnow facing difficulty and has temporarily shut down a couple of times \nand furloughed another 200 workers. Now, if you talk to the folks that \nown the mill and work on the floor in Madison, they cite two reasons: \nnumber one is the high cost of energy to run their machinery; secondly, \na provincial government in Canada has provided about $125 million of \nunfair subsidies to a competing paper mill across the border. These \nsubsidies, which are unlawful and unfair, have allowed this competing \npaper mill to buy new equipment and to subsidize the cost of energy to \nrun their machinery. As a result, the price of supercalendered paper \nthat is made across the border and also in Madison, Maine, has \nplummeted, causing our mill in Madison to temporarily shut down and \nfurlough its workers.\n  Now this, Mr. Chairman, is not right, and this is not fair. American \nworkers are the best in the world. We can compete with anybody in any \nindustry in the global marketplace as long as it is a level playing \nfield.\n  As our office, Mr. Chair, got involved in this issue, the ITA made it \nvery clear to us that they did not have the staff able to fully address \nthis issue in what we believe to be a full, thorough, and comprehensive \ninvestigation, including a number of different paper mills, when it \ncomes to these unfair subsidies.\n  Up in our district, we are very frugal. We are fiscal conservatives. \nThe folks in Maine can stretch a dollar, Mr. Chair, wider than anybody \nelse in the country. So I am not suggesting that we increase the size \nof government and we increase spending. Quite the opposite. I believe \nour government is too big and too intrusive. However, I do have a \nsolution to this problem.\n  My amendment, Mr. Chair, asks that we transfer less than 5 percent of \nthe funding this year going to the Census Bureau to the ITA such that \nthey have the resources to thoroughly and effectively conduct an \ninvestigation dealing with these unfair provincial subsidies in Canada.\n  Now, not only will a thorough and fair investigation help our workers \nat the Madison mill in central Maine, but it will also help the backlog \nof cases at the ITA that affect tens of thousands of workers in various \nindustries all throughout America. We all know in this room, on both \nsides of the aisle, that fair trade results in more jobs.\n  All of us here in this Chamber want to make sure we do everything \nhumanly possible to help our companies grow, be more competitive, more \nsuccessful, and hire more workers. When that happens, Mr. Chairman, our \nworkers have better lives with more opportunities, more freedom, and \nless government dependence.\n  This is about jobs, Mr. Chair, and it is all about national security. \nI ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and \nDemocrats, to please support this amendment to make sure that we have \nfair trade in this country.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly rise in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleague to consider \nwithdrawing the amendment. I would like to work with him to ensure that \nthis case is investigated. The ITA is funded at a level of over $470 \nmillion.\n  I can only imagine how devastating this must be to the families there \nin Madison, Maine, that have lost their\n\n[[Page H3678]]\n\njobs and had their jobs furloughed and suspended because of an unfair \nsubsidy right across the border. This is exactly what ITA is supposed \nto be doing. The Appropriations Committee has extraordinary influence \nover these agencies, and this is exactly the kind of case the ITA \nshould be working on.\n  I want to pledge to you my full support and assistance in making sure \nthat this case is investigated and pursued aggressively if you consider \nwithdrawing the amendment, because the Census has gotten hammered \npretty hard. They just had $100 million transferred over to COPS \nHiring. And if we could, I would certainly like to work with you as we \nmove forward in ensuring that this case is investigated and handled.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I would also work with the chairman on this matter to \nmake sure this is fully reviewed and investigated.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Maine.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate it very much.\n  Although I do believe, sir, that jobs are more important than \ncounting people, we will use the full authority of our office to help \nour workers at the Madison Mill to make sure that we do everything to \nhave a level playing field.\n  I will withdraw this amendment, and I accept your pledge to do \neverything within your power and authority to please help our paper \nworkers, the most skilled in the world, in central Maine.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. We will be on it and help you. I look forward to doing \nso aggressively and in a timely manner. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Maine?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                    Bureau of Industry and Security\n\n                     operations and administration\n\n       For necessary expenses for export administration and \n     national security activities of the Department of Commerce, \n     including costs associated with the performance of export \n     administration field activities both domestically and abroad; \n     full medical coverage for dependent members of immediate \n     families of employees stationed overseas; employment of \n     citizens of the United States and aliens by contract for \n     services abroad; payment of tort claims, in the manner \n     authorized in the first paragraph of section 2672 of title \n     28, United States Code, when such claims arise in foreign \n     countries; not to exceed $13,500 for official representation \n     expenses abroad; awards of compensation to informers under \n     the Export Administration Act of 1979, and as authorized by \n     section 1(b) of the Act of June 15, 1917 (40 Stat. 223; 22 \n     U.S.C. 401(b)); and purchase of passenger motor vehicles for \n     official use and motor vehicles for law enforcement use with \n     special requirement vehicles eligible for purchase without \n     regard to any price limitation otherwise established by law, \n     $110,000,000, to remain available until expended: Provided, \n     That the provisions of the first sentence of section 105(f) \n     and all of section 108(c) of the Mutual Educational and \n     Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2455(f) and 2458(c)) \n     shall apply in carrying out these activities: Provided \n     further, That payments and contributions collected and \n     accepted for materials or services provided as part of such \n     activities may be retained for use in covering the cost of \n     such activities, and for providing information to the public \n     with respect to the export administration and national \n     security activities of the Department of Commerce and other \n     export control programs of the United States and other \n     governments.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. McClintock\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk \ninvolving page 3, line 10.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the Clerk will report the \namendment.\n  There was no objection.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 10, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $311,788,000)''.\n       Page 98, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $311,788,000)''.\n\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I think we have passed that point in the \nbill.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I had risen before we had passed that \npoint in the bill and was not recognized.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I don't think it is any fault of your own. I am just \nsaying for the technical matter I think that we have.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has two amendments at \nthe desk, one to the pending paragraph and one to the previous \nparagraph.\n  The Chair is entertaining the one to the previous paragraph by \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Is this the one that the Clerk just read?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is correct. That is the amendment \nthat the Clerk just read and addressing page 3, line 10.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman from California and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, this amendment enacts a CBO \nrecommendation to eliminate the trade promotion activities of the \nInternational Trade Administration to save almost $312 million.\n  What does the ITA do exactly? Well, it has some legitimate functions \nenforcing trade agreements and treaties. This amendment leaves these \nfunctions untouched.\n  But the ITA also does trade promotion activities. To quote from its \nown material, it ``provides counseling to American companies in order \nto develop the most profitable and sustainable plans for pricing, \nexport, and the full range of public and private trade promotion \nassistance. . .as well as market intelligence, and industry and market \nspecific research.''\n  Well, this is all well and good, but isn't that what businesses and \ntrade associations are supposed to do and used to do with their own \nmoney? Why should taxpayers pay for the profits of private companies?\n  If a specific business or industry is the sole beneficiary of these \nservices, shouldn't it be the sole financier of them, either \nindividually or collectively through trade associations?\n  True, this program has been around for generations, but Franklin \nRoosevelt, who was hardly a champion of smaller government, had the \nright idea when he slashed its budget in 1932 and closed 31 of its \noffices. The problem is that reform didn't take. ITA now has over 250 \noffices and several thousand personnel around the world.\n  The ITA's authorization lapsed in 1996--19 years ago. It has not been \nreviewed or authorized by Congress since then, but we still keep \nshoveling money out the door.\n  Although it hasn't been reviewed by Congress in all of these years, \nit has been thoroughly weighed by the Congressional Budget Office, the \nOffice of Management and Budget, and the President's fiscal commission, \nand they have all found it sadly wanting. The Simpson-Bowles report \nsummed it up nicely when they said:\n  ``Services provided by ITA's U.S. Commercial Services and other \ndivisions directly providing assistance to U.S. companies should be \nfinanced by beneficiaries of this assistance. While the agency charges \nfees for those services, its fees do not cover the cost of all of its \nactivities. Additionally, it is argued that the benefits of trade \npromotion activities are passed on to foreigners in the form of \ndecreased export costs.''\n  Simpson-Bowles then goes on to say:\n  ``According to a study by the Office of Management and Budget, \nbusinesses can receive similar services from State, local, and private \nsector entities.''\n  This CBO option to eliminate ITA's promotion activities saves $312 \nmillion in 2016 and $3.5 billion through 2024.\n  Mr. Chairman, if the CBO, the OMB, and the President's fiscal \ncommission all agree this is wasteful and Congress hasn't bothered to \nreauthorize it since it expired 19 years ago, why do we continue to \nspend money that we don't have duplicating services the beneficiaries \nof those services either don't need or are perfectly capable of funding \non their own?\n  And if the companies that we are told directly benefit from these so-\ncalled ``essential'' services aren't willing to\n\n[[Page H3679]]\n\nfund them, maybe that is just nature's way of telling us we shouldn't \nbe fleecing our constituents' earnings to pay for them either.\n  And why would we tap American taxpayers to subsidize the export \nactivities of foreigners, as Simpson-Bowles notes?\n  The rules of the House were specifically written to prevent this type \nof unauthorized expenditure, and they provide for a point of order to \nbe raised if it is included in an appropriations bill. That is exactly \nwhat we have here. But alas, that rule is routinely waived when these \nmeasures are brought to the floor, making this amendment necessary.\n  This is a prime example of corporate welfare, and we ought to be done \nwith it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I share my colleague Mr. McClintock's \nfeeling about programs that are unauthorized and share his passion for \nensuring we don't spend money we don't have.\n  But as the gentleman from Maine was just out here a moment ago, Mr. \nPoliquin has a perfect example of one of the really valid and very \nimportant functions of the ITA, and that is to identify subsidies that \nare unfair, that imbalance our trade with a foreign nation. As he \npointed out, the Canadian Government is unfairly subsidizing a paper \nmill right directly across the border from his constituents in Madison, \nMaine, and caused the furloughing of workers at the Madison paper mill. \nAnd as I just pledged to Mr. Poliquin, I want to make sure that ITA is \ndoing its job when it comes to identifying and enacting some measures \nto counterbalance unfair trade practices like that.\n  I would agree with my friend from California: when it comes to \npromoting American business, that is the job of the Chamber of \nCommerce; when it comes to making sure that American businesses get the \nword out and shares information, that is something American businesses \nought to do; but when it comes to unfair subsidies given by foreign \ngovernments to their businesses that cause American workers to lose \ntheir jobs, that is exactly what the ITA is designed to do. We need \ntrade enforcement, we need countervailing duties, and we need export \nassistance.\n  The amendment which the gentleman from California has offered looks \nto be about a 70 percent cut. I would be happy to work with you and \nfind some ways to find savings within the agency when it comes to \npromoting American businesses because I am a big believer. Let the \nChamber of Commerce do it.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. This amendment leaves all of those legitimate \nactivities of the ITA intact. It still leaves $160 million of \nactivities. All it does is to defund the trade promotion activities \nthat the CBO recognized as being wasteful, as did OMB, as did Simpson-\nBowles.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Well, the scale of the reduction to reduce the agency \nby $311,788,000 so abruptly is going to eliminate the ability, for \nexample, to help Mr. Poliquin and other businesses like theirs across \nthe country that are suffering from unfair subsidies by foreign \ngovernments. So, unfortunately, I need to oppose the amendment. A 70 \npercent cut is simply not sustainable. And Mr. Poliquin, I think, made \na very eloquent case just a moment ago for the type of work the ITA \nneeds to do. So I would need to urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I would be happy to yield to my friend from \nPhiladelphia.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I thank the gentleman.\n  I also oppose the amendment. The business of our country is, I think, \nappropriate in making sure that our businesses are not locked out of a \nmarket around the world. Only 2 percent of American businesses export \nanywhere, and we need to have a robust effort because 90 percent of the \nworld's consumers live somewhere else. We do have a reality that other \ngovernments are aggressive about promoting their business \nopportunities. If we want Americans to have jobs here, some of those \nare connected to these opportunities. So I thank the chairman, and I \nsuggest that this is not an amendment that would be in the interest of \nthe American business community or workers.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I think the scale of the cut would be \ndevastating to the agency. Houston, Texas, is one of the premier \nexporting centers of the United States, and it is important that we do \neverything in our power. The Federal Government does have an obligation \nto enforce trade agreements to make sure that trade is fair and free \nand that subsidies that are unfairly used by foreign governments to \nsupport their own industries, that we have got some way to \ncounterbalance that. That is the essential function of this agency. So, \ntherefore, I would ask Members to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I want to reiterate that this does not \nin any way affect the enforcement activities of the ITA. It does not in \nany way affect the measures that Mr. Poliquin of Maine just referenced. \nIt affects only the trade promotion activities of the ITA that have \nbeen singled out time and again as being duplicative of what the \ncompanies profiting from these activities should be paying for \nthemselves or are duplicative of other programs. It is only the trade \npromotion activities. None of the enforcement activities are affected \nby this amendment. I would ask for an ``aye'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                  Economic Development Administration\n\n                economic development assistance programs\n\n       For grants for economic development assistance as provided \n     by the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, for \n     trade adjustment assistance, for grants authorized by section \n     27 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 \n     (15 U.S.C. 3722), $213,000,000, to remain available until \n     expended.\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses of administering the economic \n     development assistance programs as provided for by law, \n     $37,000,000: Provided, That these funds may be used to \n     monitor projects approved pursuant to title I of the Public \n     Works Employment Act of 1976, title II of the Trade Act of \n     1974, section 27 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology \n     Innovation Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C. 3722), and the Community \n     Emergency Drought Relief Act of 1977.\n\n                  Minority Business Development Agency\n\n                     minority business development\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Department of Commerce in \n     fostering, promoting, and developing minority business \n     enterprise, including expenses of grants, contracts, and \n     other agreements with public or private organizations, \n     $32,000,000.\n\n                   Economics and Statistics Analysis\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses, as authorized by law, of economic \n     and statistical analysis programs of the Department of \n     Commerce, $100,000,000, to remain available until September \n     30, 2017.\n\n                          Bureau of the Census\n\n                      current surveys and programs\n\n       For necessary expenses for collecting, compiling, \n     analyzing, preparing and publishing statistics, provided for \n     by law, $265,000,000: Provided, That, from amounts provided \n     herein, funds may be used for promotion, outreach, and \n     marketing activities: Provided further, That the Bureau of \n     the Census shall collect data for the Annual Social and \n     Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey using \n     the same health insurance questions included in previous \n     years, in addition to the revised questions implemented in \n     the Current Population Survey beginning in February 2014.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Nugent\n\n  Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page H3680]]\n\n\n       Page 6, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $4,000,000)''.\n       Page 44, line 8, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $2,000,000)''.\n       Page 46, line 7, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $2,000,000)''.\n       Page 42, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $4,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Chairman, each day more and more Americans are \nrealizing that we need to take action to deal with mental health issues \nin this country. We need to make it a priority.\n  My amendment, in keeping with that sentiment, would provide \nadditional funding for programs under the Mentally Ill Offender \nTreatment and Crime Reduction Act and for Veterans Treatment Courts.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  These are programs with proven track records of effectively \naddressing some of the important issues associated with mental health \nillnesses. My amendment would offset this increase by taking $4 million \nfrom the periodic censuses and programs account.\n  Mr. Chairman, both of the programs that would receive an increase in \nfunding under my amendment highlight the need for our justice and \nmental health systems to work together. As a former sheriff, I can tell \nyou that cooperation is vital. If our justice and mental health systems \nare collaborating, we can provide more positive outcomes not only for \nthose with mental health illnesses, but for our taxpayers as well.\n  Grants provided under MIOTCRA are used, among other purposes, to set \nup mental health courts, for community reentry services, and for \ntraining State and local law enforcement officers to help identify and \ndeescalate mental health crises, which saves the lives of both the \nmentally ill and of the responding officers.\n  During my 37 years as a cop, I saw firsthand how our jails were \nbecoming warehouses for people with mental health needs. No one is well \nserved by this process, not those with mental illness, not our \ntaxpayers, and, certainly, as I spoke earlier, not our veterans. Let me \nprovide you with some numbers to illustrate what actually is going on \nwithin our jails.\n  According to the Florida Mental Health Institute, over a 5-year \nperiod, 97 individuals from Miami-Dade County accounted for 2,200 \nbookings in the county jail; 27,000 days in the jail; and 13,000 days \nin crisis units, State hospitals, and emergency rooms.\n  The cost to the State and to local taxpayers was nearly $13 million \nfor just 97 people. However, the type of programs my amendment supports \nhave been shown to dramatically reduce those rates.\n  In Pinellas County, for instance, which is another Florida county, a \nmental health jail diversion program showed an 87 percent reduction in \nrearrests for the nearly 3,000 offenders who were enrolled. Not only \ndoes my amendment support these programs, but it also recognizes the \nunique responsibility that we have to our veterans.\n  Veterans are disproportionately affected by mental health illnesses. \nEven more, they would likely not have these issues if it weren't for \ntheir service to this country. We owe them a better outcome, and \nVeterans Treatment Courts can help. My point is that they are some of \nthe best investments we can make.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I am \nnot opposed to the gentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I support the gentleman's amendment. \nVeterans courts and mental health courts do great work. It is a very \nimportant role that they serve.\n  I want to also thank the gentleman for his service as a police \nofficer. We just simply cannot thank our police officers enough for the \ngood work that they do, and I strongly support the gentleman's \namendment.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I support the gentleman's amendment, and I thank him for \noffering it.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Collins).\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I appreciate the gentleman from Florida for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Nugent-Collins \namendment, which provides critical additional funding for Veterans \nTreatment Courts and mental health courts.\n  I have seen firsthand the difference that mental health courts and \nVeterans Treatment Courts can make. Over the course of the past few \nmonths in and around the Ninth District and all over Georgia, this is \nsomething that I have worked on not only in the State of Georgia, but \nalso now in working nationally here with my friend from Florida.\n  Our jails are not mental health facilities, but we continue to use \nthem that way, despite the fact that they are not in anyone's best \ninterest. By treating the mentally ill with compassion, we can provide \nthem a second chance to get better.\n  We can also cut costs, empower States, reduce recidivism, and ensure \nthat law enforcement officers can focus on protecting the safety of the \npublic. By investing in Veterans Treatment Courts, we can better serve \nthose who have served us, and we can address PTSD and related issues in \na more meaningful way.\n  I appreciate Mr. Nugent and his tireless leadership on this issue in \nadvocating for a better, more sensible approach. Together, we \nintroduced the Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act, which would \nexpand and further improve upon the mental health and Veterans \nTreatment Court programs that are funded by H.R. 2578.\n  I just want to encourage everyone to support this amendment. Again, \nlet's take an honest, serious look at how we are dealing with those \nwith mental health issues.\n  Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Fattah).\n  Mr. FATTAH. I talked to our colleague from Georgia, who just spoke on \nthis matter, and I know he has talked about how this is really \ncritically important for veterans.\n  It is a population that we have to be concerned about, so I want to \nthank you again for offering this, and the chairman and I agree.\n  Mr. NUGENT. In reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the \nchairman of the subcommittee and I appreciate the ranking member in \ntheir support of this because it really is about how we deal with our \nfellow man.\n  It is about a way that we shouldn't be criminalizing mental health \ndisorders. That is the worst thing that we can do. As a police officer \nand as a sheriff for over 38 years, I have seen the effects of \nuntreated mental illness, particularly in the county jails where they \nare now warehoused.\n  I truly do appreciate the support across the board, and I will tell \nyou that our law enforcement officers and our correctional officers \nwill support it also.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The question is on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Nugent).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                     periodic censuses and programs\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       For necessary expenses for collecting, compiling, \n     analyzing, preparing and publishing statistics for periodic \n     censuses and programs provided for by law, $848,000,000, to \n     remain available until September 30, 2017: Provided, That, \n     from amounts provided herein, funds may be used for \n     promotion, outreach, and marketing activities: Provided \n     further, That within the amounts appropriated, $1,551,000 \n     shall be transferred to the ``Office of Inspector General'' \n     account for activities associated with carrying out \n     investigations and audits related to the Bureau of the \n     Census: Provided further, That not more than 50 percent of \n     the amounts made available under this heading for information \n     technology related to 2020 census delivery, including the\n\n[[Page H3681]]\n\n     Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing (CEDCaP) \n     program, may be obligated until the Secretary submits to the \n     Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate a plan for expenditure that (1) identifies for \n     each CEDCaP project/investment over $25,000 (a) the \n     functional and performance capabilities to be delivered and \n     the mission benefits to be realized, (b) the estimated \n     lifecycle cost, including estimates for development as well \n     as maintenance and operations, and (c) key milestones to be \n     met; (2) details for each project/investment (a) reasons for \n     any cost and schedule variances, and (b) top risks and \n     mitigation strategies, and (3) has been submitted to the \n     Government Accountability Office.\n\n\n                 Amendment Offered by Mr. Poe of Texas\n\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 7, line 8, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(reduced by $17,300,000)''.\n       Page 38, line 9, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(increased by $17,300,000)''.\n       Page 41, line 14, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(increased by $17,300,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, Congress has made it clear that it \nwill not stand for this new scourge that we are finding in our country \nof human sex trafficking. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act \npassed the United States Senate 99-0, and it passed the House of \nRepresentatives before that with only 3 Members voting against it and \nall 400-plus voting for it.\n  Modern-day slavery does happen in the United States. It is a \nmultibillion-dollar business. It is second only to the international \ncrime syndicates of drug trafficking for the amount of money that is \nraised. It is not time for us to lower the amount of money we have for \ngrants that will assist the victims of this scourge. That is why my \namendment brings in just $17.3 million to this fund that was cut. This \n$17.3 million will bring it up to last year's level so that $43 million \nwill go for victim services and victim grants.\n  Where does this money come from? From where are we taking it? We are \ntaking it out of the periodic censuses and programs and applying it to \nthis fund.\n  The periodic censuses and programs--let me make it clear--is not the \nconstitutional census counting that is required to be done by the \nCensus Bureau. This is another program that the Census Bureau has. It \nis sometimes called the American Community Survey, which is very \nintrusive.\n  Without really much choice, it asks citizens numerous questions that \nare an invasion of their privacy. For example: What time do you go to \nwork? What time do you get home from work? Does anybody in your \nhousehold have a mental illness or disease? They are questions such as \nthese that are very intrusive. The Census Bureau shouldn't be asking \nthese questions.\n  Set aside that anyway. With this money, rather than asking people in \nthe community--citizens--to tell us what time they go to work or what \ntime they go during the day to different appointments, like doctors' \nappointments, we should show the priority of putting just $17 million \nof that money back into this appropriation to help the victims of \ntrafficking.\n  It will bring it up to last year's level of a mere $43 million of \ngrant money. That is what this legislation does. It ensures that we are \ntelling trafficking victims there will be money available for grants to \nassist them and money available for law enforcement to assist them in \ntheir training.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, even \nthough I am not in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Fattah) is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, first of all, this is where you can find \nthe contradictions of public policy with the interjection of politics, \nright?\n  I totally agree with the purpose, but I totally disagree with the \nunderlying notion that this money is not important to the Census. First \nand foremost, I agree with the amendment and that we should invest in \nanother $16 million in helping victims of human trafficking.\n  It is a major problem in our country--in my part of the country, in \nyour part of the country, and throughout our Nation. We should do more, \nso I support the amendment.\n  I don't want us to assume that the periodic census dollars are not \nimportant, however, and are not part of the constitutionally mandated \ncensus as they are part of the 2020 preparation. We will have to deal \nwith that in some other way, but I don't want to because I agree with \nthe amendment. That is not to suggest that I agree with the underlying \nthought that this money is not important to the Census.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to join \nhim in supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, we have a terrible problem in this country with human \nslavery and with human sex trafficking. My colleague from Texas is \nexactly right, and I strongly support his amendment.\n  I also share his concern about the American Community Survey, and I \nintend to pursue aggressive oversight during the months ahead. I do \nthink it is intrusive. Our right to be left alone as Americans is one \nof our most important rights, so I share the gentleman's concern about \nthe American Community Survey.\n  We have a responsibility to make sure the Census is funded, but this \nis a very important amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it \nto help combat this disgraceful scourge of human trafficking.\n  Mr. FATTAH. In reclaiming my time, I am glad that we are all in \nagreement. I don't want families to be left alone, though, if they have \nsomeone who is suffering from mental health illnesses.\n  The reason that question is asked in a community survey is so that, \nwhen we are doing funding for communities for mental health services, \nwe know where the impact of those dollars can be most applied. The \ncensus is taken for a good reason, but let us agree for the moment on \nthe amendment, and let's move on.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the ranking member and I thank the \nchairman, as well, for their comments.\n  Mr. Chairman, the issue is not the American Community Survey. The \nissue is where we are going to get this money to bring this fund up to \nlast year's level. It is going to come from that portion of the Census \nthat is about $800 million, and that is why that section was picked. We \nneed to have this lively debate about the American Community Survey in \nsome other setting.\n  Right now, let's take care of trafficking victims in the United \nStates and provide them grants, and let's provide law enforcement \ngrants and victim services grants so that they can help minor sex \ntrafficking victims who are being trafficked throughout the United \nStates.\n  I appreciate the ranking member's support and the chairman's support.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  My amendment is intended to ensure that the important forensic \nstandards work at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nor NIST, is fully funded.\n  The criminal justice system relies on forensic science to identify \nand prosecute criminals and to exonerate the falsely accused. Justice \nis not served by either the falsely accused or the victims and their \nfamilies when the wrong person is imprisoned.\n  In a series of investigations over the last few years, The Washington \nPost, the Innocence Project, and the FBI itself have reported on a \nflawed forensic work that may be responsible for wrongful convictions \nin thousands of criminal cases.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Innocent people have spent decades in prison, and our State certainly \nknows about many of them--my home county, as a matter of fact. Some may \nhave already been put to death while the guilty have gone free.\n  These investigations have covered hair analysis, bite mark analysis, \nand even DNA, which most people previously believed to be 100 percent \naccurate and reliable. In short, there has been a steady stream of bad \nnews about flawed forensic work being used in criminal court. And I \nworry that we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg.\n  In a year 2009 report, ``Strengthening Forensic Science in the United \nStates: A Path Forward,'' the National Academy of Sciences found that \nthe interpretation of forensic evidence is severely compromised by the \nlack of supporting science and standards.\n  Many forensic techniques and technologies lack a scientific \nfoundation. Operational principles and procedures are not standardized, \nand there are often no standard protocols governing the reporting of \nforensic evidence.\n  Since then, I have worked with colleagues in the Senate to develop \nlegislation that would strengthen forensic science and standards. The \nadministration also took notice and has initiated several activities, \neven without direct action from Congress. The Department of Justice and \nNIST have become strong partners in this effort. Now, some of my \ncolleagues on Appropriations would like to gut one of these core \nactivities, the standards development work managed by NIST.\n  For reasons that I cannot comprehend, the report language \naccompanying this bill would forbid NIST from continuing the voluntary \nconsensus standards development work already underway through the \nforensics scientific area committees. These committees coordinate \ndevelopment of standards and guidelines for the forensic science \ncommunity to improve the quality and consistency of forensics evidence \nused by our justice system.\n  These committees were established according to the longstanding and \nwell-respected NIST process for developing voluntary consensus \nstandards. As such, the membership of these committees represent the \nfull breadth and depth of stakeholder organizations, including forensic \nscience practitioners, as well as academic scientists and engineers, \nlaw enforcement, and others.\n  To the best of my knowledge, these committees have the support of the \nfull range of stakeholders. Why would we stop, in its tracks, a \nvoluntary consensus standards process that has proven itself effective \ntime and time again? I can see no justifiable reason for trying to keep \nsound science out of the courtroom.\n  Mr. Chair, since the language in question is in the committee's \nreport rather than the bill text and will not be sufficiently addressed \nwith this amendment, I plan to withdraw this amendment but seek the \napproval of both the chair and the ranking member to help correct this \nlanguage as we move toward the conference report.\n  My colleagues, I hope, will work with the Senate to rectify this \nunjustified and unjust restriction.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n\n[[Page H3683]]\n\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. I yield to the gentleman from \nTexas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chair, I look forward to working with my colleague \nfrom Texas and with my colleague from Philadelphia on this matter as we \nmove forward in the conference.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Thank you very much, Mr. \nChairman.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. I yield to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chair, I also would work with the gentlewoman and the \nchairman on this. You know, the premise of our entire judicial system \nis that we would rather a guilty person go free than any innocent \nperson be in prison.\n  Forensic science has brought a lot to the business of better \nunderstanding actually what has taken place and to make sure that we \ndon't have innocent people incarcerated.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. With that, I ask unanimous \nconsent to withdraw this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                     industrial technology services\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Hollings Manufacturing \n     Extension Partnership of the National Institute of Standards \n     and Technology, $130,000,000, to remain available until \n     expended.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Ms. Esty\n\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 12, line 20, after the dollar amount insert \n     ``(increased by $11,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 7, after the dollar amount insert ``(reduced \n     by $31,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom Connecticut and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Chairman, we should invest in manufacturing, which \nplays such a vital role in innovation and competitiveness. The Federal \nGovernment is uniquely situated to help ensure that manufacturing \nremains the backbone of the U.S. economy.\n  My amendment fully funds the Manufacturing Extension Partnership \nprogram by increasing funding for the industrial technologies account \nby $11 million. This program is the top priority for the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce. Just earlier today, the Chamber listed fully funding the \nManufacturing Extension Partnership at $141 million as its highest \npriority for the Commerce, Justice, Science bill.\n  My amendment is also fiscally responsible. It decreases funding for \nthe Federal prison system by $31 million to ensure that this investment \nin manufacturing does not affect our national spending.\n  In Connecticut, we are proud to be a national leader in \nmanufacturing. Our State is home to more than 5,000 manufacturers that \nprovide stable, good-paying jobs for our families. For more than 20 \nyears, our Manufacturing Extension program, the Connecticut State \nTechnical Extension Program, known as CONNSTEP, has been a trusted \nadviser for our small- and medium-sized manufacturing companies looking \nto grow their business and increase their workforce in sales.\n  Since 2013, CONNSTEP's clients have helped create 511 jobs, retained \nmore than $527 million in sales, and realized cost savings of $81 \nmillion statewide. In Thomaston, in my district, Metallon, \nIncorporated, a metal stamping and assembly facility, partnered with \nCONNSTEP to help conduct internal quality auditing and secure new \nproducts. Thanks to the partnership with CONNSTEP, Metallon expanded \ntheir workforce and increased sales by half a million dollars.\n  Metallurgical Processing, Incorporated, a metal processing facility \nin New Britain, Connecticut, saw a 20 percent increase in production \ncapacity and $181,000 in cost savings after working with CONNSTEP to \nstreamline product flow and improve production efficiency.\n  CONNSTEP's support for Connecticut business is critical to our \ncontinued leadership in manufacturing, as we not only retain but grow \nthese jobs statewide. I have seen firsthand how CONNSTEP's support has \nsuccessfully helped our manufacturers to be competitive in an \nincreasingly globalized economy.\n  But make no mistake, these successes are not just in Connecticut. The \nManufacturing Extension program has a proven track record of effective \npartnerships with manufacturers all across the country. Since the MEP \nprogram started more than 25 years ago, centers across America have \ncreated more than 729,000 manufacturing jobs, saved companies more than \n$13.4 billion, and turned every dollar of Federal investment into $19 \nin new sales growth.\n  The additional funding of the MEP program will enable our centers to \nfully execute their mission and undertake a robust technology transfer \nprogram to help manufacturers take new discoveries from the research \nlab to the marketplace.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to support my amendment to fully fund \nthe Manufacturing Extension Partnership program and invest in our \nmanufacturing future.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nbecause our Federal prison system is already between 30 and 50 percent \novercrowded. We have not built a new prison in the United States since \n2009. It is vitally important that we have got these prisons in place \nto keep our most dangerous criminal offenders off the streets.\n  The amendment that the gentlewoman has offered would immediately \nprevent the Bureau of Prisons from expanding its capacity and do severe \ndamage to their ability to reduce overcrowding, which is a threat to \nthe staff, a threat to the inmates, and a threat to the public.\n  The gentlewoman's amendment--I understand she is concerned--to \nsupport the Manufacturing Extension program, we cannot do so at the \nexpense of public safety.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky, the full \ncommittee chairman.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  It is no secret, Mr. Chairman, that there is a strain on our Nation's \nprison system. As the inmate population continues to rise, our prisons \nget more and more crowded every day. As the inmate population continues \nto rise, with 216,000 individuals currently serving Federal sentences, \nour prisons get more and more crowded every day.\n  At the end of fiscal 2013--listen to this--25 percent of our medium \nsecurity inmates and 85 percent of our low security inmates were triple \nbunked--triple bunked. Considering that 8 out of every 10 medium \nsecurity inmates has a history of violence, this creates some very \nserious questions about the safety of the BOP staff, the public, and \neven other inmates. Updating our prisons will provide greater \nefficiency and staffing and permits staff to safely oversee more \ninmates.\n  Our medium and maximum security prisons house some of the world's \nmost dangerous and violent criminals. The bill before us provides \ncritical funding to the Federal Bureau of Prisons in order to modernize \nand strengthen our Nation's prison infrastructure. These funds will \nhelp protect the public as well as the men and women who work at these \nfacilities. It is imperative that we provide them a safe and secure \nenvironment within which to work.\n  The Federal Government has a commitment to keep the public and prison \nstaff safe, and these dollars are needed to fulfill that commitment. So \nI oppose this effort to reduce funding for the Bureau of Prisons and \nurge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I want to point out \nthe Manufacturing Extension program is already fully funded. They have \ngot $130 million set aside for the program in the bill; and, quite \nfrankly, the\n\n[[Page H3684]]\n\namendment would endanger the public because we would not be able to \nproceed with the urgently needed construction of new prison facilities. \nSo I urge my colleagues to join us in opposing this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Connecticut has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. ESTY. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, let me just say that I rise in support of \nthe amendment, and I think this shows the bigger picture here if the \ncountry has to choose between promoting manufacturing and whether or \nnot we can safely operate the world's largest prison system. We \nincarcerate more people than any other country in the rest of the world \non a per capita basis. We need to be employing more people in \nmanufacturing. This makes sense. I support the gentlewoman's amendment.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut will be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                  construction of research facilities\n\n       For construction of new research facilities, including \n     architectural and engineering design, and for renovation and \n     maintenance of existing facilities, not otherwise provided \n     for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, as \n     authorized by sections 13 through 15 of the National \n     Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278c-\n     278e), $50,000,000, to remain available until expended: \n     Provided, That the Secretary of Commerce shall include in the \n     budget justification materials that the Secretary submits to \n     Congress in support of the Department of Commerce budget (as \n     submitted with the budget of the President under section \n     1105(a) of title 31, United States Code) an estimate for each \n     National Institute of Standards and Technology construction \n     project having a total multi-year program cost of more than \n     $5,000,000, and simultaneously the budget justification \n     materials shall include an estimate of the budgetary \n     requirements for each such project for each of the 5 \n     subsequent fiscal years.\n\n            National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\n                  operations, research, and facilities\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       For necessary expenses of activities authorized by law for \n     the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n     including maintenance, operation, and hire of aircraft and \n     vessels; grants, contracts, or other payments to nonprofit \n     organizations for the purposes of conducting activities \n     pursuant to cooperative agreements; and relocation of \n     facilities, $3,147,877,000, to remain available until \n     September 30, 2017, except that funds provided for \n     cooperative enforcement shall remain available until \n     September 30, 2018: Provided, That fees and donations \n     received by the National Ocean Service for the management of \n     national marine sanctuaries may be retained and used for the \n     salaries and expenses associated with those activities, \n     notwithstanding section 3302 of title 31, United States Code: \n     Provided further, That in addition, $130,164,000 shall be \n     derived by transfer from the fund entitled ``Promote and \n     Develop Fishery Products and Research Pertaining to American \n     Fisheries'', which shall only be used for fishery activities \n     related to the Saltonstall-Kennedy Grant Program, Cooperative \n     Research, Annual Stock Assessments, Survey and Monitoring \n     Projects, Interjurisdictional Fisheries Grants, and Fish \n     Information Networks: Provided further, That of the \n     $3,295,541,000 provided for in direct obligations under this \n     heading $3,147,877,000 is appropriated from the general fund, \n     $130,164,000 is provided by transfer, and $17,500,000 is \n     derived from recoveries of prior year obligations: Provided \n     further, That the total amount available for National Oceanic \n     and Atmospheric Administration corporate services \n     administrative support costs shall not exceed $208,100,000: \n     Provided further, That any deviation from the amounts \n     designated for specific activities in the report accompanying \n     this Act, or any use of deobligated balances of funds \n     provided under this heading in previous years, shall be \n     subject to the procedures set forth in section 505 of this \n     Act: Provided further, That in addition, for necessary \n     retired pay expenses under the Retired Serviceman's Family \n     Protection and Survivor Benefits Plan, and for payments for \n     the medical care of retired personnel and their dependents \n     under the Dependents Medical Care Act (10 U.S.C. 55), such \n     sums as may be necessary.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n\n            Amendment Offered by Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia\n\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 14, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $200,000)''.\n       Page 98, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increase by $200,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I would like to take a \nminute to tell you how we got here.\n  As someone who fished in the Gulf of Mexico long before I got elected \nto Congress, when they started reducing the snapper season back in \n2007, we had approximately 190 days to fish as the recreational angler. \nThey have now taken that down to 10 days.\n  Through the Gulf councils, the National Marine Fisheries Service has \nworked through the councils to reduce the American recreational \nfishermen's opportunity to fish for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico \nby 95 percent since 2007. At the same time, they have increased quotas \nand allocations for the commercial sector. And most recently through \nthe Gulf council, they cast a vote, 7-10, to split the recreational \nsector, and they gave the for-hire recreational sector 45 days and the \nnot-for-hire 10 days.\n  Now, let me just explain what that means to you. It means that if you \nwant to just take your family fishing, you have 10 days to do it. If \nyou want to go in the other 35 days of that recreational season, you \nhave to pay a charter boat captain to take you out.\n  What happened with the council is three of the members who voted had \na vested interest in the charter boat industry that they did not \ndisclose prior to the vote, even though Federal law required that they \ndo it. Then, they turned around and cast that vote which personally \nbenefited them, which, again, was illegal.\n  I appreciate the committee working to put in the money for more data \nin an effort to get the recreational season back for the not-for-hire \nrecreational angler, but to be honest with you, if you give them all \nthe data in the world, no matter what it says, if they continue to \nconduct themselves in that manner, it won't matter. They will simply \nallocate themselves more fish.\n  So with that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, but I am not \nopposed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I understand the gentleman is going to withdraw his \namendment, and he has identified a serious problem that he has brought \nto our attention that I want to work with my ranking member on.\n  I understand that it sounds to me like we have got a clear violation \nof Federal law involved here, and I am very distressed to hear of this \nreduction. It is a 95 percent reduction in the time available to \nindividual Americans to fish, which is a very important part to all of \nus who live next to the Gulf of Mexico who go out and fish for red \nsnapper.\n  I am very concerned to hear about this failure to disclose the \nconflict of interest, and I would like to work with the gentleman from \nGeorgia to help rectify this and make sure that the law not only is \nobeyed, but the agency is responsive to the needs of private fishermen. \nI would like to work with my colleague from Philadelphia on this.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, let me say that I thank \nthe chairman and ranking member. This is something that needs to be \nrectified. If an illegal action was taken, it needs to be reversed.\n  Based on your commitment to work with us on this amendment at this\n\n[[Page H3685]]\n\ntime, I look forward to having those discussions, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Blumenauer\n\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 14, lines 1, 18, and 19, after each dollar amount, \n     insert ``(reduced by $60,760,000) (increased by \n     $60,760,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Oregon and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Sadly, the funding in this bill for NOAA's climate research is \nshamefully inadequate and puts at risk efforts to mitigate and respond \nto the impacts of climate change. It cuts NOAA's climate research by \n$30 million relative to the current fiscal year's inadequate level and \nis $61 million below the President's request. I am offering an \namendment to restore the funding to the President's level.\n  All across America, we are dealing with the impacts of climate \nchange. Extreme weather events, whether it is the recent floods in \nTexas, or the persistent 4-year drought in California, are regular \nevents. They claim lives and cost billions of dollars each year. \nFloods, droughts, superstorms, wildfires, heat waves, and sea level \nrise are all made worse as a result of climate change.\n  We are no longer talking just about preparing for the future. It is \nhappening now. And the evidence is clear as we go from one extreme \nweather event to another that it is getting worse.\n  NOAA climate research funds atmospheric and oceanic research, \ncooperative institutes, universities, climate research laboratories, \nand others that will advance climate science and enable better \ndecisionmaking and better policies to make our communities more \nresilient.\n  It makes no sense to defund programs to help us prepare for extreme \nweather events; mitigate the impacts of such events; prevent the loss \nof human life, infrastructure, and property; and better predict these \noccurrences.\n  Choosing to deny climate change does not stop it from happening, and \nfailing to study and authorize these programs will not make the problem \ngo away. In fact, it will only make us more vulnerable and hurt our \nability to prepare for and respond to the impacts of climate change.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nhas a record level of funding in this bill for weather forecasting, \nwhich is where they need to focus their work: predicting the future and \ntelling American farmers, American workers, American industry, and the \nAmerican people what the future holds. What does the next week, the \nnext month, or hurricane season hold for the people of the Gulf of \nMexico or the Atlantic Coast?\n  So, in an era of scarce resources we have funded NOAA with a record \nlevel of funding for weather forecasting. We have made sure they have \ngot all the money they need for maritime safety and for supporting and \nmonitoring America's fisheries.\n  We have made sure in this bill that NOAA is focusing on their core \nfunction, and that is looking to the future. That, of course, is going \nto involve looking at climate. But over the past several years climate \nfunding within NOAA has received more than adequate funding, and we \nhave to use the scarce, very precious, hard-earned taxpayer dollars \nthat we are entrusted to appropriate very carefully. We have to \nprioritize that funding, and within this bill, we have chosen to \nprioritize weather forecasting.\n  I respect the gentleman's judgment but would ask him if he could \nwithdraw the amendment, and I look forward to working with him to \nensure that NOAA has got everything they need to accurately predict the \nweather in the future.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the Blumenauer amendment.\n  In business, we are always fighting the tendency of the long term \ngiving away to the short term, the important giving away to the urgent \nand the immediate.\n  I am deeply disappointed that this budget for climate research has \nbeen cut by $30 million. Now is not the time to cut climate research.\n  From the floods in Houston to the drought in California, shifts in \nclimate over the next few decades will cost American companies and \nAmerican communities hundreds of billions of dollars. NOAA has the \nability to do advanced forecasting predictions certainly for weather- \nand for ocean-related phenomena, but they also have it for climate \nshort- and long-term change. This ability is crucial to support the \nfuture of our businesses, coastal cities, and environmental health.\n  This Congress has repeatedly affirmed that climate change is real. We \nmay have different ideas about the cause of climate change and \ncertainly what we can do to combat it, but it makes no sense to slash \nthe very research which will enable us to find effective, bipartisan \nsolutions.\n  We must robustly fund climate science research, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I understand the gentleman is going to \nwithdraw the amendment, and I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Fattah).\n  Mr. FATTAH. In this bill there are three cuts: at NASA on the Earth \nScience program, the cut to the National Science Foundation in terms of \nthe ability to focus on geosciences, and the issue that is raised by my \ngreat friend from Oregon, and they combine to make the point that there \nis not yet a consensus in one place. Even though there is a consensus \nin the scientific community, the majority still is not yet clear that \nclimate is something that we need to focus on.\n  I urge support for the Blumenauer amendment.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I respect my friend from Texas. I \nappreciate his willingness to work with me and his notion of putting \nmore resources in forecasting, but that is not the issue here.\n  What we need to be doing is having a robust effort at NOAA to be able \nto deal comprehensively with climate, being able to deal with how we \nhelp communities be more resilient, how we are able to deal with the \nforces that are down upon us to help the scientific bases to be able to \nmaybe even encourage this Congress to step up and do its job.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, could the gentleman be more specific \nabout what it is he is asking NOAA to do?\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. It is our ability to provide reliable, long-term \ndrought forecasts, projections of regional drought indicators, and \nissues dealing with the prediction of what happens in terms of flood \nresearch and performance of climate and weather models.\n  This is not simply a matter of predicting next week's weather. This \nis dealing with long-term consequences and helping communities deal \nwith the impact of climate change and being able to understand it \nbetter.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is an entirely self-imposed constraint from my \nRepublican friends. They have passed hundreds of billions of dollars of \nunfunded tax cuts out of committee. There is more than adequate money.\n  Because the budget is so hopelessly inadequate, I ask unanimous \nconsent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Oregon?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Guinta\n\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n\n[[Page H3686]]\n\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 14, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $70,000,000) (increased by $70,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom New Hampshire and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I plan to withdraw this amendment, but I \nwould like the opportunity to briefly explain.\n  The Saltonstall-Kennedy Act of 1954 imposed a special duty on fish \nand fish products imported into the United States and required that 30 \npercent of the money collected by NOAA would go toward supporting \nfisheries and research and development on the industry's long-term \nsustainability. However, NOAA has not been properly paying into its \nregional fishing grant programs and is using these tariffs as part of \nits operational expenses.\n  To ensure a thriving fishing industry, we must invest in initiatives \nthat increase the stock of our Nation's fisheries by providing grants \nto research and monitor them as well as management programs.\n  During my first term, I introduced legislation that would ensure that \nkey programs critical to sustainably managing ocean fish populations \nand the fishermen and communities that depend on them would receive \nincreased and sustained funding.\n  I sincerely thank Chairman Culberson for considering my \nappropriations letter and including the transfer of $130 million in \nexisting funds to be used exclusively on Saltonstall-Kennedy fishing \nactivity, particularly the S-K regional fisheries investment grant \nprogram.\n  This transfer of funds will directly provide grants to regional \nfishery management councils that would work with area fishermen to \nidentify investment priorities. These investment priorities include \ndisaster assistance, improving shoreside infrastructure, seafood \npromotion, and managing highly migratory species.\n  The transfer of these funds will help; however, it is a temporary fix \nto a much larger issue.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  This year, I, along with my friend Congressman Bill Keating, have \nintroduced the same legislation that would ensure that NOAA follow the \nrequirement laid out in the Saltonstall-Kennedy Act of 1954.\n  Again, I want to thank Chairman Culberson for taking my letter and \nthoughts into consideration. I appreciate the hard work of the \ncommittee on this issue and the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I am \nnot opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to work with the gentleman \nfrom New Hampshire on this issue as we move forward. I understand the \nimportance of the issue. I appreciate very much you raising it here \nwith us today, and we look forward to working with you.\n  We do include language stating that certain funds may be used only \nfor activities related to the Saltonstall-Kennedy Grant Program.\n  We have worked with NOAA for the past several years to reduce their \nadministration costs. We will continue to do so this year, and I will \ncontinue to work with you as we move forward through the process.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom New Hampshire?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 14, lines 1, 18, and 19, after each dollar amount, \n     insert ``(reduced by $30,000,000) (increased by \n     $30,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to several of the \ncritical accounts in the bill that have been cut, which my amendment \nwould address.\n  The CJS Appropriations Act specifically targets funding for NOAA's \nclimate research programs by $30 million over currently enacted levels, \na program so important for farmers, for businesses, for air safety, for \nso many different reasons. That is a 20 percent cut to programs that \nare imperative to our Nation's ability and resilience in the face of \nclimate threats.\n  Twenty-five people were killed in the floods that saturated Texas \nlast month. Damage from Hurricane Sandy was estimated at $700 billion \nback in 2012, and at least six people died in Boulder and Larimer \nCounty during the flooding that overtook my region in 2013. None of \nthese places had ever seen storms like the ones they encountered over \nthe last 5 years, and each were unprepared to handle it.\n  NOAA and its partner institutions have made a huge dent in preventing \ndisasters like these by keeping first responders, weather forecasters, \nbusinesses, communities, and families on the cutting edge of data \npredictability and resilience, providing quality raw data, as well as \nhelping to develop new algorithms for interpreting existing data.\n  Two of our partner institutions, CU and CSU, are located in my \ndistrict in Colorado. Together with NOAA, these institutions are \ndeveloping unmanned atmospheric assessment aircraft that allow us to \nforesee changes in weather patterns, incoming storms, days before we \ncould otherwise, saving lives and saving property damage.\n  These are very real tangible benefits that benefit all and protect \nAmericans, regardless of whether one believes in climate change or what \nis causing it. I urge my colleagues to consider a world without these \ncapabilities and what that would look like.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. \nWe have, as I said earlier, scarce resources this year. We have to \nprioritize the very precious and scarce hard-earned taxpayers dollars \nthat we are entrusted to look after, and we have prioritized funding \nwithin NOAA for forecasting in the future.\n  As I was telling Mr. Blumenauer earlier, Mr. Polis, we have made sure \nthat NOAA has got a record level of funding for weather forecasting and \nmost of the things that Mr. Blumenauer was mentioning, in terms of \nforecasting drought, identifying where floods are going to occur.\n  Looking forward, we have made sure that NOAA's got all the money they \nneed for forecasting in the future, and we have to, I think, do \neverything we can to avoid cutting other parts of NOAA that would \nimpair the weather forecasting or the development, maintenance, and \noperation of the weather satellites which could help NOAA inform people \nof severe weather.\n  We, on the Gulf Coast in particular and on the Atlantic Coast as \nwell, depend on NOAA to give us accurate forecasts of the paths of \nhurricanes. Hurricane season this year, they are predicting--because of \nthe increase in computing power of supercomputers, they are able to \npredict it looks like it is going to be--the hurricane season this year \nis not going to be as severe.\n  That capacity of NOAA to use supercomputing power to look that far \ninto the future is of vital importance, so we have made sure that they \nhave got a record level of funding for forecasting.\n  We also do not want to reduce NOAA's capacity to support maritime \nnavigation or to appropriately manage their fisheries. We just have \nlimited resources, is the problem, Mr. Polis; and I just have had to \nprioritize NOAA's funding.\n  We have put weather forecasting at the top of the list because of its \nvital importance for the economy and for the safety and security of the \nAmerican people.\n  I understand you are planning to withdraw the amendment, and I would \ncertainly look forward to working with\n\n[[Page H3687]]\n\nyou. As Mr. Blumenauer mentioned a number of worthwhile endeavors that \nNOAA is engaged in, if you feel there are areas we need to work \ntogether on to get NOAA focused on to do a better job of forecasting in \nthe future or other concerns, I would be happy to work with you.\n  Mr. POLIS. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado if he would \nlike to engage in a colloquy.\n  Mr. POLIS. I would like to emphasize the importance of climate \nscience with regard to predicting weather. The more we know about \nclimate and climate patterns, the more it enhances our ability to \npredict short-term weather phenomena; therefore, a disproportionate cut \nto the climate science piece hampers our ability to anticipate weather \npatterns as well.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I look forward to working with you as we move forward \nin the process. I understand you are planning to withdraw the \namendment.\n  Mr. POLIS. I have additional speakers.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I think one of \nthe most concerning things about this budget proposal is, without \nquestion, the proposal to cut $30 million to NOAA. That represents an \napproximately 20 percent cut, as my colleague from Colorado was \npointing out.\n  Mr. Chairman, I find it interesting that those who would deny the \nscience of climate change often like to say, Well, the jury is still \nout, we need more research; yet here we are, with a budget that will \ncut that very research.\n  Mr. Chairman, just a couple of years ago, in my house in \nPhiladelphia, we were riding out a hurricane. Hurricane Sandy ended up \nbecoming Superstorm Sandy. We never imagined that, in Philadelphia, we \nwould be experiencing the kind of hurricane that typically is \nexperienced by Florida and the Gulf Coast States.\n  As even a Republican Governor said at the time, it seems as if the \nstorm of the century is now happening once every couple of years.\n  Mr. Chairman, we desperately need this research. We need this \nfunding. Let's restore NOAA funding.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I am still trying to identify what precisely you are \nasking for because I think we are on the same page when it comes to \nforecasting and prediction. That is what you are asking for.\n  Mr. POLIS. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. I wanted to inquire with regard to how the funding cuts \nwould impact the development of the unmanned atmospheric assessment \naircrafts that are critical to foreseeing changes in weather pattern.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. If I could, we are going to make sure that NOAA has \ngot all the--we have given them a record level of increase this year so \nthey can engage and make sure we have got accurate forecasting. Whether \nit be through their aircraft or their supercomputers or their modeling, \nthey have got the resources they need to do accurate forecasting for \nthe future.\n  I am just trying to get a precise idea what it is you are looking for \nbecause I think we have given them all they need for forecasting, and \nthat is what you are asking for.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, very specifically, this amendment would \nrestore the $30 million of cuts--namely, a 20 percent cut--a \ndisproportionate cut to climate science activities, including unmanned \natmospheric assessment aircrafts and including creating raw data \nstreams that can be used by those who predict weather, as well as by \nfarmers and businesses, because you can't separate out weather and \nclimate.\n  I think, perhaps because of political reasons--I don't know why--\nthere is a disproportionate cut, 20 percent, to the climate science \npiece of NOAA. Now, that climate science piece of NOAA, just because it \nhas the word ``climate'' in it, that doesn't mean it is something where \nthey are out there doing things that are political.\n  What they are doing is they are trying to research the macro effects \nof climate on weather, on population and patterns, on dangers on ships. \nIf the gentleman would simply allow that discretion within NOAA, undo \nthe 20 percent cut, we fund that within NOAA.\n  We are not, nor can we, under the budget, seek new money. We are \nsimply taking the $30 million and putting it back into the climate \nscience program.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Thank you for yielding because I have just checked \nwith my staff, and it appears that the money that we have allocated, a \nrecord level of funding for NOAA's forecasting, takes care of that \naircraft. The money that we have allocated for NOAA for forecasting \ntakes care of the data stream.\n  That is why I kept asking what are y'all specifically asking for. We \nhave taken care of it. We are deeply concerned with making sure that \nNOAA has got the money they need to predict hurricanes, to predict \nfloods, to predict the terrible flooding that has taken place in \nHouston or the drought that has taken place in California.\n  I think we are on the same page. I want to be sure the gentleman \nknows that I will work with him as we move forward in conference. If \nyou can identify something specific that NOAA does not have as a result \nof our record increase for forecasting, we will help you restore it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Reclaiming my time, one of the areas we would love to work \nwith you on is Cooperative Institutes funding, the partnerships that \nNOAA has with our institutions of higher education to better leverage \nour taxpayer dollars.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                amendment offered by mr. smith of texas\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 14, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $21,000,000) (increased by $21,000,000)''.\n       Page 14, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $21,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, my amendment takes direct, strong \naction to address America's weather forecasting shortcomings in order \nto reduce the loss of life and property from severe storms.\n  The amendment I offer on behalf of myself; Science, Space, and \nTechnology Committee Vice Chairman Frank Lucas; and Environment \nSubcommittee Chairman Jim Bridenstine directs that the full $120 \nmillion authorized in House-passed H.R. 1561, the Weather Research and \nForecasting Innovation Act of 2015, be provided in the NOAA Operations, \nResearch, and Facilities appropriation account.\n  The recent flooding in Texas and tornados in Oklahoma demonstrate the \nimmediate need to quickly implement better weather research and \nforecasting by fully funding H.R. 1561.\n  The House unanimously passed that bill just 2 weeks ago. We also \nunanimously passed it over a year ago in April 2014.\n  Now, thanks to Chairman Culberson's initiative and support, the CJS \nbill will add the needed resources to transform our antiquated 1980s \nweather forecasting system into a 21st century weather enterprise in \nthe next few years.\n  Specifically, this amendment will provide $5 million more for weather \nlab research in NOAA, to total the $80 million authorized. The \namendment will also provide $16 million more for weather research \ntechnology transfer in NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric \nResearch, to total $20 million authorized to implement a labs\n\n[[Page H3688]]\n\nand Cooperative Institutes research-to-operations program.\n  This program will improve the understanding of how the public \nresponds to warnings and transfer new technology to the National \nWeather Service, the American weather industry, and the academic \npartners.\n  This new joint Technology Transfer Initiative should include support \nfor the Vortex-SE project and development of advanced national and \nglobal cloud resolving models; quantitative observing system assessment \ntools; atmospheric chemistry needed for weather prediction; and \nadditional sources of weather data, which includes commercial observing \nsystems.\n  Once again, I appreciate Chairman Culberson's accepting the \namendment, which will help save lives and reduce property damage.\n  As the CJS Appropriations chairman, Mr. Culberson has proved himself \nto be capable, knowledgeable, and committed to the country's best \ninterest.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does the gentleman from Texas seek to rise in \nopposition?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Well, I would like to seek some time in opposition, \nbut I do not oppose the amendment. We have agreed to accept it and work \nthis out.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is the gentleman from Pennsylvania opposed?\n  Mr. FATTAH. I am authentically opposed to the amendment, but I would \nalso make an allowance to yield to my chairman after I make my \ncomments.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Culberson), the chairman of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I just want to stress, if I could, that \nChairman Smith has been very supportive and cooperative. We have worked \ntogether arm in arm, as has his ranking member, who is also from Texas. \nThis amendment is one that will help the Weather Service do a better \njob of forecasting. I think it is a good amendment. It is one that we \nhave worked out together. I do urge Members to support it.\n  I appreciate the gentleman from Pennsylvania yielding to me.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Reclaiming my time in opposition, in all good, there is \nsome bad. It is true that this amendment would offer some additional \ndollars for weather forecasting. But $16 million of it--the bulk of the \n$21 million--would go into technology transfer. Now, I am not opposed \nto technology transfer, but to take it out of the administrative work \nat NOAA, I have visited NOAA, and I understand how the operations there \nwork. I have spent a lot of time learning about its operations. And I \ncan tell you that NOAA cannot perform the duties that our Nation needs \nwithout the administrative capabilities.\n  It would be just like coming here to the Hill and expecting the \nCongress to function without our back office operations. We would not \nbe able to proceed forward. So I think that it is more important for us \nto have an appropriate allocation so that we can meet these needs than \nit is to rob the administrative capability of NOAA at a time when we \nwant to place more demands on it.\n  I think that the amendment--even though moving towards additional \nhelp for weather forecasting--the bulk of it is for a technology \ntransfer to the private sector, which I am all for, but it sounds to me \nlike it is robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  On the floor, it may be easy to pass an amendment that cuts \nadministrative costs at a government agency, but it may be something \nthat we live to regret. So I stand in opposition to the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma (Mr. Bridenstine), who is the chairman of the Environment \nSubcommittee of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Smith \nfor his leadership on this important amendment as well as Chairman \nCulberson. I thank them for working with us on this amendment. I know \nwe have been working very hard to make sure that this is adequately \nfunded and from the right sources.\n  By fully funding the weather research and technology transfer that \nwas authorized by my bill, H.R. 1561, this appropriations bill now \nreflects the House's will that NOAA prioritize activities that save \nlives and property. The funding will go to support critical work to \nincrease the lead times that we receive for tornadoes. A lot of this \ncritical work is being done at the University of Oklahoma. I have heard \nalready that we were looking for more funding for some Cooperative \nInstitutes, and that is what this is.\n  This is of extreme importance to my State, as I have already lost \nconstituents this year from tornadoes. It is my sincere belief that \nthis appropriations bill now ensures that programs are funded that will \neventually move us to a day where no one is killed in a tornado or \nother severe storm event.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Culberson and Chairman Smith for their \nleadership on this issue. We need to adopt this amendment so that we \ncan save lives and property, especially as it relates to my \nconstituents in Oklahoma.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Keating\n\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 14, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $1,750,000) (increased by $1,750,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to offer and withdraw my \namendment.\n  I rise for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy with the chairman \nand the gentlewoman from Maine.\n  Since 1972, the National Marine Fisheries Service has utilized \ntrained fishery observers to monitor and assess the health of fish \npopulations along the coast of the United States, providing critical \ndata gathered from commercial vessels that is then used to guide NOAA \nin determining best practices for conservation and sustainable \nmanagement.\n  The fishing industry is a willing and engaged partner in supporting \nthe use of on-vessel observers. However, following a legal challenge, \nthis August, NOAA will run out of funding to continue paying for this \nmandated program.\n  I have heard from fishermen from the south coast of Massachusetts, to \nCape Cod and the islands, to the south shore who are still struggling \nfrom the impacts of diminishing groundfish stocks and worry they will \nbe unable to cover the burden of this cost.\n  Our region is still reeling from the collapse of the groundfish \nindustry that prompted Federal disaster relief. This is particularly \ntrue for some small fishing businesses, where this added burden can be \nthe difference between success and failure as a business.\n  I am working with my New England and Massachusetts colleagues and \nNOAA to find an interim solution. And as we look to 2016, I ask that we \nwork to provide adequate funding for at-sea and dockside monitoring for \nfisheries with approved catch share management plans that impose \nobserver coverage as a condition for new and expanded fishing \nopportunities. We also can use this time, I believe, to seek cost-\neffective technological alternatives, where appropriate.\n  I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Maine \n(Ms. Pingree).\n  Ms. PINGREE. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts and Chairman \nCulberson for chatting with us about this particular issue.\n  Mr. Chairman, as has been already stated here by my colleague today, \nthere is never a good time to ask our fishermen to take on a cost of \nthis size that we are discussing here. But now is\n\n[[Page H3689]]\n\nan even worse time than most because it will be asking those who make \ntheir living on the Gulf of Maine to pay for onboard monitors when the \nground fishery is struggling. I understand the tough position that NOAA \nis in due to tight budgets, but times are even tougher on the men and \nwomen who make their living from groundfish right now.\n  I hope NOAA can find a way to avoid making them pay for onboard \nmonitors, and whatever the short-term solution is, I think NOAA should \nlook at ways to conduct monitoring through the use of onboard cameras \nor other cost-effective electronic technologies.\n  I hope the chairman will be willing to work with us on this and with \nNOAA on this issue that affects so many of our hard-working \nconstituents.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I would like to take this time to thank \nthe chair and ranking member for their willingness to engage in what \nreally is an important issue. I look forward to working together with \nChairman Culberson and Ranking Member Fattah on this issue.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. KEATING. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with the \ngentleman from Massachusetts. I recognize how important the Northeast \nMultispecies Sector Management Program is, and I look forward to \nworking with the gentleman and my colleague from Philadelphia as we \nmove forward through conference.\n  Mr. FATTAH. We are going to work to get to a more satisfactory \nresolution.\n  Mr. KEATING. I thank the ranking member and the chair.\n  Mr. Chairman, at this time, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n              Amendment Offered by Mr. Clawson of Florida\n\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 14, line 1, after the dollar amount insert \n     ``(increased by $2,000,000)''.\n       Page 25, line 3, after the dollar amount insert ``(reduced \n     by $2,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, this afternoon I am introducing \nan amendment which would take $2 million from the Department of \nJustice's legal activities, salaries and expenses, general legal \nactivities current budget of $885 million, which has been flat over the \nlast several years, and I would put this $2 million, instead, to NOAA \nin their operations, research, and facilities fund--specifically \ndirected to NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service Habitat \nConservation and Restoration initiative.\n  This nationwide initiative includes hundreds of community-based \nhabitat restoration projects that conserve or restore America's \nprecious native species and critical water quality restoration.\n  This amendment is consistent with the focus of my office to cut \ngovernment spending and motivate our civil servant management teams to \nachieve higher cost efficiencies throughout the Federal Government and \nto focus more on critical environmental priorities. In short, less \nadministration expense; more money for water, fish, and atmosphere.\n  Back in April, I introduced an amendment to H.R. 2028, the Energy and \nWater Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, with \nRepresentative Patrick Murphy of Florida that would move $1 million of \nthe Army Corps of Engineers' salary and expense budget to construction \nprojects in the Corps, like the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration and \nthe Herbert Hoover Dike.\n  This amendment today likewise will help fund critical habitat \nprojects across America, including important work in my district, like \nthe Galt Preserve Restoration Project in St. James City; the Clam Bayou \nOyster Reef Restoration and Evaluation of Seagrass and Water Quality on \nSanibel Island; the Ding Darling Mangrove Restoration Project on \nSanibel Island; Florida's Bay Scallop Metapopulation Stabilization at \nPine Island Center; the Mangrove Conservation Initiative in Naples; and \nthe Sam Williams Island Mangrove Restoration and Tarpon Bay Hydrologic \nRestoration on Marco Island.\n  Habitat restoration plays an important role in all of our communities \nand in the lives and welfare of our constituents, especially mine. \nAmerica's ecosystem is the lifeblood of so many of our American \ncommunities, economies, and culture. Let's do everything we can to \npreserve it.\n  Fisheries contribute more than $70 billion to the gross domestic \nproduct. Nationwide, commercial and recreational fishing, boating, \ntourism, and other industries provide more than $28 million jobs. \nTogether, coastal watershed counties contribute more than $4.5 trillion \nto the GDP. An estimated 53 percent of the current population live in \ncoastal communities. More than 60 percent of our coastal rivers and \nbays are moderately or severely degraded by nutrient runoff. This was \nmy original reason for getting into politics. We live with this \nnutrient runoff in my district, in my backyard, every day. It looks \nbad. It smells bad. It is a pitiful situation.\n  One added fact: according to NOAA's studies, 17 to 33 jobs are \ncreated for every $1 million invested in habitat restoration.\n  I say today, let's save a little bit of money, save a lot of jobs. It \nis good economics. It is good policy. It is good conservation. And I \nurge both sides to support it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I do \nnot oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's \namendment. It is a worthwhile cause and one that we have worked \ntogether closely on. So I would urge Members to support the amendment. \nI look forward to working with you as we move through conference to \nmake sure this is addressed. It is a problem throughout the Gulf Coast \nand one you are very right to focus Congress' attention on.\n  I urge Members to support the amendment.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I also rise in support of the gentleman's \namendment.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. I would like to thank the chairman and the \nranking member for their leadership on this. This is a big deal in the \nGulf. My appreciation is heartfelt for them making this move and \nshowing this symbol of importance. So in the name of all of my \nconstituents, I thank both of them for their leadership and support on \nthis.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Clawson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4 Offered by Ms. Bonamici\n\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I have amendment No. 4 at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 14, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $21,559,000) (increased by $21,559,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom Oregon and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Oregon.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment to increase funding \nfor the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, to \nsupport its\n\n[[Page H3690]]\n\nIntegrated Ocean Acidification research and fulfill the \nadministration's requested funding level of $30 million in fiscal year \n2016.\n  The administration's requested funding increase for ocean \nacidification research reflects a growing consensus in the scientific \ncommunity and in the coastal and fishing communities that so many of \nour colleagues and I represent. Ocean acidification is already \naffecting marine organisms and could irreversibly alter the marine \nenvironment and harm our coastal ecosystems.\n  On the West Coast alone, a $270 million shellfish industry has \nexperienced disastrous oyster production failures and faced the risk of \ncollapse in recent years because of changes in water condition that \nhave been attributed to ocean acidification. This change in chemistry \nis caused by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dissolving into the \nocean, and the increased acidity of the ocean is harming basic building \nblocks for life in the sea. This makes it more difficult for marine \norganisms to build their skeletons and shells, and it slows the \nformation of important ecosystem features like coral reefs. These \nchanges can ripple through the food chain, disrupting delicate marine \necosystems and threatening major commercial fisheries.\n  In the Pacific Northwest, the combination of seasonal upwelling of \nacidic waters, low alkalinity, and increased anthropogenic carbon \ndioxide creates some of the most corrosive ocean conditions in the \nworld.\n  In the last few years, Mr. Chairman, the scientific community has \nincreasingly raised concerns about the ocean. Researchers at Oregon \nState University have been working with the fishing community in Oregon \nto determine the effects of acidification. They have been helping the \nshellfish hatcheries assess the oyster die-off and finding ways to \nmitigate the harmful upwelling events by monitoring the water entering \ntheir facilities. This exemplifies the kind of academic and industry \npartnerships that are possible when the Federal Government supports \nacademic research.\n  NOAA's Integrated Ocean Acidification research program supports \nextramural research awards that fund studies on acidification in ocean, \ncoastal, and estuary environments. Not only does this program support \nstudies on the effects of acidification, it also allows NOAA to run the \nobserving system that helps monitor areas of increased acidity.\n  These examples have focused on the effects in Oregon and on the West \nCoast, but our changing ocean conditions can have far-reaching \nimplications for fisheries throughout the U.S., including the East \nCoast and Gulf shellfish industries. It also affects the people across \nthe Nation who eat seafood and the stores and restaurants that sell it.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is clear that we need more information, which is why \nNOAA's Integrated Ocean Acidification research program must be fully \nfunded. Unfortunately, this bill falls short of what the American \npeople and our fishing communities deserve.\n  I urge support of the amendment, and reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I understand the gentlewoman is going to withdraw this \namendment.\n  I agree with the gentlewoman that ocean acidification is a serious \nproblem. That is why you see funding in the bill for it. We just have a \nlimited amount of resources.\n  I will listen to your other speakers, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, can I please inquire about the remaining \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Oregon has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Farr), my colleague.\n  Mr. FARR. I wish the chairman was accepting this amendment because \nthe faults that we hear are that we have limited resources. We have \nlimited resources, but it is a priority where you give them. This ocean \nacidification is a serious problem. It is the most serious problem of \nmankind that we can do something about. When the ocean is starting to \nmelt all the shellfish, the lobster industry, the crab industry, \nthe oyster industry, and the clam industry, all of these industries \nhave a huge effect on not only where they are farming, but where the \ntourism that is attracted to them.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, we can do something about it. We need more money. The \nPresident asked for $30 million in this program. The committee cut it \nto $8.4 million, says he is funding it. However, the President asked \nfor the same amount of money for the exploration of the moon of Jupiter \ncalled Europa. The committee decided to give them $110 million more \nthan the President asked for. So don't tell me that there isn't money \navailable. It is just the priority where you give it.\n  Are you going to save this planet or put all the money into the moon \nof Jupiter? I think it is more important that we research ocean \nacidification, and that is why Don Young and I are introducing a bill \nto tackle this problem more than just this amendment in this moment.\n  Mr. Chairman, we have to get serious about this. The planet is \nmelting, and the ocean acidification is melting the organisms in the \nocean; and when they die, we die.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would point out to my colleagues we have $8.5 million \nin the bill for studying ocean acidification. I share your concern. It \nis a vitally important issue. And the thrust of our work in NASA, as \nyou know from reading the bill, is we have prioritized those missions \nin the bill that are the top priority of the Planetary Decadal Survey.\n  We have encouraged NASA to follow the recommendations of the best \nminds in the scientific community. Every 10 years they get together and \nprioritize the earth science missions, heliophysics missions, \nastrophysics missions, those missions aimed at the outer planets, and \nthe Europa mission has been the single highest priority of the Decadal \nSurvey last decade and this decade. The past administration and this \none continue to resist the best recommendations of the best minds in \nthe scientific community. I can't think of a more exciting question \nthat science could answer as to whether or not there is life on another \nworld, and that is going to be answered by this mission to Europa.\n  I agree strongly that we need to research ocean acidification, and \nthat is why there is $8.5 million in the bill for it.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Even though I am in a totally opposite position on the \nmatter than you.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I am happy to engage in a colloquy with my friend from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. We have an Earth in which the majority of it is covered \nby oceans. As a nation, we have more responsibility territorially for \nthe world's oceans than any other nation. You agree that this is a \nmajor issue. It is funded at a level that we think should be increased. \nI hope that the chairman will work with us as we go forward to see \nwhether we can improve and make even more robust our stewardship, which \nis our responsibility, as I would understand it. Even though there are \nother areas in the bill where we have made important sacrifices, maybe \nthis is an area where we can do more.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. It is one in which I look forward to working with you \non to do more to research ocean acidification. That is why you see in \nthe bill a major investment in oceanographic mapping and research, the \neconomic zone of the United States which is unmapped and uncharted and \nloaded with rare earths and great mineral wealth that Dr. Bob Ballard \nand his team and other scientists are exploring, and we are investing \nthere.\n  I look forward to working with you in conference.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, we will work together on this. This is a \nvery important area of interest for me, and I thank the gentlewoman for \noffering her amendment.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H3691]]\n\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned, I do plan to withdraw this amendment. I \ndo want to emphasize the seriousness of this issue in addressing it. I \ndo contend that the amount in this bill is inadequate. So I do look \nforward to working with the committee chairman, the ranking member, and \nthe committee going forward to address this very important issue.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Oregon?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n               procurement, acquisition and construction\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       For procurement, acquisition and construction of capital \n     assets, including alteration and modification costs, of the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n     $1,960,034,000, to remain available until September 30, 2018, \n     except that funds provided for construction of facilities \n     shall remain available until expended: Provided, That of the \n     $1,973,034,000 provided for in direct obligations under this \n     heading, $1,960,034,000 is appropriated from the general fund \n     and $13,000,000 is provided from recoveries of prior year \n     obligations: Provided further, That any deviation from the \n     amounts designated for specific activities in the report \n     accompanying this Act, or any use of deobligated balances of \n     funds provided under this heading in previous years, shall be \n     subject to the procedures set forth in section 505 of this \n     Act: Provided further, That the Secretary of Commerce shall \n     include in budget justification materials that the Secretary \n     submits to Congress in support of the Department of Commerce \n     budget (as submitted with the budget of the President under \n     section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code) an estimate \n     for each National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n     procurement, acquisition or construction project having a \n     total of more than $5,000,000 and simultaneously the budget \n     justification shall include an estimate of the budgetary \n     requirements for each such project for each of the 5 \n     subsequent fiscal years: Provided further, That, within the \n     amounts appropriated, $1,302,000 shall be transferred to the \n     ``Office of Inspector General'' account for activities \n     associated with carrying out investigations and audits \n     related to satellite procurement, acquisition and \n     construction.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Bridenstine\n\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 15, line 16, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $9,000,000) (increased by $9,000,00)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment designates $9 million within NOAA's \nProcurement, Acquisition, and Construction account for the purposes of \nfunding a pilot program for space-based commercial weather data as \nauthorized by H.R. 1561, the House-passed Lucas-Bridenstine Weather \nResearch and Forecasting Act of 2015.\n  Although I intend to withdraw my amendment, I intend to use this time \nto enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. Chairman, the commercial satellite industry has revolutionized \neveryday life. From telecommunications to imaging to navigation, we \nreap the benefits of private sector innovation. I truly believe we have \nthat opportunity when it comes to weather satellites as well. By \nintroducing newer, more innovative, more resilient and additional forms \nof data into our numerical weather models, we can improve our ability \nto forecast weather and save the lives of our constituents.\n  By providing NOAA with the funds to purchase commercial data, it \nsends a clear signal to the burgeoning, nascent weather satellite \nindustry: NOAA is interested in commercial data from the private \nsector. This pilot program has the potential to shift paradigms within \nour weather enterprise and serve as the first step toward moving to a \nday where the government does not have a monopoly on weather \nsatellites.\n  NOAA operates huge, monolithic, billion-dollar satellite programs \nthat have experienced cost overruns and launch delays. These programs \nare important to ensuring we have robust weather data, but we need a \nmitigation strategy when problems arise, a role that commercial sources \ncan play. In addition, they can augment our programs of record, and for \na fraction of the cost. In fact, to fully fund this program, NOAA would \nonly need to find the equivalent of one dime out of a $20 bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I believe, in the long run, purchasing data from the \nprivate sector will lead to lower costs for the taxpayers, as well as \nbetter data, more data, and more innovation. However, I understand the \nconstraints that the gentleman from Texas is under when crafting this \nappropriations bill, and I appreciate his willingness to work with me \non this issue. The question I pose to him is: Does the chairman intend \nto have NOAA provide $9 million from within its Procurement, \nAcquisition, and Construction appropriation for NESDIS Systems \nAcquisition to carry out this pilot program in fiscal year 2016 as is \nauthorized in H.R. 1561?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I agree completely with the gentleman that NOAA should \nwork with the private sector when data is available. It is cost \neffective and can save the taxpayers money, and, in fact, that is why \nwe included a statement on this in the committee report. I look forward \nto working with you as we move forward in conference to ensure that \nthis worthwhile goal is achieved.\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. I thank the chairman. I look forward to working \ntogether with you and with NOAA to ensure that congressional intent is \nclear and to make this critically important pilot program a reality. I \nappreciate your leadership and assistance on this issue.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5 Offered by Ms. Bonamici\n\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I have amendment No. 5 at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 15, lines 16, 19, and 20, after the dollar amount \n     insert ``(increased by $380,000,000)''.\n\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman from Oregon and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Oregon.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment to \nensure the continuity of NOAA's polar satellite program by restoring \nits funding. There are many important priorities in this bill, but the \ntechnical nature of this satellite program and its value to our Nation \nare being overlooked.\n  The importance of these satellites and the need to maintain the \ninformation they collect is not daily news, but the accurate, timely \ndata the satellites provide to our weather forecasters is crucial. This \ndata is needed not only in severe weather scenarios, but also for the \nwide-ranging accessibility to everyone in our Nation, from those who \nhear a weather forecast on the local news to the millions across the \nNation who open up an app on their phones.\n  Weather is important. It affects everything from our commute to the \nfood on our table. In fact, a 2009 study from the American \nMeteorological Society stated that U.S. weather forecasts generate \n$31.5 billion in benefits for $5.1 billion in cost.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Unfortunately, past trouble and mismanagement in the polar satellite \nprogram means that a gap in coverage within the next decade is \npossible, with the worst-case scenario being a gap lasting more than 5 \nyears. Any loss of coverage from the polar satellites would have \nserious consequences on the accuracy and timeliness of our weather \nforecasts, warnings, and the capabilities of the National Weather \nService.\n\n[[Page H3692]]\n\n  Thankfully, NOAA and NASA have worked very hard to get the polar \nsatellite program back on track. Unfortunately, the bill we are \nconsidering today has the potential to undermine that progress. The \nPresident's fiscal year 2016 budget request included $380 million for a \npolar follow-on program. This important program will minimize the risk \nof a gap in polar weather data and address a recommendation from \nvarious independent groups, including the Government Accountability \nOffice, regarding the need to develop a robust satellite program, a \nprogram that can withstand a launch failure.\n  By not funding the polar follow-on program in 2016, the continuity \nfor the polar weather mission is put at risk and the Nation will be \nexposed to the vulnerabilities and impacts of a potential gap.\n  Mr. Chairman, working families in my district and across the country \nare balancing enough already. They need to rely on accurate and timely \nforecasts, not worry about a gap or where the weather data comes from. \nWe need this program to continue so we do not lose the gains we have \nmade. Americans deserve to have access to the best available scientific \ndata.\n  Mr. Chairman, unfortunately, the funding levels in this bill are \nstretched so thin that it is impossible for me to find more than $300 \nmillion to provide an offset. So I do ask the subcommittee chairman and \nranking member to work with me on ways that we can find to preserve and \nmaintain this essential program.\n  At this time, Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Oregon?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 23, line 6, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(decreased by $2,000,000)''.\n       Page 72, line 1, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(increased by $2,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom West Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia.\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, many small businesses around the country \nare struggling, struggling to compete against low-priced foreign \nimports benefiting from unfair trade practices. They are constantly \nintimidated by the cost of the legal challenges that they face.\n  The intent of this amendment is simple. It transfers $2 million to \nthe International Trade Commission to provide legal and technical \nassistance to small businesses seeking a remedy.\n  I offered this amendment last year to the bill and it was approved.\n  Time and time again small companies are losing business against \nunfair, low-cost imports which flood our country. Something needs to be \ndone. Small businesses need help.\n  They don't have access to the same legal resources as larger \ncompanies. They can't afford the cost to file a claim against large \nstate-supported industries like we see coming from China. These small \nbusinesses in America deserve to be treated better.\n  In West Virginia, Mr. Chairman, we have one particular company which \nmanufactures glass, lead-free marbles. The company has less than 50 \nemployees. They, among other firms like that, have asked our office a \nsimple question: When an average cost to file an antidumping claim is \n$1 million or more, how can small manufacturers afford access to \njustice?\n  The Federal Government provides pro bono attorneys in criminal cases \nfor those who can't afford representation. Mr. Chairman, why not offer \nsomething similar to our small businesses across America who are facing \nunfair competition?\n  A recent contract was for 300 million marbles per year. Currently, \nthis company manufactures 1 million per day. This contract would have \nguaranteed 300 days of manufacturing production for hard-working West \nVirginians.\n  The Chinese company undercut their bid. Unfortunately, we have seen \nthis story far too often where the Chinese currency manipulation and \nstate subsidies have cut our tin, steel, and hot-rolled steel \nindustries, among others.\n  The ITC must have the tools to protect our small businesses, and this \namendment is a step in the right direction.\n  Let's be clear, Mr. Chairman: Do we want to keep talking about jobs, \nor do we want to offer a solution? Supporting this amendment will be an \nimmense help for small business employers who are trying to fight back \nagainst unfair trade.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I \nam not in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the gentleman's \namendment. We are willing to accept the amendment, and I yield to the \ngentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I join you in supporting the amendment.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n     Amendment Offered by Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico\n\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I have an \namendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 23, line 6, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(decreased by $2,000,000)''.\n       Page 42, line 24, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(increased by $2,000,000)''.\n       Page 44, line 8, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(increased by $2,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom New Mexico and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Mexico.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, trust between \nlaw enforcement and the public that they are sworn to protect is not \njust important but essential to safe, collaborative, and constitutional \ncommunity policing. Trust promotes healthy relationships and \ninteractions that are in the best interest of the both the public and \nthe police.\n  Unfortunately, the public's trust in law enforcement has eroded in \nmany communities across the country, including my own. The Federal \nGovernment needs to make targeted investments to ensure that law \nenforcement has the tools to rebuild and strengthen that trust, which \nis the cornerstone of successful policing.\n  That is why I am so proud to introduce this bipartisan amendment, \nalong with my colleagues Congressman Murphy and Congressman Blumenauer, \nto add $2 million to the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime \nReduction Act programs. These programs provide a broad range of \nservices, including crisis intervention training for State and local \nlaw enforcement agencies to identify and improve responses to people \nwith mental illnesses and substance abuse issues. Crisis intervention \ntraining can help prevent injuries to officers, deescalate potentially \ndangerous situations, and alleviate harm to the person in crisis.\n  Interactions between the mentally ill and law enforcement too often \nend in tragedy. Since the beginning of the year, 385 people have been \nshot and killed by police, and about a quarter of these individuals \nhave been identified as mentally ill. The more training we can provide \nlaw enforcement to improve their skills to interact with the public, \nthe more likely crises will be resolved peacefully. And the more \nnonviolent peaceful interactions police have with the public, the more \nwe can strengthen trust between police and the public that they are \nsworn to protect.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although \nI am not supposed to the gentlewoman's amendment because it is a good \namendment and I support it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. At this time, I yield to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Murphy), my good friend and colleague.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the Chairman, and I also thank \nRepresentative Grisham for this thoughtful amendment we are working on \ntogether, which will put $2 million towards crisis intervention \ntraining for State and local law enforcement and also work towards \nsubstance abuse treatment and mental health courts.\n  In the 1950s, this country had 550,000 psychiatric hospital beds for \nthe population of 150 million. Now, with a population twice that size, \nwe only have 40,000 psychiatric hospital beds.\n  So what happened? Some people got better. But sadly, what we ended up \nwith is huge increases in homelessness and visits to emergency rooms. \nLast year in this country there were 40,000 suicides and 1 million \nsuicide attempts.\n  With this critical bed shortage we have many people who end up \ncommitting crimes. Of the 2.4 million incarcerated Americans, about \nhalf of them, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, are \nestimated to have a mental health condition. That is 64 percent in our \ncounty and local jails, 56 percent in State, and 45 percent of Federal \nprisoners. By comparison, there are only 35,000 patients with severe \nmental illness in State psychiatric hospitals.\n\n[[Page H3694]]\n\nAnd, according to a report from April 2014, the number of mentally ill \npersons in prison is ten times higher than that in psychiatric \nhospitals.\n  The largest jails in the country--Cook County in Illinois, Los \nAngeles, and New York--have 11,000 prisoners combined with serious \nmental illness. Now, that is over twice as large as the three largest \nState-run mental hospitals.\n  Mentally ill inmates are twice as likely to be charged with rule \nviolations when incarcerated and actually remain in prison four times \nlonger than a non-mentally ill person with the same original crime. And \nwhat happens then? Solitary confinement, tasered. Then when they are \ndischarged, they repeat the cycle in the revolving door.\n  What we need to make sure we are doing is to deal with public safety, \nmake sure there is restitution to the community for what has happened, \nbut the key is to provide help for those with serious mental illness.\n  It is not right for our country to continue to say things like, It is \nnot illegal to be crazy. Our courts and systems that do not understand \nmental illness continue to say that, but to them I say it isn't just an \nissue of someone has a right to be mentally ill; they have a right to \nbe well.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  What we need to do is to stop this revolving door of having someone \nwho is hallucinating and delusional and waiting until he commits a \ncrime or is a threat to public safety, instead of intervening earlier.\n  We need mental health courts; we need ways a policeman can intervene \nearly to help persons, and we need evidence-based initiatives to fix \nour broken mental health system in America. I know that, in our own \ncourt in Allegheny County, they saw a nearly 38 percent reduction in \nrecidivism when they used mental health courts.\n  This is compassion, and this is the right thing to do. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 \nminutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy and her \nleadership on this, and I appreciate my good friend from Pennsylvania \nin his eloquence and his tireless championship in this area.\n  Mr. Chairman, the fact is that we have a broken system that does not \nmeet the needs of people with mental illness, and it places an undue \nburden on law enforcement. His words about people having a right to be \nwell really resonates with me because we have seen in all of our \ncommunities situations that escalate because they don't have the proper \nresponse--we don't have the proper training; we don't have the proper \nresources--where people get worse.\n  It is not just that it costs more money; it is the pain to the \nindividuals, to their families, and, ultimately, since virtually all of \nthese people are released but are released in a more damaged situation, \nthey are worse. They are a greater risk to themselves and society, and \nthe cycle continues.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that, if we were able to properly \naccount for the costs and consequences of the current nonsystem that \nthere would be far more resources saved in treating them humanely and \neffectively, giving the police and the community the resources they \nneed that will more than pay for itself. This is an important step for \nthe Federal Government to be a better partner.\n  I appreciate the gentlewoman's leadership. I appreciate my friend Mr. \nMurphy from Pennsylvania, and I am looking forward to working with him \non other items.\n  I respectfully request that our colleagues not just support this, but \ntake it to heart because we can make a difference on so many different \nlevels.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment, and I would \nencourage Members to support it if you would be willing to request a \nrecorded vote on this.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. On behalf of our country, I attended the Healthy brain: \nhealthy Europe conference in Ireland. The estimate in these 28 EU \ncountries was that some 36 percent of the population had some type of \nmental health challenge, and they deal with it much more openly and \nwithout the stigma that sometimes we attach here in our country to \nmental health challenges.\n  I want to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for his extraordinary \nleadership on this issue, and I thank the gentlewoman for offering \nthis.\n  We will support this amendment and ask for a recorded vote.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I encourage Members to support the \namendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I want to \nthank my colleagues for working so diligently on this very important \nimprovement to public safety and police training, and I encourage all \nMembers to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment which \nseeks to bolster funds for the Department of Justice inspector general \nin order to meet the fiscal year 2016 budget request.\n  As a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, I \nam a firm believer in the proper oversight of the Federal Government. \nThe more sunlight on Federal activity, the more honest and efficient it \nwill be.\n  I am also a strong proponent of our inspector general community. \nSince the Inspector General Act was passed into law, the IG community \nhas saved taxpayers billions of dollars and has uncovered countless \nexamples of wrongdoing in the Federal Government.\n  It seems only fitting that the inspector general's office receive the \nbudget requested resources, particularly at the expense of the office \nit will likely need to investigate first.\n  In the committee report, the committee noted, ``The DOJ OIG has had \nsignificant investigative and audit workload.'' In fact, we have seen \nnumerous scandals and coverups from within this agency and at the \nrecommendation of the previous Attorney General.\n  I applaud the committee for including language in this bill to \npermanently prohibit funds for Fast and Furious-like programs and for \nthe many\n\n[[Page H3695]]\n\nother reforms contained in this legislation, but I do believe more \nneeds to be done to ensure additional transparency and accountability \nwithin the DOJ.\n  Let's give the DOJ OIG the resources it needs to investigate this \nagency and to ensure the Justice Department adheres to the law.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I do \nnot oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I agree very strongly with the gentleman \nin that the inspector general's office does superb work. It is an \nindependent agency whose oversight is crucial.\n  The amendment will certainly improve oversight and ensure that our \nconstituents' hard-earned tax dollars are well spent. I would urge \nMembers to support the gentleman from Arizona's amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \nsupport.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n            Amendment Offered by Ms. Brownley of California\n\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 23, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $2,500,000)''.\n       Page 42, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $2,500,000)''.\n       Page 46, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $2,500,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an \namendment to H.R. 2578, which would increase funding in Veterans \nTreatment Courts.\n  Our Nation's heroes are returning home from over a decade of war in \nIraq and Afghanistan with the invisible wounds that come with multiple \ndeployments in military service to our Nation.\n  The signature wounds of these wars, post-traumatic stress disorder \nand traumatic brain injury, have led to a rise in mental health issues \namong our veterans. According to the National Center for PTSD, about 11 \nto 20 percent of veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and \nEnduring Freedom have PTSD in a given year. Since 2005, the number of \nveterans diagnosed with post-traumatic stress has doubled.\n  Too often, these mental health issues can severely impact a veteran's \nlife--from being able to keep a job, to drug abuse, to criminal \nactivity in some circumstances. Instead of receiving the mental health \nservices and support that they need, a growing number of veterans ends \nup being incarcerated in our justice system.\n  My simple amendment would increase funds for Veterans Treatment \nCourts by $2.5 million. Veterans Treatment Courts are designed to give \nveterans with mental health and substance abuse issues and who find \nthemselves in trouble with the law an opportunity to get the help they \nneed while avoiding jail time.\n  In my district, the Ventura County Veterans Treatment Court, which \nstarted as a pilot program in 2010, has helped dozens of veterans. \nJudge Colleen Toy White, one of the program's many champions in Ventura \nCounty, knows that the treatment courts reunite families and save \nlives.\n  Rather than arresting and jailing veterans for a few days or weeks \nand then putting them back on the streets with nothing changed in their \nlives, the Ventura County collaborative court connects veterans to \nneeded treatment and services, which may include mental health care, \ndrug and alcohol treatment, vocational rehabilitation, or other life \nskill services and programs.\n  The process begins with a guilty plea, an in-court meeting involving \nthe veteran, his or her attorney, and a VA representative.\n  I was very impressed with the care that the court officers and \nvolunteers extended to our veterans who found themselves before the \ncourt. A recent success for the Ventura County Veterans Treatment Court \nis a young man who was an Active Duty marine.\n  Before leaving the service in 2014, he had completed three combat \ntours in 12 years. He was arrested for two DUIs within 3 weeks. After 5 \nmonths of treatment, he still stands with his back against the wall \nrather than taking a seat in court. It is a common sign in combat \nveterans, but he is now getting evaluated by VA, is going to treatment, \nand has hope once again.\n  Since the Veterans Treatment Court program began in 2008 in Buffalo, \nNew York, over 220 Veterans Treatment Courts have been established \nacross the United States, and many more are being planned.\n  I believe we need to increase Federal resources to these critical \nprograms nationwide, which is what my amendment seeks to accomplish. It \nis our obligation to ensure our veterans receive the appropriate \nattention to their needs and that we do whatever we can to help them \ntransition to an independent civilian life.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support my amendment to provide \nveterans who are in trouble with the resources they need to help them \nsecure a strong future.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition even though I am not \nopposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n            Modification to Brownley of California Amendment\n\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that we modify the \namendment and, rather than strike line 12 on page 46, strike line 7.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Would the gentlewoman from California send the \nmodification to the desk.\n  The Clerk will report the modification.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n  Modification to Brownley of California amendment:\n\n       Page 46, line 7, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $2,500,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I have visited the Intrepid Center over in \nBethesda. We have been working with our veterans on post-traumatic \nstress. I know, in Houston, some of the best work in the Nation is \nbeing done at the University of Texas, at the Center for BrainHealth in \nDallas, and your work in Houston.\n  I had my own experience with this. I had a young man, Bill Cooper, \nwho on his last day in Iraq went out on patrol, and he was the victim \nof an IED. Some 59 operations later, he ended up working for me in my \ndistrict offices.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  He is just doing a wonderful job helping other veterans in the \nPhiladelphia area, but post-traumatic stress is a circumstance that far \ntoo many of our veterans have faced.\n  I want to thank my colleague from the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, \narea, Congressman Pat Meehan, who has helped to lead this effort on \nveterans courts, and the chairman and I support it. I thank the \ngentlewoman for her amendment.\n  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time because, again, \nI am not in opposition. I am in favor of the amendment.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and \nwould join in supporting the gentlewoman's amendment. The veterans \ncourts do great work. I support the gentlewoman's amendment and urge \nMembers to support it.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I should report to the House that Bill \nCooper got married, just had a new son, and got his graduate degree on \nthe GI bill that we passed. He is just another example of what can \nhappen for our veterans when we take care of them.\n  I thank the gentlewoman from California, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very, very \nmuch the chairman accepting my amendment. I appreciate his support,\n\n[[Page H3696]]\n\nand I know veterans across the country will as well.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment, as modified, \noffered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Brownley).\n  The amendment, as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. MacArthur\n\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 23, line 6, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(reduced by $750,000)''.\n       Page 38, line 9, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(increased by $750,000)''.\n       Page 40, line 10, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(increased by $750,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Westmoreland). Pursuant to House Resolution \n287, the gentleman from New Jersey and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 2578 along with \nthe gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams), who unfortunately was \ncalled away on an emergency and can't be here to speak with me.\n  The Violence Against Women Act has been an important step--a critical \nstep, really--in ending the scourge of violence against women, and the \nelderly abuse grant program has been an important part of that. It \nfunds training and services to end abuse of women in later life. The \nquestion is how much funding is necessary for this.\n  The National Network to End Domestic Violence suggests that that \nnumber is $9 million for the program, and this Congress previously \nauthorized $9 million. Unfortunately, we can't afford that right now, \nand so we have to settle for something less. The President's budget, \nhowever, sets the amount at less than half, and that is simply not \nenough.\n  My amendment would increase that amount to $5.2 million, which is $1 \nmillion over the President's request and $750,000 over the current \nmark. We would pay for that by moving $750,000 from the Department of \nJustice administration account.\n  Mr. Chairman, the elderly abuse grant program has successfully helped \nmany older women escape neglect, abuse, and exploitation taking many \nforms. Our elderly population is growing, and we simply believe we need \na little more funding to make this program handle the growing \npopulation. Alma Adams from North Carolina and I have cosponsored the \namendment because this is not a Republican or Democratic issue; this is \na very human issue. I ask my colleagues to support it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition but do \nnot oppose the amendment and would, in fact, encourage Members to \nsupport it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I would agree with the chairman and his \nwisdom, and I would also ask my colleagues to support it. I have no \nobjection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I urge Members to support it. It is a good program and \nappreciate very much the gentleman bringing this to the floor today and \nurge Members to vote ``yes.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank both the chairman and \nthe ranking member for their support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. MacArthur).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                 justice information sharing technology\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       For necessary expenses for information sharing technology, \n     including planning, development, deployment and departmental \n     direction, $25,842,000, to remain available until expended: \n     Provided, That the Attorney General may transfer up to \n     $35,400,000 to this account, from funds available to the \n     Department of Justice for information technology, to remain \n     available until expended, for enterprise-wide information \n     technology initiatives: Provided further, That the transfer \n     authority in the preceding proviso is in addition to any \n     other transfer authority contained in this Act.\n\n                   administrative review and appeals\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       For expenses necessary for the administration of pardon and \n     clemency petitions and immigration-related activities, \n     $426,791,000, of which $4,000,000 shall be derived by \n     transfer from the Executive Office for Immigration Review \n     fees deposited in the ``Immigration Examinations Fee'' \n     account: Provided, That under this heading of the amount \n     available for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, \n     not to exceed $15,000,000 shall remain available until \n     expended.\n\n                      office of inspector general\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Office of Inspector General, \n     $92,000,000, including not to exceed $10,000 to meet \n     unforeseen emergencies of a confidential character.\n\n                    United States Parole Commission\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses of the United States Parole \n     Commission as authorized, $13,308,000.\n\n                            Legal Activities\n\n            salaries and expenses, general legal activities\n\n       For expenses necessary for the legal activities of the \n     Department of Justice, not otherwise provided for, including \n     not to exceed $20,000 for expenses of collecting evidence, to \n     be expended under the direction of, and to be accounted for \n     solely under the certificate of, the Attorney General; and \n     rent of private or Government-owned space in the District of \n     Columbia, $885,000,000, of which not to exceed $20,000,000 \n     for litigation support contracts shall remain available until \n     expended: Provided, That of the amount provided for INTERPOL \n     Washington dues payments, not to exceed $685,000 shall remain \n     available until expended: Provided further, That of the total \n     amount appropriated, not to exceed $9,000 shall be available \n     to INTERPOL Washington for official reception and \n     representation expenses: Provided further, That of the amount \n     appropriated, such sums as may be necessary shall be \n     available to the Civil Rights Division for salaries and \n     expenses associated with the election monitoring program \n     under section 8 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. \n     10305) and to reimburse the Office of Personnel Management \n     for such salaries and expenses: Provided further, That of the \n     amounts provided under this heading for the election \n     monitoring program, $3,390,000 shall remain available until \n     expended.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 25, line 3, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(reduced by $1,000,000)''.\n       Page 98, line 20, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(increased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a simple good \ngovernance to the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies \nAppropriation Act for the fiscal year 2016. The amendment seeks to hold \nthe Department of Justice accountable for its failure to enforce the \nrule of law. Specifically, my amendment decreases available funding for \nthe salaries of individuals who concoct ways to undermine Federal \ncriminal immigration laws.\n  This amendment is very similar to an amendment that passed this body \nlast year in relation to the DOJ's lack of enforcement of Federal \nmarijuana laws and was offered by my friend and colleague Congressman \nFleming. My amendment reduces Department of Justice's general legal \naccount by $1 million, specifically targeting the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral's Office. I will continue to seek similar amendments until the \nAttorney General decides to enforce the Federal criminal immigration \nlaws on the books.\n  In 2014, the Department of Justice instructed the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice in some States to no longer prosecute persons that violate \ncertain criminal immigration laws. I have heard firsthand from law \nenforcement in my district that such actions have placed unnecessary \nburdens on these officers, increased costs, put local communities at\n\n[[Page H3697]]\n\nrisk, and encouraged more illegal immigration.\n  The committee raised similar concerns about the selective enforcement \nof these laws in the committee report stating: ``The committee is \nconcerned with the inconsistent enforcement of Federal criminal \nimmigration laws and supports programs like Operation Streamline. The \nAttorney General is directed to submit a report to the committee . . . \nThe report shall describe steps the Department is taking to ensure that \nthe Federal criminal immigration law is enforced vigorously and \nconsistently across the country to include prosecution guidelines and \npolicies by district.''\n  My amendment is consistent with the concerns expressed by the \ncommittee and echo this message without harming the overall operation \nof the Department.\n  I thank the chair and ranking member for their leadership on this \nbill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I rise reluctantly in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, if the proposal would have been to put this \nmoney in the veterans courts or drug courts or youth mentoring, I \nprobably wouldn't be standing; but the idea of putting it into savings \nwhen we know that the allocation is already shy of what we needed and \nthat many programs that we have had to give shorter appropriations to \nthan we would have otherwise makes me reluctant to support this \namendment, and I would ask the House to oppose it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nCulberson), the chairman of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I want to express my support for the \ngentleman's amendment. I think he is exactly right. We need to send a \nvery strong message to the administration that they must enforce the \nlaw as enacted by Congress. That has been the central theme I have \ntried to pursue as the new chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, \nJustice, Science, and Related Agencies. It is the foundation of all our \nliberty.\n  There is no liberty without law enforcement, and the Chief Executive \nhas a duty under the Constitution to enforce the law as written by \nCongress and to faithfully execute that law. If any of the Federal \nagencies under the President's jurisdiction want access to our \nconstituents' hard-earned tax dollars, they need to enforce the law as \nwritten by Congress.\n  I strongly support the gentleman's amendment; and, frankly, putting \nit in the savings account is a good thing because that goes back to the \ntaxpayers. I support the gentleman's amendment and would urge Members \nto vote ``yes'' to send a message to the White House. If the White \nHouse doesn't get it, they will learn it throughout the year under the \nnew chairman of the CJS Subcommittee.\n  Mr. GOSAR. I thank the chairman for his support, and I ask all my \ncolleagues to vote for this bill.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. I yield back the balance of my time as well.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings \nwill now resume on those amendments on which further proceedings were \npostponed, in the following order:\n  An amendment by Mr. McClintock of California.\n  An amendment by Ms. Esty of Connecticut.\n  An amendment by Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico.\n  An amendment by Mr. Gosar of Arizona.\n  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the time for any electronic vote \nafter the first vote in this series.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. McClintock\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a \nrecorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \n(Mr. McClintock) on which further proceedings were postponed and on \nwhich the noes prevailed by voice vote.\n  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

1900\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Pittenger\n\n  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 32, line 5, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $25,000,000)''.\n       Page 72, line 7, after each of the dollar amounts, insert \n     ``(reduced by $25,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his leadership \nand hard work on this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple, it is fair, it is fiscally \nresponsible, and it strengthens our national security. My amendment \nreduces Federal spending for the Legal Services Corporation by $25 \nmillion while leaving the program substantially intact. That money is \nthen used to increase funds for the FBI in their critical \ncounterterrorism efforts.\n  The underlying bill appropriates $300 million for the LSC, but \nCongress has not authorized the LSC since 1980. Mr. Chairman, 35 years \nis much too long to leave a Federal program on autopilot. Even the \nnonpartisan CBO has recognized defunding the LSC is a way to rein in \nour out-of-control spending, noting that programs receiving LSC grants \nalready receive funding from States, localities, and private entities, \nas well as from private attorneys involved in pro bono work. Community \nproblems are best solved at the community level, not through the \nFederal bureaucracy.\n  This amendment, however, does not suddenly end LSC and its programs. \nIt simply reduces funding in a responsible and modest way and applies \nthat money toward critical national security efforts. This amendment \nprioritizes the spending of taxpayer money on our current needs.\n  Earlier this year, FBI Director James Comey said he has ``homegrown \nviolent extremist investigations in every single State.'' Just last \nmonth, the Department of Homeland Security Secretary, Secretary \nJohnson, said: ``We're very definitely in a new environment because of \nISIL's effective use of social media, the Internet, which has the \nability to reach into the homeland and possibly inspire others.'' He \ncontinued, saying, ``Because of the use of the Internet, we could have \nlittle or no notice in advance of an independent actor attempting to \nstrike.'' But in a congressionally mandated report released in March of \nthis year, the FBI Commissioner said, budget cuts ``severely hindered \nthe FBI's intelligence and national security programs.''\n  Mr. Chairman, given the constant, evolving, and new threats we face \ntoday from terrorism, it is common sense to reduce spending for a \nprogram which has other proven avenues of funding and prioritize the \nfunding we do have for those seeking to protect us from terrorism.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to support the amendment, and with \nthat, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Hudson). The gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, the committee, over the time that I have been on the \ncommittee, each and every year has increased its appropriations to the \nFBI, and this year is no exception. The chairman, in his wisdom, \nworking with a very tough allocation, has provided $8.5 billion--to be \nexact, $8.489 billion, which is a $111 million increase.\n  I think that the gentleman, if his concern is about us providing \nadequate funding for the Bureau, can rest assured that the committee \nhas taken every--they have taken that responsibility very seriously.\n  If his concern or effort is to suggest that somehow pro bono lawyers \nare going to make up the difference for a cut at Legal Services, in a \nbig city like Philadelphia, it may be so that we have law firms who can \nhave pro bono partners who can spend their time helping people who are \nnot going to be able to pay them, but in large swaths of our country, \nthat is not the case.\n  Legal Services was created and it helps people, many of whom are \nveterans, for instance, who are stationed far away from home, who have \nto fight off efforts by people who are trying to repossess a car or do \nsomething else nefarious. They need access to the courts. And so it was \nPresident Nixon who created Legal Services, understanding that one of \nthe things about our country, it is a country of laws. People have to \nhave access to the courts, and they need representation.\n  So I think there is already a justice gap, that is the percentage of \npeople eligible to the numbers who are actually able to be helped, and \nI think this would be unwise. I hope and I believe that this House will \nnot support this amendment because it would be taking from people who \nneed it the most when there is no definitive need for it in terms of \nwhere it is being allocated.\n  Mr. Chairman, I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee, \nCongressman Cohen, my colleague who represents the city of Memphis.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Fattah. I join with him in \nopposing this amendment.\n  Legal Services is funded at $375 million this year. This budget cuts \nit $75 million to $300 million. That is a large cut. That is over 20 \npercent. It has been cut and cut and cut over the years.\n  Nationally, 50 percent of all eligible potential clients are turned \naway from Legal Services because of a lack of funding. In my district \nin Memphis,\n\n[[Page H3702]]\n\nthey have lost $300,000, and the staff has been reduced from 50 to 38.\n  Mr. Chairman, when we travel overseas, one of the things that almost \nevery individual you meet up with tells us about America is, We envy \nyour justice system. They envy our justice system because people have \naccess to the courts to settle our differences.\n  But if you are poor and/or uneducated and you don't have a lawyer, \nyou don't have access, really, to the legal system; the other side \nwill. If you are a domestic violence victim and you need an attorney \nand you don't have one, you are subject to further domestic violence. \nIf you are a tenant in an apartment building and you are being run out, \nthe apartment people are going to have attorneys and you won't, and you \nwill be on the street.\n  So we are talking about victims, domestic victims. We are talking \nabout people being homeless. We are talking about individuals, American \ncitizens, who won't have access to the courts, the envy of people \naround the world when they look at America, and we will be taking it \naway from them.\n  I would ask the gentleman to find moneys for the FBI from somewhere \nelse. The FBI helps bring about justice. But to take it away from an \narea that gives poor people of America justice--even though it does \ngive money to the FBI to find criminals and hopefully bring justice to \nthem on the criminal side, which is important--this is not the right \nplace to take the money.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I agree with the spirit.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kennedy).\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I am grateful for the time of both my \ncolleagues. I want to recognize the extraordinary commitment that my \ncolleague, Mr. Pittenger, has made to counterterrorism and trying to \nprotect the safety and security of the United States.\n  I will say, though, Mr. Chairman, I did work as a legal aid attorney, \na legal aid volunteer many years ago when I was a law student. We spent \ncountless hours trying to keep a roof over the head of tenants who were \nbeing kicked out of their home through no fault of their own because a \nlandlord wasn't paying a mortgage. Now, you had people who were going \nhomeless because they did nothing wrong but couldn't avail themselves \nof an attorney.\n\n  To try to find, now, ways to gut that funding when, with low interest \nrates--one of the key methods of funding for Legal Services across this \ncountry is from interest on lawyer's trust accounts. Because of low \ninterest rates, that funding has been basically nonexistent. In \nMassachusetts, that went from about $34 million a year down to $4 \nmillion a year.\n  We are gutting a very basic tenet of what this country is all about. \nWe spend so much time in these Chambers, Mr. Chairman, talking about \nhow these laws are shaped to touch people's lives and very little time \nspeaking about the enforcement and protections that they provide. Mr. \nChairman, this is that moment, and I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' \non the amendment.\n  MR. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I acknowledge the wonderful work of Mr. Kennedy and \nwhat he has done with Legal Services. I would say that Legal Services, \nfrankly, has had a long and troubled history of using taxpayer money \nfor political purposes.\n  An LSC-affiliated agency once used Federal tax dollars to produce \npamphlets and political cartoons for political advocacy purposes. Tax \ndollars were also used to train activists on how to lobby Congress for \nadditional funding. The LSC is marked by misuse of taxpayer money and \nredundancy, as many of these programs are offered, as well, by the \nStates.\n  So I don't question that there is good work that is being done, but \nat the same time, I think it is prudent and logical that we look and \nsee how this money is not being used wisely and, frankly, been \ninappropriately used.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, this is a very, very modest cut in this agency. I \ncommend this amendment to the House and ask for their support, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North \nCarolina will be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                              construction\n\n       For necessary expenses, to include the cost of equipment, \n     furniture, and information technology requirements, related \n     to construction or acquisition of buildings, facilities and \n     sites by purchase, or as otherwise authorized by law; \n     conversion, modification and extension of Federally-owned \n     buildings; preliminary planning and design of projects; and \n     operation and maintenance of secure work environment \n     facilities and secure networking capabilities; $57,982,000, \n     to remain available until expended.\n\n                    Drug Enforcement Administration\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration, including not to exceed $70,000 to meet \n     unforeseen emergencies of a confidential character pursuant \n     to section 530C of title 28, United States Code; and expenses \n     for conducting drug education and training programs, \n     including travel and related expenses for participants in \n     such programs and the distribution of items of token value \n     that promote the goals of such programs, $2,073,945,000; of \n     which not to exceed $75,000,000 shall remain available until \n     expended and not to exceed $90,000 shall be available for \n     official reception and representation expenses.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Cohen\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk concerning \nrape kits.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 33, line 5, after the first dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $4,000,000)''.\n       Page 49, line 9, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $4,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Tennessee and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This amendment would increase by $4 million the bill's funding for \ngrants to address the backlog of sexual assault kits at law enforcement \nagencies.\n  DNA analysis has been revolutionary in helping to catch criminals and \nprevent crimes from occurring because of DNA evidence. This evidence \ndoes us no good if it remains untested and sitting on a shelf in a lab \nsomewhere.\n  Despite progress over the last few years, and much progress most \nrecently, there are still thousands of rape kits that remain untested--\npotentially hundreds of thousands. That is potentially hundreds of \nthousands of victims whose assailants are never brought to justice left \nto prey on yet more women.\n  Last year, my hometown paper, the Memphis Commercial Appeal, \nhighlighted the tragic need to end this backlog once and for all. It \ndescribed a serial rapist who was finally caught by police in 2012. He \ncould have been stopped nearly a decade earlier if only his first \nvictim's rape kit had been tested, but that kit wasn't, and, instead, \nhe was able to attack five more women over the next 8 years.\n  Missed opportunities like this happen all across our country every \nday. The trauma inflicted on victims of rape can be compounded when \nthey know that their assailants run free while critical evidence goes \nuntested.\n  Fortunately, efforts are underway to reduce the backlog, and they are \nmaking a difference. In Memphis, our backlog reached more than 12,000, \nbut police have now opened 488 investigations and issued 90 requests \nfor indictment.\n  But testing rape kits cost money, more than local law enforcement can \nafford. I appreciate the chairman's and the ranking member's commitment \nto eliminating the backlog and the funding that the committee has \nprovided in the bill, but we need more.\n  This amendment would increase by not quite 10 percent, an additional \n$4 million, and would take it from the\n\n[[Page H3703]]\n\nDrug Enforcement Administration, a $2 billion agency that receives a \n$40 million increase in this bill. DEA would barely notice the \ndifference.\n  Moreover, DEA has been alarmingly irresponsible with money Congress \nhas given it previously. An inspector general report recently found \nthat DEA agents had ``sex parties'' with prostitutes funded by drug \ncartels in government-leased living quarters. And this followed an \ninspector general report that found the DEA paid hundreds of thousands \nof dollars for information from Amtrak that they could have obtained \nfor free.\n  I think the choice is clear: we should stand with victims of sexual \nassault.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment. It is so important that \nthese kits are tested, that the assailants are brought to justice, and \nthat additional women are not attacked by what are known to be serial \nrapists who are out on the streets.\n  I would like to say a thank you to my partner on this amendment, \nRepresentative Carolyn Maloney, who has been a tireless advocate on \nthis issue as well.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although \nI am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Westmoreland). Without objection, the gentleman \nfrom Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I believe the gentleman is exactly \nright. We, in the bill, have increased funding to reduce the rape kit \nbacklog. This is a vitally important tool that local police departments \nare using to get these people off the streets as quickly as possible.\n  I accept the gentleman's amendment. There is no punishment severe \nenough nor swift enough for these people. I think it is very, very \nimportant that we get these rape kits handled as quickly as possible, \nso I urge Members to support the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, we made some significant progress, but more \nneeds to be done. I want to thank the gentleman for his amendment. The \ncommittee has made this a very high priority. I thank the chairman for \nhis leadership in this regard. We are all in concurrence here.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank the chairman, \nparticularly, and the ranking member as well, for their help and their \nhard work on getting the moneys passed and for helping on this \namendment.\n  These rapists don't know State lines, and they cross State lines, so \nit is most appropriate that the Federal Government help the locals in \nfinding people that perform these dastardly acts all over our country.\n  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n            Amendment Offered by Mr. Ted Lieu of California\n\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 33, line 5, after the first dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $9,000,000)''.\n       Page 38, line 9, after the dollar amount insert \n     (``increased by $4,000,000'').\n       Page 38, line 24, after the dollar amount insert \n     (``increased by $4,000,000'').\n       Page 47, line 8, after the dollar amount insert \n     (``increased by $3,000,000'').\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Chairman, this amendment takes $9 \nmillion out of the DEA's $2 billion salaries and expense budget and \nredirects it toward deficit reduction, as well as underfunded State and \nlocal programs to help children who suffer through child abuse, \ndomestic abuse, and sexual assault.\n  This amendment has been scored by the CBO as reducing budget \nauthority by $2 million and reducing outlays by $6 million in fiscal \nyear 2016.\n  In the face of overwhelming support for lessening restrictions on \nmarijuana, the DEA still spends over $18 million a year on domestic \nmarijuana eradication programs. This simply takes some of that money \naway because some States have legalized it, making some of these \neradication programs no longer necessary, and it redirects the money--\n$2 million to lowering the deficit, $3 million to the Victims of Child \nAbuse Act, which supports justice and support for victims of child \nabuse, and $4 million to the Consolidated Youth Oriented program, which \nhelps victims and the services they need to pursue safe and healthy \nlives.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although \nI am not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I think the gentleman has a good \namendment, and I would encourage Members to support it.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I concur.\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment Offered by Mr. Castro of Texas\n\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 33, line 5, after the 1st dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $10,000,000)''.\n       Page 49, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $10,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Chairman, first, I would like to thank the \nchairman and the ranking member for their hard work on this bill.\n  My amendment would add $10 million to the Community Trust Initiative \naccount for police body-worn cameras, and would take those $10 million \nfrom the DEA account for salaries and expenses.\n  Over the last several months, we have seen more and more encounters \nbetween members of our communities and law enforcement that have been \ntoo powerful to ignore. We have seen in those recordings instances of \npolice abuse. We have seen instances where police were justified in the \nuse of force. We have even seen instances where police went above and \nbeyond doing their job.\n  Mr. Chairman, over the last two decades or so, something changed--two \nthings, in fact.\n  First, we developed a technology so that basically each of us who \nwalks around with a cell phone camera is a social documentarian of the \nthings going on around us.\n  The second thing that changed is the advent of social media, which \nallowed people not only to document their experiences, but also to \nwidely distribute what they have documented to this country and to the \nworld. Because of that, we have gotten a better indication of the \ninteraction between law enforcement and members of our community.\n  In this digital age, we have a responsibility to seek and to know the \ntruth about those encounters. Local police departments, many of them--\nin fact, 25 percent of the 17,000 police agencies in this country--are \nalready using body cameras. Many more in States all over our Nation are \nseeking the funds to do this.\n  The President of the United States asked for $50 million to allow \nlocal grants and moneys for local agencies to afford these body cameras \nand for the storage to make sure that they can keep that evidence.\n\n[[Page H3704]]\n\n  As you all know, this is a very expensive thing, and many departments \nhave struggled with the funds to afford these things. So in the budget \nthat has been proposed, the amount proposed is not $50 million, but $15 \nmillion. This $10 million would simply bring us back up to half of what \nthe President has requested at $25 million.\n  I will also add that this is very popular among the American people: \n86 percent of Americans--Republicans and Democrats, people of every \nrace and ethnicity, in every community across the country--support \nincreased use of body cameras for officers. Even the association of \npolice chiefs in our country supports this also.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although \nI am not opposed to it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I would encourage Members to support it. \nThe gentleman has a good amendment. I think the Community Trust \nInitiative program that we have created in the bill will rebuild that \nbond of trust between police officers and their community by making \nsure that these body cameras are available. My good friend from Texas--\nTexas was the first State in the Union to pass a State law that says \nwhen, where, and how this data from the body cameras can be used. State \nSenator Royce West from Dallas passed that legislation. I had a chance \nto talk to him during the legislative session about a month and a half \nago, talk to him about this, and I said: If you will pass this law in \nTexas and other States will pass it, my good friend, Mr. Fattah, and I, \nwe made sure that the language in our bill follows State law. The State \nlaw in Georgia, the State law in Pennsylvania, in Texas, et cetera, \nwill decide when, where, and how this data can be accessed by \nattorneys, by victims, and make sure it is not given to the media. \nState law will control that. It is a good program and a good amendment, \nand I encourage Members to support it.\n  I am happy to yield to my good friend from Philadelphia.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and I thank the \ngentleman from Texas for offering this amendment. I also support it. We \nhave already put some dollars available for this purpose, but adding \nanother additional $10 million gets us closer to the goal that we want \nto seek in this effort, so I thank the gentleman.\n  We have got a circumstance here where we are in total agreement and \non one accord.\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his \nforesight and thank him for his work on this. I also want to thank a \nfew folks: Congressmen Cleaver, Clay; Dana Rohrabacher, who was with me \non this; Congressmen Schweikert, John Lewis, and Donald Norcross. \nCongressman Norcross did a lot of work on this in New Jersey. So thank \nyou very much.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Cohen\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 33, line 5, after the first dollar amount insert \n     ``(reduced by $12,000,000)''.\n       Page 72, line 7, after the first dollar amount insert \n     ``(increased by $10,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Tennessee and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We just had an amendment on the floor and the amendment took $25 \nmillion from Legal Services. I had several amendments to file, and they \nwent from $5 million for legal services up to $35 million. So what I \nthought might be the equitable thing to do would be, instead of going \nwith the $35 million, which would have just been half of the cut, take \nthe $25 million that Mr. Pittenger wanted to take away from them, take \nit away from the amendment that would have been best, the $35 million \nincrease, and go for a $10 million increase, which would, in essence, \nbe Mr. Pittenger's amendment against the amendment which would be a \nbest practices that I would have recommended increasing $35 million.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  This amendment would restore $10 million to the devastating cuts to \nLegal Services. Legal Services in 1995 was funded at $400 million. Just \non inflationary dollars, today, that $400 million would be $600 \nmillion; yet, in this budget, Legal Services would be funded at $300 \nmillion, half of what it would be based on 1995 figures adjusted for \ninflation.\n  We are proud of our legal system, and we are known for it all around \nthe globe, but it can be complex. With all of the problems we have with \nthe legal language, let alone just languages that we have in this \nNation, it is too difficult for people to represent themselves in \ncourt.\n  There is a saying: ``He who represents himself as a lawyer has a fool \nfor a client.'' People need professional legal aid to get through the \nmaze of the justice system. If you are poor in this country--and most \npeople are--if you are uneducated--and many are--and scared when you go \nto court, you are not going to be able to successfully work against a \nprivate attorney on the other side. It just takes away from the whole \nidea of equal justice under the law.\n  I talked earlier about domestic violence. There are ladies--and \nsometimes men--who need protective orders from abusive partners or \nseniors who have been victimized by fraudulent lenders as well. Legal \nassistance is vital to ensuring that these parties are treated fairly \nand are aware of their rights. That is why I am a champion of the Legal \nServices Corporation, which helps fund legal aid programs throughout \nthe country.\n  This bill, as I say, cuts $75 million, which would make many people \nin the Nation not have representation and unable to pursue justice. \nNearly 50 percent of all eligible potential clients are turned away \nfrom legal services nationally, and it has hurt people all over this \ncountry.\n  The attorneys do heroic work, and there are serious consequences for \nreducing the funding to these folks. Unless we ensure legal assistance, \nwe effectively shut the courthouse doors to many who won't be able to \nprotect their rights.\n  The decrease would come from the DEA. Again, the DEA has had \nnumerous, numerous problems with agents who have gone rogue and have \ndone things that you shouldn't do anywhere, least of all when you are a \nDEA agent representing our country. The funding in the hands of Legal \nServices could change the lives of thousands of people who need legal \nrepresentation.\n  This amendment is $25 million less than what I would have like to \nhave gotten with the $35 million amendment, but I will take that. If we \ncan get the 10, hopefully, Mr. Pittenger will be happy with the 25 cut \nfrom the 35 that we should have gotten, in my opinion, on top to \nrestore the 75 that we have lost.\n  Representatives Quigley, Castor, Schrader, and Joe Kennedy have all \nhelped on this.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, once again, I rise in support of the Legal \nServices Corporation.\n  This is an organization that is the major source of funding for legal \naid offices all across this country. The funding, as my colleague \nindicated, has not kept pace with need, inflation, or reality.\n  The fact of the matter is, Mr. Chairman--and I have seen as a legal \naid volunteer in the courtrooms and then again as a prosecutor the \nimpact of adequate legal representation. I spent hours and hours, along \nwith other volunteers, trying to ensure that citizens of this country \nwho, through no fault of their own, are being victimized by large \ninterests or by folks who did know how to navigate the legal system \ncould have adequate representation in the courts.\n  Mr. Chairman, inside these halls, we debate with great vigor and \ngreat detail the nuances to every single piece\n\n[[Page H3705]]\n\nof legislation, yet spend far too little time discussing the impact of \nhow that is going to be enforced after it becomes law. That is what the \nLegal Services Corporation does.\n  The fact is, in many ways, another source of funding for Legal \nServices is through the interest on lawyers' trusts accounts, IOLTA \nfunding. With low interest rates over the course of past several years, \nthat funding has been devastated.\n  In Massachusetts alone, that used to be about $34 million a year \nthrough a separate fund that has been reduced to $4 million. The fact \nof the matter is, Mr. Chairman, that Legal Services has already been \ndecimated at a time when more and more people need to understand that \nthey have access to a fair and just legal system. That is what this \namendment seeks to do.\n  That is why I am proud to support it, and I ask my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, the Drug Enforcement Agency does \nextraordinarily important work in targeting high-level drug trafficking \norganizations--disrupting and dismantling them, attacking the economic \nbasis of the drug trade, and contributing to counterterrorism \nactivities that are tied to and financed by drugs.\n  We have seen the absolute anarchy in northern Mexico. Mexico is a \nfailed state. The northern part of the state is a complete disaster. We \nhave got utter lawlessness along the Texas border, the southwest \nborder, so it is so important that the DEA be given the resources that \nthey need to do their job.\n  I understand the concern about the Legal Services Corporation. I will \nbe filing legislation to give attorneys a dollar-for-dollar deduction \nin their taxes for services that they donate to the poor. I think it is \na far better way to get at the concern that we all have that legal \nservices be provided to the poor by doing that through the Tax Code \nrather than by appropriating our constituents' hard-earned tax dollars. \nThe DEA has a very, very important job to do.\n  As for the concerns that the gentleman has raised and that I have \nheard other people raise about some of the activities of some senior \nlevel folks at the DEA, we have withheld money from the Department of \nJustice in our bill specifically to encourage the new Attorney General \nto discipline those high-level DEA officials who were involved in that \nembarrassing and disgraceful episode that we saw take place in Colombia \nthat the inspector general uncovered.\n  That kind of behavior is not acceptable, and they should all be \nfired, and we have encouraged the new Attorney General to do so \nimmediately. However, I think the taking of additional money from the \nDEA is a bad idea, and I do encourage my colleagues to oppose the \namendment. I will also point out that we have an initial $43 million in \nthis bill for violence against women programs, specifically for legal \nassistance for domestic violence victims.\n  I do urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment in order to \nprotect the vital role that the DEA plays in the war on drugs.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, let me be clear. This does not cut the DEA. \nIt only reduces the amount of money it was increased by in the budget, \nand it was increased by something like $40 million in a $2 billion \nbudget. It would take $10 million, which would make a big difference to \nLegal Services.\n  Once the Rohrabacher-Cohen-Farr amendment passes, they won't be \nmessing with States that have legalized medical marijuana, and it will \ngive the DEA a lot more time to do the right things they need to do in \nnorthern Mexico and in other failed states; and as for the states that \nhaven't failed, stay out of them.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from \nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania (Mr. Fattah) for any comments he may have.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I don't want anyone to be confused here. On the floor, \nthe chairman from the subcommittee and from the full committee has \nsaid--and I have said it--that we realize that the Legal Services \nCorporation and the shortfall needs to be addressed.\n  I believe, before we pass a final bill, it will be addressed. There \nis no possibility that I am going to support a bill that has got $300 \nmillion funding for Legal Services Corporation.\n  There is this notion of a $10 million increase on top of a $25 \nmillion cut. I don't want these votes to be viewed as some kind of \nceiling for Legal Services, and I think we ought to be careful here to \nmake sure, as the House is working through this, that we understand \nthat the amount that the bill is at now is unacceptable. It has already \nbeen cut. Taking that cut and adding $10 million back to it is not a \nsatisfactory response, notwithstanding the intentions of our colleague \nhere.\n  We want to address the bigger issue, which is the full funding for \nLegal Services. As we go forward in this effort, I want to make my \nintentions clear that I intend to fight to make sure that we live up to \nour commitment and our responsibilities in terms of fully funding Legal \nServices.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I want to assure my friend from Philadelphia, as we \nget down further into conference, that we have got priorities in the \nbill that we did not have enough money for, and we will work hard with \nyou to try to find resources, but let's not take it from the DEA.\n  I would urge Members to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Tennessee \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n          Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \n     Firearms and Explosives, for training of State and local law \n     enforcement agencies with or without reimbursement, including \n     training in connection with the training and acquisition of \n     canines for explosives and fire accelerants detection; and \n     for provision of laboratory assistance to State and local law \n     enforcement agencies, with or without reimbursement, \n     $1,250,000,000, of which not to exceed $36,000 shall be for \n     official reception and representation expenses, not to exceed \n     $1,000,000 shall be available for the payment of attorneys' \n     fees as provided by section 924(d)(2) of title 18, United \n     States Code, and not to exceed $20,000,000 shall remain \n     available until expended: Provided, That none of the funds \n     appropriated herein shall be available to investigate or act \n     upon applications for relief from Federal firearms \n     disabilities under section 925(c) of title 18, United States \n     Code: Provided further, That such funds shall be available to \n     investigate and act upon applications filed by corporations \n     for relief from Federal firearms disabilities under section \n     925(c) of title 18, United States Code: Provided further, \n     That no funds made available by this or any other Act may be \n     used to transfer the functions, missions, or activities of \n     the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to \n     other agencies or Departments.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 33, line 19, insert after the dollar amount ``(reduced \n     by $5,000,000)''.\n       Page 42, line 24, insert after the dollar amount \n     ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.\n       Page 46, line 7, insert after the dollar amount \n     ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to stand with the veterans \nthroughout the country by offering a simple amendment to bolster funds \nin this act for Veterans Treatment Courts.\n  Veterans Treatment Courts promote sobriety and recovery through \ncoordinated local partnerships among community corrections agencies, \ndrug treatment providers, the judiciary, and other community support \ngroups. Veterans Treatment Courts have been extremely successful since \nthey were first\n\n[[Page H3706]]\n\ncreated in 2008 by a Buffalo judge to combat the growing numbers of \nveterans appearing before the court that were addicted to drugs and \nalcohol, as well as suffering from mental illness.\n  Many of our Nation's heroes returning from combat are traumatized due \nto the associated violence and pressure of war and often cope with such \nfeelings with substance abuse. They need focused treatment and a \nhelping hand, and these courts provide such an avenue.\n  The alternative to Veterans Treatment Courts is often jail time. I \nthink we can all agree that providing treatment for our veterans \nthrough community partnerships at the local level is a far better \noption than locking them up.\n  My amendment pays for this modest increase for this critical \ninitiative by reducing funds for the salaries and expenses for the \noverreaching Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives by $5 \nmillion. I offered a very similar amendment last year, which was \nadopted by voice vote.\n  The ATF's salaries and expenses are slated to receive an increase of \n$49 million from fiscal year 2015 enacted levels, which would bring the \ntotal appropriation level to $1.25 billion. My amendment redirects \nfunds from bureaucrats in the mismanaged and overzealous ATF to a \nworthy treatment program for our Nation's veterans.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to, once again, show \ntheir support for the worthwhile program by passing my commonsense \namendment.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership on \nthis bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment, but I am not opposed to it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman has a good amendment, and \nI encourage the House to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 33, line 19, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(decreased by $5,000,000)''.\n       Page 42, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.\n       Page 46, line 9, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer another amendment to \nthis bill, along with my colleague from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), that seeks \nto bolster another important program.\n  First, I reiterate my thanks to the committee for the long hours they \nhave dedicated to prioritizing limited resources in order to produce \nthis bill, but I simply believe the House should not reward bad \nbehavior for that type that the ATF has shown recently. My amendment is \nsimple, and it is nearly identical to an amendment I offered last year, \nwhich was adopted by voice vote.\n  The amendment shifts $5 million from the overreaching ATF bureaucrats \nto a worthy and effective program known as the Harold Rogers \nPrescription Drug Monitoring Program.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  You ask why $5 million. Because that amount would bring the \nPrescription Drug Monitoring Program appropriations back to the level \noriginally approved by the House last year. The gentleman, Mr. Rogers \nof Kentucky, is the chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, \nand he has been unrelenting on the issue of combating prescription drug \nabuse.\n  This problem is truly plaguing our streets, our youth, and our \ncommunities. Prescription drug abuse is contributing to addiction, \nhealth deterioration, and even untimely death for too many across our \ncountry. Prescription drug abuse also fuels the demand for other \nillicit drugs, such as cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, and heroin, \nalong with human trafficking, gunrunning, and murder. Much of the \nsolicitation activity flows over our southwestern border and into my \nhome State of Arizona.\n  The primary purpose of the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program is to \nenhance the capacity of regulatory and law enforcement agencies to \ncollect and analyze controlled substance prescription data through a \ncentralized database administered by an authorized State agency. States \nthat have implemented the PDMP can collect and analyze this data much \nmore effectively than States in which collection of this data requires \nmanual review of pharmacy files.\n  It is this body's duty, through the annual appropriations process, to \nevaluate which programs are worthwhile and which ones are not. The \nPrescription Drug Monitoring Program has shown promising results, but \nwe must not give up. We must continue to think of our families, our \nfriends, and our future generations.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment. I thank \nChairman Culberson and Ranking Member Fattah.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I am \nnot opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I support the effort here to increase \nfunding for a very important program that is addressing a major problem \nin our country. I divorce myself from the offset, not in terms of the \nactual offset, but in any criticism of the ATF. I think that they have \nsome very brave, courageous Americans who are trying to make our \ncountry safer. I think in lieu of the balancing act here, I support the \namendment, and I agree with it.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  If I could also point out, actually, the ATF did the right thing \nhere. I strenuously disagreed with the ammo ban and had a chance to \nmeet with the head of the ATF, as I was the new chairman of the CJS \nSubcommittee, and walked him through the problems he was going to face \non this House floor with amendments and problems with their budget and \ntheir spending plan this year.\n  He is a patriot, former marine, and a lifelong law enforcement \nofficer. He understood they had kind of gone beyond the bounds of the \nstatute, so he agreed to drop the ban on .223 ammunition after I had a \nvery good heart-to-heart meeting with him, and so ATF did the right \nthing. I think we should encourage good behavior.\n  I want to recognize and I want to thank the new head of the ATF for \ndoing the right thing and not going after law-abiding Americans' \nconstitutional right to possess and use perfectly lawful .223 \nammunition and focus on enforcing the statute, which is designed to \nprotect police officers from armor-piercing bullets that can be fired \nfrom pistols.\n  ATF did the right thing here, but I think the gentleman has a good \namendment. That money is going to a good cause. The Prescription Drug \nMonitoring Program is a good one. I share my colleague's support for \nthe amendment. I want to encourage Members to vote for it, but I want \nto be sure the Record reflects that the ATF did the right thing in \ndropping the ammo ban, and I don't expect we are going to see another \nattempt by the ATF to attempt to ban .223 ammunition because the new \nchairman of the CJS Subcommittee will be on them immediately.\n  Mr. FATTAH. We are in agreement again, maybe coming to it from \ndifferent angles, but the important thing is we are at a ``yes'' on \nthis amendment. The way we all get to these points may be different.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), my friend.\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague from Arizona for \nyielding me time to speak on this very\n\n[[Page H3707]]\n\nimportant amendment. I want to thank him for his leadership.\n  Prescription drug abuse has become an epidemic in my home State of \nArkansas and throughout our country. I am so grateful for people like \nChief Kirk Lane of Benton, Arkansas, who leads on this issue throughout \nmy district.\n  Tonight I speak from the well of our beloved House first as a dad, \nand a Congressman second. I have had personal experiences with the \ntragic loss of life that come as a result of prescription drug abuse, \nand many times our children and our loved ones are the ones who are so \nclosely affected and impacted.\n  My daughter is 18 years old, and she already knows four people in her \nage group who have lost their lives due to the influence of \nprescription drugs and the related impacts. That is tragic.\n  I am proud that Arkansas recently passed legislation that gives law \nenforcement investigators access to our State's Prescription Drug \nMonitoring Program. This law in my State will enhance investigative \ncapabilities and will give law enforcement investigators better ability \nto bring criminals to justice who are abusing prescription drug \npractices and trying to dump those drugs back on the street.\n  This is a serious problem that deserves more of our attention, first \nat our dinner tables, in our schools, and in our capitol buildings. I \nam so proud to support Mr. Gosar's amendment that cuts money from the \noverhead at the ATF and will strengthen these prescription drug \nmonitoring activities.\n  I thank the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for his kind words in \nsupport.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word and enter \ninto a colloquy.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. \nBlum).\n  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Chairman, as a small-business man and a supporter of \nthe private sector, I wish to commend the committee for the inclusion \nof report language which states: ``The committee encourages NOAA to \npurchase services from the private sector when such services are \navailable, cost effective, and practicable.''\n  As my friend from Texas knows, NOAA operates a fleet of survey ships \nfor nautical charting as well as a fleet of survey aircraft for aerial \nphotography and LIDAR for mapping. However, the inspector general of \nthe Department of Commerce has long recommended that the aircraft fleet \nbe privatized, as aerial survey operations are better, faster, and less \nexpensive when purchased from the private sector. In fact, the \ninspector general found NOAA survey operations cost 42 percent more \nthan the private sector, which was then confirmed by a second NOAA-\ncommissioned study.\n  Rather than accept these cost savings and productivity improvement \nrequirements, NOAA has continually acquired new planes, new aerial \nsensors, and new ships. This is not only poor stewardship of taxpayer \nmoney and inefficient use of resources, but results in the government \nduplicating and directly competing with private enterprise. There are \nnumerous companies, including small businesses, ready and able to \nperform these services for NOAA at a reduced cost and increased \nquality.\n  I have visited one such private sector mapping firm in my district \nand heard firsthand about how government agencies are engaged in this \nbehavior, which hinders private economic growth and job creation.\n  My question for the gentleman from Texas is: Regarding the language I \nquoted earlier, is it the intent of the committee to include \ncontracting for such surveying and mapping services when there is a \nqualified, capable, and cost-effective solution available in the \nprivate sector?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I want to thank my colleague from Iowa for raising \nthis important point, and the committee does expect NOAA to utilize the \nprivate sector for these services when they are available and cost \neffective and practicable. I deeply appreciate my friend's interest and \nlook forward to continuing to work with him on these issues to ensure \nthey are taken care of as we move through the process.\n  Mr. BLUM. I thank my friend from Texas and appreciate his hard work \non this important legislation.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Byrne\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 33, line 19, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $250,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Alabama and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, my straightforward amendment would cut the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, by 20 \npercent. That would result in $250 million worth of savings.\n  Let me make one thing clear. I know that the ATF has an important \nmission to play in keeping our Nation safe and regulating everything \nfrom firearms to alcohol. That said, in the last few years, we have \nseen an outrageous growth in operations and regulations coming out of \nthe ATF.\n  How could we forget the Fast and Furious gun trafficking scheme that \nwas allowed to go so far offtrack that 2,000 guns were allowed to flow \nto Mexican drug trafficking groups? Worst of all, a Federal law \nenforcement officer was killed with a gun from that operation.\n  There was Operation Fearless, where an undercover operation in \nMilwaukee, Wisconsin, went horribly wrong. Convicted felons were given \naccess to weapons, the fake storefront was burglarized, and $39,000 in \nmerchandise was lost. The ATF even used someone with developmental \ndisabilities in the operation and ultimately arrested him for his \ninvolvement.\n  From Wichita, Kansas, to Portland, Oregon, to Atlanta, Georgia, the \nstories of botched operations and inappropriate action just goes on and \non.\n  Then there was the ATF's recent attempt to reclassify common M855 \nammunition as armor piercing, despite its exemption from this \nclassification since 1986 for sporting purposes. Thankfully, this \nproposal was dropped after pressure from Congress.\n  Mr. Chairman, the people I represent in southwest Alabama are tired \nof a Federal Government that doesn't live within its means. They want \nto see their elected officials in Washington get serious about making \ncuts to the Federal bureaucracy. My constituents also are tired of \nexecutive overreach and the Federal Government involving itself in \nareas where it simply doesn't belong.\n  I know that the committee and Chairman Culberson have made real \nefforts to rein in the ATF, and I appreciate those efforts. I also \nunderstand that ATF is now under new leadership, and I hope that the \nnew leaders get serious about much-needed reforms.\n  I am all for safety and responsible gun ownership, and the ATF does \nhave a role to play in that, but this amendment would simply require \nATF to return to its core functions and responsibilities. It would \ncause ATF to look at itself in the mirror, find areas where they can \ncut back, and refocus on their true priorities.\n  Ultimately, this amendment is about protecting our Second Amendment \nrights while also pushing for real reforms to Federal spending. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I do understand the gentleman's concern. \nMy constituents and all of us were upset with the ATF's attempt to ban \n.223 ammunition, but they did the right thing: they withdrew the ammo \nban after I had a heart-to-heart with them. By doing the right thing, I \nthink we should reward good behavior.\n  I am monitoring them very closely. We have spending plan language in \nour bill that allows the subcommittee to have ongoing oversight over \nnot only\n\n[[Page H3708]]\n\nthe ATF and Department of Justice, every agency under our jurisdiction \nhas to submit a spending plan to us that is then subjected to careful \nongoing oversight throughout the year; and if we cut ATF by $250 \nmillion, they are not able to do all the important work that they are \nnow engaged in, and it would really devastate the agency.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  There are a lot of dedicated law enforcement officers in that agency \nthat are doing their very best to fight gangs and violent criminals.\n  We have visited with the folks at ATF. They are not concerned about \nlaw-abiding citizens or a gun dealer who is following the law. They are \nfocused on the criminal element in the country.\n  So I would encourage Members, and I would be happy to work with you \nand share with you the ongoing oversight work that I am doing. I \nencourage you to visit with the new ATF Director. He is a very \nimpressive man: a marine and a lifelong law enforcement officer who did \nthe right thing here.\n  The agency is devoted to protecting Americans' Second Amendment \nrights. As the new chairman, if I ever detect any deviation from that, \nI assure you this son of the South is going to make sure our Second \nAmendment rights are protected.\n  I would encourage Members to oppose the amendment. I just don't want \nto see the ATF devastated.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for his superb \nwork in this area. We are in great debt to you for all that you have \ndone. And I am 100 percent confident you will continue to do that.\n  I don't know the new leadership over there. I pray that it is truly \nnew leadership. Because what has happened at ATF is simply not \nacceptable. And it is particularly not acceptable when it interferes \nwith the Second Amendment rights of the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  So I thank the gentleman. I know that he will do everything he \npossibly can. I will take him up on his offer to meet the new \nleadership.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I urge Members to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I visited at the ATF headquarters. In looking at their \nwork particularly focused on explosives--and their new site in \nAlabama--looking at some of the work that they are doing around the \ncountry, it is so vitally important that I think at this time in our \ncountry's history for us to retreat from our commitment to this agency \nwould be a very unfortunate and unwise decision.\n  So I would hope that the House would vote in opposition to this \namendment and make sure that as we go forward we can try to address \nwhatever the concerns are. But cutting ATF by this amount of money \nwould put so many Americans at risk, and I think it would be unwise.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Reclaiming my time, I join my colleague in urging a \n``no'' vote on this amendment, and will, again, work with my colleague \nin making sure the ATF continues to protect the Second Amendment rights \nof Americans.\n  There is no greater power the Congress has than the power of the \npurse. I assure you as the new chairman that I am monitoring very, very \nclosely to make sure that ATF, FBI, and the Department of Justice \nenforce the law and preserve our Second Amendment Rights.\n  Therefore, I urge Members to vote ``no'', and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Buck\n\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 33, line 25, strike ``none of the'' and insert \n     ``such''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chair, I rise to strike language from this \nappropriations bill that denies hope, denies dignity, and denies \nAmericans their Second Amendment right to bear arms.\n  When I was district attorney in northern Colorado, a gentleman \nvisited my office. He told me a story that I have heard from many, many \nothers. He told me that 40 years ago, when he was in college, he gave \nhis landlord a bad check. He pled guilty to a felony.\n  The past 40 years, he has been a model citizen. He finished college. \nHe work hard and raised a family. Now he wants to go hunting with his \ngrandchild. He can't because he is a convicted felon.\n  The law allows the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives to restore this man's right to possess a firearm. The burden \nis on the applicant to prove that he is not a danger. ATF may \ninvestigate to make sure. This appropriations bill prohibits ATF from \nprocessing applications, from following the law established by Congress \n30 years ago.\n  America is a compassionate country. We restore the right to vote in \nmany States, and other rights. There is no good reason to prevent law-\nabiding citizens from, at the very least, petitioning ATF to have their \nrights restored.\n  The change I am seeking is fair and reasonable, and it is long \noverdue. People who are able to prove to ATF that their possession of a \nfirearm would pose no danger to society would finally, after over two \ndecades of unfair treatment, be permitted to make their case and have \ntheir rights restored.\n  Not everyone who petitions ATF will have their rights restored. In \nfact, this bill does not intend in any way, shape, or form to allow a \nviolent criminal to possess a firearm--only those nonviolent criminals \nthat ATF deems are not a danger. Not everyone will have their rights \nrestored, but Washington should not get in the way of Americans asking \nfor a second chance.\n  For these reasons, I respectfully request support for this amendment, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom Wisconsin and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chair, my amendment transfers $2 million into the \nMentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act for the purpose \nof expanding and improving police training to safely and appropriately \nrespond to mentally ill individuals.\n  Now, Mr. Chair, we have heard a lot lately in the news about high \nprofile police-involved shootings that have become a major subject here \naround the country and here in Congress. Not surprising to some of us, \nespecially those of us who hail from large urban cities, this is a \nwidespread problem that has been around for a while.\n  But today, I am offering this amendment to highlight one serious \nissue that I think should be a major part of our current national \ndialogue: ensuring that police have adequate training to identify \npersons with mental illness and to safely, when it is possible, resolve \nencounters during a crisis.\n  Mr. Chair, indulge me for a moment while I tell you a story about a \n31-year-old man in my home district of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who, \nunfortunately, is no longer with us today. His name was Dontre \nHamilton.\n  Dontre, like many people in this country, suffered from a mental \nillness. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia 1 year prior to the \nincident and had been off his medication due to an insurance issue.\n  On April 30 of last year, Dontre was taking a nap on a public park \nbench when employees of a nearby Starbucks called the police. Two \npolice officers came and did a wellness check and left the scene, \ndiscerning that Mr. Hamilton was no threat to himself, nor to anyone in \nthe park or the public.\n  Soon thereafter, yet another call came from the Starbucks employee \nbecause this gentleman was sleeping on the public park bench. Another \npolice officer, Officer Manney of the Milwaukee Police Department, \narrived and started to pat down Dontre. This pat-down turned into a \nstruggle, and Officer Manney pulled out his baton to help him subdue \nMr. Hamilton.\n  The struggle escalated, and Dontre got control of the baton and swung \nit at Officer Manney. This caused Officer Manney to draw his firearm \nand shoot 14 bullets into Dontre Hamilton.\n  Officer Manney was terminated for conducting a pat-down in \ncontravention of his training on dealing with mentally ill individuals \nbut faced no charges in the death of Dontre Hamilton.\n  Mr. Chair, perhaps this tragedy could have been prevented. Too often, \nour mental health infrastructure is woefully inadequate for many \nAmericans. A lack of treatment can turn a treatable mental illness into \na severe debilitating condition. Many can't hold a job or pay rent. \nMany end up homeless on the streets. In fact, more than 124,000 of the \n610,000 homeless people in the United States suffer from a severe \nmental illness.\n  As a result of many failures in our system, our Nation's police \nofficers have de facto become our country's first responders to crisis \ncalls, including those individuals experiencing mental illness. Too \noften these calls, many intended to be out of concern for the \nindividual in crisis, become a tragic fatality.\n  As we know, mentally ill persons are not generally dangerous, Mr. \nChair. In fact, they are actually more likely to become victims \nthemselves than actual perpetrators of violence. Many of these tragic \nencounters could be prevented if police officers are trained and follow \nproper procedures.\n  The Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act is an \nimportant Federal initiative and tool that will help us bridge this \ngap. This law established a grant program called the Justice and Mental \nHealth Collaboration Program which helps States and localities develop \ncollaborative approaches to dealing with the intersection of criminal \njustice and mental health systems.\n  One of the authorized grant uses under the program is training to \npolice officers for exactly these purposes: to safely respond to crisis \ncalls and limit the chance of a tragic and often preventable \nconsequence.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I am \nnot opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Woodall). Without objection, the gentleman from \nTexas is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. The gentlewoman has a good amendment, and I want to \nencourage Members to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Connolly\n\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n       Page 34, line 19, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $1,,000,000)''.\n       Page 42, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $1,000,000)''.\n       Page 46, line 7, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chairman and \nthe distinguished ranking member and their staffs for their cooperation \non this amendment.\n  The amendment increases the funding for Veterans Treatment Courts by \n$1 million. I offered a similar amendment last year that the House also \nadopted on a voice vote.\n  With the additional funds provided by this amendment, a total of $6 \nmillion would be available for such courts, which is still short of the \n$8 million Congress has authorized under the bipartisan Mentally Ill \nOffender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act.\n  Our Nation's heroes are returning home from more than a decade of \nwar. Upon their return, they bear the visible and invisible wounds of \ndeployment. Substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic \nbrain injury, and various mental health disorders can lead our \nreturning heroes down a difficult and often lonely path during their \ntransition to civilian life.\n  Twenty percent of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans suffer from post-\n\n[[Page H3710]]\n\ntraumatic stress disorder or major depression. One in six battle with \nsubstance abuse. Left undiagnosed or untreated, these illnesses can \nresult in an encounter with the justice system. Worse yet, these \nillnesses can also lead to suicide, which veterans commit at twice the \nrate of our civilian population.\n  Fortunately, specialized Veterans Treatment Courts are being \ndeveloped across the country, including in my home county of Fairfax in \nVirginia, to help veterans who do find themselves in the justice system \nand suffer from substance addiction or mental health disorders so that \nthey can alter their course and find the assistance they deserve, Mr. \nChairman.\n  The first such court was established in Buffalo, New York, in 2008; \nand since then, more than 200 have opened across the Nation. Hundreds \nmore are currently going through the planning and training process.\n  Today, there are more than 11,000 vets enrolled in Veterans Treatment \nCourts. Virginia is home to the sixth largest veteran population in the \ncountry, with nearly 850,000 veterans, more than 10 percent of whom \nlive in my district, the 11th Congressional District of Virginia.\n  The comprehensive treatment program provides eligible veterans with \nan alternative to jail and incarceration. Participating veterans must \ncommit to an 18- to 24-month program, during which they receive group \ncounseling, a dedicated veteran mentor, and enroll in vocational \neducation and self-help programs.\n  By bringing veteran service organizations, State veterans service \ndepartments, and volunteer mentors into the courtrooms, Veterans \nTreatment Courts can promote community collaboration and connect \nveterans with the programs and benefits they have earned and that they \nmay need.\n  Having a veteran-only court docket ensures that everyone, from the \njudge to the volunteers, specializes in veterans care, and the \ninvolvement of fellow veterans allows the defendant to experience a \ncamaraderie to which he or she became accustomed in the military.\n  We know this model works, and it is our hope this amendment will \nprovide these courts with the resources they need to help our veterans \nwho fall into the justice system to get back on the right track and \ntransition successfully back into the society they swore to defend.\n  In closing, again, I want to thank the distinguished chairman, the \ndistinguished ranking member, and their respective staffs for their \ncooperation in this matter.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although \nI support the gentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I think the gentleman has a good amendment, and I \nwould encourage the Members to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word and enter \ninto a colloquy with my good friend, the gentleman from North Carolina \n(Mr. Price).\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from North \nCarolina (Mr. Price) for a colloquy.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding, Mr. \nChairman.\n  During the full committee consideration of this legislation, the \nchairman will recall that we discussed the accompanying report language \nthat, for the first time, would allocate NSF research funding by \ndirectorate and, in particular, would disproportionately reduce funding \nfor the Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences and the \nDirectorate for Geosciences. This has raised critical questions and \nconcerns within the scientific community.\n  As the legislative process goes forward, I ask for the chairman's \nassurance that we can work together to preserve the National Science \nFoundation's traditional discretion and flexibility in allocating basic \nresearch funding among the Foundation's directorates.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I look forward to working with you, Dr. Price, and \nother members of the subcommittee and the full committee, as well as \nthe Science, Space, and Technology Committee, to ensure that we protect \nthe independence of the National Science Foundation.\n  It is vitally important that America preserves its leadership role in \nthe world, and scientific research and NSF and NASA have been a vital \npart of that.\n  A strong supporter of our investment in the sciences, my favorite \nFounding Father, Thomas Jefferson, liked to say that liberty was the \nfirstborn of science.\n  It is vital that we work together, as I will with you, sir, as we \nmove through conference, to continue to preserve the flexibility and \nindependence of the National Science Foundation. We, in the committee \nreport, are simply working to make sure NSF prioritizes their funding, \nbut I will continue to work with you throughout this process as we move \nforward.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I thank the gentleman. This is \ncritically important. I appreciate the chance to work on this, as the \nlegislation moves forward.\n  Mr. CULBERSON.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike section 527.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman\n\n[[Page H3717]]\n\nfrom New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I have two amendments. The first strikes \nsection 527; the second strikes section 528. I had to put them in as \ntwo separate amendments because only one amendment pends at a time, but \nthey are really together.\n  Sections 527 and 528, which my amendment would strike, restricts the \nPresident's authority to move Guantanamo Bay detainees to the United \nStates for trial.\n  Mr. Chairman, simply put, it is time to punish Khalid Sheikh \nMohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. In GTMO, he has not been \ntried, convicted, or punished. Meanwhile, Federal courts have tried, \nconvicted, and punished more than 400 terrorists. None of them have \never escaped from a U.S. prison. No prison where they are located has \never been subjected to an attack.\n  The only thing my friends who are opposed to closing Guantanamo have \non their side is fear. Fear, Mr. Chairman. As they argue against this \namendment, they will try to tell us that these men are dangerous and \nscary, that these men can harm us, that these men are the worst of the \nworst--and some may be--but these men are already in our custody.\n  Like so many murderers and terrorists already in prison, they have no \npower over us. They have been shut off from the outside world for more \nthan a decade.\n  If there are terrible people in Guantanamo--and I am not denying that \nthere are--then it is time for them to face the consequences of their \nactions in a U.S. court. And that is the rub. The terrorists that have \nbeen prosecuted and sentenced had their day in court and were found \nguilty.\n  U.S. Federal courts have successfully tried and convicted criminals \nand terrorists during times of war and peace for hundreds of years, all \nwhile respecting the rights of due process that our Constitution \ndemands.\n  This leads me to believe that some of my colleagues do not believe in \nthe American system of justice. They do not trust our American courts \nto do justice. I do not understand why.\n  Through the centuries, our legal system has kept America safe by \nputting away dangerous individuals while protecting those who were \ninnocent of the government's charges against them. That is the beauty \nof our system that has made it the envy of the world.\n  The principles underpinning the system, the right to due process and \nto a fair trial, are built into our Constitution and are part of our \nmost basic values. But in order for the system to work, you actually \nneed to get your day in court.\n  Without our amendment, this bill guarantees that we will continue \nholding people indefinitely at Guantanamo Bay.\n  Even though we suspect that we are holding people who are terrorists, \nsome of whom probably are, in fact, terrorists, none of this has been \nproven in a court of law. Without this amendment, we will continue to \nhold them indefinitely without charge, contrary to every tradition this \ncountry stands for, contrary to any notion of due process.\n  The founding principles of the United States, that no person may be \ndeprived of liberty without due process of law and certainly may not be \ndeprived of liberty indefinitely without due process of law, demands \nthat we close the detention facility at Guantanamo.\n  We must close this facility, try these people, condemn the guilty, \nplace them in supermax facilities, release the innocent, if there are \nany; and restore our national honor. I urge the support of this \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I want to make sure everyone in the \nHouse understands that what the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) is \nattempting to do is to give constitutional rights to foreign nationals \ncaptured on battlefields overseas who are being held in Guantanamo Bay. \nNever before in American history have we ever given foreign nationals--\nenemy combatants captured overseas on a battlefield--constitutional \nrights, the most precious rights we have, that were fought for, bled \nfor, died for by our forefathers on so many battlefields all over the \nworld to preserve these precious rights reserved for the people of the \nUnited States of America. Mr. Nadler wants to extend the protections of \nthis Constitution to the killers and the psychopaths who have killed so \nmany Americans overseas.\n  I could not disagree more strenuously. I know the House disagrees \nstrenuously. We have voted on this repeatedly. And the House and the \nCongress have repeatedly affirmed this language, which says very \nclearly, ``none of the funds appropriated''--this is the language Mr. \nNadler seeks to strike:\n  ``None of the funds appropriated . . . in this or any other Act may \nbe used to transfer, release, or assist in the transfer or release to \nor within the United States . . . Khalid Sheikh Mohammed or any other \ndetainee who is not a United States citizen or a member of the Armed \nForces . . . and is or was held on or after June 24, 2009 . . . at \nGuantanamo Bay.''\n  During World War II, a group of Nazi saboteurs who landed on beaches \nin Long Island and in Florida were captured fairly rapidly by local \npolice officers and local militia and were handed over to the U.S. \nmilitary. Franklin Roosevelt did the right thing, and they immediately \nheld these Nazis as military detainees. They were accorded a trial \nunder the Code of Military Justice and executed, as they should have \nbeen, I think within about 60 days.\n  This is not really an issue with the American people, who I hope, Mr. \nChairman, are out watching tonight because there could not be a more \ndramatic contrast between the majority in the House that is \nrepresenting the will of the Nation in seeing that our laws are \nenforced and the enemies of the United States are hunted down wherever \nthey may hide.\n\n  I had a constituent tell me Hamas stands for ``hiding among mosques \nand schools.'' Wherever these people may hide--they hide behind women \nand children. They will not face our soldiers on the battlefield. When \nwe have met them on the battlefield, we have defeated them decisively.\n  Where the men and women of the United States military find these \npeople and hunt them down and kill them or capture them--if we have \ncaptured them and they have information that could save American lives, \nwe bring them to Guantanamo Bay, and we have saved countless lives by \nholding them there.\n  We, in this appropriations bill, make clear that we will not give \nthese killers, these cowards, these terrorists, these foreign fighters \non foreign battlefields the precious rights reserved for the people of \nthe United States by this Constitution. And it is that simple.\n  If you want to give terrorists, foreign fighters on foreign \nbattlefields constitutional rights, you should vote with the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Nadler).\n  Vote against Mr. Nadler's amendment if you believe that the rights \nguaranteed by this Constitution are reserved for the people of the \nUnited States and that if you are an enemy combatant, a foreign \nnational fighting the United States, you are going to be dealt with \nseverely and accorded the Code of Military Justice, as it should be.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NADLER. How much time do I have remaining, Mr. Chairman?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 90 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  First of all, almost everything the gentleman just said is not \napropos and is wrong.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the people at \nGuantanamo have exactly the same constitutional rights--no more and no \nless--than they would have if brought to the United States. So it has \nnothing to do with giving constitutional rights to foreign nationals.\n  Second of all, some of these people were, indeed, captured on foreign \nbattlefields; some were not.\n  Third of all, maybe they should be tried by military tribunals. But \nthey have been held for 11, 12, 14, 15 years. We can't manage to try \nthem by foreign tribunals. Put them in a Federal court. Try them. \nConvict them.\n\n[[Page H3718]]\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  Put them in a Federal court, try them, and convict them. If you want \nto put them in a military tribunal, you can do that, fine. We haven't \nmanaged to. But the fact is, by staying in Guantanamo, they don't have \nany less, fewer, or more constitutional rights than are here. Anyone \nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States, according to the Supreme \nCourt, has constitutional rights. We must treat them with due process. \nAll this amendment says is treat them the way the Supreme Court has \nsaid we should: try them, condemn them, or find them innocent, as the \ncase may be. Some may be innocent. Many of them are not. Some may be. \nWe should follow our traditions.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of this amendment so that we can \napply American concepts of justice as the Supreme Court has said we \nmust.\n  We can try them by military tribunal in Guantanamo or in the United \nStates. We can try them in Federal Court. Military tribunals haven't \nworked. We haven't been able to make them work. Federal courts have \nworked. We should condemn the guilty and release the innocent, if there \nare any.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes\n  Mr. FATTAH. It was not long after 9/11 that we held a conversation \nhere in Washington, and the former Speaker was on a panel over in \nRayburn, I think. We were discussing this, and he said, well, this is \nthe situation that we find ourselves in after these attacks. And I \nasked Speaker Gingrich at the time, former Speaker, this notion of us \nbeing a nation of laws, what did that mean now. Because under former \nPresident Bush, the original President Bush, he had complained about \nthe Chinese holding people without trial. We had issued a formal \ncomplaint that the Chinese were holding people without trial, using \nsecret evidence and so forth and so on, and what did this mean now in \nthe context of our own country's conduct. Speaker Gingrich said that, \nwell, he wasn't really sure because we are at a difficult moment.\n  So now we are here. We have had two Presidents who tried to close \nGuantanamo. President Bush who opened it, and his second administration \nwanted to end it, and then we had two Presidential elections in which \nthe country voted for Barack Obama, who said he wanted to close this \nfacility. We have a congressional majority that is not going to do it, \nthat is going to put every impediment in the way of doing it.\n  We have our national security enterprise that says that this is used \nas a recruitment tool against our interests, that this is working \nagainst the security of the United States. And, more important than \nperhaps even that is, I am sure, gnaws at our ideals as Americans that \nyou would take someone, hold them, never try them, never produce any \nevidence in a tribunal of any type, military or civilian, and say that \nyou are going to do it in perpetuity, that this is not the great Nation \nthat our ideal speaks to. This is the act of something less than what \nwe should be doing as a great country.\n  Mr. Chairman, I know that it is not popular and Mr. Nadler's \namendment is not going to probably enjoy majority support, but at the \nend of the day, we can't just ask what is popular or what is politic. \nAt some point, we have to ask ourselves what is the right thing. If we \ncan complain about China holding people without charge, with secret \nevidence and no trial and no access to lawyers, then we have to think \nabout looking in the mirror and think about what we have allowed other \npeople's actions to turn our country into in this circumstance.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Nadler amendment, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Let me, if I could, Mr. Chairman, point out that President Obama has \nalready said he wants to close Guantanamo Bay and bring these people \ninto the United States. The 19th terrorist was captured in the United \nStates, and therefore he was entitled to constitutional protection \nbecause he was in the United States.\n  But the only thing standing between Barack Obama giving these \nterrorists and killers constitutional rights is this language in this \nappropriations bill which says none of the money in the United States \ncan be used to transfer these killers into the United States. As soon \nas they touch our soil, they will be given constitutional rights. And \nthat is exactly what Mr. Nadler wants to do with his amendment is give \nthese precious constitutional rights to these killers and these cowards \nthat have been captured on foreign battlefields, these foreign \nnationals who have never been afforded the protection of the United \nStates Constitution, which is reserved for the people of the United \nStates.\n  They deserve what they have got. They are lucky to be alive. They are \nlucky to be in Guantanamo Bay. And I urge Members to vote against this \namendment to ensure that these people are given what they deserve, and \nthat is, whether it be life in prison or whatever lies ahead of them, \nthat they will never again threaten the people of the United States.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to vote ``no,'' against Mr. Nadler's \namendment, to ensure that constitutional protections are only afforded \nto the people of the United States or those persons who are actually \nwithin our boundaries when they are captured or they commit a crime.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Sec. 528. (a) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available in this or any other Act may be used to \n     construct, acquire, or modify any facility in the United \n     States, its territories, or possessions to house any \n     individual described in subsection (c) for the purposes of \n     detention or imprisonment in the custody or under the \n     effective control of the Department of Defense.\n       (b) The prohibition in subsection (a) shall not apply to \n     any modification of facilities at United States Naval \n     Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n       (c) An individual described in this subsection is any \n     individual who, as of June 24, 2009, is located at United \n     States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and who--\n       (1) is not a citizen of the United States or a member of \n     the Armed Forces of the United States; and\n       (2) is--\n       (A) in the custody or under the effective control of the \n     Department of Defense; or\n       (B) otherwise under detention at United States Naval \n     Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Nadler\n\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment to strike section 528.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike section 528.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, this is really a continuation of our \ncolloquy from the last amendment since they both seek to do the same \nthing. Let me just say a couple of things.\n  Again, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that people in \nGuantanamo Bay have the same constitutional rights as people in \nFlorida, New York, or Washington, so I do not seek to give people in \nGuantanamo Bay constitutional rights they do not already have. They \nhave the constitutional rights. That was the Supreme Court decision, I \nthink, in 2009 I think the decision was. They have the constitutional \nrights. Anyone under the jurisdiction and effective control of the \nUnited States has the constitutional rights, so that is not really in \nquestion.\n  What is really in question is: Are we going to honor our obligations? \nNow, the gentleman says that some of these people are terrible people, \nthat they are murderers. Some of them may be,\n\n[[Page H3719]]\n\nand some of them are, but some of them may not be. They have not been \ntried. They ought to be tried.\n  As the gentleman from Pennsylvania said, we have criticized the \nChinese communists, and we have criticized many other nations for \nholding people in jail indefinitely, for not trying them and for not \ngiving them any kind of due process. These people, like any other human \nbeings, deserve some due process.\n  Some of them, I am sure, have been terrorists. They ought to be \ncondemned and put in jail forever. Some of them may not be. And some of \nthem were captured on foreign battlefields and some were not. Some of \nthem were simply victims of the Hatfields and the McCoys' feud between \ntwo tribes or clans in Afghanistan or wherever, and one clan said: Gee, \nthe Americans are paying a $5,000 bounty, so why don't we tip them off \nto our enemy and tell them that they are a terrorist. Some of them were \nvictims of that.\n  The facts ought to come out. Some due process ought to be given. No \none ought to be held in jail for life without a trial, without a \nhearing, and without some due process. That is what we stand for. And \nsimply saying that Americans deserve due process but other people do \nnot, A, it is wrong. Other people do not have constitutional rights, \nbut if they are in the United States, they do. If they are in \nGuantanamo, they have constitutional rights. The Supreme Court has \nalready said that.\n  So the question here is: Are we going to bring them to a facility in \nthe United States, a supermax facility? No one has escaped from them. \nIt is cheaper. It saves the taxpayers a lot of money. Give them a \nmilitary tribunal or a Federal trial and do what is right. That is what \nis at stake here.\n  I will say one other thing. Our military has told us time and time \nagain that the stain of Guantanamo, besides being a stain on our honor, \nis one of the greatest recruiting tools the terrorists have. They point \nto Guantanamo. They say: Look at those American hypocrites. They are \npersecuting Muslims. They are persecuting non-Americans.\n  Well, they have a point. And other people think they have a point, \nand they get angry. They get radicalized, and they become terrorists \nagainst us.\n  So why not, for the 120-odd people who are still at Guantanamo, the \nmajority of whom have been judged not to pose a threat to this country \nby our own military authorities, do the right thing? Give them a trial. \nThrow them in jail for whatever lengthy period of time is indicated if \nthey are guilty. And if they are not, then they ought to be released if \nthey are not guilty of a crime, if they haven't been terrorists. We \nhave to have some evidence. We can't simply point to someone and say, \n``He is guilty of a crime. He is a terrorist,'' without some evidence \nto that fact. That is our tradition. Mr. Chairman, that is what this \namendment calls for.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, let me point out to all the Members of \nthe House and those listening here this evening that the section Mr. \nNadler attempts to strike is the only thing standing between President \nBarack Obama and his attempt to close Guantanamo Bay and transfer all \nthese killers, these cowards, and these foreign nationals captured on \nthe foreign battlefields either attempting to or having already killed \nAmerican soldiers. This language that Mr. Nadler is attempting to \nstrike prohibits, says:\n  None of the funds appropriated by this or any other act may be used \nto construct or acquire or modify any facility in the United States to \nhouse any individual transferred into the United States from Guantanamo \nBay.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, we have got two provisions in this bill: no money \nto transfer anybody from Guantanamo into the United States--and that \namendment, which will be a record vote, will be decisively defeated by \nthe House in a minute--and then this amendment which Mr. Nadler is \noffering. We have put language in this bill for the last several years \nto make sure that President Obama cannot use Federal hard-earned \ntaxpayer dollars to build a prison facility or modify it to house \nanybody transferred from Guantanamo.\n  Now, this is very clear-cut. This is very simple. Obviously anybody \nheld, if you are in a military tribunal, you get due process. That is \nnot the issue. What Mr. Nadler is attempting to do with this amendment, \nagain, is to give constitutional rights to foreign nationals captured \non foreign battlefields engaged, and we are still at war with these \npeople. We are still at war. And Mr. Nadler is attempting to extend \nconstitutional protections fought for and died for by our ancestors to \nenemy combatants captured on foreign battlefields--never been done, \nabsolutely unprecedented, and, frankly, unbelievable. I cannot even \nimagine the cost, the sacrifice, the burden on American taxpayers, the \nthreat to American safety, for what?\n  So these foreign nationals, these psychopathic killers in ISIL are \ngoing to respect us and like us because we give them a trial and gave \nthem constitutional protection? Yeah, that is going to happen.\n  Mr. Chairman, we are at war with a medieval mindset that is \ndetermined to destroy our way of life and our liberty. They are hostile \nto everything that our Founding Fathers fought for. These people would \ndestroy this Constitution that we have had for over 200 years, worked \nso hard to preserve and protect.\n  I cannot think of anything more destructive or damaging to the morale \nof our troops, to the morale of our Nation, and to all of those \nfamilies who lost loved ones in the war on terror than to bring in \nthese killers and cowards in the United States and grant them the \nprotections guaranteed to American citizens in the United States \nConstitution.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to oppose this amendment, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Again, Mr. Chairman, even the Nazis who came ashore on Long Island \nthat the gentleman referred to before were tried in the military \ntribunal. They weren't simply thrown in jail and held forever. They \nwere tried in a military tribunal, condemned, and then sentenced to \ndeath.\n  All this amendment says is we should do the same thing, that people \nwho are in the custody and the jurisdiction of the United States \nalready have constitutional rights. We are not giving them \nconstitutional rights. The Supreme Court already said they have them. \nWe are saying they should get a military tribunal or a civilian trial, \nwhichever is chosen. This amendment doesn't deal with that. And they \nshould be condemned or not.\n  One more thing. The gentleman keeps saying that these people were \nenemies of the United States captured on the foreign battlefield. Some \nwere and some were not.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. NADLER. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Thank you, Mr. Nadler, because the section we are \ndealing with is a prohibition against building a prison facility in the \nUnited States to house these people. So that is what the debate needs \nto be about. What you are attempting to strike is a prohibition against \nusing our taxpayers' hard-earned dollars to build a prison to house \nthese killers.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. NADLER. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, this is an appropriations bill. I just want \neverybody to know it is $2 million per inmate at Guantanamo. It is a \npremium facility, $2 million per inmate.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from New York has \nexpired.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, the question before the House is whether \nor not our taxpayers' hard-earned dollars are going to be used to build \na prison facility in the United States to house the terrorists and \nkillers and cowards held in Guantanamo Bay. That is the question before \nus.\n  Mr. NADLER. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from New York.\n\n[[Page H3720]]\n\n  Mr. NADLER. Does the gentleman not know what has been testified to \nrepeatedly, that it will be a lot cheaper for the taxpayers' money to \nhold them in the United States than in Guantanamo?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Well, that may be your opinion, sir, but we will not, \nand will not ever, afford constitutional rights or house foreign \nfighters captured on a foreign battlefield who have been killing the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces of the United States on a foreign \nbattlefield, we are never going to house them in a prison in the United \nStates. We are never going to give them constitutional rights. Those \nrights are reserved to the people of the United States and the people \nwho commit crimes within the boundaries of the United States.\n  The 19th terrorist, who didn't quite make it that day, was captured \nin the United States, and he was given a trial, as he should be. The \nConstitution extends protections to persons within the United States. \nThese people, again, whom we are at war with have never been afforded \nconstitutional protections. And you are right, the Nazis captured in \nLong Island and in Florida were given due process in a military \ntribunal, as these individuals have been given due process in military \ntribunals at Guantanamo Bay. That is the way it always has been and \nalways should be.\n  And certainly the Members of this House have voted repeatedly in the \npast, and I am confident they will vote again tonight to defeat this \namendment to reaffirm that these precious rights in the United States \nConstitution are reserved for the people of the United States and will \nnever be extended to enemy foreign fighters, particularly these cowards \nwho have been waging war against women and children and won't come out \nand fight our men and women on the battlefield in open combat.\n  This language in this bill is the only thing standing between \nPresident Barack Obama in his attempt to close Guantanamo Bay and move \nthese people into prison facilities in the United States. So I urge \nMembers to vote against Mr. Nadler's amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word and enter \ninto a colloquy with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin) and the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey).\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield initially to my friend, Mr. \nBabin, and then will yield to Mr. Posey.\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chairman, I am seeking an increase of funding for the \nCommercial Crew Program in our Science budget.\n  For the past several years, the United States taxpayers have been \npaying over $70 million a person to launch our astronauts to the \nInternational Space Station on Russian vehicles from Russian soil. We \nmust end this reliance on the Russians as quickly as possible. We must \nset priorities within the NASA budget to make sure that the American \nastronauts are launched from American soil on American vehicles sooner \nrather than later.\n  When it comes to spending within our NASA budget, it is important \nthat we set a precedent of what we think is the most important thing to \ndo. NASA is the only U.S. Government agency that has human spaceflight \nas its mission. If NASA doesn't do it, then it simply is not going to \nbe done.\n  This investment in Commercial Crew, which is managed out of Johnson \nSpace Center in the 36th congressional District, would aid the \ndevelopment of U.S. human spaceflight capabilities and lay the \nfoundation for future commercial transportation and end our dependence \non the Russians.\n  I look forward to working with you, Mr. Chairman, to ensure that we \ngive this program the funding necessary to end our reliance on the \nRussians.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Thank you, Mr. Babin. I want to assure you that as we \nwork through this process in conference and the additional funding \nbecomes available--and I do expect that as we move forward, if we have \nadditional funding, we are going to make sure that any gaps or holes, \nwhether it be in the Orion program or anywhere else, we are going to \nfill those holes and make sure that we are given as much support as we \npossibly can to Commercial Crew and to Orion.\n  We funded the Orion program at the level the President requested. And \nif we get additional funds, we will do our very best to hit that mark \nalso for the Commercial Crew Program.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I am very supportive of the Commercial Crew Program, and \nI think that there is a shortfall in that particular program. I think \nthat is what the gentleman is referring to in his hope that we can \naddress that shortfall so that we don't have to spend what has now been \nabout $500 million with our Russian counterparts in order to transport \nastronauts to the International Space Station.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. We will work together. If we, as we say, find \nadditional funds, we will do everything we can to help Orion.\n  Mr. BABIN. Thank you for your consideration, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I will be happy also to yield to my good friend, Mr. \nPosey, for a colloquy as well.\n  Mr. POSEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  This bill adequately funds the Space Launch System, the rocket which \nwill carry the Orion capsule into space, and I am grateful for that.\n  It adequately funds exploration ground systems, which are essential \nto getting Orion off the ground, and I am really grateful for that.\n  But without sufficiently funding the Orion capsule, we will be \ndelaying the deep space exploration missions. Orion is a very unique \nand very special spacecraft, unlike any we have ever sent into space, \npossessing capabilities to carry astronauts deeper into space than \nhumans have ever gone before. The technological and engineering \nchallenges are enormous, and it requires proper funding to get the job \ndone.\n  It is critical that Orion receives adequate funding to remain on \nschedule. My rough calculations indicate this funding level, so much \nless than authorized, can result in the delay of having Orion online by \nas much as 2 years. Imagine having our space launch systems ready to \ngo, our exploration ground systems ready to go, and no space capsule \nready to fly for 2 more years after that. That would be disastrous.\n  Unfortunately, when Congress assigns tasks to NASA and does not \nprovide adequate funding, American's space program gets criticized and \nmaligned for being behind schedule, when it is actually Congress that \ncaused the problem.\n  I thank my colleagues for their work on this issue, and I am hopeful \nthat we can work together to make certain Orion gets enough funding to \nstay on schedule to carry humans into space, deep space, by 2021.\n  I thank Chairman Culberson for his work on this and his assurance \nthat we can work together to secure adequate funding to keep Orion on \nschedule.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I want to assure the gentleman that we will do so. I \nwant to make sure to make the Record clear that we funded Orion at the \nlevel requested by NASA. We fully funded in exactly the number they \nasked for. If additional funds become available, and it looks like it \nis really going to help them speed up the program, we will certainly \nmake those funds available to them, because we want to get Americans \nback into space as quickly as possible on an American built rocket. \nThat is why you have seen us plus up the SLS heavy launch rocket \nprogram to accelerate that program, which will have so many uses. But, \nof course, you know I don't know there is any stronger advocate for \nNASA and America's space program than I am and you gentlemen are. I \nlook forward to working with you.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PERLMUTTER. I move to strike the last word with the gentleman \nfrom Texas.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the gentleman cannot strike the \nlast word.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Do I have the ability to strike the last word again to \ncomplete additional colloquy with the gentleman from Colorado?\n\n[[Page H3721]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Only the gentleman from Texas and the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania can move to strike the last word under the rule.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word and enter \ninto a colloquy with the gentleman from Colorado, my friend.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. PERLMUTTER. I thank the gentleman from Texas, and I thank my \nfriend from Florida for speaking up on behalf of Orion.\n  Orion is America's new spacecraft to take astronauts further into \nspace than ever before and land our astronauts on Mars.\n  Orion had its maiden test flight this past December, and it was a \nresounding success. The Orion program, as Mr. Posey stated, needs a \nfull funding for this, and we believe it to be $1.35 billion for fiscal \nyear '16 to meet those needs.\n  I appreciate the committee including language in the committee report \nrequiring NASA to provide an assessment of these challenges, but \nCongress needs to provide the resources necessary in fiscal year `16 to \nmitigate the entire risk and move this project forward.\n  So I thank the gentleman from Texas for his support of the Orion \nprogram. We need to make sure it has sufficient resources to get our \nmen and women, our astronauts, to Mars as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I look forward to working with you and my colleague \nfrom Texas and our colleagues from Florida in ensuring everyone in this \nHouse supports NASA and the manned space program. And I will work \nclosely with you and my colleagues to ensure that any additional \nfunding that Orion needs that they receive as we move through this \nprocess and go into conference.\n  As you noted, the bill that we have before us tonight funds Orion at \nthe level requested by NASA. We gave them exactly what they asked for. \nWe also asked them to give us reports on making sure they can meet \ntheir deadlines for testing the spacecraft and meeting their \nmilestones. As they prove that to us and as we get further along and \nadditional funds get available and they show us they need that, of \ncourse, we will put them at the top of the list.\n  Mr. PERLMUTTER. I thank the gentleman. I look forward to staying on \ntop of this so that as they move forward we have sufficient funding to \nreally propel this project forward and get our astronauts to Mars.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I thank the gentleman. America will never surrender \nthe high ground--outer space is the high ground of the 21st century--\nand we are going to make sure to preserve America's leadership in space \nexploration, both manned and unmanned.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n  Vacating Demand for Recorded Vote on Amendment Offered by Mr. Cohen\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I am doing something I would rather not do. \nBut the gentleman from Texas was so nice on my rape kit amendment, and \nwe did save Texas and have Davy Crockett, a predecessor of mine, in \nCongress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my request for a recorded vote on the \namendment I offered that the chair was against, that it be withdrawn, \nto the end that the amendment stand disposed of by the voice vote \nthereon.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the request for a recorded vote \nis withdrawn.

A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman from Connecticut \nand a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Chairman, my amendment strikes section 532 and 537, two \nharmful gun riders in this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, appropriations bills are not the proper place to \naddress significant policy provisions. Instead, such changes to gun \npolicy must be seriously and properly considered by Congress through \nthe regular order. The American people deserve an open and transparent \nprocess where a full range of options can be frankly discussed and \ndebated by the proper congressional committee and the entire House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Over the past several years, various appropriations riders related to \ngun policy have had unintended consequences that could have been \nprevented had these issues been fully and thoroughly debated in \nCongress.\n  Today is National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Today of all days we \ncan and must do better. We should not allow contentious policy \nprovisions related to important Federal policies governing firearms to \nbe attached to these appropriations bills.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge the Appropriations Committee and the House as a \nwhole to stop inserting significant gun\n\n[[Page H3722]]\n\npolicy provisions into must-pass spending bills.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk to strike \nsection 540.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike section 540 (page 97, line 18 through page 98, line \n     10).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I am serving my 22nd year in the United \nStates Congress, and I have never seen a provision in an appropriations \nbill like this.\n  This amendment in there could be labeled the ``family feud.'' There \nis only one Member of Congress who is related to anybody in the \nleadership and in the military in Cuba, and he is the person who put \nthis amendment in.\n  What it does is it prohibits businesses from doing business in Cuba \nbecause it makes it almost impossible for any business to get a \nlicense. That is why the United States Chamber of Commerce; the \nNational Foreign Trade Council; the Emergency Committee for American \nTrade; USA Engage, which is a trade group; and CubaNow, which is \nFlorida's Cuban Americans, are all opposed to this provision of the \nbill and support my amendment to strike it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I submit for the Record letters from CubaNow which are \nin support of my amendment.\n       Dear Congressman Farr: We urge that House Members vote to \n     strip Section 540 from H.R. 2578, Commerce, Justice, Science, \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016.\n       This provision would turn back the strategic effort to \n     normalize relations between the U.S. and Cuba, harming \n     advancements to increased commerce with Cuba.\n       Majorities of Americans, Cuban-Americans, and Cubans \n     support normalizing relations and ending the unilateral trade \n     embargo. Bipartisan support exists in both the House and \n     Senate and throughout the business community and the majority \n     of civil society groups focused on Cuba.\n       The question of Cuba policy should be approached \n     deliberatively in the full context of hemispheric relations.\n       Please support the Farr amendment to strip Section 540 from \n     H.R. 2578.\n           Sincerely,\n     CubaNow;\n     Emergency Committee for American Trade;\n     Engage Cuba;\n     Manchester Trade Limited, Inc.;\n     National Foreign Trade Council;\n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce;\n     USA*Engage.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   #CubaNow Statement on Administration Veto Threats Over Cuba Policy\n\n                            [From #CubaNow]\n\n       Washington.--#CubaNow Political Director David Gomez issued \n     the following statement in support of the Obama \n     Administration's veto threats and congressional efforts to \n     eliminate attempts to limit or roll back the new Cuba policy:\n       ``#CubaNow supports the recent veto threats issued by the \n     Obama Administration in regards to the House's current \n     Transportation and Commerce appropriations bills. As the \n     Administration noted, these bills include policy riders that \n     place unacceptable and regressive restrictions related to \n     Cuba, including Americans' right to travel to the Island and \n     the ability to do business with and support Cuba's growing \n     private sector. #CubaNow also supports the floor amendment by \n     Rep. Sam Farr to strike the restrictions from the Commerce \n     appropriations bill and other similar efforts in Congress to \n     keep spending bills free of bad policy that will do nothing \n     to help the Cuban people.''\n       ``Congress should work on advancing U.S.-Cuba policy in a \n     constructive manner that recognizes there's no going back to \n     the failed ideas of yesterday. Only a small minority in \n     Congress continues to try to drag their feet. But the Cold \n     War is over, and it's time that Congress heeds the will of an \n     American public that by and large supports moving forward \n     with greater engagement. Our new direction will do more to \n     help Cuban civil society than riders that try to breathe life \n     into an unsuccessful half-century-old policy.''\n\n  Mr. FARR. Almost every country in this hemisphere and almost every \ncountry in the world has normal trade relations with Cuba. We are \ntrying to open those up so that businesses in America, particularly our \nagriculture and our other trading goods, can take advantage of the \nmarket in Cuba--not a big one, but an important one--because it is so \nclose to shore.\n  What this amendment does is it stops all of that. It targets the \nCuban military by saying that anything related to the Cuban military \nand what they own, which is a lot of businesses in Cuba, may not be \nused to facilitate, permit, license, or promote exports to the Cuban \nmilitary or intelligence services or the immediate families thereof.\n  This is what is really so damaging. The term ``immediate family,'' as \ndescribed in the bill, means a spouse, sibling, son, daughter, parent, \ngrandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew. Now, how does a \nbusinessperson in the United States know if\n\n[[Page H3723]]\n\nany of those people are working for any of the agencies that this bill \nrestricts from?\n  It hurts American businesses, and it hurts Cubans. Let's stop living \nin the past. Let's strike this provision in the bill and support my \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I am glad this amendment is here.\n  President Obama said--and he said this a while ago--that his policies \nare to help promote the Cuban people's independence from Cuban \nauthorities.\n  Now, no one can claim that the Cuban military and the Cuban \nintelligence community and their direct family members are not the \nCuban authorities. Nothing is more authority than those two things. \nLet's unmask what this amendment does.\n  The language in the mark, in the bill, simply affirms that we should \nnot send exports--I will make this very clear--to the Cuban military or \nthe intelligence community or their immediate families. In unmasking \nthis amendment, what this amendment is saying is no, no, no, that we do \nsupport and that we do want to do business with the Cuban military and \nthe Cuban intelligence services and their immediate families.\n  By the way, it is the same military and intelligence services that \nbrutalized the Cuban people, that beat prodemocracy demonstrators, that \nbeat a number of American citizens in Panama recently, that illegally \nsmuggles weapons, which has members of that Cuban military under \nindictment here in a U.S. Federal court for the murder of American \ncitizens.\n  I am glad this amendment is here because this amendment unmasks the \nunderlying issue, and the chairman's mark specifically deals with--\nagain, as I mentioned--the Cuban military and the intelligence \ncommunity and their immediate relatives.\n  If this amendment were to happen, what we would be saying is that we \nwant to do business, not with Cuba and not with the Cuban people, but \nwith the Cuban military and the intelligence services and their direct \nrelatives. Frankly, I am glad this amendment is here because it does \nunmask the issue.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the distinguished \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo).\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Farr amendment.\n  Section 540 is critical in ensuring that exports to Cuba reach and \nbenefit the Cuban people, not the regime's military and intelligence \nservices, which actively and aggressively collaborate with our enemies \nthroughout the world. Still today, Cuba has one of the most robust spy \nnetworks in the United States. These are not the people we should be \nrewarding with American business.\n  The most recent State Department report on Cuba's human rights \nconditions says that harsh prison conditions, arbitrary arrests, \nselective prosecution, and the denial of fair trials continue in the \ncountry.\n  The iron fist of the Castro regime has cracked down on peaceful \ndemocratic activists with over 2,000 dissidents arrested since the \nPresident's December 17 announcement. Just this past Sunday, 59 members \nof the Ladies in White were arrested along with 25 other human rights \nactivists--their crime? It was attending Sunday mass, Mr. Chairman.\n  The oppression is not limited to Cuba's borders. According to high-\nlevel military defectors from Venezuela's Government, there are between \n2,700 and 3,000 Cuban military and intelligence agents aiding in the \ncrackdown against Venezuelan protesters and opposing American interests \nin that country.\n  These are the thugs--the very individuals--who would most benefit \nfrom the Farr amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I understand that there is a diversity of views in this \nChamber with regard to our broader Cuba policy. What I cannot \nunderstand is why anyone would want to reward the individuals \nresponsible for the deaths of Americans, for the oppression of the \nCuban people, for spying against our country.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to oppose the Farr amendment.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, rhetoric is really cheap here, but I would \nurge Members to read the bill and to read the second term.\n  It reads:\n\n       The term ``Cuban military intelligence service'' includes \n     but is not limited to the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed \n     Forces and the Ministry of Interior of Cuba and any \n     subsidiary of such ministry.\n       The term ``immediate family'' means spouse, sibling, son, \n     daughter, and so on.\n\n  The analysis by our own Library of Congress says that this would \nseverely hurt the consumer communication devices that would be sent to \nfamilies in Cuba as part of the negotiations that are going on right \nnow between the United States and the administration.\n  It would also hurt materials, equipment, tools used by the private \nsector to construct or to renovate privately owned buildings, tools and \nequipment for private sector agriculture activity, tools and equipment \nand supplies and instruments used by the private sector.\n  This provision just kills the ability for the United States to open \nup trade that every other country has. This is just a ``family feud'' \namendment. This is not good business, and that is why the business \ncommunity is opposed.\n  Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. McClintock). The gentleman from California has \n2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. FARR. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Lee).\n  Ms. LEE. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment.\n  Once again, the other side is really pushing the envelope in terms of \ncharacterizing what this amendment actually does.\n  This amendment would strike provisions included in this bill that \nwould prohibit the Department of Commerce from issuing licenses for new \ntypes of exports that are permitted under the Obama administration's \nnew policy of engagement with Cuba. This provision is not only an \ninappropriate policy rider in this appropriations bill, but, if \nincluded, it would put this House, once again, on the wrong side of \nhistory.\n\n  Supporters of this provision claim that it would only prohibit \nexporting to anyone who works with the Cuban military, intelligence \nservices, and their immediate families. The reality is that the effects \nof this provision are much, much broader.\n  It would make it difficult for the Department of Commerce to issue \nlicenses to companies that want to export to Cuba, U.S. companies that \ncreate jobs in the United States of America. This includes equipment \nand supplies for entrepreneurs that are related to running their own \nbusinesses here in America, and it includes the materials, equipment, \nand tools to construct or renovate privately owned businesses.\n  Simply put, this rider is wrong. It is wrong for business, and it \ncertainly should not be part of a bill that funds our critical \nCommerce, Justice, and Science programs.\n  The majority of Americans and Cubans agree that U.S. policy toward \nCuba has been an unpopular failure for more than 50 years. Instead of \nincluding misguided provisions that undermine the process of \nnormalizing relations with Cuba, we should be moving toward increased \nexchanges, formal relations with our neighbors, and creating good-\npaying jobs in the United States by allowing the exporting of U.S. \nproducts to Cuba.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Culberson).\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I want to point out the language Mr. \nFarr is attempting to strike.\n  It reads:\n\n       No funds made available to do business with the Cuban \n     military or the intelligence services.\n\n  The only thing standing between President Barack Obama's attempt to \noverride the will of the people as expressed by Congress, which is we \nwill not do business with Cuba, is the Federal law. President Obama is \nattempting to change that.\n  The only thing stopping President Obama from doing business with Cuba \nis this language, and the language says\n\n[[Page H3724]]\n\nyou cannot do business with the Communist military in Cuba or with the \nCommunist intelligence services.\n  It is very straightforward. If you want to do business with the \nprivate sector in Cuba, go ahead. All this says is that you can't do \nbusiness with the Communist military or with the Communist intelligence \nservices.\n  Therefore, we urge Members to vote ``no'' against this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from Florida has expired.\n  Mr. FARR. It is very interesting that the capitalist society out \nthere supports my amendment: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nForeign Trade Council, Engage Cuba, the Emergency Committee for \nAmerican Trade. They wrote a letter that they urge the House Members to \nstrip section 540 from H.R. 2578, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act.\n  The provision would turn back the strategic effort to normalize \nrelations between the U.S. and Cuba, harming advancements to increase \ncommerce with Cuba. The majorities of Americans, Cuban Americans, and \nCubans support the normalization of relations and any unilateral trade \nembargo.\n  Bipartisan support exists in both the House and the Senate and \nthroughout the businesses community and with the majority of the civil \nsociety focused on Cuba. The question of Cuba policy should be \napproached deliberatively and in the full context of hemispheric \nrelations.\n  I urge the support of this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, we spend a lot of time making something \nsimple complex. The problem here is that, in a small nation, an island \nlike Cuba, trying to discern whether somebody is related--a cousin, a \nnephew, a so-and-so who might work for some entity--is very \nproblematic.\n  What this restriction would basically mean is that you wouldn't be \nable to do any business. That is notwithstanding everything else, \nnotwithstanding the failure of the last 50 years, notwithstanding the \nfact that everybody else in the world is doing business in Cuba, this \nlanguage would prevent us from being able to do any business there \nbecause you would not be able to predetermine whether there was a blood \nconnection between some person you were selling a cell phone to and \nsomeone who, at some point, was a grunt in the military.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  That is the issue. That is why we should support the Farr amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Farr).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Sec. 541.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be expended during fiscal year 2016 for the shutdown of the \n     Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy or for the \n     preparation therefor.\n\n                       spending reduction account\n\n       Sec. 542.  The amount by which the applicable allocation of \n     new budget authority made by the Committee on Appropriations \n     of the House of Representatives under section 302(b) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 exceeds the amount of \n     proposed new budget authority is $0.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Schweikert\n\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Curbelo of Florida). The Clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Add at the end of the bill (before the short title), the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act \n     shall be used to transfer cell site simulators, or IMSI \n     Catcher, or similar cell phone tower mimicking technology to \n     state and local law enforcement that haven't adopted \n     procedures for the use of such technology that protects the \n     constitutional rights of citizens.\n\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman from Arizona and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, I will try to make this very quick \nbecause I know there is a point of order.\n  This was one of those moments where there was a concern about new \nadopted technology. We have all heard the stories of some of these, \nshall we call them, dummy cell sites that are basically used to capture \nthe phone calls because they produce the largest, most powerful signal. \nNow, some of this technology that has been being used at the Federal \nGovernment level is being transferred to State and local law \nenforcement.\n  The amendment is meant to be very simple and just says for the \nFederal Government to design, for Justice to design, protocols that the \nconstitutional rights are being protected, that if a local law \nenforcement is going to use this capture technology, that they better \ndarn well be following the Constitution, and before that technology is \ntransferred, that there is an understanding, mechanics of that being \nlaid out.\n  We tried to make the amendment as simple and clear-cut as possible.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise to make a point of order against \nthe amendment, reluctantly, because I agree with the gentleman's \namendment because I share his concern about privacy matters; but \nbecause the amendment proposes to change existing law, and it \nconstitutes legislation in an appropriations bill, it, therefore, \nviolates clause 2 of rule XXI.\n  I do share the gentleman's concern. I think it is very important \nthat, as the House debates these matters, that we remember that our \nmost important right as Americans is to be left alone and our right of \nprivacy. I am deeply concerned about these cell phone towers that are \nspoofed, that are designed to spoof our phones, and the government \nintruding into our zone of privacy that is now compromised by these \nelectronic devices in so many ways.\n  However, House rules state in pertinent part: ``An amendment to a \ngeneral appropriations bill shall not be in order if changing existing \nlaw.''\n  This amendment does require a new determination by its express terms, \nand while I will certainly work with the gentleman as we move forward \nin conference to address this concern, make sure our privacy rights are \nprotected, I do ask at this time for a ruling from the Chair on the \nsubstance of my point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, with the chairman's friendship and \ncommitment and where he is on understanding the importance of the \nissue, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Arizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  June 2, 2015, on page H3724, the following appeared: There was \nno objection. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. ENGEL\n  \n  The online version should be corrected to read: There was no \nobjection. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. AMENDMENT \nOFFERED BY MR. ENGEL\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Engel\n\n  Mr. ENGEL. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ___. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Department of Commerce, the Department of \n     Justice, or any other Federal agency to lease or purchase new \n     light duty vehicles for any executive fleet, or for an \n     agency's fleet inventory, except in accordance with \n     Presidential Memorandum--Federal Fleet Performance, dated May \n     24, 2011.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n\n[[Page H3725]]\n\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, on May 24, 2011, President Obama issued a \nmemorandum on Federal fleet performance that required all new light-\nduty vehicles in the Federal fleet to be alternative fuel vehicles, \nsuch as hybrid, electric, natural gas, or biofuel, by December 31, \n2015.\n  My amendment echoes the President's memorandum by prohibiting funds \nin this act from being used to lease or purchase new light-duty \nvehicles unless that purchase is made in accord with the President's \nmemorandum. I have submitted identical amendments to 16 different \nappropriations bills over the past few years, and every time they have \nbeen accepted by both the majority and the minority, so I hope my \namendment will receive similar support today.\n  Global oil prices are down. We no longer pay $147 per barrel. But \ndespite increased production here in the United States, the global \nprice of oil is still largely determined by OPEC. Spikes in oil prices \nhave profound repercussions for our economy. The primary reason is that \nour cars and trucks run only on petroleum. We can change that with \nalternative technologies that exist today.\n  The Federal Government operates the largest fleet of light-duty \nvehicles in America, over 633,000 vehicles. Nearly 50,000 of these \nvehicles are within the jurisdiction of this bill, being used by the \nDepartment of Commerce, Department of Justice, and the National Science \nFoundation.\n  When I was in Brazil a few years ago, I saw how they diversified \ntheir fuel by greatly expanding their use of ethanol. People there can \ndrive to a gas station and choose whether to fill their vehicle with \ngasoline or with ethanol or some other mix. They make their choice \nbased on cost or whatever criteria they deem important. I want this \nsame choice for American consumers.\n  That is why I am proposing a bill this Congress, as I have in the \npast, which will provide for cars built in America to be able to run on \na fuel instead of, or in addition to, gasoline. It doesn't cost much at \nall; and if they can do it in Brazil, we can do it here.\n  In conclusion, expanding the role these alternative technologies play \nin our transportation economy will help break the leverage that foreign \ngovernment-controlled oil companies hold over Americans. It will \nincrease our Nation's domestic security and protect consumers. I ask \nthat my colleagues support the Engel amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I do \nnot oppose the gentleman's amendment and would urge its adoption.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nFattah), my friend from Philadelphia.\n  Mr. FATTAH. We had a big celebration at the Ben Franklin Institute in \nPhiladelphia for electric cars, and there was such a variety of \nvehicles. Alternative fuels are important. I think that the gentleman's \namendment is one that we have accepted in previous appropriation bills, \nand I concur with the chairman that we would accept it in this case.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I urge Members to support the amendment and urge its \nadoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I conclude and say I thank my colleagues and \nlook forward to continuing to work together with them in a bipartisan \nfashion for the good of the American people.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Engel).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment Offered by Mr. Poe of Texas\n\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I have an amendment at the desk regarding the \nFourth Amendment to the Constitution, with multiple cosponsors.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Except as provided by subsection (b), none of \n     the funds made available by this Act for the Department of \n     Justice or the Federal Bureau of Investigation may be used to \n     mandate or request that a person (as defined in section \n     101(m) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \n     (50 U.S.C. 1801(m)) alter the product or service of the \n     person to permit the electronic surveillance (as defined in \n     section 101(f) of such Act (50 U.S.C. 1801(f)) of any user of \n     such product or service.\n       (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to mandates \n     or requests authorized under the Communications Assistance \n     for Law Enforcement Act (47 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. POE of Texas (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous \nconsent to dispense with the reading of the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have a simple, straightforward \namendment to protect the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \nThis is a very similar amendment that passed DOD Appropriations last \nyear.\n  I would like to thank Representatives Lofgren, Massie, Conyers, \nAmash, Nadler, Farenthold, Polis, Labrador, and Lieu for working with \nme as cosponsors on this important amendment.\n  James Comey, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nrecently asked Congress to update the law to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment can access information from Americans' cell phones and \npersonal electronic devices in the future.\n  Many U.S. technology companies have also been approached by the \ngovernment agencies, urging them either through intimidation or just \nrequest to create back doors on their products' encryption system so \nthe government can access it later down the road. We have all learned \nrecently about the government's abuse of section 215 under the PATRIOT \nAct and abuse under section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act.\n  Basically what this amendment does, Mr. Chairman, is prohibit the \ngovernment from going to Apple, for example, and telling Apple that \nthey want an encryption in cell phones that they sell to Americans, an \nencryption that would allow the FBI to have access to this information, \nwhich would include not just conversations, not just include emails, \nbut it would also include text messaging as well.\n  This is a straightforward amendment. This prohibits the Federal \nGovernment--specifically, the FBI--from going in and receiving this \ninformation. Privacy is important. It is under our Constitution. There \nshould be no doubt that the Federal Government should have no access to \nour cell phones and the information that is in those cell phones. That \nis what this amendment does.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in \nopposition, but I do not oppose the gentleman's amendment. I agree with \nhis amendment and encourage the House to support it.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Chairman, reserving the right to object.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized on \nher reservation.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Chairman, I had also sought to seek the time in \nopposition, although I also do not oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Does the gentlewoman support the amendment?\n  Ms. LOFGREN. I support the amendment, as does the gentleman.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. That was my point. I think it is important. We are \nhere in this Chamber looking at George Mason, who refused to sign the \nConstitution because he was so concerned that the power of the Federal \nGovernment would just absolutely obliterate----\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will suspend.\n  Does the gentlewoman withdraw her reservation?\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Chairman, further reserving, I was wondering if the \nDemocratic side of the aisle might be able to split the time. That is \nwhy I was reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to split the time with\n\n[[Page H3726]]\n\nthe gentlewoman. I am claiming the time in opposition, although I do \nnot oppose it. The gentleman still has some time remaining on his \ninitial time. I will yield in just a moment, but I really think it is \nimportant in this age of electronic communication that we in the \nCongress debate and be keenly aware of the new boundaries.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will suspend.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. I withdraw my reservation.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The reservation is withdrawn.\n  Without objection, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Culberson) is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n\n                              {time}  2145\n\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, my neighbor and good friend, Judge Ted \nPoe, brings a very important point to the floor tonight.\n  In this new era of expanding technology that now intrudes on every \naspect of our lives, it is very important to remember the admonition \nthat Benjamin Franklin gave us--that those who would surrender a little \nfreedom to gain a little safety are soon going to find themselves with \nneither.\n  I do find it instructive that we are here on this House floor looking \nat George Mason, who is on the right here, who refused to sign the \nConstitution because he was so concerned the Federal Government would \nbecome omnipotent and obliterate the rights of individuals and the \nrights of the States to control those issues that deal exclusively with \nthe States.\n  My favorite Founding Father, Thomas Jefferson, was keenly aware of \nand concerned about the power of the Federal Government. We are \nentering into a whole new era now where the government has got the \nability to intrude on every aspect of our life.\n  I share Judge Poe's concern. I support his amendment, and I urge the \nHouse to support it. If the FBI has a court order, if the National \nSecurity Agency gets a court order, I believe they could get access to \nwhat they need to get access to. Just like cracking a safe.\n  In fact, I asked this question, if I could, of Director Comey in \nfront of our subcommittee. He said these new iPhones--I dropped my \niPhone 5 and had to get a 6--he said these can't be cracked. So, \ntherefore, you would have to open them up like you would a safe, as you \nhad to order safes, I bet, opened on occasion, Judge Poe.\n  So I agree with the amendment, and I yield the balance of my time to \nthe gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren).\n  Ms. LOFGREN. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  As Mr. Poe recognized, this is a very diverse group of authors who \ndon't agree on everything, but this is very important for a reason.\n  First, it is fundamental that our privacy be protected; that the \nFourth Amendment be adhered to. Secondly, we all know--and if you ask \nany computer scientist, they will tell you--that once the vulnerability \nis introduced for a good reason, it is available for hacking for very \nbad reasons. Finally, for competitiveness. Think how competitive it is \nto sell an American product around the world when everyone knows that \nit is compromised. Not a really good marketing tool.\n  Last year, as Mr. Poe mentioned, we had almost precisely this \namendment on the floor as an amendment to the DOD appropriations. What \nwas the vote on that amendment? It was 293-123; overwhelming.\n  So I am hoping that Members will not flip-flop, that they will, in \nfact, vote the way they did last year.\n  And I will just go a little trip down memory road. When I was first \nelected to the Congress, I took my oath of office January 4, 1995, and \nI met Bob Goodlatte for the very first time. And he and I went all over \nthis Congress to try and work on decontrol of encryption.\n  Although a lot of people we talked to in 1995 had no idea what we \nwere talking about when we talked about encryption, ultimately that \nbipartisan effort was successful. We must not let that successful \neffort to protect privacy, to protect technology, be eroded at this \npoint.\n  So I look forward to a very strong vote on this. I think it is \nimportant that we have a vote, even though there is agreement, just to \nsend the message to the other body how serious that we are.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Our most important right as Americans is to be left \nalone. If you are a law-abiding American, you are secure in your home \nand your possessions. Your home is your castle.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. We might not agree on everything, but I think we agree \non the Fourth Amendment. So this is a great day for this body to come \ntogether across the aisle for that purpose. And I thank the gentleman \nfor yielding\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I just wanted to indicate that on behalf of the minority, \nwe support your amendment and are prepared to agree to it.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky \n(Mr. Massie).\n  Mr. MASSIE. Thank you, Judge Poe, for introducing this amendment. \nThis was substantially the same amendment that we offered last summer \nthat passed with a veto-proof majority 293-123.\n  Back doors are bad for three reasons. When the government forces \ncompanies to put back doors or weaken their encryption, it is bad for \nsecurity because hackers are going to find these back doors and other \nforeign countries will find these back doors.\n  It is bad for privacy because the Fourth Amendment can be violated. \nAnd it is bad for business. As my colleague Zoe Lofgren from California \nmentioned, it is bad for business because it makes us less competitive \noverseas. Who wants to buy a piece of defective software that was made \ndefective by our government?\n  So I urge Members to vote for this amendment because it would prevent \nall of these bad things from occurring.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. In conclusion, I want to thank the minority, Ms. \nLofgren, and all the cosponsors on this, as well as the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, for their support.\n  On the issue of privacy, in this time where we have threats to this \ncountry, we can have security and we can certainly have privacy, and we \ncan have the Constitution be followed as well.\n  The Fourth Amendment has always required that if the government wants \nto search, the government must follow certain rules. And those rules \nare that you must get a warrant from a judge based on probable cause. \nThat is still the law of the land, even in 2015.\n  All this amendment does is ensure the fact that the government--the \nFBI--follows the Constitution. The idea that the Federal Government \nwants to have encryption in American cell phones so they can have \naccess to the information is repulsive. So all this does is keep the \nFederal Government out of our business without appropriate \nconstitutional protections.\n  I ask for support of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I just want to reaffirm that, as Judge \nPoe has written this amendment, there is an exception in here that if \nthe government gets a court order, they can go in and put a back door \non the phone when the judge says there is a compelling reason to do so.\n  I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Certainly. The law--the Constitution--still applies \nthat the government must go and get a warrant based upon probable cause \nunder the Fourth Amendment. Of course, there are exceptions to \nwarrantless search.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Reclaiming my time, the way the amendment is written, \nthe government can't just force all phone companies to build a back \ndoor into all telephones. You have got to have a court order on that \nspecific phone, on that specific person, before you can do it. That is \nabsolutely reasonable. That is what Mr. Madison and Mr. Jefferson \nintended for us to do.\n\n[[Page H3727]]\n\n  Therefore, I support the gentleman's amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to execute a subpoena of tangible things pursuant to \n     section 506 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 876) \n     that does not include the following sentence: ``This subpoena \n     limits the collection of any tangible things (including phone \n     numbers dialed, telephone numbers of incoming calls, and the \n     duration of calls) to those tangible things identified by a \n     term that specifically identifies an individual, account, \n     address, or personal device, and that limits, to the greatest \n     extent reasonably practicable, the scope of the tangible \n     things sought.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, here in Congress we have just been spending \na lot of time and energy discussing NSA surveillance. The American \npublic--and now, Members of Congress in both Chambers--have spoken \nclearly that the kind of bulk data collection the NSA has engaged in \nneeds to be stopped. However, there is a corresponding change that we \nneed to make with regard to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n  In a series of revelations from 2013 to 2015, it came to light that \nthe DEA had for more than 20 years been gathering a vast database of \ninformation on America's personal communications. There was no \ncongressional authority for this program and no oversight by Congress \nor any area of the Federal Government.\n  Legal experts who weighed in after the program was finally made \npublic have said without hesitation that the program was illegal.\n  In 2013, the Department of Justice brought this program to an end, \nbut there is nothing to stop the government or the DOJ from resuming it \nat will unless Congress acts by inserting this language in the \nappropriations bill. Without this language, the DEA could once again \nunilaterally sweep up the communications records of millions of \nAmericans.\n  There is no reason that, as we work to end the unconstitutional \nsurveillance that the NSA has engaged in, we should continue to allow \nthe DOJ to have the very same abuses.\n  This is a corresponding piece of legislation to something that \nalready passed the House with regard to the NSA by an overwhelming \nmajority.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our bipartisan amendment that we \nworked on with Mr. Griffith, Mr. Schweikert, Mr. Nadler, and Mr. \nFarenthold to simply prohibit DOJ from using Federal funds to engage in \nbulk data collection of Americans' phone records or other data, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Just being given Mr. Polis' amendment, I oppose the \nidea of bulk data collection. I would like to accept the gentleman's \namendment because of my previous expressed concerns about how we want \nto make sure we are protecting the privacy of law-abiding Americans.\n  So I would accept the gentleman's amendment with the understanding \nthat I would work with him. There may be unintended consequences here \nthat I am not immediately aware of. Judiciary Committee staff is \nworking with ours right now to make sure we have got our arms around \nthis.\n  I want to make sure that if the DEA has a valid court order, a valid \nsubpoena, that they can go after lawbreakers and complete their \ninvestigations. Again, we want to protect the privacy of law-abiding \nAmericans.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I think with the understanding that the chairman has laid \nout, your accepting this amendment would move us forward, and I agree. \nI think we have a clear understanding that you are accepting it, but we \nwill work together to make sure it doesn't have any unintended \nconsequences.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Reclaiming my time, with that understanding, I want to \nmake sure we reserve the right of DEA to get a court order to do their \nwork. With that understanding, I withdraw my opposition and will accept \nthe amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nNadler), the coauthor of the amendment.\n  Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I rise in strong support of this amendment to prevent bulk collection \nof data at the Department of Justice.\n  Last month, this House spoke loud and clear that we oppose the \nNational Security Agency's bulk collection of telephone metadata. \nToday, the Senate joined us in that judgment, and, together, we have \nreaffirmed our commitment to the Fourth Amendment and to protecting \nAmericans from unconstitutional government surveillance.\n  We learned earlier this year that long before the NSA program ban, \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration engaged in its own bulk collection \nprogram that provided a model for the NSA to use nearly a decade later. \nThis program included logs of virtually all telephone calls from the \nU.S. to as many as 116 countries, ostensibly linked to drug \ntrafficking, all without a court order and without authorization from \nCongress.\n  Mr. Chairman, enough is enough. Although the DOJ has since shut down \nthis program, there is nothing preventing the Department from renewing \nit in secret without authorization, as it did before. This amendment \nwould ensure that it remains dormant and that Americans' privacy \nremains secure.\n  I thank Mr. Polis and the other cosponsors of the amendment, and I \nthank the gentleman from Texas for accepting this amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Farenthold).\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment and \nthank my colleague from Texas for agreeing to accept it.\n  This has been a great victory this week in our ability to work with \nthe Senate to rein in what I believe to be the unconstitutional bulk \ndata collection by the NSA.\n  Just because we stopped the NSA doesn't mean we shouldn't be ever \nvigilant. With the reports of the DEA engaging in similar activities, \nit is absolutely appropriate that we use the power of the purse to \nensure that this type of spying on American citizens--this bulk data \ncollection--is stopped.\n  This is no different from the general warrants that were complained \nabout when the King of England would send troops to rifle through \npeople's desks just looking for stuff. It is the exact same thing in \nthe digital age. I encourage my colleagues to support it and look \nforward to working with my colleague, Mr. Culberson, in making sure it \ndoes become part of this bill.\n\n                              {time}  2200\n\n  Mr. POLIS. In conclusion, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Culberson). It is, indeed, the intended language and we believe \nthe actual language of the amendment that would not interfere with any \nvalid court orders or warrants. We are happy to work with them in that \nregard.\n  The amendment is designed to pertain to bulk collection of data, \nwhich was never specifically authorized by Congress.\n  I appreciate the gentleman from Texas accepting the amendment, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. Blackburn\n\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n\n[[Page H3728]]\n\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Each amount made available by this Act, except \n     those amounts made available to the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, is hereby reduced by 1 percent.\n       (b) The reduction in subsection (a) shall not apply with \n     respect to the following accounts of the Department of \n     Justice:\n       (1) ``Fees and Expenses of Witnesses''.\n       (2) ``Public Safety Officer Benefits''.\n       (3) ``United States Trustee System Fund''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to begin by \nthanking the committee and Chairman Culberson for their tremendous work \nthat they have put into this bill, identifying ways to reduce spending \nand to be a good steward of the taxpayers' money.\n  This funding bill is $51.4 billion, and I would like to point out \nthat that is $661 million below the President's request. Good work on \nbehalf of our team.\n  Now, I am one of those that thinks more needs to be done, especially \nwhen we look at the discretionary spending. There is more we should do. \nMy amendment calls for a 1 percent across-the-board spending reduction. \nThat would reduce the budget authority by $540 million and outlays by \n$340 million in Fiscal Year 2016.\n  I am fully aware of the opposition that exists to across-the-board \ncuts by many of the appropriators, and I have many times stood on this \nfloor and heard how they think this is just a little bit of a cut too \nmuch.\n  However, we are nearly $18.3 trillion in debt. Indeed, Admiral \nMullen, on July 6, 2010, said the greatest threat to our Nation's \nsecurity is our Nation's debt.\n  Getting our spending under control is an important step for us to \ntake. That is why we need to move forward and do what many of our \nStates have done and institute across-the-board cuts to save one penny \nout of a dollar.\n  Engage the rank-and-file Federal employees. Have them bring to the \ntable their best ideas. Our children are depending on us to do this in \norder to maintain the fiscal sovereignty of our Nation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. It is important for the House to oppose this amendment \nbecause, as in our personal lives or our business lives, the \nAppropriations Committee has prioritized the very precious and scarce, \nhard-earned taxpayer dollars that we are entrusted to appropriate to \nmake sure that they are spent on the most urgent priorities first.\n  We do not want to cut, as Mrs. Blackburn would, the FBI. We do not \nwant to cut our operations of our cybersecurity forces, as Mrs. \nBlackburn would. I do not want to cut the work that is being done by \nour law enforcement officials across the country, as Mrs. Blackburn \nwould.\n  This amendment would also cut, for example, the good work that is \nbeing done by the U.S. Marshals Service. This would cut the 55 new \nimmigration judges that we have included in the bill.\n  This would cut the amount of money we set aside for the operation of \nour prison system, of the ATF, all Federal law enforcement agencies \nthat perform such a vital role. We prioritized them and made sure they \nare protected from cuts.\n  I would oppose this amendment on the basis that we do not want to cut \nFederal law enforcement.\n  We also don't want to cut our Nation's investment in the sciences and \nthe National Science Foundation or our work to preserve America's \nleadership role in space exploration.\n  We want to make sure that we are doing all that we can to accelerate \nour work in bringing American astronauts back into space on an \nAmerican-made rocket as quickly as possible. This amendment would cut \nNASA.\n  We have, in the bill, however, cut or eliminated dozens of programs \nthat their authorization has expired--or their usefulness has expired. \nWe went in and dramatically cut programs that were not effective \nanymore, completely eliminated programs.\n  We found all kinds of savings in this bill, and I am sure that our \npriorities are ones that the good people of Tennessee that Mrs. \nBlackburn represents would share. I know her constituents share, as we \ndo, a commitment to law enforcement, to scientific research, to \nAmerica's space program; and they would probably also agree with our \ncuts to the Department of Commerce, our unavoidable cuts really to the \nCensus.\n  We did our best to protect the important work that our men and women \nin uniform who enforce the laws of the United States do. This amendment \nwould be a blunt cut across the board to all of these worthwhile \nprograms, and I urge the Members to oppose it.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield 10 seconds to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I wanted to say that I concur completely with the \nchairman, and I am opposed to the amendment.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Chairman, I appreciate, as I said, the work \nthat the committee has done, but I think it is imperative that we \nrealize the burden that we are placing on future generations.\n  Quite frankly, I think it is rather selfish of this body to force \nfuture generations--our children and grandchildren--to pay for the out-\nof-control spending of today.\n  Have we done a good job? Yes. Could we do a superlative? Absolutely, \nwe could. Cutting one penny out of a dollar is a wise step. I don't \nknow of anybody that thinks we are underspent. I know a lot of people \nthat think we are overspent and that we are overtaxed.\n  What it is going to take in order to get our fiscal house in order \nand to secure this Nation for future generations is, yes, indeed, \ntargeted cuts. It is going to take across-the-board cuts, and it is \ngoing to take everybody agreeing that we don't have a revenue problem, \nwe have a spending problem.\n  That is a component of our budget and appropriations process that the \nAmerican people are demanding that we get under control. It is not \nnecessarily a debate about worthiness. There are lots of good programs \nand essential programs.\n  What it is, is a debate about stewardship, making certain that we are \nfocusing and that we are doing the extra work that is necessary to get \nthe spending under control.\n  As I said, this is $51.4 billion in discretionary funding that is in \nthis appropriations bill. It is below the President's request. The \ncommittee is to be commended for that.\n  Taking the step of a 1 percent cut, you are talking about $540 \nmillion in budget authority and $340 million reduction in outlays. It \nis a goal that we should set for ourselves. It is doable. It is \nattainable.\n  We should take a playbook and a lesson from the States and the \ncounties and the communities that we represent and make the effort to \nreduce the spending just a little bit more.\n  Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I \nhave remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Foxx). The gentleman from Texas has 2\\1/4\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, I want to point out also that the \namendment before us would cut 1 percent from eliminating the backlog of \nrape kits that are piling up in local police departments all over the \ncountry. We increased funding to eliminate that backlog of rape kits.\n  We increased funding to help forensic labs at the local level. We \nincreased funding to make sure that programs to prevent violence \nagainst women are fully funded. This amendment would cut those funding \nincreases for violence against women.\n\n                              {time}  2210\n\n  It is not the annual appropriations bill that is the biggest part of \nthe problem. All of us need to recognize that we have got to look at \nthe entire Federal budget.\n  The annual appropriations bill only represents one-third of the \nproblem. The other two-thirds of the problem are the automatic \nmandatory problems: the looming bankruptcy of Medicare, the looming \nbankruptcy of Social Security and Medicaid, the incredible\n\n[[Page H3729]]\n\nburden that ObamaCare has placed on individual Americans--it threatens \nto bankrupt the entire healthcare system--the national debt, and the \ninterest on the national debt.\n  The American taxpayers are, indeed, taxed too much, but the biggest \npart of the spending problem is on these automatic programs that are \nconsuming two-thirds of the Nation's resources.\n  In fact, if you pay off all those existing--just paying for these \nexisting programs, the mandatory programs, which you have to think of \nas America's mortgage and interest payments, once you pay Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the debt, veterans benefits, \nyou are only left with $689 billion to run the entire Federal \nGovernment, which is enough money to run the government through July \n27. ``National credit card day'' is what I call it. July 27 is the day \nwhen we run out of existing revenue, and we are living on borrowed \nmoney to be paid off by our kids.\n  A far better way to deal with this problem is to deal with the \nlooming bankruptcy of Medicare, Social Security, and to deal with the \nnational debt and deficit, the two-thirds of the problem out there, and \nnot look at some 1 percent cut on the one-third of the budget that we \nhave already prioritized and cut everywhere we possibly can while \nprotecting law enforcement. We are protecting our investment in the \nsciences and space exploration.\n  I urge the Members to reject this amendment, and I would urge the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) to work with us throughout \nthe year as we develop these appropriations bills and help us find cuts \nin programs and prioritization of funding, rather than bringing the \namendment to the floor at the last minute.\n  I urge Members to vote against this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment Offered by Mr. Scott of Virginia\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ___. The amounts otherwise provided by this Act are \n     revised by reducing the amount made available for Federal \n     Prison Systems--Salaries and Expenses, and increasing the \n     amount made available for Office of Justice Programs--Office \n     of Juvenile Justice Delinquency and Prevention, by \n     $69,515,000.\n\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chairman, I reserve a point of order against the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman from Virginia and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Madam Chair, this amendment that I am offering today would repurpose \njust 1 percent of the funding for the Federal prison system and restore \nfunding for the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.\n  Madam Chair, the underlying bill zeros out both title II formula \ngrants and title V discretionary grants for prevention and early \nintervention programs, which were funded last year at approximately $70 \nmillion. To ensure that our State juvenile justice systems are not \nirreparably damaged, this amendment would take just 1 percent away from \nour Federal prison systems, approximately $70 million, to maintain our \ncommitment to prevention and early intervention.\n  The prison system can take steps to deal with this reduction by \nlimiting duplicate prosecutions or pursuing evidence-based alternatives \nto incarceration, particularly for first-time offenders. These \npractices not only will save money, but will also improve public \nsafety.\n  We have a choice, Madam Chair. We can invest in prisons after the \nfact, or we can invest in prevention and early intervention before the \nfact and eliminate what the Children's Defense Fund calls the Cradle to \nPrison Pipeline.\n  Madam Chair, at this point, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Cardenas).\n  Mr. CARDENAS. Madam Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to \nmy colleague and friend Congressman Scott's amendment and to encourage \nthis body to restore critical funding for the Office of Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention.\n  This existing appropriations bill decimates funding for title II \nState formula grants and title V local delinquency prevention programs \nwhich are essential investments that are proven to reduce crime.\n  This amendment would provide $69,515,000, the equivalent of less than \n1 percent of the Federal prison budget, which is a small investment \nwhen you consider the cost of incarcerating a youth is an average of \n$88,000 per year. That is hundreds of dollars a day to incarcerate a \nyouth. Evidence-based alternatives to incarceration for youth costs as \nlittle as $11 per day.\n  These proven juvenile crime prevention methods cost pennies compared \nto the incarceration of our young people. Members from both parties \nhave espoused the importance of investing in our children. Conservative \norganizations have been among the loudest advocates for reforming our \ncriminal justice system--in particular, for our youth--to move from an \nincarceration-based system to one that funds proven research-based \nalternatives to putting behind bars America's children. There is a \nbipartisan consensus on this, ladies and gentlemen.\n  While this amendment will be withdrawn, I hope we can work together \nto fund these critical programs to give our children the opportunity to \nbe productive members of our communities, reduce crime, and save \nbillions of tax dollars going forward.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I would like to thank the ranking member of \nthe Committee on Education and the Workforce for raising this important \nissue. I assure him that it is my intention that we will be working \nbetween here and the final bill to improve upon this area in the bill.\n  I thank the chairman for all of his work in this regard.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of \nmy time.\n  I thank the gentleman for allowing us to debate because I understand \nthe point of order will be sustained.\n  There will be other opportunities during the legislative process, as \nthe ranking member of the subcommittee has indicated, to deal with this \nissue.\n  The way the bill has been drafted, it was impossible to get an \namendment in order, but there will be other possibilities later on in \nthe process, and I would hope the chair and the ranking member will \nwork effectively to make sure that we deal with the choice that we \nhave, whether we are going to just put money away for young people to \nget in trouble and then deal with it or we can deal with it in advance \nwith prevention and early intervention. This is what this amendment \nwould do.\n  Madam Chair, if the gentleman is going to assert his point of order, \nI ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment and deal with the \nissue later on in the process.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                      Amendment Offered by Ms. Lee\n\n  Ms. LEE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Add, at the end of title V of the bill, the following:\n\n[[Page H3730]]\n\n       Sec. 5__. (a) For each fiscal year after the expiration of \n     the period specified in subsection (b) in which a State \n     receives funds for a program referred to in subsection \n     (c)(2), the State shall require that all individuals enrolled \n     in an academy of a law enforcement agency of the State and \n     all law enforcement officers of the State fulfill a training \n     session on sensitivity each fiscal year, including training \n     on ethnic and racial bias, cultural diversity, and police \n     interaction with the disabled, mentally ill, and new \n     immigrants. In the case of individuals attending an academy, \n     such training session shall be for 8 hours, and in the case \n     of all other law enforcement officers, the training session \n     shall be for 4 hours.\n       (b)(1) Each State shall have not more than 120 days, \n     beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, to comply \n     with subsection (a), except that--\n       (A) the Attorney General may grant an additional 120 days \n     to a State that is making good faith efforts to comply with \n     such subsection; and\n       (B) the Attorney General shall waive the requirements of \n     subsection (a) if compliance with such subsection by a State \n     would be unconstitutional under the constitution of such \n     State.\n       (2) For any fiscal year after the expiration of the period \n     specified in paragraph (1), a State that fails to comply with \n     subsection (a), shall, at the discretion of the Attorney \n     General, be subject to not more than a 20-percent reduction \n     of the funds that would otherwise be allocated for that \n     fiscal year to the State under subpart 1 of part E of title I \n     of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 \n     U.S.C. 3750 et seq.), whether characterized as the Edward \n     Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance \n     Programs, the Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants \n     Program, the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant \n     Program, or otherwise.\n       (c) Amounts not allocated under a program referred to in \n     subsection (b)(2) to a State for failure to fully comply with \n     subsection (a) shall be reallocated under that program to \n     States that have not failed to comply with such subsection.\n\n  Ms. LEE (during the reading). I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be considered as read and printed in the Record.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n\n                              {time}  2220\n\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman from California and \na Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. LEE. Madam Chair, I want to thank the Chair and our ranking \nmember for your leadership on this subcommittee for your interest and \nsupport on this amendment. I recognize the point of order and plan to \nwithdraw the amendment.\n  Recent events in Ferguson, Staten Island, Baltimore, and around the \ncountry really illustrate the need for significant reform in police \ninteraction in communities that they are sworn to serve and protect. \nThat is why this amendment would require the States receiving funding \nfrom the Department of Justice's Edward Byrne Memorial Justice \nAssistance Program put academy students and law enforcement officers \nthrough sensitivity training on ethnic and racial bias, cultural \ndiversity, and police interaction with the disabled, mentally ill, and \nnew immigrants.\n  As you know, DOJ's Byrne JAG Grant Program is the primary provider of \nFederal criminal justice funding to State and local jurisdictions \nsupporting a wide range of law enforcement and court activities. Our \nlaw enforcement agencies and officers play a critical role in \nprotecting the safety of our communities. We need them to work \ncooperatively and competently along with our community members if we \nwant to protect the public safety and the integrity of our \nneighborhoods.\n  This is a major issue in many congressional districts where many \nofficers live outside of the communities they serve and do not have the \ntraining to deal with a diverse constituency. Madam Chairman, I know \nthat we all agree that the status quo is simply unacceptable.\n  Madam Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. \nClay), my colleague who has demonstrated incredible leadership on this \nissue and continues to work in a bipartisan fashion on this very \ncommonsense policy.\n  Mr. CLAY. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of this amendment. FBI Director \nJames Comey's February 12, 2015, speech, entitled, ``Hard Truths: Law \nEnforcement and Race,'' addressed what he characterized as a \n``disconnect between police and minority communities.'' Director Comey \nchallenged officers to ``acknowledge the widespread existence of \nunconscious bias.'' We appreciate his candor and acknowledgment of \nissues we have long felt.\n  Experience in our communities indicates negative police interaction, \nand excessive force disproportionately affects communities of color, \nbut there are other communities who would also benefit from better law \nenforcement relations.\n  As FBI Director, Mr. Comey requires all new agents and analysts to \nstudy the agency's interaction with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \nfollowed by a visit to the King Memorial. The FBI's required study \nserves as recognition that in order to truly see each other as people, \nwe must recognize our shortcomings and create and identify \nopportunities to understand, respect, and be decent to one another.\n  Police officer sensitivity training and annual retraining demonstrate \na commitment to communities across this Nation. As Members of Congress, \nit is a practice we must encourage. In Ferguson, Staten Island, \nCleveland, North Charleston and Baltimore, the need for reform is as \nclear as it is urgent.\n  Madam Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. LEE. Madam Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Fattah), our ranking member.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I want to thank the gentlewoman for her steadfastness and \nher focus on this matter and pledge to her that I am going to work with \nthe chairman as we go forward to see that we get this incorporated in \nthe final product of our bill.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I continue to reserve the point of order pending the \ngentlewoman's withdrawal of the amendment.\n  Madam Chairman, I want to reassure my colleague that I will continue \nto work with her and my ranking member, to work on this as we move \nthrough conference, as we discussed in full committee.\n  I appreciate the gentlewoman's withdrawing the amendment, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. LEE. Madam Chair, I want to thank our ranking member and our \nchairman for their commitment to continue to work on this very \nimportant issue, along with Congressman Clay.\n  Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                 Amendment Offered by Mr. Poe of Texas\n\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to enforce section 221 of title 13, United States \n     Code, with respect to the survey, conducted by the Secretary \n     of Commerce, commonly referred to as the ``American Community \n     Survey''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam Chair, we are all familiar with the Census that takes place \nevery 10 years where there is a counting of the people in America. The \nCensus Bureau also has another project, not constitutionally required, \nbut something\n\n[[Page H3731]]\n\nthat they do called the American Community Survey, which is a partial \nsampling of about 3 million Americans a year.\n  A survey is sent out, and I will read from this 28-page survey. It is \n48 questions long, and the questions have nothing to do with how many \npeople live in your house. Some of the questions are like this:\n  When do you leave for work?\n  When does your spouse leave for work?\n  When do your kids leave for school?\n  Does anyone suffer from a mental illness in the residence?\n  Does your house have a sink with a faucet?\n  Does anyone have trouble walking?\n  Does anyone have trouble getting dressed or bathed?\n  So there are 48 question like this, and failure to abide by and fill \nout this document and send it back to the Census Bureau could result in \na fine.\n  Now, people in my district have called my office from all over the \ncountry about getting this thing in the mail and the harassment by the \nCensus Bureau and subcontractors, including the fact that I have a \nsingle parent in my district that called and was complaining about the \nfact that the Census Bureau person would sit in the front of her house \nwaiting for her to come home from work and then go to the door and peak \nthrough the windows trying to get her to fill out this page, or these \n28 pages and send them back to the Census Bureau. So harassment takes \nplace. And some people are threatened with a fine that is imposed for \nfailure to abide by the survey.\n  Now, what this amendment does, it does not eliminate the American \nCommunity Survey. The ranking member and I had a discussion, I guess, \nabout 5 hours ago on the House floor about whether it is a good idea or \nnot. It doesn't even stop the survey from being conducted.\n\n                              {time}  2230\n\n  All it does is prohibit the Federal Government from imposing a \npenalty for failure to fill out the survey. That results in the fact \nthat people then can voluntarily fill out this form and send it back if \nthey want to. If they don't want to voluntarily have their privacy \ninvaded by the government, then they don't have to fill it back out and \ndon't have to worry about a fine.\n  That is what this amendment does: prohibits funding to allow the fine \nto be collected, thus making the survey voluntary.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I supported the gentleman's last amendment. \nI strongly oppose this amendment.\n  It is impossible for me to conceive that we want to run the greatest \ncountry on the face of the Earth without data, without information, \nwithout knowledge of what the circumstances of the citizens of the \ncountry are--how many daycare slots, where to locate VA hospitals, all \nof the other information that is generated through this community \nsurvey.\n  Now, I note that there is talk about a fine, but we haven't been able \nto identify anybody who has ever been fined. We do know that our \nneighbors to the north, when the Canadians moved to a voluntary system \nin their rural areas, they stopped getting almost any compliance.\n  If the Federal Government is going to plan in terms of Federal \nhighways, in terms of Federal programming, and a whole range of items \nthat flow through formal grants, not through earmarks, but by knowledge \nof what is happening in communities, these surveys are critical.\n  The idea that we would say we are going to run this great country, we \ndon't want any information, we are going to put on blindfolds and just \nkind of hope for the best when we are making public policy about \neducation and housing and transportation needs or health care needs, it \ndoesn't make a lot of sense. It may have some popularity politically, \nbut as a notion for actual intentional leadership for our Nation, to \nsay that we want to separate ourselves from actual information about \nwhat is going on in these communities, I think that the gentleman, as \nright as he was in the original amendment that I supported him on, in \nthis particular matter I think he is headed in the wrong direction.\n  I would ask my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--put the party \naside, put the national interest first, and know for certainty that no \nperson would ever--you are always talking about running the government \nlike a business--no one would run a business without utilizing data to \nunderstand the marketplace.\n  At this point, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I \nhave remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Culberson), chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman.\n  I want to express my strong support for my neighbor and good friend \nJudge Poe's amendment because, again, our most important right as \nAmericans is to be left alone.\n  In fact, the data, and I agree with my ranking member that this data \nis important, but it can be included as a part of the Census itself. \nAny really essential questions the Department of Commerce can include \nwithin the core questions of the Census. They don't have to send this \nlong intrusive and detailed and very invasive survey out to every \nAmerican and subject Americans to the threat of a $10,000 fine if they \ndon't comply.\n  I support the gentleman's amendment as a further reflection of our \ncommitment on this subcommittee and in this Congress to protect \nAmerica's right to privacy and to be left alone by their government, as \nMr. Mason and Mr. Jefferson intended.\n  I urge Members to support Mr. Poe's amendment. And remember, if the \ngovernment needs this data, they can just put it in the basic Census \nitself.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, how much time is remaining between the \ngentleman who is the proponent and myself?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Texas has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. FATTAH. And I assume he has the right to close?\n  The Acting CHAIR. Yes, he does.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, let me remind the House that we had another \nTexan--he was the President of the United States--and it was under his \nadministration that the questions that were put together in the \ncommunity survey were developed under that administration.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will suspend.\n  The gentleman from Pennsylvania does have the right to close.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, well, then at this point, I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for bringing up \nthe American Community Survey and where it came from. That is \nirrelevant. The issue is Americans should not be required to give \npersonal information to the Federal Government. If they want to fill \nout this form, go for it. Make it voluntary. Fill it out and send the \nFederal Government all the information you can come up with about what \ntakes place in your residence. But it should not be required.\n  The Federal Government could get this information some other way. \nThey could go to polling. The idea that they have got to go door to \ndoor to get this information when information is gathered all over the \ncountry by different businesses not going door to door--the government \ncan do it other ways and not violate the right of privacy.\n  I would ask that this amendment be adopted that basically requires \nthe American Community Survey to be voluntary, and that the fine that \nis allowed by law not be allowed or not be collected under this \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, let me close by just saying that I just want \nto make sure that, because there is some antipathy about, sometimes, \nanything that may emanate from this administration, I just want to make \nit clear\n\n[[Page H3732]]\n\nthat this was not some Democratic scheme here to gather up people's \nprivate information; that this is actually a legitimate activity of the \nFederal Government. It is one joined in by the Chamber of Commerce and \nother business organizations who tell us that this is vitally \nimportant.\n  I think just from a commonsense basis, we actually know as \npoliticians, because when we are engaged in activities that are \nimportant, we try to get a lot of information. So we know it is \nimportant. It is actually important for making sure that Federal \nprograms are focused on the priorities of your community. And if we \ndon't have the knowledge of how many people need daycare slots or how \nmany veterans there are or what the other circumstances are in a \nparticular community, it is impossible to do the planning that is \nnecessary.\n  I would ask that we reject this amendment and that we continue to use \ndata as a basis to make informed decisions here at the national level.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Foster\n\n  Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, offered \njointly with the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett), my colleague.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 543.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to fund any Experimental Program to Stimulate \n     Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Illinois and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, every year, hundreds of billions of dollars \nis transferred out of States that pay far more in Federal taxes than \nthey receive back in Federal spending--the so-called ``payer States.'' \nAnd this money is transferred into States that receive a lot more \nFederal spending than they pay in taxes--the ``taker States.'' This is \nan enormous and economically unjustifiable redistribution of wealth \nbetween the States.\n  The payer States can be characterized in a number of ways, but most \nof the payer States are large population States, while virtually all of \nthe taker States are smaller, which means that they are overrepresented \nin the Senate.\n  Over time, Senators from these States have inserted hundreds of \nprograms that systematically steer money into the taker States. Our \namendment takes a first small step to begin rolling back these taker \nState preferences by eliminating one of the most unjustifiable of them \nall: the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, \ncommonly referred to as EPSCoR.\n\n                              {time}  2240\n\n  EPSCoR was started as an experimental program in 1978 with the goal \nof redistributing Federal research dollars into States that \ntraditionally received less than their ``fair share'' of NSF funding.\n  However, because ``fair share'' was determined on a per State basis, \nrather than on a per capita basis, it has devolved into just another \nprogram that steers money into smaller States that already get far more \nthan their fair share of Federal spending.\n  Since no allowance is made for whether the State has a big or a small \npopulation, the EPSCoR program systematically discriminates against \nresearchers simply because they come from States with large \npopulations. The EPSCoR States are hardly lacking for Federal largesse.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, in a typical year, the EPSCoR States \nreceived approximately $60 billion more in Federal spending than they \npaid in Federal taxes.\n  How does one justify a program that excludes researchers in States \nlike Florida or Texas, which over the past 3 years got only an average \nof about $7 per capita in NSF funding while steering money into States \nlike Rhode Island, Alaska, and New Hampshire, which already got 5 times \nmore?\n  Why should a researcher at Brown University in Rhode Island be \neligible for a grant set-aside that is unavailable to researchers at \nSMU, FSU, UCLA, Rutgers, or Northern Illinois?\n  As a scientist, I find that it is not surprising that it is very \ndifficult to find supporters for EPSCoR in the scientific community. \nPrecious research funding would be far better spent in a competitive, \nmerit-based process as it will be if our amendment is adopted.\n  Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nGarrett), the cosponsor of my amendment.\n  Mr. GARRETT. I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster) for his \nwork on this issue. I am honored to serve alongside him on the Payer \nState Caucus as well.\n  Madam Chair, this program is yet another example of good intentions \nand bad policy. What was intended to be a temporary assistance to a \nselect group of States to build a research infrastructure and then exit \nthe program has become a permanent and growing pot of taxpayer \nsubsidies. This, of course, is in addition to the permanent and growing \npot of subsidies the government has already enacted for the States.\n  For three decades, 30 years after establishment, this program \ncontinues to be called--what?--an experimental program, and no State--\nnone--has graduated from the program; yet it exists 30 years later.\n  This can only demonstrate one thing, Madam Chair, that this is yet \nanother example of ineffective, wasteful redistribution programs that \nthe taxpayers are compelled to financially support. The Foster-Garrett \namendment would relieve the taxpayers of this burden.\n  Again, I thank Mr. Foster for his work in protecting the payer \nStates, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. FOSTER. I thank my colleague from New Jersey.\n  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, this program is designed to ensure that \nacademic institutions and industry can develop science and engineering \ncapabilities that are outside of traditional research hubs.\n  The partnerships support areas of strategic importance in such \ndisciplines as aerospace and aerospace-related research. I do urge a \n``no'' vote on the gentleman's amendment.\n  I now yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).\n  Mr. CICILLINE. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment which would \neliminate the EPSCoR program.\n  For more than 60 years, the National Science Foundation has provided \nacademic research funding to colleges and universities around the \nNation, and it has been critical to ongoing research that is essential \nto maintaining our competitive edge in scientific advancement.\n  The NSF's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, \ncommonly known as EPSCoR, is an authorized program whose mission is to \nhelp balance the allocation of NSF and other Federal research and \ndevelopment funding to avoid the undue concentration of money to only a \nfew States.\n  This successful program has had a profound impact on my home State of \nRhode Island, allowing nine of our academic institutions to increase \nresearch capacity, to enrich the experience of their students, and to \ncontribute to advances in a variety of fields.\n  Currently, 25 States, including Rhode Island, and 3 jurisdictions \naccount for only about 10 percent of all NSF funding, despite the fact \nthat these States account for 20 percent of the U.S. population. EPSCoR \nhas helped to stabilize this imbalance in funding and should continue \nto do so in the 2016 fiscal year and beyond.\n  In order to ensure robust academic research and outcomes across the \ncountry, geographic diversity in funding should be considered to ensure \nthat we are taking advantage of the particular experiences, knowledge, \nand perspectives of academics and institutions from every State. This \namendment to\n\n[[Page H3733]]\n\neliminate this successful program would be a step backward for the \nUnited States' commitment to research and development.\n  Investments in critical programs, such as EPSCoR, are essential to \ncreating jobs, innovating for the future, maintaining our competitive \nedge in scientific research and a global economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in strongly opposing this amendment.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, I would ask Members to vote ``no.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Goodlatte\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to pay the salaries and expenses of personnel of the \n     Department of Justice to negotiate or conclude a settlement \n     with the Federal Government that includes terms requiring the \n     defendant to donate or contribute funds to an organization or \n     individual.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  My amendment prevents the Department of Justice from requiring \nmandatory donations as part of settlement agreements. The Department of \nJustice is systematically subverting Congress' budget authority by \nusing settlements to funnel money to third-party groups.\n  An investigation by the House Judiciary and Financial Services \nCommittees reveals that, in just the last 10 months, the Department of \nJustice has used mandatory donations to direct as much as half a \nbillion dollars to activist groups.\n  These payments occur entirely outside of the congressional \nappropriations and oversight process. In some cases, the Department of \nJustice is using mandatory donations to restore funding that Congress \nspecifically cut. This is money that could otherwise be going directly \nto victims.\n  The Department of Justice continues to resist document requests, but \nwhat little has been provided confirms that activist groups which stood \nto gain from mandatory donation provisions were involved in placing \nthose provisions in the settlements.\n  The committees raised concerns with the Department of Justice in \n2014, but instead of suspending the practice, the Department of Justice \nhas doubled down. It recently entered into an over $50 million \nsettlement relating to robo-signing; $7.5 million of that did not make \nit to victims.\n\n                              {time}  2250\n\n  Instead, it went to a third party. Incredibly, the settlement \nspecifically provided that there would be no oversight of the money.\n  The situation is even more egregious when one considers that the \nrequired donation will nearly double the net assets of the DOJ-\nspecified recipient. It is deeply troubling for that to happen at the \nunilateral discretion of the executive branch.\n  This amendment takes no money away from any organization. It is \npurely prospective. It ensures that settlement money goes either \ndirectly to victims or to the Treasury for elected representatives to \ndecide how it is to be spent.\n  It is critical that we act. The Department of Justice is ignoring \nCongress' concerns, increasing the use of third-party payments, even as \nwe object. The purpose of enforcement actions is punishment and redress \nto actual victims. Carrying that concept to communities at large or \nactivist community groups, however worthy, is a matter for the \nlegislative branch and is not to be conducted at the unilateral \ndiscretion of the executive.\n  This is fundamentally a bipartisan institutional issue. There was \nabuse of third-party payments in the Bush administration. This \namendment is about preserving Congress' appropriations authority. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I claim the time in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I am not planning on strongly objecting to \nthis, but I want to make a few points. One is that this is something \nthat should be dealt with in an authorizing circumstance, but I think \nbecause it is on an appropriations bill, it could have unintended \nconsequences.\n  As I understand the plain English of what is being said, an \nadministration faced with, for instance, the Gulf oil spill could not \nhave been involved in a settlement in which various entities received \ndollars to try to find redress for harm that was created in the Gulf. I \nthink that that would be very problematic because there were a lot of \ngroups--fishermen, other associations, chambers of commerce, others--\nwho received support through that settlement.\n  I just think we ought to be careful. It would probably be better that \nthere be hearings and that there be an understanding around what this \nactually means. I have offered my own bipartisan-supported legislation \nthat would create a congressional framework for settlements. I am not \nopposed to the thrust of what is being said here.\n  I do recognize that there have been circumstances in past \nadministrations. I am not aware of the instances that the chairman \nspeaks of now, but I would just hope that rather than rushing forward, \nwe would be mindful that this is probably the kind of thing that we \nreally would want authorizers to handle and not have it tucked into an \nappropriations bill at this time. Plus, if you really think that the \nexecutive branch is using their authority, the idea that they would \nthen sign it away by signing our appropriations bill, if it is so \nmeaningful to them, it might slow down the passage of our very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for his concern \nabout this. I want to assure the gentleman that the language in this is \ndesigned to make it clear that it applies to donations and not to \nanybody who is a victim of a lawsuit where redress is sought for them \nbecause the compensation for them is not a donation. That is actual \nrecompense for the harm that they suffered.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I know the chairman is quite aware of how \nthese words, ``donation,'' ``mandatory,'' ``settlement,'' so forth and \nso on, might be applied and abused in various ways.\n  Again, obviously, if this is something the majority wants to do, they \nwill do it. I just think that it may have unintended consequences; and \nthis administration, the next administration, and various \nadministrations going forward, there should be a congressional \nframework for settlements. I have offered legislation that is \nbipartisan in that regard. I am not opposed to creating a congressional \nframework. I just think that we don't want to have unintended \nconsequences here if we can avoid it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Culberson), the chairman of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, I want to express my strong support for \nChairman Goodlatte's amendment. The words he has chosen have been \nchosen very carefully. A donation or contribution is just that. It is a \ngift. It is a donation. If the money is paid in compensation for an \ninjury as a result of a claim, it is not covered. So the\n\n[[Page H3734]]\n\nchairman of the Committee on the Judiciary has written this very \ncarefully and very narrowly to address a very real problem. I strongly \nsupport the gentleman's amendment and have worked with him and his \nstaff on it.\n  I really, genuinely appreciate the good work that your staff has \ndone, Mr. Chairman, in working with you to find common ground.\n  This is one of those areas that I believe we are doing good public \npolicy. I strongly support the gentleman's amendment and urge its \nadoption.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time \njust to say this is an important principle, not only to address the \nabuse that has taken place in the executive branch, but to protect the \nprerogatives of the Congress on both sides of the aisle.\n  These are funds that, if they are not expended for the specific \npurpose of providing compensation to victims, relief to victims in \nthese lawsuits, those funds should go back to the General Treasury of \nthe United States, and they should be appropriated by the Congress--in \nfact, by this very subcommittee of the House Committee on \nAppropriations--to make sure that the people's will is exercised with \nregard to the expenditure of these funds.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Blumenauer\n\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title) insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used for any inspection under section 510 of the \n     Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 880) with respect to \n     narcotic drugs in schedule III, IV, or V of section 202 of \n     such Act (21 U.S.C. 812), or combinations of such drugs, \n     being dispensed pursuant to section 303(g)(2) of such Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 823(g)(2)) for maintenance or detoxification \n     treatment.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Oregon and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chair, that is a rather imposing title to deal \nwith a relatively simple concept.\n  We have a national epidemic dealing with opioid painkillers. \nPrescription drug overdoses are a serious problem. We find people who \nbecome addicted. We are finding that, in a routine matter of course, \nthis drug dependence often leads to heroin, and we are watching a chain \nof events.\n  In Oregon, we found that 15 percent of young Oregonians between 18 \nand 25 abused prescription pain relievers last year. I mentioned that \nchain of causality. We are finding that people in this sequence often \nuse heroin as a substitute when the pills get too expensive or the high \nis no longer high enough. It is easy to switch to heroin.\n  It is not just a problem in Oregon. We have seen the CDC chart heroin \ndeaths doubling between 2010 and 2012 in 28 States.\n  Opioid addiction can be devastating, but there is a drug that can be \nused to safely and effectively treat this addiction. For more than 12 \nyears, buprenorphine has been a critical weapon in our fight against \nopioid addiction. It can be taken on an outpatient basis. It is easy to \nadminister.\n  But we have seen artificial barriers to treatment. In fact, we have \nmade it harder for doctors to prescribe these schedule III addiction \ntreatment drugs even though it is comparatively easy to prescribe the \nschedule II drugs that cause addiction in the first place, such as \nVicodin and OxyContin. And the schedule III drugs, we are finding that \nthere are audits that are taking place by DEA.\n\n                              {time}  2300\n\n  Doctors who complete the 8-hour certification process have been \napproached by DEA agents in my community before they even write a \nsingle prescription. They report hostile and intimidating behavior from \nagents who demand inspections of their prescription records at random, \nunscheduled intervals. As I say, these are doctors who can simply write \na prescription for powerful narcotics without having to worry about \nrandom DEA inspections.\n  We need to allow doctors to treat their patients with compassion and \nwith the care they deem appropriate. They shouldn't have to worry about \nDEA agents having a super overlay of attention.\n  We need to encourage opportunities to make sure that doctors can \ntreat patients and be able to withdraw them from the symptoms. And I \nwould respectfully suggest that the DEA should focus their efforts on \nchasing criminals, the pill mills, and the drug dealers, not doctors \nwho have worked hard to be part of the solution.\n  This amendment solves the problem by ensuring no funds are available \nto DEA to enforce inspections of the physicians who prescribe \nbuprenorphine and allow them to proceed with the treatment of patients \nwithout fear of getting into trouble with the Federal Government while \nhelping hundreds of at-risk patients who want to beat their addiction \nin a healthy, effective way.\n  The irony is the powerful addictive drugs don't have as much \ninterference and oversight. The opportunity to have drugs at schedule \nIII--not schedule II--that can be used to treat it is much more \ndifficult and intrusive for medical professionals. That is not right.\n  I would respectfully suggest that we adopt this amendment to correct \nthe situation, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \nGoodlatte), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding, \nand I rise to join him in opposition to this amendment.\n  Madam Chair, this amendment would undermine diversion control and \nthereby potentially increase drug abuse by creating a significant \nloophole in the system of controls established by the Controlled \nSubstances Act.\n  The amendment would cause this highly problematic result by \neffectively exempting DEA registrants who dispense drugs for addiction \ntreatment from being subject to administrative oversight under the CSA. \nAt present, buprenorphine is the only schedule III-V controlled \nsubstance contained in a drug that has been approved by the FDA for \ndrug addiction treatment.\n  While it is also true that the amendment would not preclude DOJ/DEA \nfrom obtaining a criminal search warrant to obtain the foregoing types \nof records, this does not come close to being an adequate substitute \nfor the administrative inspection authority. Obtaining a criminal \nsearch warrant must be predicated on evidence sufficient to establish \nprobable cause that the registrant has committed a criminal violation \nof the Controlled Substances Act.\n  The very point of the administrative inspection authority that \nCongress provided under the CSA 45 years ago was to have a robust \nsystem of administrative oversight that would help to prevent \nregulatory violations before they occurred, and even more so, before \ncriminal violations occurred. This is because Congress recognized that \ncontrolled substances, when abused, can have dangerous and sometimes \ndeadly consequences, and thus that the widespread problem of drug abuse \nin the United States cannot be solved exclusively through criminal \nprovisions of the Controlled Substances Act.\n  It also bears mentioning that this drug is highly subject to \ndiversion, as it is a narcotic drug that is much sought after by many \npersons who are addicted to opiates and/or who seek to abuse opiates \nfor nonmedical purposes.\n  Indeed, the heightened risk of diversion associated with dispensing \nof this drug to a drug-addicted patient population actually warrants \ngreater scrutiny, not less scrutiny, than with many other categories of \nprescribed controlled substances.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I join the chairman in urging my colleagues to oppose \nthis amendment on many grounds. It is a technical issue that should be \ndealt with by the authorizing committees. This is not an appropriate \nplace to handle it.\n\n[[Page H3735]]\n\n  I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Fleming), who has \npersonal experience and knowledge in this area as a physician, and who \ncan speak to this in opposition as well.\n  Mr. FLEMING. I thank my good friend for yielding.\n  Madam Chairman, years ago, one of the positions I served was as a \ndirector for drug addiction and alcoholism, and one of my duties was as \na methadone doctor.\n  This drug is really a new form of methadone. It can be applied and \ncan be employed in the treatment of heroin addiction. But at the end of \nthe day, it too is highly addictive. It is a scheduled drug, and it is \nabused. So it deserves the same kind of safeguards and protections and \noversight as any other addictive drug.\n  And so if my friends really want to see this used as an effective \ntool and not itself become a dangerous drug out on the open market \nbeing diverted and perhaps even sold on the black market, I suggest \nthat we oppose this amendment and let's continue the good, strong \noversight that we have under the CSA.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I would strongly urge my colleagues to talk to \ntreatment professionals in their communities. My concern is that we \ndon't have as much vigorous oversight for things that are much more \nhighly addictive--we see them more abused--and that this extra overlay \nfor something that is less dangerous and can in fact be useful for \ntreatment, I think, is an area that deserves oversight.\n  I respect my friends in terms of their opinions, but I would urge \nthem to have the conversations I have had with the people who are \ngetting wrapped around the axle with the DEA.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, with that, I would urge all Members to \noppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                Amendment Offered by Mr. Carter of Texas\n\n  Mr. CARTER of Texas. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to \n     propose or to issue a rule that would change the Chief Law \n     Enforcement Officer certificate requirement in a manner that \n     has the same substance as the proposed rule published on \n     September 9, 2013 (786 Fed. Reg. 55014).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CARTER of Texas. I rise with an amendment to limit unnecessary \nburdens on firearm owners and law enforcement officers.\n  The Second Amendment's intent is clear: firearm ownership ``shall not \nbe infringed.'' However, the ATF has proposed a rule requiring an \nadditional layer of approval from local law enforcement officers to \npurchase suppressors and other firearms regulated by the National \nFirearms Act. This rule broadly expands existing requirements and \nfurther burdens local law enforcement officers who are already \noverworked and understaffed.\n  The ATF knows full well that there are cities and jurisdictions that \nrefuse to give approval for political reasons.\n\n                              {time}  2310\n\n  Action films are fun to watch, but they are wrong about suppressors. \nSuppressors dampen the sound of a firearm, but do not make guns silent. \nThey simply are a form of hearing protection for the shooter, for other \nhuman beings, and for any hunting dogs that are around.\n  Suppressors increase safety while shooting, allow people to easily \nhear and react to range safety instructions and to other sportsmen.\n  My amendment ensures Americans' rights are protected and does not \neliminate background checks. It will protect suppressor suppliers; \nmanufacturers; tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue; thousands \nof jobs nationwide; and, more importantly, the Second Amendment rights \nof a law-abiding gunowner.\n  I urge support for this commonsense provision, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. If the gentleman from Texas would join me in a quick \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. CARTER of Texas. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. FATTAH. This is the amendment relative to trust and gun trust and \nwhether there needs to be a background check or not?\n  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. CARTER of Texas. This is the amendment that requires an \nadditional approval by a law enforcement officers for purchases of \ncertain either weapons or suppressors.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Right. Now, in this instance, in 2006, our information is \nthat there were 4,600 of these applications, and then that grew to \n40,000 in 2012 and then 72,000 in 2013 and 90,000 in 2014.\n  Are those numbers relatively accurate, as best as you know?\n  Mr. CARTER of Texas. If the gentleman will yield, those numbers could \nbe accurate. I cannot contest those numbers.\n  However, it has been made absolutely clear, both by target shooters \nand by hunters, that suppressors make for a more accurate weapon, less \ndamage on the shooter, less damage on the people and animals around the \nshooter, a better ability to be safe with your fellow hunters.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Thank you, Judge.\n  Reclaiming my time, I rise in opposition to this. It is clear, given \nthe majority that we have, that we won't be on a successful vote count \non this.\n  I do want to make the point, right, that the Second Amendment, as it \nwas ruled on by the Supreme Court, says that there can be reasonable \nregulation, and so that is our job. That is where we come into this \npicture at. We are supposed to be the reasonable regulators. We are \nsupposed to decide where and when and under what circumstances there \nshould be some speed bump.\n  The question here is, for these types of circumstances, where someone \nis going to have a weapon in which discerning that it has been fired, \nyou are going to be less able to do it, whether that is something where \nsomeone should have to have a small speed bump on the way to getting \nit.\n  Now, it doesn't seem like there is a major hurdle here because we \nhave jumped from 4,600 of these in 2006 to 90,000 in 2014.\n  I don't know, unless we are going to just have a universal access to \nthem, there doesn't seem to be a major impediment.\n  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Because an application was made doesn't \nnecessarily mean that the law enforcement people dealt with it and \napproved that application. Now, if you are telling me these are 90,000 \napproved applications, I understand your argument.\n  One of the issues seems to be finding a law enforcement agency in the \nmodern society we live in that actually has some knowledge of the \nindividual that is making the request and is willing to process it.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Judge, I will just say this then, reclaiming my time, \nthat everybody, even those who are not involved in law enforcement, \nunderstands the challenge of having a firearm in which the sound is \nsuppressed.\n  We just had an incident in one of our Capitol buildings where someone \ntried to bring a weapon in. We know that weapons are dangerous. That is \nwhy you can't bring them into the U.S. Capitol.\n  Making them more accessible in the communities and among the people \nthat we represent, if we think that is a great thing to do, the \nmajority will have its way on this. I stand in opposition to it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Chair, I only claim time to say that I \nserve on this subcommittee with both these honorable gentlemen. I want \nto commend them for a great bill.\n\n[[Page H3736]]\n\n  The chairman has asked for time. I yield such time as he may consume \nto the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I do want to express my strong support for the \ngentleman's amendment. It is an appropriate and necessary additional \nprotection for Americans' Second Amendment rights.\n  Judge Carter is exactly right. This is the right place for the bill. \nThis is the right place for this amendment. He has drafted it very \nnarrowly and very carefully, and I urge Members to join us in \nsupporting this very important Second Amendment amendment before the \nHouse.\n  Mr. CARTER of Texas. To finish, I am honored to serve on this \nsubcommittee with these two fine gentlemen. They have made a great work \nproduct here, and I am very glad that we were able to all work \ntogether.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 9 Offered by Ms. Bonamici\n\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this Act to \n     the Department of Justice may be used to prevent a State from \n     implementing its own State laws that authorize the use, \n     distribution, possession, or cultivation of industrial hemp, \n     as defined in section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 \n     (Public Law 113-79).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom Oregon and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Oregon.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Chair, I rise to offer a bipartisan amendment \nwith Mr. Massie to restore power to the States to regulate the \ncultivation of industrial hemp within their own borders. The House \nadopted this amendment last year with strong support from both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  This amendment is very simple. It would move our country in line with \nindustrialized countries around the world that long ago recognized the \nimportance of industrial hemp as a natural resource, an agricultural \ncommodity, and a versatile component that is now found in more than \n25,000 commercial products.\n  In fact, not only does this amendment bring America in line with much \nof the rest of the industrialized world, it brings America back in line \nwith our country's history. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson grew \nit. The first drafts of our Constitution and first laws were written on \npaper made from it.\n  During World War II, the USDA encouraged patriotic American farmers \nto raise it for the war effort. They even produced a slick promotional \nfilm titled ``Hemp for Victory.'' Now, at least 23 States have passed \nlaws to allow farmers to grow it, too.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Government stands in the way of family \nfarmers who want to grow hemp. The senseless classification of hemp as \na schedule I drug contributes nothing to public safety; instead, it \nrobs our farm economies of a potentially multibillion-dollar crop that \nis used to make everything from rope to soap.\n  The amendment would simply allow farmers to grow hemp in accordance \nwith their own State's laws. The amendment does not eliminate \nregulation in hemp cultivation; it simply divests the Department of \nJustice and the DEA of their ability to treat hemp like marijuana \nbecause hemp is not marijuana.\n  So far, 23 States have passed laws to allow farmers to grow hemp. \nRight now, farmers in California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, \nIndiana, Kentucky Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, \nNebraska, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, \nUtah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia are waiting for \nthe Federal Government to get out of the way.\n  Because the Department of Justice refuses to acknowledge what \nWashington and Jefferson knew, that hemp is an agricultural commodity \nand not marijuana, these State laws take a back seat to Federal \noverreach.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment, and I \nyield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie), my \ncosponsor.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Madam Chair, I am very excited to report that, thanks to \nthe farm bill amendment that allowed for pilot programs, we grew many \npilot programs in Kentucky last summer; and this summer, there will be \nabout 1,800 acres of hemp grown in Kentucky in pilot programs.\n\n                              {time}  2320\n\n  We have venture capital coming to Kentucky. I met with two companies \nin Kentucky that are investing in hemp, but the problem is right now \nthey can only do the pilot programs. Yet they are still going to grow \n1,800 acres of it in Kentucky alone. They grow 100,000 acres in Canada.\n  It is time to let our farmers have this opportunity. We need to take \naway the restraint that it is just a pilot program. We have addressed a \nlot of the concerns that people had last year before these pilot \nprograms. Law enforcement are okay with hemp now. They have seen that \nit is not its cousin.\n  With that, Madam Chair, I urge passage and urge my colleagues to vote \nfor this amendment.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Louisiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Madam Chair, the cultivation of cannabis for industrial \npurposes is governed by the Controlled Substances Act and permitted \npursuant to the registration requirements found in title 21, United \nStates Code.\n  Let's face it, hemp is very closely related to cannabis. And DEA \nagents tell us that it is very difficult to detect, determine, and \ndistinguish between hemp and marijuana, so it only makes their job more \ndifficult. However, the Agricultural Act of 2014--and Mr. Massie just \nreferred to this, I believe--permits institutions of higher learning \nand State departments of agriculture to grow or cultivate industrial \nhemp as defined in the statute for purposes of research conducted under \nan agricultural pilot program or other agricultural or academic \nresearch.\n  In short, we are studying it, we are analyzing it, and we are \nevaluating it, but we don't have the results yet of those studies. I \nthink it would be premature, especially considering the problem with \nthe rapid expansion of the marijuana industry and the problems which I \nwill speak about later this evening with marijuana and abuse of \nmarijuana and the damage to brains of our children and so forth. The \nlast thing I think that we want to do now is to create more problems \nfor enforcement for the DEA.\n  Madam Chairman, if we are going to study it, let's study it, but I do \nnot believe it is time that we remove these restraints on industrial \nhemp.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Chair, may I inquire into the amount of time \nremaining.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Oregon has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer), my colleague.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's \ncourtesy and her leadership on this issue.\n  Madam Chairman, as a practical matter, industrial hemp is not \nmarijuana. With less than 0.3 percent THC, it is not a drug. As a \npractical matter, it is not hard to distinguish it, and, in fact, it is \nsort of a myth that somehow people will use industrial hemp to disguise \nthe cultivation of marijuana. They don't want that. It cross-\ncontaminates. It makes it a less effective product.\n  We have a situation where the rest of the world deals with industrial \nhemp, where there are countless products available to purchase today, \nit is just that Kentucky farmers or Oregon farmers can't produce it. \nLast year the House overwhelmingly passed this amendment. We are \nstarting down a path towards rationalization.\n  Twenty-three States have removed the barriers to production of \nindustrial hemp. The Federal Government should get out of the way. \nCongress should\n\n[[Page H3737]]\n\nadopt this amendment and allow it to proceed.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Madam Chairman, who has the right to close?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Oregon has the right to close \nsince the gentleman from Louisiana is not on the committee.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Madam Chairman, I would just say in conclusion that DEA \ntells us otherwise, that it is difficult to distinguish. It is a \nproblem for them. They are the ones who have to enforce this. Also, \nthere isn't any product that you can get from hemp. Hemp production, \nindustrial hemp is not abundant in many other ways, whether it is \npaper, rope, or what have you. So with that, it is not necessary. It is \nnot some vital resource that we can't do without. It does create and \ncomplicate problems when it comes to the enforcement of schedule I \ndrugs such as marijuana.\n  Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Chair, as we have heard this evening, it makes no \nsense that industrial hemp is legal to have and legal to use in \nmanufacturing but can't be grown by our own farmers. Right now the \ncompanies that are manufacturing with hemp have to import it from \nplaces like Canada and China. They should be able to grow it in our own \ncountry.\n  Please support this bipartisan amendment. Industrial hemp is grown \ndifferently from marijuana. It looks different. The enforcers can tell \nit apart. Let's let our farmers grow industrial hemp. Please support \nthis amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Oregon \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment Offered by Mr. Poe of Texas\n\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used for the DNA analysis and capacity enhancement program \n     and for other local, State, and Federal forensic activities \n     for which funds are made available under this Act as part of \n     the $125,000,000 for DNA-related and forensic programs and \n     activities, unless such funds are used in accordance with \n     paragraphs (3) and (4) of section (2)(c)) of the DNA Analysis \n     Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-546; 42 \n     U.S.C. 14135).\n\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, I reserve a point of order on the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman from Texas and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam Chairman, Congress in the last several sessions has done, I \nthink, an admirable job of dealing with this crime of sexual assault in \nthe United States. Several pieces of legislation have passed the House, \nunder several administrations, going all the way back to the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. More recently, under the Debbie Smith Act, SAFER \nlegislation, here is what is taking place.\n  We now know because of DNA that old rape kits can be analyzed to \ndetermine who the suspect was that committed that sexual assault, \ngenerally against females, and that is a good development.\n  Because of that legislation, the Debbie Smith Act was passed; and the \nSAFER Act says that Debbie Smith, which grants funds to do rape kit \nbacklogs, that 75 percent of that money, of those grants, will go to \nactually analyze backlog rape kits. Get those backlogs analyzed, go \nafter the bad guys, find out who committed these crimes, and bring \nthose 400,000 rape kits up to date by getting them analyzed.\n  This all sounds good. The problem is the Justice Department doesn't \nfollow the law. They are not analyzing these cases. There is still a \nbacklog. They are spending the money, but they are spending it on other \nthings like research rather than what the law says: analyze those \ncases.\n  Madam Chair, 75 percent of that money is to go to analyze that \nbacklog of rape cases.\n\n                              {time}  2330\n\n  My amendment just tells the Justice Department to follow previous \nlaw, analyze those cases, use 75 percent of the money that is available \nto analyze those cases. That is what the amendment does.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, I strongly agree with the gentleman's \namendment and intend to work with him as we move through conference to \naddress this problem in the way he suggests and make sure the law is \ncomplied with.\n  I understand the amendment may be withdrawn. Before the amendment is \nwithdrawn, if I could address the merits of your amendment, I think you \nare exactly right. We plussed up funding for rape kits. We want to make \nsure that this backlog is taken care of as rapidly as possible. I know \nmy friend from Philadelphia and the members of this committee share \nyour concern. We want to make sure the backlog rape kits are cleared \nout as rapidly as possible and these criminals are taken off the street \nas rapidly as they can be. We want to make sure the Federal law is \ncomplied with, so I will work with you to make sure that through the \noversight authority we have got on this subcommittee that the \nDepartment is enforcing the law as written by Congress and doing so \naggressively.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I concur with your point of view, and I hope that the \namendment is withdrawn. But I think that the maker of the proponent \namendment is correct that we need to move in this direction. We not \nonly want to make sure that the backlog is ended and that we get bad \npeople off the street; we also don't want innocent people incarcerated \nfor crimes they didn't commit. So this is where the science can help.\n  But you are right that we need to make sure that there is specific \ndirection. I thank the Chairman.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. And we can do that through oversight, and we will work \nvery closely with you, Judge Poe, on this. And I thank you for your \nwork on this effort. There is no penalty severe enough that can be \nimposed swiftly enough on anyone who would injure a woman or a child.\n  I understand the amendment is going to be withdrawn.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman, and I also thank the ranking \nmember.\n  What the amendment does--and I will work with the committee on this--\nis exactly what the ranking member said. In one word, it finds out \n``justice.'' We free the innocent and we convict the guilty, but we \ncan't do it unless these rape kits are analyzed. So I hope the \ncommittee figures out a way to have the Justice Department do what they \nare supposed to do that Congress has already told them to do. Good luck \nwith that.\n  Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  June 2, 2015, on page H3737, the following appeared: There was \nno objection.

The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Department of Justice in violation of--\n       (1) the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \n     States Constitution; or\n       (2) the memorandum issued by the Attorney General on March \n     31, 2015, and entitled ``Guidance Regarding the Use of Asset \n     Forfeiture Authorities in Connection with Structuring \n     Offenses''.\n\n\n[[Page H3738]]\n\n\n  Mr. ELLISON (during the reading). Madam Chair, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the amendment be considered as read and printed in the \nRecord.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Madam Chair, I offer this amendment with the support of \nthe chairpersons of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional \nHispanic Caucus, the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, and \nthe Progressive Caucus.\n  This amendment would prevent funding from law enforcement agencies \nthat engage in discriminatory profiling based on gender, race, \nethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or national origin.\n  It would also prevent the use of funds to repeal the December 14 \nrevised profiling guidance issued by the Department of Justice. \nDiscriminatory profiling is wrong. It doesn't help prevent crime. It \ncreates a culture of fear and resentment within our community. It is \ncontrary to the core constitutional principles, and the Federal dollars \nshouldn't be spent perpetuating this activity.\n  I commend the work of Attorney General Holder to revise profiling \nguidance, and I believe that we must do more to close the remaining \nloopholes in profiling guidance.\n  You shouldn't be able to profile at the border. You shouldn't be able \nto map people without cause. You shouldn't be able to use national \nsecurity as an excuse to engage in prejudicial policing.\n  And we need comprehensive antiprofiling legislation like the End \nRacial Profiling Act introduced by the dean of this Congress, John \nConyers. In the absence of such comprehensive reform, we should at \nleast prevent Federal funds from being used to discriminate against \ncitizens.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, even though \nI am not actually in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I think that what we should be for is \neffective law enforcement techniques. We know by every empirical \nevidence that profiling does not work, and our experts in every aspect \nof law enforcement--local, State, and nationally--tell us that it \ndoesn't work. So I agree with the gentleman and I support his \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Madam Chair, I will close and just say that racial \nprofiling has no place, and we urge a ``yes'' vote for the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Ellison\n\n  Mr. ELLISON. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to enter into a contract with any person whose \n     disclosures of a proceeding with a disposition listed in \n     section 2313(c)(1) of title 41, United States Code, in the \n     Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System \n     include the term ``Fair Labor Standards Act''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Madam Chair, this is a very simple amendment which says \nthat the moneys appropriated by the U.S. Congress should go to \ncontractors who deal fairly with workers and who do not violate the \nFair Labor Standards Act.\n  This particular amendment is not an allegation; it only applies to \ncontractors who have been found in violation, who have been forced to \ndisclose those violations based on the requirements of law and their \nviolations of the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  This amendment would prohibit the Federal Government from using funds \nin this bill to hire contractors with wage theft violations.\n  Madam Chair, we live in a time when it is so hard for workers all \nacross this Nation to make a living. People go to bed at night \ncalculating whether they are going to be able to meet their monthly \nexpenses. If the work that they do can't even be fully paid because \nthey are victims of wage theft by an unscrupulous employer, I think \nthat the Federal Government should not be doing business with that \nemployer.\n  The fact of the matter is that in this appropriation, we should \nreserve Federal money for the millions of contractors who do an honest \ncontract, who provide the Federal Government with good work. Evidence \nsuggests that wage theft is widespread and costs workers billions of \ndollars every year--greater than the cost of burglaries, robberies, \nlarcenies, and other sorts of problems.\n  Wage theft among Federal contractors is also a problem. Federal \ncontractors are among America's companies that we rely on to discharge \ngood service. But that service should be within the law; that service \nshould be honoring the work that workers do. And Federal contractors, \nsome of them, certainly not all, but some have had a problem in this \narea.\n  A national employment law project found that nearly one in three low-\nwage contractors in the D.C. area reported stolen wages.\n\n                              {time}  2340\n\n  A report by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee revealed that 35 percent of the largest Department of Labor \npenalties for wage theft were levied against Federal contractors.\n  Now, there are many excellent Federal contractors. These people \nshould not have to compete with companies that circumvent the \nrequirements of the law. In total, those Federal contractors who did \nhad to repay employees $82.1 million in back wages for violations \nbetween 2007 and 2012. Despite these violations, many of these same \ncompanies received Federal contracts again in 2012.\n  The fact of the matter is that wage theft is wrong, and the people \nwho engage in it shouldn't receive Federal funds. I hope that all \nMembers will agree that a dollar earned is a dollar that must be paid \nand that the United States of America only wants to do business with \ncontractors that obey the law.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chairman, I share the gentleman's concerns, but \nI think his amendment is written so broadly that it is going to have an \nimpact far beyond anything he actually intended.\n  For example, if a very large company like Boeing ever failed to pay \nsomebody overtime on one occasion, the way his amendment is drafted, \nthis would bar Boeing from ever doing any business with the Federal \nGovernment. It would bar Lockheed, which is responsible for building \nthe Orion spacecraft for NASA, and they are doing an extraordinarily \ngood job in doing so.\n  It is almost inevitable. None of us are perfect. Everybody, somewhere \nor somehow, is going to make a mistake. It is just inevitable. In the \nway the gentleman's amendment is drafted, the Federal Government could \nnot hire any company that was ever dealt with in a proceeding that \nincluded the term ``Fair Labor Standards Act.'' It essentially \nblackballs any contractor who has ever had any violation of any kind, \nanywhere, anytime.\n  It is too broad. This is not the right place for it. You are going to \ndo great damage to a lot of very good companies that have had very \nminor, one-time violations a number of years ago. I know that is not \nthe gentleman's intent, but the language before the House that he has \ndrafted is very broad and has implications far beyond what I know he \nhas laid out here tonight.\n\n[[Page H3739]]\n\n  The bill, as written, would actually, I think, wind up with a lot of \nvery good companies being unable to do business with the Federal \nGovernment, so I would ask Members to oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Madam Chair, I just want to point out that the companies \nthat the gentleman has identified ought to obey the Fair Labor \nStandards Act. Every company that does business with the United States \nGovernment ought to pay its workers fairly.\n  Federal contracts are lucrative, and Federal contracts make people \nrich. At the very least, those companies and those individuals who \nbenefit from those contracts ought to make sure that their workers get \npaid properly.\n  The fact of the matter is that this is an appropriation from this \nyear. It doesn't bar them in the future from applying for Federal \ncontracts again, and if they should prove to have really cleaned up \ntheir acts, we can have a conversation about that.\n  I am afraid, Madam Chair, that if we do not pass this amendment, we \nwill be telling all of the honest, hard-working contractors that you \ndon't need to obey the law, that you can just do whatever.\n  Companies that don't obey the Fair Labor Standards Act and steal \nworkers' wages actually gain a competitive advantage on the companies \nthat do obey the law. I don't think that is anything that any one of us \nwould like to see happen, so I would urge a ``yes'' vote on this; say \n``no'' to wage theft.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chairman, I want to reiterate, the way the \ngentleman's amendment is drafted, any violation anywhere, anytime in \nthe history of the company would bar them from ever doing business with \nthe Federal Government. It is if they ever made a mistake anywhere in \nthe past.\n  The amendment is far too broad and far too sweeping, and I urge \nMembers to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mrs. Black\n\n  Mrs. BLACK. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to require, pursuant to section 478.124 of title 27, \n     or section 25.7 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, or \n     the Office of Management and Budget Statistical Policy \n     Directive No. 15, Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal \n     Statistics and Administrative Reporting, that any person \n     disclose the race or ethnicity of the person in connection \n     with the transfer of a firearm to the person.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.\n  Mrs. BLACK. Madam Chairman, our Founding Fathers did not mince words \nwhen they authored the Second Amendment to our Constitution.\n  They spoke plainly and with conviction in writing, ``the right of the \npeople to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.'' Unfortunately, \nthis administration hasn't always seen it that way.\n  Recently, President Obama's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives enacted a quiet change to its form 4473--a mandatory \ndocument for most gun transactions--that requires Americans to disclose \ntheir race and ethnicity in order to complete the sale. What is more, \nthe failure to collect this information is considered an ATF violation \nthat could result in government penalties for the gun dealer.\n  By placing an extra barrier of complexity between the law-abiding \ncitizens and their right to own a firearm, I believe this intrusive \nreporting requirement sets up a direct challenge to the Second \nAmendment rights enshrined in our Constitution, not to mention the \nright to privacy.\n  Madam Chairman, we all want to see weapons kept out of the hands of \ncriminals, but an individual's race and ethnicity has nothing to do \nwith his ability to safely own and operate a firearm. Perhaps that is \nwhy even traditionally left-leaning groups like the ACLU have spoken in \nopposition to this requirement.\n  The fact is the government should be colorblind on all of our rights, \nwhether it is the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, or the \nfreedom to keep and bear arms. That is why my amendment states that the \ngovernment cannot require gun buyers to disclose their race and \nethnicity at the point of sale. It is really that simple.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this commonsense amendment so \nthat we can reverse this latest regulatory overreach and ensure that \nfairness and privacy are upheld in our Nation's gun laws.\n  Madam Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe), my lead cosponsor and an ardent defender of the Second \nAmendment.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank Congresswoman Black for this amendment and \nfor bringing it to the attention of the House tonight.\n  Madam Chair, this issue came to my attention a couple of years ago \nwhen I was with constituents in my district. They were gun dealers, and \nthey were complaining and telling me how the administration quietly \nbegan requiring the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives--we call it the ATF--to record a firearms purchaser's race \nand ethnicity.\n  This, Madam Chair, is not law. It is not congressional action. We did \nnot do this. The ATF, through administration rules, requires the race \nof the gun purchaser, and the seller who is selling the gun has got to \ncheck the box and write the race of the gun purchaser.\n\n                              {time}  2350\n\n  If they do not do that or they do it wrong, the ATF can come back \nlater, look at the records, say ``You left it blank on the race of the \nindividual,'' and shut the business down.\n  Now, there are several problems with this new rule by the ATF. In \norder to avoid breaking this Federal regulation, the dealers then have \nto ask the customers their race, and when people are offended--and they \nget offended--they take it out on the dealers themselves. Sometimes \nrefuse to give their race, and then what is the gun seller to do? Why \nis our government racial profiling people who exercise the Second \nAmendment? Why are they doing that?\n  Second, it is none of the government's business the race of a \ngunowner. The Second Amendment does not just apply to certain races. It \napplies to everybody. It doesn't exclude races and only include certain \nraces. As the gentlewoman from Tennessee has said, the Federal \nGovernment ought to be colorblind across the board on every issue, \nespecially when it comes to rights. The Second Amendment applies to \neverybody regardless of their race, just like the First Amendment \napplies to everybody regardless of their race.\n  So this amendment would simply tell the Federal Government, it is \nnone of your business the race of a gun purchaser in the United States. \nStay out of that issue. Just as equally important, you can't shut some \nbusiness down if they don't put the right race or they leave the race \nblock blank. That is none of the Federal Government's business.\n  I would hope that Members of Congress would support this amendment \nand keep the Federal Government from requiring racial profiling in the \npurchase of guns under the Second Amendment.\n  Mrs. BLACK. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I claim the time in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Before we finish with this, you will be able to have a \nweapon,\n\n[[Page H3740]]\n\nyou will be able to suppress the sound on it, and you won't have to \nidentify yourself by these characteristics that are attacked in this \namendment, but I want to just kind of set the facts straight.\n  First of all, this information has been required since 1968. I know \npeople are excited about it tonight, I know there is a lot of \nenthusiasm about ridding the Nation of having this information, but \nsince the Gun Control Act of 1968, prospective firearm purchasers have \nbeen required to record their race.\n  Now, sometimes, you know, we hear in law enforcement people trying to \nbe politically correct and say, well, we don't want you to be too \ndescriptive of a suspect in a crime, identifying them by race or \nsomething, but, you know, the reason why we have this information has \nnothing to do with prohibiting people's Second Amendment rights. This \nis about how to track down someone who has done something wrong, who \nwas the original purchaser of the gun that was used in a crime.\n  The information is not held by the Federal Government, \nnotwithstanding the excitement on the House floor tonight. It is held \nby the dealer. It is not centralized in any way, but it is a law \nenforcement data point. Sometimes we actually need data, we need \ninformation so that if something has been done with a gun that is \nunlawful, somebody can figure out who purchased it; and you can also \nclarify who these people are, if they have similar names, similar \nbackgrounds, or whatever may be the case.\n  So it is just basic information that any law enforcement person would \nwant to have, the race and ethnic background of the owner of the weapon \nthat was used in a neighborhood near you to harm one of the people whom \nyou have been elected to represent, and to decide tonight, well, what \nwe want to do is strip this information away under some pretense. What \nwe just heard was an argument that somehow someone was trying to say \nthat the Second Amendment discriminated against somebody on a racial \nbasis, and of course anyone can win that straw argument because it is \nnonsensical. No one is arguing that.\n  We are talking about basic information that is needed for law \nenforcement purposes that the majority tonight wants to deny from the \nATF. That is something that I would hope the majority wouldn't do, but \nthey obviously have the votes to do as they please. I will be against \nit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Richmond\n\n  Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  The amounts otherwise provided by this Act are \n     revised by reducing the aggregate amount made available for \n     ``Federal Prison System--Salaries and Expenses'', and by \n     increasing the amount made available for ``Office of Justice \n     Programs--Juvenile Justice Programs'' for youth mentoring \n     grants, by $155,900,000.\n\n  Mr. RICHMOND (during the reading). Madam Chair, I ask unanimous \nconsent to dispense with the reading of the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Louisiana?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, which amendment is the gentleman \noffering?\n  Mr. RICHMOND. I only have one amendment, and it is the amendment to \nmove $155 million from the Bureau of Prisons over to the Juvenile \nJustice program.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will continue to read the amendment.\n  The Clerk continued to read.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, I reserve a point of order against the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman from Louisiana and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.\n  Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Chair, I rise today to talk about something that \nI would hope is important to both sides of the aisle, and that is our \nyouth. Here in Congress we talk about how important a lot of things \nare: education, public safety, strong communities, freedom, and \nprosperity. If we have a goal of keeping our children in school and on \nthe path to success, cutting Juvenile Justice programs is the wrong way \nto go in order to reach it.\n  We know that supporting programs that keep our children out of jail \nis one of the best investments we can make, and it gives us one of our \nhighest returns on our investment.\n  On any given day in this country, there are over 70,000 juveniles in \njail around the country. This incarceration is not cheap. We spend \nabout $6 billion a year on juveniles in prison. Interactions with the \ncriminal justice system at a young age have a ripple effect that makes \nit harder for children to achieve success later.\n  Students who are arrested early in high school are six to eight times \nmore likely to drop out of high school. What is more, children who are \nincarcerated are almost 40 percent less likely to graduate from high \nschool and 40 percent more likely to be in prison at the age of 25. \nFinally, if someone with an arrest record as a juvenile does graduate \nhigh school, they are still only half as likely to enroll in a 4-year \ncollege.\n  In short, keeping our children out of jail has benefits to the \nchildren, their families, our communities, and to the Nation as a \nwhole. This President realized all of this when he made his budget \nrequest. That is why he requested more than $300 million for a variety \nof authorized programs aimed at improving public safety and keeping \nchildren on the path to college and careers instead of the path to \nprison.\n  Unfortunately, the bill in front of us calls for devastating cuts to \nthese vital programs. The funding level in the bill is more than $155 \nmillion below the President's request, and even $68 million below last \nyear's funding level.\n  My amendment today would simply bring the funding for Juvenile \nJustice back in line with the President's request by funding one of the \nonly programs left available in the bill, and that is mentoring. By \nincreasing the role and capacity for mentoring programs across the \nNation, we can have a true impact on children in every community.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  0000\n\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I will assert my point of order against \nthe amendment, depending on what the gentleman intends to do.\n  Does the gentleman intend to withdraw the amendment?\n  Mr. RICHMOND. I would like to know what the point of order is. I am \njust shifting money from one thing that is already in the budget to \nsomething that is already in the budget.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. CULBERSON. The amendment is subject to a point of order on the \nbasis that it proposes to increase an appropriation not authorized by \nlaw, Mr. Chairman, and, therefore, is in violation of clause 2(a) of \nrule XXI.\n  Although the original account funding for the Office of Juvenile \nJustice contains a number of programs that are unauthorized, it was \npermitted to remain in the bill pursuant to the provisions of the rule \nthat provided for the consideration of this bill.\n  When an unauthorized appropriation is permitted to remain in a \ngeneral appropriations bill, an amendment merely changing the amount is \nin order, but the rules of the House apply a ``merely perfecting \nstandard'' to the items permitted to remain, and do not allow the \ninsertion of a new paragraph that was not part of the original text \npermitted to remain to increase a figure that was permitted to remain.\n  This amendment proposes to add funding as a reach-back to an \nunauthorized program, and the amendment, therefore, cannot be construed \nas merely perfecting.\n  And therefore, Mr. Chairman, I ask that the Chair rule the amendment \nout of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Stivers). Does any other Member wish to be \nheard on the point of order?\n  Mr. FATTAH. I understand the spirit of the chairman's statement. I \njust\n\n[[Page H3741]]\n\nwant to comment that one of the things that we have done is we have \nworked over a number of years and doubled the amount of money going \ninto youth mentoring.\n  I think that the chairman and I agree with the spirit of your \namendment and that it is a much more worthy investment for the country \nto keep our young people on the straight and narrow than to try to \nrepair, as has been said, a broken adult.\n  We continue to have an interest in building this part of the \nappropriations bill. Notwithstanding the complicated set of rules \nrelative to the authorized and the non-authorized portion, we continue \nto want to work with you as we go forward on this matter.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I want to, if I could, express my support for the \nranking member's comments, but I do need to assert the point of order.\n  Mr. RICHMOND. If the gentleman does not assert the point of order \nnow, then what I will do is just wrap up and ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw my amendment.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. If the gentleman withdraws the amendment, I withdraw \nmy point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does the gentleman seek to withdraw the amendment?\n  Mr. RICHMOND. I was going to close and use the remaining time and \nthen withdraw the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is currently pending.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I reserve my point of order. Once the gentleman \nwithdraws, I will withdraw the point of order, but we do need to \nconclude this. We will work together with Mr. Fattah on juvenile \njustice to keep young people out of prison.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does the gentleman withdraw the point of order?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I reserve the point of order. I will withdraw its \nassertion at this time, but I reserve it pending the gentleman's \nconclusion and withdrawal of the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman's earlier point of order is \nwithdrawn. A point of order is now reserved.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.\n  Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Chairman, I would just say I started coaching \nLittle League at 16, and I continue to do that today, and I continue \nalso to mentor.\n  I would just say that as we look at the budget and we try to do \nthings to bring the budget back into balance, we keep leaving out the \npoint of return on investment. And if we continue to invest in things \nthat are going to give us more than a one-to-one return, then we are \nactually gaining a benefit that will allow us to cut down the deficit.\n  And then I would just quickly add in the spirit of bipartisanship and \nworking together that it is almost like the field of dreams for the \nBureau of Prisons. If you appropriate it, they will spend it. And if \nthey build it, they will fill it. We don't want to do that when we have \na greater avenue, I think, to put our youth on a better path and not \nonly save money, but create less victims of crime.\n  So with that, I would just remind all of our Members that I hope we \ncontinue to work together. And we should really be careful here because \nthe life you save may be your own.\n  I thank the chairman for his cooperation, and I ask unanimous consent \nto withdraw the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Louisiana?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Meadows\n\n  Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. _.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to negotiate or enter into a trade agreement that \n     establishes a limit on greenhouse gas emissions for the \n     United States. The limitation described in this section shall \n     not apply in the case of the administration of a tax or \n     tariff.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. MEADOWS. My amendment would prohibit the administration from \nusing any funds from this bill to advocate or support a position in \ntrade negotiations or enter into a trade agreement that would limit \ngreenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Basically, the amendment \nwould prohibit the Obama administration from trying to address \n``climate change'' through trade agreements.\n  The last few years, we have seen the administration intentionally \nwork around Congress to implement its own agenda.\n  Mr. Chairman, the hour is late. There are many worthwhile amendments \nthat need to be debated and heard, and with that, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I am not sure this is the right place to be imposing on \ntrade agreements. We would be opposed to this. We won't be seeking a \nrecorded vote, but we would be opposed to this.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Culberson), the chairman of the \nAppropriations subcommittee, who has done great work.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I strongly support this amendment. It is important \nthat these trade agreements not be negotiated in ways that would \nsupersede the authority of this Congress. Any limitation on greenhouse \ngases should be debated in this Congress and enacted by Congress and \nshould not be any part of any trade agreement.\n  So I strongly support the gentleman's amendment in the same spirit \nthat we have got language in this bill that prohibits use of funds to \nnegotiate or to implement the U.N. arms control treaty, which would \ninterfere with our Second Amendment rights. We have prohibited that. We \nhave shut down the U.N. arms control treaty in this bill. Similarly, \nlet's shut down any attempt to impose greenhouse gas limits on the \nUnited States through a trade agreement.\n  I strongly support the gentleman's amendment and urge Members to vote \n``yes.''\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I urge support, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  June 2, 2015, on page H3741, the following appeared: The \namendment was agreed to. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. GRAYSON\n  \n  The online version should be corrected to read: The amendment \nwas agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. \nAMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. GRAYSON\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Grayson\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), add the \n     following new section:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to enter into a contract with any offeror or any of \n     its principals if the offeror certifies, as required by \n     Federal Acquisition Regulation, that the offeror or any of \n     its principals:\n       (A) within a three-year period preceding this offer has \n     been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against it \n     for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection \n     with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public \n     (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation \n     of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the \n     submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, \n     forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, \n     making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal \n     criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; or\n       (B) are presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or \n     civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of \n     any of the offenses enumerated above in subsection (A); or\n       (C) within a three-year period preceding this offer, has \n     been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount \n     that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains \n     unsatisfied.\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the reading be waived.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n\n[[Page H3742]]\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is identical to other \namendments that have been inserted by voice vote into every \nappropriations bill considered under an open rule this year and in the \nlast Congress as well.\n  My amendment expands the list of parties with whom the Federal \nGovernment is prohibited from contracting due to serious misconduct on \nthe part of the contractors. Specifically, the list would include \ncontractors who within a 3-year period preceding an offer have been \nconvicted or have had a civil judgment rendered against them for fraud, \nviolation of Federal or state antitrust laws, embezzlement, theft, \nforgery, bribery, violation of Federal tax laws, and other items \noutlined in section 52.209-5 of title 48 of the Code of Federal \nRegulations.\n\n                              {time}  0010\n\n  These are all offenses which any contractor doing business with the \nFederal Government must disclose to a contracting officer, but oddly \nenough, the contracting officer would then be free to ignore these \ntransgressions and award contracts to offending entities, absent my \namendment.\n  I commend the authors of this bill for their inclusion of section \n523. I still believe, however, that we can improve on this bill by \nprohibiting agencies from contracting with those entities who have \nengaged in the activities described above.\n  It is my hope that this amendment will be noncontroversial, as it has \nbeen on every previous occasion and again be passed unanimously by the \nHouse.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I am \nnot opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I am not opposed to the amendment. I am prepared to \naccept the amendment and support it, and I thank the gentleman for \noffering it.\n  I speak even for the chairman in this matter. We are ready to rock \nand roll, so we accept the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Hudson\n\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to treat any M855 (5.56 mm x 45 mm) or SS109 type \n     ammunition as armor piercing ammunition for purposes of \n     chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, first and foremost, I want to voice my \nstrong opposition to the Obama administration's continued assaults on \nour Second Amendment rights.\n  I ran for Congress to stand up against this overreach and to keep \nWashington bureaucrats' influence out of our lives and their hands off \nour freedoms and their hand off our guns. That is why I am offering an \namendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill that \nwould stop President Obama's green tip ammo ban.\n  As you recall, the ATF recently tried to ban common rifle ammunition \nthat has been legally used by law-abiding American sportsmen for \ndecades. It was only after receiving intense pressure from Congress and \nmore than 80,000 public comments and, frankly, the direct intervention \nof Chairman Culberson that the administration stalled their proposed \nban.\n  As the clock ticks down on this President's second term, the \nadministration is cooking up more than a dozen gun control regulations \nand has left the door open to reconsider future ammo bans.\n  This determination to unconstitutionally restrict one of our most \nfundamental rights and--I would argue--our first freedom has nothing to \ndo with safety or security and everything to do with government \ncontrol.\n  My amendment, previously introduced as a stand-alone bill by my good \nfriend and colleague, Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry, from North \nCarolina, would put an end to this attack on our Second Amendment \nrights by ensuring this popular ammunition remains available and not \nsubject to any future ATF bans.\n  Mr. Chairman, like many of my constituents from North Carolina, I \nlike to spend time outdoors in a deer stand, in a field, or at the \nrange. I will not stand idly by and allow a unilateral executive fiat \nto threaten our right to enjoy this cherished American tradition.\n  The Second Amendment is not about hunting or shooting sports. Our \nright to keep and bear arms is a right that ensures our ability to \nprotect all of rights. That is why I refer to it as our first freedom. \nThis fundamental freedom must be defended and protected.\n  For that reason, I encourage my colleagues in the House to support \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to my colleague \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to stand with my colleague from \nNorth Carolina in support of this amendment. In the eyes of our \nFounding Fathers, the right to bear arms was just as fundamental as the \nfreedom of speech. The Second Amendment ensures our right, as law-\nabiding American citizens, to bear arms to protect ourselves from \nenemies, both foreign and domestic.\n  It is no secret that our Second Amendment rights have been threatened \nby the government bureaucrats in the Obama administration. Earlier this \nyear, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives doubled \ndown on attempting to ban lead projectiles, as they claim the \nammunition is armor piercing.\n  They proposed a ban on the manufacturing and sale of certain AR-15 \nammunition that could have drastically reduced the availability of \nammunition commonly used for sporting and other legitimate purposes.\n  Because of the strong objections from gunowners and constitutional \nconservatives across the country, ATF decided to table their proposal, \nat least for now.\n  Mr. Chairman, our constitutional rights should not be left up to the \nwhims of Federal bureaucrats in Washington. This amendment simply \nensures that Federal funds cannot be used to ban certain types of \ncommonly used ammunition, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. They must have some special kind of deer in North \nCarolina. They are running around in the woods with bulletproof vests \non.\n  The idea that a sportsman needs an armor-piercing bullet to go after \na deer, I mean, I don't really buy it; but if the majority is willing \nto buy it at this hour of the night, it is fine with me.\n  On a serious note, for those who are in law enforcement, who are out \nin dark alleys, and who have to confront circumstances that they don't \nknow the exact dangers that they are going to face, the fact that we \nwant to have weapons that suppress the sound--now, we want to have \nbullets that can pierce armor and that we want to make sure that are \nunder the guise of the Second Amendment, that you can have all manner \nof armament, without any type of reasonable speed bumps that might \nprotect the American public is something that I am not sure that the \nmajority would want to take such an enthusiastic effort around.\n  Obviously, they do, and they have decided that this bill is the bill \nfor it, that this bill is the place where they want to do this \nactivity, right?\n  I think it is unfortunate. As for me and for my side, we will be in \nopposition, and we will let the majority work its will.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from North Carolina has 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining, and the gentleman from Pennsylvania has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n\n[[Page H3743]]\n\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague's rhetorical \nquestion. Mr. Chairman, I would just say that the point is a 5.56 green \ntip bullet is not an armor-piercing bullet. The only reason it has been \ncalled an armor-piercing bullet is because of a loophole, and that is \nmy point.\n  We have an administration that has just put out a whole list of \nregulations that say they want to restrict the rights of people because \nthey may or may not have a mental illness. They want a whole list, a \nwhole range of regulations that they would like to roll out in the \nfinal days of this administration to limit, to infringe upon our Second \nAmendment rights. What I am saying is we are not going to stand for \nthat.\n  The bullet, the round that I am talking about is not an armor-\npiercing round; it has never been defined as an armor-piercing round, \nbut because of a loophole, this administration tried to ban it as such.\n  Having said that, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Culberson), the chairman.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I want to express my very strong support for the \ngentleman's amendment. The gentleman's amendment is necessary because \nthe ATF did come out with a very broad legal framework within which \nthey were attempting to ban not only 223 ammunition, but potentially \nwhole other categories of ammunition, and that is just not what the \nstatute was intended to prevent.\n  The statute was intended to prevent specific types of armor-piercing \nbullets from being used in pistols. The ATF was taking that far beyond \nthe statute. It was necessary for--as new committee subcommittee \nchairman, I was able to step in and persuade the ATF to drop their ammo \nban.\n  Mr. Hudson's amendment is necessary to make sure it doesn't happen \nagain in the future, and I urge Members to support his amendment in the \nstrongest possible terms to defend our Second Amendment rights.\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  0020\n\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would just hope that none of my good friends on the \nother side decide to test this theory about whether or not it can \npierce armor, that you don't take the rhetoric to an extreme here. It \nis a fact that there is some concern about what this means for law \nenforcement. I know that the majority would want to be seen, and I \nthink truly is, in support of law enforcement.\n  Why would we want to put this type of ammunition in guns that we want \nto suppress the sound on, in which we want less information about the \npurchaser, at a time like this in our Nation I don't actually \nunderstand. But there is obviously some thread that runs through the \nother team over here that suggests that this is the time for them to \nproceed along this line. I think that the American public will have to \nmake whatever judgment they want to make about that.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n              Amendment Offered by Mr. Collins of Georgia\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title) insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to provide assistance to a State, or political \n     subdivision of a State, that has in effect any law, policy, \n     or procedure in contravention of immigration laws (as defined \n     in section 101(a)(17) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(17))).\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask \nunanimous consent to dispense with the reading.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I support the gentleman's amendment, and \nI withdraw the point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The point of order is withdrawn.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman from Georgia and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today with basically a \ncommonsense amendment on H.R. 2578. I appreciate the hard work that \nChairman Culberson, Ranking Member Fattah, and other members of the \nAppropriations Committee have put into this bill.\n  This bill contains many important provisions to protect law-abiding \nAmericans and public safety while spending responsibly; however, I want \nto make it absolutely clear that no funds appropriated under this bill \nare used to assist States and localities whose laws and policies are in \ndirect contradiction to Federal immigration law and enforcement \nefforts. My amendment does just that. It ensures that we do not reward \nState and local governments with Federal funds when they ignore the \nrule of law.\n  State and local jurisdictions are implementing policies that directly \ncontradict U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's statutorily \nmandated mission to identify and remove illegal aliens who are \ncurrently incarcerated. At this point, we even have seen some local \nsheriffs who choose to follow Federal law and honor ICE detainers \nslapped with lawsuits for cooperating, for following the law.\n  I know we are late. I know there is some discussion about this, but \nreally this is simple.\n  Hard-working taxpayers should not have to sit idly by and watch their \ntax dollars go to localities that choose to encourage illegal \nimmigration through their nonenforcement policies. My amendment sends a \nclear message that, if localities implement policies in contradiction \nto Federal immigration law, they will not be eligible to receive funds \nunder this act, specifically Federal reimbursement grants under the \nState Criminal Alien Assistance Program.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that was offered and accepted last \nyear. We are offering it again and would ask favorable consideration.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does the gentleman from Pennsylvania continue to \nreserve his point of order?\n  Mr. FATTAH. I would like, at this point, unless there are more \ncomments, to assert the point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania may state his point \nof order.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the \namendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes \nlegislation in an appropriations bill and, therefore, violates clause \n2, rule XXI.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I will at least respond to the \npoint of order.\n  This amendment is not in contradiction of current law. In fact, it \nsimply states that the amendment would not allow funds to be used in \nsupport of holding up law as it is currently written. This is not a law \nthat is written to circumvent current law. In fact, all it says is that \nStates and localities who receive the money will actually support \ncurrent law. So I am not sure what the point of order is actually \ntrying to say.\n  This was put in last year. It was approved. I understand. I \nappreciate the gentleman's concern. But, basically, we are saying if \nyou enforce the law as it is written, which is all we are asking, then \nthe grant is there. If you choose not to enforce Federal law, then that \nis money that will be withheld.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does the gentleman from Georgia wish to withdraw \nhis amendment?\n\n[[Page H3744]]\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Not at this point.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, we will respect the ruling of the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  The gentleman from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to reiterate that I agree \nwith the gentleman from Georgia. This does not change existing law. It \nsimply states that if you expect to receive Federal money, you need to \nbe in compliance with Federal law. It is pretty straight up.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The Chair finds that this amendment includes language requiring a new \ndetermination as to the status of local law.\n  The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of \nclause 2 of rule XXI. The point of order is sustained, and the \namendment is not in order.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Grayson\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Sec. __. None of the finds made available by this Act may \n     be used to negotiate or enter into a trade agreement whose \n     negotiating texts are confidential. The limitation described \n     in this section shall not apply in the case of the \n     administration of a tax or tariff.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is akin to an amendment \nthat was considered just a few moments ago offered by Mr. Meadows. This \namendment is meant to address a problem that has arisen with trade \nagreements that has become visible to all of us as Members of this \naugust body.\n  What has happened is that the Trade Representative, for no apparent \nlegal reason, with no apparent legal authority, has taken it upon \nhimself to negotiate trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership in secret--not entirely in secret, just in secret from us \nand from members of the American public.\n  The corresponding provision, the TTIP provision, has been posted by \nthe European Union, which is our negotiating partner in this on the \nInternet.\n  The Trans-Pacific Partnership itself has been negotiated in secret, \nbut that has been posted by WikiLeaks, to the embarrassment of our \ngovernment in an unnecessary manner.\n  What we have seen over the past several years is that the Trade \nRepresentative has turned a deaf ear to our concerns as Members of \nCongress who must perform our oversight functions whenever we ask for \ninformation about what the Trade Representative is doing on behalf of \nthe American people.\n  Three years ago, we had the strange circumstance come up that over \n100 Members of Congress, 100 Members of this body, wrote a letter to \nthe Trade Representative saying: We hear you are negotiating something \ncalled the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Would you please give us a copy?\n  And the answer came back: No. We are not going to give you a copy.\n  For the past 5 years, the Trans-Pacific Partnership has been \nnegotiated in secret. Only in the last few months, Members of Congress \nhave been able to see it under the most extreme conditions imaginable. \nI was actually the first person to be able to see it, and the Trade \nRepresentative came to my office with his staff and offered to show it \nto me, but I couldn't take any notes.\n\n                              {time}  0030\n\n  I couldn't discuss it with my own staff. I couldn't even discuss it \nwith other Members of this body. And of course I couldn't make copies \nor otherwise help myself to record what I had seen, much less speak to \nmy constituents about it, much less speak to the media about it, much \nless speak to the public about it.\n  Respectfully, secret laws are un-American laws; secret agreements are \nun-American agreements. There is no such thing recognized under our \nConstitution as a ``secret statute'' or a ``secret treaty.'' But that \nis, in effect, what we have been experiencing without any legal \nauthority whatsoever on behalf of the Trade Representative.\n  Now, I am not saying the Trade Representative needs to stop \nnegotiating these agreements; not at all. What I am suggesting is that \nwe lift the veil of secrecy that has been dropped over these \nnegotiations so that we can't see them, the American people can't see \nthem, but foreign governments can see them.\n  Why is it that we have confidentiality? Why is it that we have a \nclassified information system? Generally speaking, it is not to keep \nAmericans from seeing this information; it is to keep foreigners from \nseeing this information. And here the world has been turned upside \ndown, and we have a situation where foreigners get to see it, but even \nthe highest members of our own government--our Senators, our \nCongressmen--we don't get to see it. That is absolutely unacceptable; \nit is un-American.\n  The only way to come up with agreements that satisfy the needs of \nthis country is through an open, fair, transparent process. That is \nwhat this simple amendment will accomplish. It says: None of the funds \nmade available in this act, which includes funds made to the Trade \nRepresentative, may be used to negotiate or enter into a trade \nagreement whose negotiating texts are confidential.\n  It is time for a little sunlight. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. \nIt is time for the Members of this body to take control of our \nconstitutional responsibilities, not to let the Trade Representative or \nany member of the executive branch tell us to stuff it when we need to \nfind out things in order to be able to do our jobs properly.\n  Wouldn't it be a better system if we were able to tell a trade \nrepresentative what we think, what our constituents think, what the \nmembers of the American public think about these documents before they \nare simply dropped on us?\n  This is a simple commonsense amendment. There is no existing legal \nauthority that allows the Trade Representative to do what he has been \ndoing. I say the time is up and we should insist that these agreements, \nwhich will determine the course of economic history in America for the \nnext 20 or 30 years, are agreements that are negotiated in public with \nour approval and with our input.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Florida I know has \nworked in the past as an attorney and represented clients and \nundoubtedly has settled cases before. And those settlement agreements, \nthose negotiations, when you were designing those agreements, Mr. \nGrayson, I know were not something that you wanted to disclose. You \nwanted to negotiate those settlements in private with your client \nconfidentially, because had the world seen what you were working out, \nthat would have damaged your client's ability to negotiate a fair \nsettlement with the other party in the case.\n  As here, with trade promotion authority, the countries with which the \nTrade Representative is negotiating, Japan, for example, I doubt the \nJapanese want the Australians to see what the Japanese are agreeing to. \nThat is just common sense. I doubt that the Koreans want the Japanese \nto see what the Koreans are attempting to agree to.\n  So it is perfectly understandable that the agreement itself would be \nconfidential until it is finalized. Members of Congress can go see the \nagreement, but the Korean-American Trade Agreement is going to be \nconfidential until it is finally settled because Korea doesn't want \nJapan or Australia or Vietnam to see what they are negotiating, in the \nsame way you did not want your clients, the agreement you were \nattempting to negotiate on behalf of your client, you didn't want to do \nthat in the open sunshine. Sunshine is a good thing, but there are \ntimes when a negotiation like this on a trade agreement is just common \nsense. You are not going to want the other countries that you are \ncompeting against to see what kind of a deal you are fixing to work out \nwith the United States.\n\n[[Page H3745]]\n\n  The Members of Congress can see it, of course, as we should, and the \nagreement itself must be available to the public to view 90 days before \nthe President can even sign the agreement, and the Congress is going to \nhave this debate. In fact, I understand that this trade promotion \nauthority agreement that is under discussion, the new law that Congress \nis proposing, would for the first time give either House of Congress a \nveto over the agreement with a majority vote. So the House could decide \non our own to veto a particular trade agreement by majority vote; the \nSenate could veto a trade agreement by majority vote.\n\n  The only part of the deal so far that is confidential is the ongoing \nnegotiation, which is exactly the way you handled and protected your \nclient's best interest as an attorney. I am quite confident as an \nattorney you handled your client's litigation in a way that was \nprofessional and confidential, and I imagine you never disclosed a \npending settlement agreement that was being negotiated, you never \nreleased that publicly, did you ever, Mr. Grayson?\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Is the gentleman yielding to me?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Did you ever release a negotiated settlement agreement \nto the public before it was finalized?\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Is the gentleman yielding to me?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. No. Answer my question, yes or no.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Well, I can't answer your question unless you are going \nto yield to me.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. That is why I am asking a question. I am asking you, \ndid you ever release the terms of a settlement agreement you were \nnegotiating before it was final?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas controls the time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Yes. And I am asking a question.\n  I was an attorney myself. I defended businesses in civil litigation, \nand any settlement agreement that we worked on was done confidentially. \nAnd I would ask Mr. Grayson, did you ever disclose a confidential \nsettlement negotiation publicly when you were negotiating on behalf of \nyour client?\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Is the gentleman yielding the balance of his time to me?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. No, I am not yielding the balance of my time. I am \njust asking a question.\n  I am quite confident Mr. Grayson always kept those negotiations \nsecret. That is all that is being kept secret here. And it is actually \nnot secret because Members of Congress can go read the text of the \ntrade agreement that is being negotiated. And if any of us have any \nsort of an objection, that is a good time to raise it, to tell the \nTrade Representative that we think this or that provision is going to \neither be in violation of Federal law or cause a problem for American \nindustry and we think you ought to drop it.\n  So you have actually got an opportunity to have your 2 cents' worth \nheard during the course of the negotiation. So I would urge Members to \noppose Mr. Grayson's amendment for the same reason that Mr. Grayson \nalways kept his settlement negotiations confidential on behalf of his \nclients.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida has 15 seconds \nremaining. The gentleman from Texas has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent for another minute \nbeyond my 15 seconds.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I object. We are limited to 5 minutes and it is 12:30 \nat night.\n  The Acting CHAIR. There is an objection. The gentleman has 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. First of all, I represent the American public here, not \nthe American private. When I was an attorney, I represented private \ninterest, just as you did. Now I represent the public. The reason we \nrefer to the American public as the public is because the public's \nbusiness needs to be public. That means no secret negotiations, no \nsecret acts, no secret agreements, nothing but the public interest in \npublic.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I think Mr. Grayson's answer confirms \nthat he did not ever disclose a negotiated settlement before it was \nfinal, and that is just common sense. And here, under trade promotion \nauthority, the trade agreement, as it is being negotiated, needs to be \nkept confidential. But any Member of Congress can go in and see it and \nhave our voices heard, object, suggest changes to it, as it is being \nnegotiated. And then once it is finalized the text must be made \navailable to the public 90 days before the President signs the \nagreement, and then either House of Congress can void the agreement by \na majority vote. We are going to have this debate, and I urge Members \nto oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Rohrabacher\n\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this Act to \n     the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to any of \n     the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, \n     Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, \n     Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, \n     Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, \n     New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North \n     Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, \n     Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and \n     Wisconsin, or with respect to either the District of Columbia \n     or Guam, to prevent any of them from implementing their own \n     laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or \n     cultivation of medical marijuana.\n\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous \nconsent to dispense with the reading of the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n                              {time}  0040\n\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to make a practical as well as a \nprincipled vote. My amendment would prohibit any Federal funds from \nbeing used to supersede State law in those States that have legalized \nthe use of medical marijuana.\n  Let's be clear. The intent of this amendment is to make it illegal \nfor Federal employees to engage in efforts to enforce Federal law that \nmakes the medical use or distribution of medical marijuana illegal in \nStates where the use of marijuana for medical purposes has been made \nlegal.\n  The practical aspect of this vote is based on the realization that, \nat a time of severely limited resources, it makes sense to target \nterrorists, criminals, and other threats to the American people rather \nthan use Federal law enforcement resources to prevent suffering and \nsick people from using a weed that may or may not alleviate their \nsuffering.\n  There are many examples--yes, anecdotal--in which the use of \nmarijuana has helped end severe suffering.\n  Trying to prevent this use of marijuana once it has been legalized by \na State government is a travesty, an inexcusable waste of our limited \nresources. That is the practical reason to vote for my amendment.\n  As for the principle, we Republicans claim to base our decisions on \nindividual freedom, on states' rights as mandated by the 10th Amendment \nto the Constitution, and especially on the doctor-patient relationship.\n  Don't bother to use rhetoric about those principles on other issues \nif you vote for the Federal Government to supersede individual rights, \nstates' rights, and the doctor-patient relationship when it comes to \nmarijuana.\n\n[[Page H3746]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. I yield myself 10 seconds.\n  Stop this waste of limited Federal law enforcement resources. Stop \nthe roughshod use of the Federal bureaucracy from busting down doors to \nprevent sick people from using a substance that his or her doctor \nbelieves might alleviate his or her pain.\n  Vote for the Rohrabacher amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Louisiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  First of all, I hear constantly of this idea about individual rights, \nabout the 10th Amendment, et cetera. This was all settled back in 2005 \nin the Supreme Court with Gonzales v. Raich, which was a 6-3 victory in \nfavor of the government's having preemptive rights when it comes to the \ndrug laws, the CSA. That has been settled. We can claim this over and \nover again, but bring it back to the Court and see if you can change \nthat.\n  Now, how is this affecting us in real life? It is now legal in \nColorado, but Nebraska and Oklahoma are now suing Colorado. Why? It is \nbecause of all of the problems that are developing across the State \nborders--again, interstate commerce, a big problem.\n  Let's talk about the huge problem that marijuana represents. First of \nall, it has no accepted medical use.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. FLEMING. I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.\n  There are synthetic marijuana equivalents that are useful--yes, \nindeed--but the drug itself, which is the smokeable part of it, is not \nsafe and has not been accepted.\n  Here is the thing. It is known to have brain development alterations; \nschizophrenia and other forms of mental illness, psychosis; heart \ncomplications; and an increased risk of stroke.\n  A study recently found that even casual users experience severe brain \nabnormalities found on MRIs and that pot smoking leads to the loss of \nambition; to lower IQs; and that it impairs attention, judgment, \nmemory, and many other things.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Farr).\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, Congress needs to represent the States that \nthey were elected in. It is time that we represent them here in the \nUnited States Congress to allow medical marijuana laws in those States \nthat have been approved by the voters and approved by their \nlegislatures--39 States, the District of Columbia, and Guam. That is 41 \ntotal, the majority of the American population. It is a states' rights \nissue.\n  Support this amendment.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Louisiana has 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from California has 2\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte).\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, the supporters of this amendment claim \nthat this is a states' rights issue. However, it is not that simple, \nnot hardly. Drug manufacture and use is inherently an interstate \nproblem.\n  For example, we need look no further than at one of the two States \nwhere marijuana has been legalized. The Colorado Department of Revenue \nhas reported that 45 percent of marijuana sales in the State were to \nout-of-State ID holders.\n  Indeed, earlier this year, Colorado Governor Hickenlooper said, ``If \nI could've waved a wand the day after the election, I would have \nreversed the election and said, `This was a bad idea.' ''\n  In fact, Colorado is now being sued by Nebraska and Oklahoma, which \nclaim Colorado has created a ``dangerous gap'' in the control of \nmarijuana and that marijuana is flowing from Colorado to neighboring \nStates.\n\n  However, Mr. Chairman, of far greater concern to me is the increased \navailability of marijuana to children, which will inevitably result \nfrom a loosening of restrictions on this dangerous drug.\n  Though my colleagues may not like it, marijuana remains a schedule I \nnarcotic because it has a high potential for abuse and no legitimate \nmedical use. In fact, Mr. Chairman, statistics show that 78 percent of \nthe 2.4 million people who began using marijuana last year were aged 12 \nto 20.\n  There is little doubt that this drug poses a significant danger to \nour children, and I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Lee).\n  Ms. LEE. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding and for his \nleadership on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, of course, I rise in support of this bipartisan \namendment.\n  In States with medical marijuana laws, patients now face uncertainty \nregarding their treatment, and small-business owners, who have invested \nmillions in creating jobs and revenue, have no assurances for the \nfuture.\n  It is way past the time for the Justice Department to stop its \nunwarranted persecution of medical marijuana and to put its resources \nwhere they are truly needed. There is no way that Members of Congress \nshould tell people who live in States where these laws have been passed \nthat what their doctors prescribe, which could prevent pain, should not \nbe allowed.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).\n  Mr. COHEN. I appreciate the time, and I appreciate all of the work \nthat Mr. Rohrabacher and Mr. Farr have done, and I am happy to join \nwith them.\n  Mr. Chairman, Justice Brandeis said the States are the laboratories \nof democracy. That is what they are doing here. Some of the arguments \nwe have heard are ``Reefer Madness'' 2015. It is over. One of the \ngentlemen said children are doing marijuana at age 12. That will show \nyou how good the laws are doing right now.\n  If we had more money going into heroin and not marijuana, we could \nstop people from dying, and that is what we should be doing. Tell \nMontel Williams, who has MS, that marijuana doesn't work. Tell cancer \npatients that it doesn't help them with nausea. Tell people that it \ndoesn't work.\n  It works. It helps. It is the States.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, by the way it has been talked about by some \non the other side, to be clear, this amendment does not legalize \nmarijuana. It simply ensures that the Federal Government doesn't waste \nits limited resources in prosecuting men and women who are acting in \ncompliance with State and medical marijuana laws. That is all it does.\n  It is very reasonable that States have enforcement priorities in this \narea, and we want our Federal resources geared towards crime that we \nview as more important. Have them go after the meth lab. Have them go \nafter the heroin ring.\n\n                              {time}  0050\n\n  Colorado has had legal medical marijuana for nearly a decade. Some in \nour State are for it; some are against it. It is our right as a State \nto determine that. That is why I support this amendment.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Nevada \n(Ms. Titus).\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is about standing up for \nstates' rights and protecting businesses, doctors, and patients who are \nacting legally under the medical marijuana laws of some 41 States and \nterritories, including Nevada. Congress needs to catch up with State \nlegislatures, and the Federal Government needs to stop wasting money \nbusting good citizens who are trying to do the right thing.\n  Mr. FLEMING. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chair, who has the right to close?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has the right to \nclose.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. That is correct. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FLEMING. May I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n\n[[Page H3747]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Louisiana has 2 minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from California has 15 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Let me say, first of all, this whole idea of medical \nmarijuana is a big joke. It is an end run around the laws. There are \nmore pot shops in California than there are Starbucks or McDonald's; \nokay?\n  Now, is it really a medical treatment? Well, the AMA says no. The \nAmerican Society of Addiction Medicine says no. Even the American \nGlaucoma Society, which is of course in charge of glaucoma treatment, \nsays that this is not a medical treatment for glaucoma. So there is no \nsingle approved use of marijuana for medical diseases.\n  The whole idea about medical marijuana is to get around the laws on \nlegalization or illegalization of marijuana. But make no mistake about \nit, the most common addiction diagnosis for young people admitted to \ndrug treatment centers is addiction to marijuana. The rate is 9 percent \naddiction rate in adults; it is 17 percent in young people.\n  We all know the studies show very clearly that the States that are \nmore permissive have higher addiction and abuse rates than any others. \nWe also know that NIDA tells us that it is a developmental disease. \nWhat does that mean? It means the younger a child is exposed to it, the \nmore likely that child will later become an addict to something else, \nlike methamphetamine, prescription drugs, heroin. So if you support \nthis, which is really the legalization of marijuana, then you are \nreally supporting allowing our children to be harmed and addicted to \nthis terrible drug.\n  Now, I am all in favor of research, and we are in discussions with \nDEA about allowing it in some way, whether we go to a 1a category to \nallow such research. Some suggest that it may have some benefit for \nseizures. That is yet to be seen. Some suggest that it may be \nbeneficial to those who have spastic muscle disease, but there is \nabsolutely no proof of that.\n  So with that, I urge everyone to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, notwithstanding the doctor's remarks, the \ntruth is that almost no research has been put into marijuana in terms \nof its medical efficacy. You have epilepsy and a whole host.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Will the gentleman yield on that?\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Okay. I am not going to dominate the gentleman's time.\n  This has been under study for over 40 years. My university, the \nUniversity of Mississippi, has been legally growing pot for over 40 \nyears and studying it, so it has been studied.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Reclaiming my time, I know a little bit about this \nsubject. The bottom line is that in terms of its medical viability, in \nterms of epilepsy and a lot of other issues, there is some need for a \nreal study of this, not just about the way that we have proceeded so \nfar. I think that this amendment and what is happening in the States \nshould be allowed to go forward.\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to my colleague from California (Mr. \nRohrabacher) for an opportunity to close on this subject. At that point \nthen I would yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman may not yield blocks of time and must \nremain on his feet.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to Mr. Rohrabacher.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman may not yield blocks of time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield such time as he may consume, as long as he \ndoesn't go over 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. I appreciate that from my colleague.\n  Look, our Founding Fathers didn't want criminal justice to be handled \nby the Federal Government. I don't know what government you want to \nhave in our country, but most of us here don't believe that the Federal \nGovernment--neither did our Founding Fathers--is an all-wise system, \nthat the Federal Government is the only government that has wisdom to \nmake the decisions for the families.\n  This is absolutely absurd to think that the Federal Government is \ngoing to mandate all of these things even though the people of the \nStates and other doctors, many other doctors, would like to have the \nright to prescribe to their patients what they think is going to \nalleviate their suffering. No, we should not get in the way. As I said \nin the first debate, it is sinful for us to try to get in the way \nbetween a doctor and his patient, saying, Oh, no, the Federal \nGovernment knows better.\n  This is a states' rights issue. This is the issue of what our \nFounding Fathers had in mind for this country, where the decisions \nwould be made like this. They didn't want the Federal Government to \nhave a police force that can bust in people's doors. No. They wanted to \nhave individual freedom, personal choice. They want parents to take \ncare of their kids. They didn't want an all-controlling nanny State to \ncontrol our lives. That is what this country was supposed to be all \nabout. I thought that is what Republicans were supposed to be all \nabout, and I hope my Republican colleagues will start reexamining \nwhether or not they believe in the fundamental principles of limited \ngovernment and individual freedom that we have always talked about.\n  So I would ask my colleagues to join me, reaffirm what our Founding \nFathers had in mind, which is freedom, states' rights, limited \ngovernment, and people making choices about their own lives and being \nresponsible for their families and not shoving that off on the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Reclaiming the balance of my time, I think I hear that \necho again about the right to be left alone.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Let me just say this. I just wish you would have \ntalked to the very doctors and people I know that have been suffering, \nand they have gone to their doctor and asked for help, and the doctors \nhave said, ``Yes, medical marijuana will help you''--to believe that \nthe Federal Government can stop that.\n  I have met people whose suffering has been alleviated. Some veterans \nI know have gone through seizure after seizure, and they were only \nhelped by medical marijuana. If we have a heart, if we have our \nbeliefs, let's make sure that we stand for freedom in this vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Grayson\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), add the \n     following new section:\n       Sec.__. None of the funds made available by this Act may be \n     used to compel a person to testify about information or \n     sources that the person states in a motion to quash the \n     subpoena that he has obtained as a journalist or reporter and \n     that he regards as confidential.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, this amendment has nothing to do with \nmedical marijuana. It was passed last year by a vote of this body of \n225-183; in other words, it passed by a majority of 42 votes.\n\n                              {time}  0100\n\n  The purpose of this amendment is to raise the possibility of a \nFederal shield law that corresponds to protections already in place in \n49 States but not at the level of the Federal Government.\n  Again, to be clear about this, 49 States have a Federal shield law. \nThe Federal Government does not--at least up to this point.\n\n[[Page H3748]]\n\n  A shield law is designed to protect a reporter's privilege: the right \nof news reporters to refuse to testify on information and sources of \ninformation obtained during the news gathering and dissemination \nprocess. In short, a reporter should not be forced to reveal his or her \nsources under penalty of imprisonment.\n  This issue has come up in court cases at the Federal level and the \nSupreme Court level, beginning with the 1972 case of Branzburg v. \nHayes. In that case, a reporter wished to inform his readers about the \nnature of the drug hashish, and he realized that the only way to go \nabout that was to actually find and interview people who had actually \nused the drug hashish, so he did that.\n  After he published his article, relying upon two confidential \nsources, he was subpoenaed by the police to provide his sources so that \nthey could be arrested, compromising their identity and compromising \nhis journalistic integrity. So he was forced to choose whether he would \nconceal his sources and go to prison or he would reveal his sources and \nhave them go to prison, simply because he wanted to inform the public \nabout this matter of concern.\n  Some of us may remember the case of Valerie Plame, who was publicly \nidentified as a covert operative. Reporters were continually asked to \nname the sources used in their reporting, and one reporter was jailed \nfor 85 days for refusing to disclose sources in that government probe.\n  At this point, under current law, journalists are in a quandary--an \nunnecessary and unhealthy quandary. They realize that they need to \nprotect their sources, but that right is codified only at the State \nlevel and not yet at the Federal level.\n  So what I am seeking to do, as I did last year with the assistance of \nthis House, is to offer the journalists the protection they should have \nin order to do their jobs properly.\n  Freedom of the press is not just an important principle, but it is \npart of the foundation of American law. The Constitution and the First \nAmendment provide for freedom of speech and of the press. It is \ncompletely incongruous to say that we have freedom of the press, but \nthe Federal Government could nevertheless subpoena sources and put \nreporters in prison if they don't comply.\n  I think that we should have settled this issue years if not decades \nago. We did settle it last year successfully in this body, but we are \nhere today to try to address it once more.\n  Respectfully, I submit this amendment as a much-needed and long \ndelayed clarification that the Federal Government treats the issue of \nfreedom of the press just as respectfully and just as importantly as \nthe great majority of our States do--49 out of 50.\n  I ask for support of this amendment from my esteemed colleague, the \ngentleman from the Seventh District of Texas, and I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. It is \ndrafted far too broadly. And I would point out that in a grand jury \nproceeding--those that occur in the District of Columbia, for example, \nare done under the auspices of the Department of Justice, and that is a \nFederal grand jury proceeding. A journalist would not have the \nprivilege of protecting the confidentiality of his sources because in a \ngrand jury everything that is discussed is absolutely confidential.\n  I also, frankly, think it is astonishing that under Mr. Grayson's \namendment a journalist has the ability to self-certify what is \nconfidential and what is not. I certainly agree with the principle of a \nstrong and free press, but Mr. Grayson's amendment is written far too \nbroadly and, frankly, would not provide protection to a journalist in a \ngrand jury setting. I think he has neglected that problem.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the chair of \nthe Judiciary Committee, to also speak in opposition to this amendment.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee for \njoining me in opposition to this amendment.\n  Shield laws for reporters are not a bad concept at all, but this is \nhardly the way to go about doing it. No State has a law like this \nlanguage here, where it is so vague that virtually anyone in the United \nStates claiming to be a journalist or reporter--and, by the way, \nnowadays, when lots of people maintain blogs or posts on the Internet, \nthey could easily claim to be a journalist or reporter--would be \ncovered by this.\n  So no one intends to have that broad an exception that would allow \nanyone to evade the requirements that they respond to a legitimate \nsubpoena for investigation by law enforcement, a violation of the law.\n  This is far too broad. It is something that clearly should be handled \nby the authorizing committee, the Judiciary Committee, which worked on \nthis for a long period of time and has struggled with that very \ndefinition of journalist or reporter that the gentleman from Florida \nsimply glosses over in this.\n  And then, to give further exception to simply say that that \nindividual who first claims they are a journalist or reporter and then \nsays, Oh, yeah, that is confidential, that would breed criminal \nmisconduct because criminals would be before the court claiming that \nthey were reporters and that they regarded their information as \nconfidential and, therefore, do not have to respond to a subpoena.\n  This is a very harmful, very bad way to go about providing protection \nto legitimate journalists and reporters and should be defeated. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in voting against it.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. This is the same parade of horribles that we heard last \nyear before this body voted in favor of the Grayson amendment. It is \nalmost the same, word for word.\n  Last year, we heard that this somehow would allow people to self-\ncertify. Well, in fact, anybody who self-certifies falsely in front of \na grand jury is looking at a lot more than 83 days in jail. They are \nlooking at 5 years in Federal prison. They would be prosecuted for \nperjury if they claimed to be a journalist and weren't actually a \njournalist--a fact that I pointed out last year before this amendment \nwas actually passed.\n  I also want to point out that there is no distinction between a grand \njury and an actual jury for this purpose. Forty-nine States all agree \nthat there is no distinction whatsoever. So it is simply false to say \nthat this doesn't apply to grand jury proceedings. It certainly would \napply and does apply to all grand jury proceedings at the State level.\n  And there is nothing vague about this provision at all. In fact, the \nwording that has been referred to here, that the information has been \nattained as a journalist or reporter, is exactly the same wording that \nwas in the Grayson amendment last year that passed with a margin of 42 \nvotes.\n  So none of these old attacks, these unsuccessful attacks, are \nanything new and deserve any more credence than they received from a \nmajority of this body last year.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, with that, I would urge Members to \noppose the amendment and urge Members to vote ``no'', and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. McClintock\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk that I \noffer with the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this Act to \n     the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to any of \n     the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, \n     Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, \n     Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, \n     Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,\n\n[[Page H3749]]\n\n     Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New \n     Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode \n     Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, \n     Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin, to prevent any of them \n     from implementing their own laws that authorize the use, \n     distribution, possession, or cultivation of marijuana on non-\n     Federal lands within their respective jurisdictions.\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous \nconsent to dispense with the reading.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not an endorsement of marijuana. I \nhave never used it. My wife and I raised our children never to use it. \nAnd I believe that local schools ought to assure that every American is \naware of the risks and dangers that it may pose.\n  This amendment addresses a much larger question: whether the Federal \nGovernment has the constitutional authority to dictate a policy to \nStates on matters that occur strictly within their own borders. I \nbelieve that it does not. But even if it does, I believe that it should \nnot.\n  In 1932, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis described the beauty of \nthe 10th Amendment this way. He said: ``A State may, if its citizens \nchoose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic \nexperiments without risk to the rest of the country.''\n\n                              {time}  0110\n\n  That is exactly what States like Colorado and Oregon have done with \nlegalization and what many more have done with aspects of it. They \nbelieve that the harm that might be done by easier access to this drug \nis outweighed by removing the violent underground economy that is \ncaused by prohibition.\n  I don't know if they are right or wrong, but I would like to find \nout, and their experiment will inform the rest of the country.\n  Now, the Federal Government has a legitimate authority to protect \nneighboring States by forbidding transport across State lines, which \nthis amendment protects; but, at the same time, it protects the right \nof a State's citizens to make this decision within their own \nboundaries.\n  It is not necessary to become embroiled in the debate over marijuana. \nThese States are having that debate and establishing their laws.\n  The question is over the right of their people to have these debates, \nto make these decisions, and for the rest of the Nation to observe and \nbenefit from the outcome for good or ill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  My friend Mr. McClintock makes the point that this should be an \nexperiment within the States, and certainly, that is something that has \nbeen a long-held goal and value, but we already have that ongoing.\n  Today, Colorado, as everyone knows, has legalization of marijuana, \nnotwithstanding what is going on with the Federal Government and its \nlaws, and the information is rolling in, and the information is bad. \nThe black market is worse than ever when it comes to drugs. Interstate \ncommerce has increased, not decreased.\n  Again, as I stated before, two States, Oklahoma and Nebraska, are now \nsuing Colorado over the bleedover of problems that are occurring. The \nstrength of marijuana is much stronger today in Colorado than it has \never been. The problems are much worse. We are actually seeing related \ndeaths, accidents; and we have even had an overdose death now with the \nstronger forms of marijuana.\n  Look, if this is about allowing doctors to work with their patients, \nlet's admit it. We don't allow, as a society, doctors to just do \nanything with any patient. We do have some guidelines and restrictions.\n  Furthermore, children are the end result of bad decisions in all \nthis. We know that the more it is in the homes, the more it is going to \nget into the brains and bloodstream of children.\n  Again, I will mention the number of problems that are developing from \nit are growing, mostly from what we are seeing in Colorado. Studies \nshow that MRI scans show, even in casual users, profound brain changes. \nWe see that the area that deals with ambition is being greatly \naffected, thus, the ambition killer sort of knowledge that we have and \nunderstand about this drug.\n  IQ, studies show a lowering of IQ.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. FLEMING. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), the cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Mr. POLIS. I thank the gentleman from California for bringing forward \nthis amendment.\n  I say to my friend, the gentleman from Louisiana, I am actually from \nColorado, and I don't recognize the Colorado that you are talking \nabout.\n  I come from the Colorado where underage marijuana use is down since \nlegalization. I am from the Colorado where we have driven criminal \ncartels that seek to prey on our children every day out of business.\n  I am from the Colorado where our violent crime rates are down and \nwhere we continue to regulate dispensaries to make sure they are not \nschools; rather than have a corner street dealer who doesn't care if \nthey are selling to a 14-year-old, we moved that away and regulated it \nin a way to make sure that minors don't have access to marijuana. That \nis the Colorado that I am from. I welcome you to come visit. I welcome \nyou to visit.\n  You know what, I don't have to convince you. I don't have to convince \nthe State of Louisiana that they should do anything. I just wish that \nyou would leave my sovereign State of Colorado alone.\n  Let our people and our State government decide what we want to do \nwith regard to marijuana, rather than the Federal agents going around \ntrying to arrest people for doing activities that are fully legal under \nState law. That is all I ask.\n  I am not going to send Federal troops into Louisiana to arrest people \nfrom whatever you do down there, smoking crayfish. You want me to ban \nthat and send Federal troops down there? I bet maybe smoking crayfish \nain't good for you. I don't know. What if it is fried? It might clog \nyour arteries, huh? I bet that is not good for you.\n  You want me to send Federal troops down there? Is that what you want? \nDo you want me to send Federal troops to Louisiana to stop you from \neating fried crayfish?\n  Mr. FLEMING. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. POLIS. Yeah, I would like your answer. Yes or no?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will suspend.\n  All Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to inquire of the gentleman \nfrom Louisiana if he wants us to send Federal troops to Louisiana to \nstop them from eating fried crayfish. I am happy to yield for an \nanswer.\n  Mr. FLEMING. If the gentleman is yielding to me, I would point out \nthat the Colorado he describes does not exist.\n  Mr. POLIS. Reclaiming my time, I am from Colorado. I know Colorado \ninside and out, and we have been tremendously successful in reducing \nthe abuse of marijuana among minors.\n  Again, it shouldn't be up to us to convince him, just as I don't have \nto eat their darn fried crayfish--I don't want it. I don't want it. Get \nthe Federal law enforcement apparatus to leave our State alone.\n  That is all this amendment does, is respect the sovereign will of the \npeople of my great State of Colorado to have innovative policies to \nreduce the abuse of marijuana.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have left?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Louisiana has 3 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from California has 1\\1/4\\ minutes remaining.\n\n[[Page H3750]]\n\n  Mr. FLEMING. I yield myself another minute.\n  What we are finding out from Colorado, we are learning a lot of \nlessons. One is the way that marijuana is now getting into baked goods, \ngummy bears. There is a huge spike in emergency room visits, children \nwho are overdosing on marijuana.\n  Know that if you look, if you actually read what the media says and \nwhat the studies show is there are increasing problems in Colorado, not \ndecreasing problems.\n  Mr. POLIS. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FLEMING. I'm sorry, but I can't yield.\n  Mr. POLIS. The gentleman is inaccurate with regard to his \ncharacterization of my State.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will suspend. It is the gentleman \nfrom Louisiana's time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does the gentleman from Louisiana yield for a \nparliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. FLEMING. I do not yield.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman does not yield. The time is \ncontrolled by the gentleman from Louisiana.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Back to the constitutionality, we may all have different \nopinions about this, but it has been settled.\n  The Supreme Court in 2005, Gonzales v. Raich, 6-3, said that the \nFederal Government does have a right to enforce drug policies and for \ngood reason because we know that drugs cross State lines. It is an \ninterstate commerce issue. What happens in one State affects the other \nStates.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. FLEMING. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, the arguments we are hearing from Mr. \nFleming are the arguments that ought to be heard in the States. I would \nremind him this measure does not affect marijuana laws involving any \nconceivable Federal jurisdiction.\n  It does not affect Federal districts or territories. It does not \naffect Federal jurisdiction over interstate commerce, including the \nFederal Government's responsibility to interdict transport among \nStates.\n  It does not affect the Federal jurisdiction over Federal land. It \ndoes not affect Federal jurisdiction over the importation of marijuana \nfrom abroad. It only affects jurisdiction that is strictly and solely \nthe rightful province of the States as pertains to their affairs \nstrictly and solely within their own borders.\n  At some point, Mr. Chairman, we must ask ourselves: Do we believe in \nthe 10th Amendment or do we not? Do we believe in federalism or do we \nnot? Do we believe in the architecture of our Constitution or do we \nnot? Do we believe in freedom or do we not?\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Louisiana has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FLEMING. And who has the right to close?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Louisiana has the only time \nremaining. The gentleman from California yielded back the balance of \nhis time.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Again, my good friend from California would suggest \nthat, really, Federal laws have no application, that we should just \nturn all laws and law enforcement over to the States. That simply isn't \nthe case.\n  Again, yes, the Federal Government does have jurisdiction. It is \ncalled the CSA, the Controlled Substances Act, and it has been around \nfor a long time, and it is enforced by the DEA and many other agencies. \nI would just say that the gentleman is just flat wrong on that and that \nthe Supreme Court came down on my side.\n  Again, we can have different opinions, but that is where we are \ntoday. I would suggest that perhaps we get the Supreme Court to rule \ndifferently if we believe differently.\n\n                              {time}  0120\n\n  But again, what is important to me is not the law. What is important \nto me is what is happening to the children of our Nation, especially \nColorado: overdosages, brain changes, loss of IQ, memory loss, and \ncognitive impairment.\n  Marijuana smoke has four times the tar of cigarette smoke. Who really \nbelieves that we are not going to see an epidemic down the road of lung \ncancer related to marijuana?\n  As far as use for medical purposes, again, we don't have a single \napproved specific use of marijuana for medical purposes. And for \nheaven's sakes, we know that up to 17 percent of people who use it \nbecome addicted to it. So the first rule for us as physicians--and I \nhave been a doctor for 40 years--is first do no harm. Well, we are \ndoing a lot of harm with marijuana by legalizing it and liberalizing \nits use.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Perry\n\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to take any action to prevent a State from \n     implementing any law that makes it lawful to possess, \n     distribute, or use cannabidiol or cannabidiol oil.\n\n  Mr. PERRY (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to \ndispense with the reading.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is important to talk about what this amendment is \nnot, as much as to talk about what it is. This amendment in no way \nfederally legalizes marijuana. It does not allow for the recreational \nuse of marijuana, and I maintain that I am still opposed to the \nrecreational use of marijuana. What it does is it simply prevents the \nFederal Government from interfering in States that have legalized CBD \nand CBD oil.\n  CBD--cannabidiol is how you pronounce it--is an extract from hemp. \nCBD oil has been known to reduce the amount or duration of seizures in \nthose suffering from epilepsy or other seizure disorders. CBD oil \ncontains no THC, the active psychotropic ingredient that makes people \nhigh. It contains none.\n  Numerous families in my district have children with epilepsy, and \nthey are out of options. They have tried all the FDA-approved drugs, \nand they sit and they watch their children fade away. And that is their \noption. They can either do that, they can break the law, or they can \nmove somewhere where they can get CBD. Some have had to move to States \nwhere it is legal. They have had to split their families apart to care \nfor their children.\n  Mr. Chairman, 17 States--most recently, Texas, where the good \nchairman resides--have legalized CBD. These States have made the choice \nto help children with epilepsy and seizure disorders. Parents who want \nto treat their children should not be hindered by Federal prohibition.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold), my good friend.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my good friend from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. Chairman, last week I had an opportunity to sit down with Sophie \nWeiss, an inspiring young girl from Illinois. In many ways she is a \nvery normal girl who enjoys spending her days playing with her sisters, \nbut she also suffers from a severe form of epilepsy\n\n[[Page H3751]]\n\nthat does not allow her to respond to the traditional medication. \nBecause of this, she suffers through upwards of 200 seizures each and \nevery day. Mr. Chairman, she can't read. She is 9 years old. Her 6-\nyear-old sister reads to her. She can't do this because she blacks out \nand she seizes hundreds of times each and every day.\n  Unfortunately, Sophie's story is not unique, and there are girls just \nlike Sophie in every State and every district across our country.\n  Mr. Chairman, we have already found lifesaving seizure relief for \nsome families. In Illinois, CBD oil is legal and has shown to \ndrastically reduce the frequency of seizures. But because of antiquated \nlaws and Federal bureaucracy, this relief is unavailable to many.\n  Over and over again, the Federal Government has stood in the way of \naccess to lifesaving care for these children. Why would we allow even \none child, Mr. Chairman, to suffer while waiting for other options to \nbe approved? If this natural therapy can help even one family, ensuring \naccess to it is a must.\n  Mr. Chairman, I came to Washington to fight for commonsense, \nbipartisan reform that will improve the day-to-day lives of the people \nthat I represent, and that is exactly what this amendment does. Quite \nsimply, it ensures that States that already have legalized CBD oil can \ndo so without Federal interference.\n  Helping these families is a reform that we should all be able to get \nbehind. Regardless of political party, we can agree that the \ngovernment's role is not to prevent families from getting access to \nlifesaving treatment.\n  Mr. Chairman, as a father looking at these children who suffer from \nthousands of seizures, who literally can't live their lives normally, \nis something that we can and must change. This amendment offers hope to \nthousands of individuals and their families, and I urge my colleagues \nto help children like Sophie in their districts by adopting this \ncommonsense amendment.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Louisiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Chairman, some of the things that have been said about this are \nquite true. First of all, it is pronounced--I can't even say it myself. \nWe will say CBD oil for short.\n  It is not psychoactive, although it is an extract from the plant of \nmarijuana. There have been anecdotal reports that it reduces seizures \nin kids who have severe seizure disorders, so-called Charlotte's Web. \nIt is actually on fast-track evaluation by the FDA both for safety and \nfor effectiveness. Actually, the early reports are disappointing. \nDespite the anecdotal reports, they are not finding, thus far, the \nbenefits that have been promised. Also, they are finding, in some \ncases, pretty severe side effects.\n  One of the things that hasn't been discussed on this issue is, just \nas we don't allow people or encourage people, at least, to eat mold in \norder to get penicillin as an antibiotic for disease, it doesn't make \nany sense to give a raw plant as a medication. What we do in health \ncare by using the scientific method is to extract the component, make \nsure we have a precise measurement, fully study it for safety and for \nefficaciousness, and then we prescribe it under the direction of a \nphysician.\n  The CBD oil right now is not being produced. It is not in a pill or \ninjectable form or even in a liquid form. It is sort of grown on the \nside, and people are sort of experimenting with it to see whether it \nworks.\n  What I would say to my colleagues is let's let this thing play out. \nLet the FDA finish its fast-track evaluation. If they find it to be \nefficacious and safe, let them put it in the proper measurement form. \nLet's make sure we know what all the side effects are. As far as I am \nconcerned, we would make it a nonscheduled drug.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is \nremaining.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 1 minute \nremaining. The gentleman from Louisiana has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  Again, I think this is a similar thrust to the previous debate, so I \nwon't prolong it. But we need to be exploring relief for families in \nwhich no other relief is available and for individuals in which no \nother relief is available. This provides an opportunity for potential \nrelief. We should explore it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering the amendment, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has the right to \nclose.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, what my colleagues are suggesting here is \nthat we just pull a plant from someplace or something off the shelf and \nwe give it to children, something that has not been a practice in \nprobably 100 years.\n\n                              {time}  0130\n\n  We just don't do it that way. That is why we spend millions, if not \nbillions, of dollars of research to be sure that what we give the \npublic is going to be healthy for them and safe for them.\n  You may recall a drug that was prescribed for pregnancy, nausea and \npregnancy, which was approved back in Europe but not approved here, and \nwe found out that babies were born without arms and legs as a result. \nSaving children in America--why? Because we waited to be sure that not \nonly was it efficacious, but it was safe.\n  So I would say to my friends, my heart is in the same place. I want \nto see treatment for children who may have severe seizure disorders. We \nhave it on a fast track. We may be months away.\n  But I don't think turning this over to parents and others who may \nfiddle with it and experiment with it, in essence, making our children \nguinea pigs, is the right way to go.\n  There are centers that are doing these studies, and certainly \nchildren can go and talk to those doctors, get on their studies, and \nget the trials. But I would again warn people that the preliminary \nresults are not good, and in some cases we are seeing adverse side \neffects.\n  So I think we need to stay with the scientific method. We need to \nstay with the discipline that has made us the leader in the world when \nit comes to health care. We should not depart from something that has \nbeen proven right.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Austin Scott), my friend.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank Mr. \nPerry for his work on this.\n  I have a friend in my district who has been seen on TV many times \nbecause they have to carry their child to Colorado for this treatment. \nAnd I have had extensive discussions not only with people in Georgia \nwho need this treatment for their kids, but with the sheriffs of my \ndistrict as well. I certainly wouldn't support the cannabis oil and the \nuse of cannabis oil and those type of things if my local sheriffs were \nnot in favor of it.\n  You might be interested to know that the Georgia Sheriffs' \nAssociation actually endorsed a piece of legislation a couple of years \nago that would allow the use of cannabis oil for these children with \nseizures.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, some things have been said about the side \neffects of this. These are not the same side effects as with people who \nsmoke marijuana. This is not smoke. This is an oil extract, usually \ngiven with the care of a doctor. It is not some weed grown along the \nroad; it is actually classified in the therapeutic temp category \nbecause the plant has very scientific properties.\n  I understand and I respect the gentleman from Louisiana very much. \nWhen he says that he is concerned\n\n[[Page H3752]]\n\nabout the side effects for these children, understand children are in \nhospice, they are looking at their final days, their parents are \nlooking at their final days. They take the oil extract and they start \non the road to recovery. The side effect is the choice of death or \nlife.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Perry\n\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), add the \n     following:\n       Sec. _.  None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to implement the United States Global Climate \n     Research Program's National Climate Assessment, the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment \n     Report, the United Nation's Agenda 21 sustainable development \n     plan, or the May 2013 Technical Update of the Social Cost of \n     Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis under Executive Order \n     12866.\n\n  Mr. PERRY (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent \nto dispense with the reading.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, this amendment prevents funds from being \nused for the implementation of the United States Global Climate \nResearch Program's National Climate Assessment, the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report, the United Nation's \nAgenda 21 sustainable development plan, or the May 2013 Technical \nUpdate of the Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis \nunder Executive Order 12866.\n  Mr. Chairman, this administration and others before it have taken \nunilateral actions that push a climate change agenda that hinders our \nown domestic business and industry.\n  Programs such as the United States Global Climate Research Program's \nNational Climate Assessment and Agenda 21 drive burdensome regulations \non unsound science, such as the new ozone rules set to take effect this \nOctober, the waters of the United States, and regulations on coal-fired \npower plants.\n  I wonder why do we want to fund programs, panels, and treaties that \ncreate propaganda, propaganda that looks to drive industry out of this \ncountry.\n  With that, I urge passage of this amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although \nI am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I am not going to object, but I am in \nopposition to the amendment. So as long as the chairman will yield me \nhalf of the time, I think we are fine.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Of course.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Go right ahead.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I do want to express my support for the \ngentleman's amendment. I think it is very important that we restrict \nthis or any other President's ability to enter into agreements that \nwould interfere with our rights as Americans, would interfere with the \nlaws as enacted by Congress. And that is the intent of your amendment, \nto ensure that the laws enacted by Congress or by the legislatures of \nthe several States reign supreme and no President can enter into any \nkind of an agreement. We are not going to subject ourselves to the law \nof the U.N. or any of these other agreements in here. So I strongly \nsupport the gentleman's agreement.\n  I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nFattah).\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman. And just as strongly \nas the chairman supports it, I oppose it. Even though I supported your \nlast amendment, this one is headed in the wrong direction.\n  We have a need to deal with the challenges around our stewardship of \nthe planet Earth and the questions around climate and working with our \ninternational neighbors.\n  I want to commend the administration for getting an agreement with \nChina around some of these issues. It is necessary for our children and \nour grandchildren and great-grandchildren that we act as proper \nstewards. It is our obligation, at least in most of our religious \nteachings, that we have a responsibility to be good stewards.\n  So we can't ignore even for the point of profits. You mentioned how \nthis might interfere with business interests. It is beyond the question \nof business interests. We need clean water, clean air, we need a \nclimate that is capable of human habitation, at least until we can have \nEuropa as a second exit opportunity. This is the only planet for human \nbeings that we know of and we, therefore, have a responsibility.\n  And the President under our Constitution is the carrier of our \ninternational activities in terms of the conduct of foreign policy, not \nthis President or some other President, but the President of the United \nStates has that burden and that responsibility under our Constitution.\n  So I would hope that the House would vote this down. I know we won't. \nBut I also know that there will be another day in which this \nlegislation will have to be considered in a format in which it won't be \njust the House majority making these decisions.\n  And thank God for that, because even the House majority could be \nwrong every once in a while, as proven by this amendment.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I certainly respect the thoughts of my good \ncolleague and good friend from Pennsylvania. I also want to remind him \nthat we went through this last session. This very same amendment passed \nby vote. And while we do absolutely have the requirement and \nresponsibility for the stewardship of the planet, I just want to remind \neverybody here, in case you don't know, we have these new ozone rules \ncoming out, set to come out, or be codified in October. Yet from this \nadministration's EPA, ozone levels have plummeted 33 percent since \n1980. That is reported from the current administration's EPA. Let me \njust repeat that: ozone levels have plummeted 33 percent since 1980 \nbecause of the good work we have done. Yet in a downturn economy where \nthe economy is actually contracted in the first quarter, we seek to \nforce more unnecessary rules that are unvetted by this Congress, this \npeople's House, on the businesses of America and also things like \nUnited Nations Agenda 21.\n\n                              {time}  0140\n\n  I just feel like those rules and those regulations should come at the \nvetting of this body instead of by the United Nations. What is good for \nAmerica should be handled by Americans.\n  I thank the chairman for his support.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Garrett\n\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used by the Department of Justice to enforce the Fair \n     Housing Act in a manner that relies upon an allegation of \n     liability under section 100.500 of title 24, Code of Federal \n     Regulations.\n\n  Mr. GARRETT (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the amendment be considered as read and printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page H3753]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  I rise today to offer an amendment that stops the Justice Department \nfrom using one of the most dangerous and illogical theories of all \ntime, the theory of disparate impact.\n  In short, disparate impact allows the government to allege \ndiscrimination on the basis of race or other factors based solely on \nstatistical analyses that find disproportionate results among different \ngroups of people.\n  In recent years, the Justice Department has increasingly used this \ndubious theory in lawsuits against mortgage lenders, insurers, and \nlandlords and has forced these companies to pay multimillion-dollar \nsettlements.\n  What is wrong with that, one might ask? Under disparate impact, one \ncould never have intentionally discriminated in any way and even have \nstrong antidiscriminatory policies in place and still be found to have \ndiscriminated.\n  For example, if mortgage lenders use a completely objective standard \nto assess credit risk, such as the debt-to-income ratio, they can still \nbe found to have discriminated if the data show different loan approval \nrates for different groups of consumers.\n  To be clear, I have zero tolerance for discrimination in any form; \nand, if there is intentional discrimination, we must prosecute to the \nfullest extent of the law. The Justice Department's use of disparate \nimpact, however, tries to fight one injustice with another.\n  On a more practical level, disparate impact will make it difficult, \nif not impossible, for lenders to make rational economic decisions \nabout risk. Lenders will feel pressured to weaken their standards to \nkeep their lending statistics in line with whatever the Justice \nDepartment's bureaucrats consider nondiscriminatory.\n  We have seen the damage risky lending can do to our economy. It is \ntruly reckless for our government now to be encouraging those dangerous \nand shortsighted practices. Ironically, disparate impact forces \nlenders, insurers, and landlords to constantly take race, ethnicity, \ngender, and other factors into account or risk running afoul of the \nJustice Department.\n  Mr. Chairman, even an accusation of discrimination could have a \ndevastating impact on a small business. Therefore, on balance, \ndisparate impact will make it more difficult and expensive for families \nto buy a home, and it will result in more discrimination, not less.\n  For these reasons, both philosophical and practical, I ask my \ncolleagues to reject this misguided theory by supporting this \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, this is obviously an important signal from \nthe majority to Americans of color, whether they be Asian Americans, \nAfrican Americans, Hispanic Americans, or Native Americans, that the \none thing that they don't want is to enforce the fair housing laws and \nthat they don't want to have a circumstance in which, even though the \nimpact of a set of policies means that you are excluded, that somehow \nthere should not be any redress for that.\n  We went through this debate last year. I am going to ask for a \nrecorded vote on this as I think it is an important indication of the \nnature of inclusiveness that is being offered to America by the House \nmajority.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I think it is an indication of something. It is an indication of \nwhether this House is more concerned about actually filing true \nintentional discrimination or is just creating fear in this area by \nsaying that we are going after discrimination based upon disparate \nimpact.\n  It is about whether this House is more concerned about making things \neasier for all races, for all ethnicities, for all ethnic groups to be \nable to buy homes and to live and prosper and enjoy a new home or make \nit more difficult to be able to buy that first home.\n  Allowing the Justice Department to use disparate impact will do just \nthat. It will make it more difficult for those individuals who now find \nit difficult to buy a home because lenders will not be able to use the \nproper risk analysis to make those decisions and, therefore, will be \nless likely to make those loans.\n  For those reasons and for the other philosophical and practical \nreasons I have already stated, I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chair, the gentleman said for practical and other \nphilosophical reasons.\n  I guess, if you looked at Major League Baseball and if you didn't see \nanybody of color, you could assume that there was a disparate impact \nuntil Jackie Robinson showed up, but American baseball is a lot better, \nand I think that our country is a lot stronger because of the diversity \nthat exists.\n  I think the fair housing laws have played an important role in at \nleast the idea that we think that you shouldn't have a circumstance in \nwhich, no matter what the set of policies, if you are a different color \nor ethnic background, you shouldn't apply.\n  I think it is something that we have rejected as a nation. I hope we \nreject this amendment, and I will seek a recorded vote on it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Marino\n\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used for the Department of Justice's clemency initiative \n     announced on April 23, 2014, or for Clemency Project 2014, or \n     to transfer or temporarily assign employees to the Office of \n     the Pardon Attorney for the purpose of screening clemency \n     applications.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, my amendment prohibits funds from this bill \nfrom being used to transfer or detail employees to the Office of the \nPardon Attorney to support the administration's so-called clemency \nproject.\n  The President possesses the constitutional authority ``to grant \nreprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States.'' \nHowever, in the first 5 years of his administration, President Obama \ngranted fewer pardons and commutations than any of his recent \npredecessors.\n  Last year, the Deputy Attorney General took the unprecedented step of \nasking the defense bar for assistance in recruiting candidates for \nexecutive clemency, specifically for Federal drug offenders. The \nJustice Department intends to beef up its Office of the Pardon Attorney \nto process applications for commutations of sentence for Federal drug \noffenders.\n  The Justice Department is also accepting pro bono legal work from the \nACLU and other defense attorney organizations for this initiative. This \namendment would prohibit that.\n  The Constitution gives the President the pardon power, but the fact \nthat the President has chosen to use that power solely on behalf of \ndrug offenders shows that this is little more than a political ploy by \nthe administration to bypass Congress.\n  This is not, as the Founders intended, an exercise of the power to \nprovide for ``exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt,'' but the use \nof the pardon\n\n[[Page H3754]]\n\npower to benefit an entire class of offenders duly convicted in a court \nof law.\n\n                              {time}  0150\n\n  It is also just the latest example of the executive overreach by this \nadministration, and I urge support of my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I seek time in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. The executive branch, the President of the United States, \nhas the responsibility to review applications for pardons and clemency, \nand this would interfere with the executive branch's responsibility in \nthat regard. I think that it would also hamper our ability to move this \nbill to a position of final passage and signature by the President. I \nam opposed to it.\n  I am glad the gentleman from Pennsylvania was able to have an \nopportunity to offer it and air his point of view, but I think when we \nhave a President perhaps of a different party, there will be less \nenthusiasm for trying to unnecessarily interfere in the proper role of \nthe executive, which clemencies and pardons are in the purview of the \nPresident; and detailing employees of the executive branch, for the \nRepublican Party that is for normally streamlining and making nimble \nand allowing managers to set priorities and to move personnel around, \nto suggest that they somehow now are against this, I assume there is \nsome particular reason, and it couldn't be anything other than on the \nmerits I am certain.\n  I thank the gentleman, and I would stand in opposition to the \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 3 minutes \nremaining, and the other gentleman from Pennsylvania has 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I would share with my good friend from \nPennsylvania, no matter who is in the White House, Republican or \nDemocrat, my enthusiasm is always at an all-time high, particularly \nwhen it comes to following the law.\n  The President does have the authority to pardon, but not to, as he \nhas done here, zeroed in on a specific class of individuals who broke \nthe law, and that is people who use drugs, sell drugs, made profits \nfrom drugs, and were duly found guilty and sentenced. This is just a \nway for this administration to bypass the drug laws that they don't \nagree with.\n  This administration is known for that. If they don't agree with \nsomething, they just try to bypass it, as they have done numerous times \nwith Congress. But, fortunately, the United States Supreme Court has \nslapped this administration down numerous times because of bypassing \nCongress and making decisions that are not in its authority.\n  So let's be realistic about this. This isn't an issue of politics, \nfrom my perspective. I do say it is an issue of politics from the \nadministration's perspective.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nCulberson), the chairman, if he needs the time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. Chairman, I do want to express my support for the gentleman's \namendment. I am concerned about the efforts of this White House to \nrepeatedly ignore the laws enacted by Congress. If we didn't have this \ntrack record from this President who has made a deliberate effort to \nevade the laws written by Congress and attempted to bypass them at \nevery opportunity--the President has lost a record number of cases \nbefore the Supreme Court.\n  I believe, Mr. Marino, the Supreme Court has ruled against the \nPresident unanimously on repeated occasions when the White House has \nattempted to avoid a statute and refused to enforce it, and Mr. Marino \nbrings to the table tonight experience as a prosecutor, very valid \nconcerns about granting clemency to a whole category of people rather \nthan as in the case of a pardon, which is on an individual basis.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Reclaiming my time, we have, and it must be just inherent \nfor politicians, selective amnesia. We kind of remember what we want to \nremember, and we forget what we want to forget.\n  Now, it has been uttered on the floor of the House that no President \nhas done some broad swath of clemencies or pardons. Well, it was \nPresident Ford who offered and President Carter who implemented a \nclemency or amnesty for hundreds of thousands of people who had evaded \nthe draft during the Vietnam war.\n  This has nothing to do with the implementation of the laws set by our \nCongress. This right to the Presidency of pardons and clemency is given \nin the Constitution. The point here is that it is just another effort, \nthis consistent drumbeat about our President.\n  This will not be the law at the end of the day when this bill is \npassed. I oppose it, and there is no President that is going to sign \naway their executive authority. It would diminish the power of the \nPresidency. And perhaps for the majority if they were to gain this \nPresidency again--and I am sure they will on some election--they \nwouldn't want to diminish the power of the Presidency. I think it is \njust ill-fated and it is focused at a particular effort at this moment, \nbut it does not represent a historical fact that a President has not \nprovided broad exemption or clemency or pardons in our past.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. MARINO. I am sure in my remarks my colleague is not referring to \nany comment that I made that no other President has done something of \nthis nature. I came to Congress in 2011. Really, my concern is what is \nhappening with this administration, not past administrations. I am \ndwelling on the future and the rule of law.\n  It is very clear what this administration is doing when it comes to \nthe rule of law or the lack of rule of law. Once again, this \nadministration does not like the drug laws. It has a very difficult \ntime with the criminal laws that are on the books.\n  I was a prosecutor for 18 years at the State level and the Federal \nlevel. I have seen what takes place concerning drugs. I have put people \nin prison for selling drugs; I have put people in prison for hurting \npeople who they sell drugs to; and I have taken the position where some \npeople did not deserve to go to prison based on several factors. But \nthe individuals that I sent to prison, and I think, overwhelmingly, \naccording to the criteria that this administration has set, they are \ntalking about individuals that have a sentence of 10 years or less, \nthat is quite a sentence to pardon, because those individuals who have \nbeen sent to prison, in my experience, for 5 and 6 and 10 years are \nmajor drug dealers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n            Amendment Offered by Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia\n\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert:\n       Sec. ___. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration to enforce:\n       1) Amendment 40 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef \n     Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico published in the Federal \n     Register on April 22, 2015 or any other effort of the same \n     substance, or\n       2) Red Snapper Management Measures published in the Federal \n     Register on May 1, 2015 or any other effort of the same \n     substance that establishes an-4 annual catch limits or annual \n     catch targets for Red Snapper that would result in the \n     commercial fishing for Red Snapper in the federal waters of \n     the Gulf of Mexico lasting longer than five times the number \n     of days recreational fishers are allowed to catch and retain \n     at least two such fish each day in such federal waters.\n\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask \nunanimous consent to dispense with the reading.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Georgia?\n\n[[Page H3755]]\n\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chair, first I would like to thank \nthe Parliamentarians for helping us work with this language. I would \nlike to especially thank both the majority and the minority staff for \ngiving me the courtesy of presenting this. I know it is late, and we \ncertainly hoped to close by 2 a.m.\n  It is the third day of what has been designated as the 10-day red \nsnapper season for a man or woman who simply wants to take their child \nfishing in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n                              {time}  0200\n\n  The commercial fishermen get to fish 365 days a year. The charter \nboat anglers get to fish 45 days a year.\n  What this amendment does is it says that the National Fisheries \nService cannot enforce a rule that was adopted that is, quite honestly, \nprobably going to court. And then it says that as they go forward and \nthey pass the rules in the future, the recreational fishermen should \nreceive at least 20 percent of the number of days as the commercial \nfisherman does with regard to the red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  That is effectively what it does. It still allows them to set the \nseasons. It does have some restriction in that they just can't take \nfrom the recreational fishermen. They have to give the recreational \nnot-for-hire and for-hire 20 percent of the number of calendar days \nthat they give the commercial fishermen to fish for red snapper in the \nGulf of Mexico.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia because I need to \nask a question about this.\n  You say that the commercial catch limits for fishing days are 360 \ndays a year? And I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Yes, sir. They can fish year-round for \nred snapper. It is different for different species. This is tailored \nspecifically to this species.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Reclaiming my time, we are talking red snapper, right? I \nyield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. FATTAH. But for the recreational fisherman, taking your sons out \nto fish for the day, there is a limit of 10 days?\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Yes, sir. This is the third day of the \n10-day season for the Federal waters for the recreational fishermen in \nthe Gulf of Mexico.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Reclaiming my time, in spirit, I support this. I don't \nknow what the unintended consequences are. So I would be prepared to \naccept it, as long as we can dig into it and make sure there are no \nunintended circumstances.\n  I know this is a very parochial matter. I think you should be able to \ntake your kid out fishing. I don't think that profit is the only \nmotivator in the world. I don't know why it would be so arbitrary a cut \nline.\n  At this point I would like to work with the chairman on this. I would \nbe prepared to accept it at this time. If we find some major problem \nwith it, we will jump up and down about it then.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I completely agree, and I join my ranking member in \naccepting this amendment and working with you. If there is something we \ndidn't spot or anticipate, we will work it out. But I think the \ngentleman has got a good amendment, and I would agree, I would \nrecommend we would accept it.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I would like to say that \nas a dad, honestly, I would like to say thank you for doing this. And \ncertainly, if there are unintended consequences, I would look forward \nto working with you to resolve those unintended consequences.\n  Again, as a father of a son named Wells and a daughter named Carmen \nand a lovely wife named Vivien, I just want to say thank you.\n  Mr. FATTAH. My wife is a fly fisher. We are not doing red snapper. \nBut I understand the spirit of it, and we will take it at that, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nGraves of Louisiana) having assumed the chair, Mr. Stivers, Acting \nChair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, \nreported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill \n(H.R. 2578) making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and \nJustice, Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2016, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution \nthereon.\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Hudson (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today until 6:45 p.m. \non account of attending a funeral.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/house-section/article/H3755-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Karen L.
