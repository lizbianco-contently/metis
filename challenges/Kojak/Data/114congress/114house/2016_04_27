The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Paulsen) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember somebody of \nunquestionable talent, somebody who appealed to and spoke to people of \nall types, ages, and cliques, and somebody who also never stopped \nfinding different ways of expressing coolness.\n  Of course, I am speaking of Minnesota's native son, Prince, who \ntragically passed away this last week in Chanhassen, my hometown.\n  Prince was the personification of limitless ability and creativity, \nand, even better for Minnesotans, he was one of us.\n  For me, the music of Prince was intertwined with growing up in \nChanhassen. I remember spending time with high school friends after a \nfootball game or a soccer game. We would take the time to actually \ndrive up his driveway, which we thought was kind of fascinating. We \nwould head over to his house. We were a little entranced with his \nsimple, purple, split-level house.\n  The fact that the man responsible for some of our favorite songs and \nmusic was living right in our backyard seemed actually too good to be \ntrue.\n  I remember my very first concert I went to was also Prince on his \nPurple Rain Tour back in 1984 at the St. Paul Civic Center.\n  To hear his contemporaries tell the story, Prince's guitar playing \nsimply was indescribable. If the best musicians of our day can't find \nthe words to express how talented he really was, I certainly can't find \na way to express the skill that he possessed.\n  Of course, he was much more than his guitar playing. He could also \nsing and play numerous other instruments and write hit after hit. But \nwhat inspires so many is that it shows that greatness lives within us.\n  Prince grew up in Minneapolis. He didn't have any formal classical \nmusical training at an elite school, but he did rise to the top of the \nmusic world and never looked back.\n  Even with all the stories that we have heard over the past several \ndays and week about the greatness of Prince, more inspiring are the \nstories of him extending a helping hand to help lift others up in times \nof need, stories of how he was very active in our community.\n  Just a few weeks before he passed away, he played a very surprise \nshow with friends at the Chanhassen Dinner Theater, a very popular \nvenue and Minnesota favorite, where I worked as a high school busboy.\n  Day after day we are hearing stories now of donations to schools, to \ndifferent causes and, of course, to people. Those are the folks that \nPrince made happy in terms of their time of need. Prince had a giving \nheart.\n  Ultimately, it is for these reasons that we have seen the outpouring \nof grief from around Minnesota, from around the country, and also from \naround the world.\n  As we continue to remember Prince, the man, and his music, it is his \nwords from one of his earliest top hits, ``1999,'' that helps put \nthings in perspective. He says: ``But life is just a party, and parties \nweren't meant to last.''\n  While his party has certainly sadly come to an end, these lyrics \nremind us each and every day to live those days to the fullest and to \nset out to achieve great things.\n  We will miss Prince Rogers Nelson. May he rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H1999-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1999-H2000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           UNGASS REFLECTIONS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, last week I had the opportunity to be an \nofficial observer at the United Nations as they had a special meeting \ndealing with the international war on drugs.\n  Much has happened since President Clinton addressed the Global Drug \nSummit at the United Nations in 1998, carrying the American war on \ndrugs to the international stage. But this, in my mind, solidified the \nneed for us to reset these failed drug policies.\n\n[[Page H2000]]\n\n  People across the political spectrum now agree that this approach to \ndrug policy is flawed and ineffective. We have spent over $1 trillion \non this effort over the years.\n  We have undermined countries in Latin America and helped unleash an \nunprecedented wave of violence in Mexico, killing tens of thousands of \npeople in the drug wars.\n  Yet, despite all the effort, all the money, drugs are still widely \navailable in the United States, actually less expensive than before we \nstarted. We seem unable to even keep drugs out of our own prisons.\n  America's failure to deal with harm reduction, treatment, and \nprevention has helped lead to the epidemic of opioid addiction and \ndeath. In 2013 alone, we lost 20,000 people to prescription drug \noverdose.\n  As people get hooked on amazingly over-prescribed prescription drugs, \nit leads to heroin addiction when they substitute it when they can no \nlonger get access to opioids.\n  Now, it is interesting that some of the countries that have been most \ndevastated by this war on drugs, in dealing with the international \ncartels--Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala--were there at the United Nations \nleading the charge for a different approach.\n  Many of the presentations that I witnessed were suggestions to the \nOutcome Document, with the common theme that it did not go far enough \nin reforming the path forward.\n  Calls for harm reduction, greater access to treatment, and fighting \nthe barbaric practice of executing drug offenders energized that \nconsensus.\n  Now, America was on the sidelines. America was not calling for \nadjustment and change in reform. We were sort of between those more \nprogressive forces, including those countries that have really been in \nthe throes of the drug wars.\n  And then there is Iran and China and Russia, and we were sort of \nfloating in between. It is kind of embarrassing, as an American, to see \nthe United States not leading.\n  I come back to Washington, D.C., more committed than ever for the new \nadministration and the next Congress to be a voice of reform to change \nthese failed policies.\n  We need to put an end to the mindless military action and hard-edged \npolicies that fail and replace them with policies that will make a \ndifference, saving lives, and having effective regulations as tools.\n  Now, the United States is moving ahead at reform at the State and \nlocal levels. Forty States now provide some access to medical \nmarijuana. Four States and the District of Columbia deal with adult \nuse, and there will be four or five more States that will join this \nyear.\n  In 2019, when we go back to the United Nations, hopefully to be able \nto make some of these reforms, the world is going to look different.\n  First of all, there are moves in both Canada and Mexico to expand the \nuse of medical marijuana and to legalize adult use.\n  In 2019, virtually every American will have a legal access to medical \nmarijuana, and we will continue the action at the State level, making \nthose critical changes. Public opinion, once and for all, will be \nsettled in favor of regulation, taxation, and responsible adult use.\n  We will break the shackles of research on marijuana, where the \nFederal Government actually gets in the way of being able to have the \ninformation that the scientists and doctors can produce to settle the \nquestion so we don't have to guess.\n  I am hopeful that the United States will be on the right side of \nreform, that we will stop expensive and regressive policies that don't \nwork, and that we will be able to respond to the emerging American \nconsensus of the people at the State and local levels to do it better. \nThis is one effort we can't afford to fail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2000-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2000-H2001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING THE OUTSTANDING WORK OF ILLINIPAC\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Dold) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding work \nof IlliniPAC, a group of students on the University of Illinois Urbana-\nChampaign campus who are making a positive and important impact through \ntheir pro-Israel advocacy.\n  IlliniPAC is focused on building bridges throughout the student \ncommunity and educating fellow students of all backgrounds about \nIsrael.\n  At a time when there are so many concerted efforts to promote myths \nand terrible mistruths about Israel, the student leaders of IlliniPAC \nhave stepped forward with a positive message to highlight the \nimportance of a strong and bipartisan U.S.-Israel relationship.\n  I particularly want to commend IlliniPAC for its proactive and \nconstructive efforts to oppose misguided calls to promote boycotts, \ndivestment, and sanctioning, otherwise known as BDS, against Israel.\n  As the sponsor of the bipartisan Combating BDS Act of 2016 in \nCongress, I greatly appreciate the efforts by IlliniPAC to oppose BDS \ncampaigns targeting Israel. These BDS campaigns perpetuate damaging \nfalsehoods against Israel only to serve to divide and separate students \non campus.\n  The truth is that the BDS movement has neither brought Israelis and \nPalestinians closer to peace nor advanced the laudable goal of \nimproving dialogue between supporters of both sides. Instead, the BDS \nmovement has simply been employed as a hateful weapon to delegitimize \nIsrael and those who stand with her.\n  Once again I would like to thank IlliniPAC for taking a leadership \nrole on campus and for the work that they do to spread the positive \nmessage about Israel, an oasis of freedom, democracy, and tolerance in \none of the world's most volatile regions.\n\n\n             Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016\n\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, yesterday we in the House of Representatives \npassed the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important bipartisan effort to \nprotect our Great Lakes. I believe that, when it comes to our \nenvironment, we must all work together to strengthen conservation \nprograms and other policies that protect our natural resources.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am fortunate to represent Illinois' 10th Congressional \nDistrict, which borders one of our Nation's greatest treasures, Lake \nMichigan. Lake Michigan offers miles of beachfronts, natural habitats, \nrecreational space for all of those that visit her, as well as drinking \nwater for millions.\n  As a scoutmaster, I teach my Scouts that we should always leave or \nstrive to leave areas better than when we found them. Reauthorizing the \nGreat Lakes Restoration Initiative for the next 5 years will help us \nfulfill this goal with Lake Michigan.\n  I now urge the United States Senate to immediately take up and pass \nthis legislation. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative was introduced \nin the Senate by my friend and colleague, Senator Mark Kirk, who has \nbeen a fierce advocate for protecting Lake Michigan throughout his 15-\nyear career representing the people of Illinois.\n  Working together, we can protect our country's greater natural \nresources for future generations to enjoy.\n\n\n                      Congratulating Sherri Rukes\n\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Sherri Rukes, who \nwas awarded the Golden Apple Award for Excellence in Teaching by the \nGolden Apple Foundation.\n  Ms. Rukes has been an AP chemistry teacher at Libertyville High \nSchool for 19 years. She also was the coach of the robotics team and \nvolunteers with the science Olympiad and math team.\n  The Golden Apple is awarded to the best teachers in the entire \ncountry, and Ms. Rukes is very deserving of this prestigious \nrecognition. Her innovation and passion for teaching have made her an \noutstanding teacher who has bettered the lives of every student who \nentered her classroom.\n  Ms. Rukes plays an important role in educating and preparing our \nfuture leaders for success. I am happy to know that our students are \ngetting the outstanding education they need and deserve when they step \ninto her class.\n  I offer my congratulations to Ms. Rukes and to Libertyville High \nSchool for this well-deserved recognition.\n\n[[Page H2001]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2001-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1015\n                           ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nRhode Island (Mr. Cicilline) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 101st \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide. Over the years in Rhode Island, I \nhave spoken with many Armenian Americans who have recounted the stories \ntheir parents or grandparents told them about living through the horror \nof the Armenian genocide. Even after 100 years, there is still a deep \nwound in the heart of the Armenian people, particularly as genocide and \natrocious human rights violations continue to be used as weapons of war \nin the 21st century.\n  Today, hardly a week goes by without news of horrific human rights \nviolations somewhere around the world. The first step to stop these \nabuses is to acknowledge them for what they are and then to confront \nthem. That is why it is important that the United States Government \nfinally recognize and call the Armenian genocide what it is and what it \nwas: a systematic attempt by the Ottoman Empire to annihilate the \nArmenian people.\n  The challenges, of course, continue today for the people of Armenia. \nAll of us know that earlier this month, violence once again erupted in \nNagorno-Karabakh. President Serzh Sargsyan called it ``the most wide-\nscale military action that Azerbaijan has tried to carry out since the \nestablishment of the 1994 ceasefire regime.''\n  It is critical that the United States remain deeply engaged in \nresolving this conflict. I recently met with the Armenian Ambassador to \nthe United States, Ambassador Grigor Hovhannissian, to discuss \nrelations between our two countries and what role the United States \nmust play to help promote a resolution of this longstanding conflict. I \nhave received briefings on the current situation, and I will continue \nto advocate for critical American leadership to protect the innocent \nmen, women, and children who are living in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n  But as we address this current crisis, it is also critical that we \ncontinue to push for recognition of the Armenian genocide. History is \nclear: 101 years ago, 1\\1/2\\ million Armenian men, women, and children \nwere brutally and systematically murdered while living under the \nOttoman Empire. That is not an opinion, it is not an interpretation, \nand it is not an allegation. It is a fact.\n  In a cable sent to the U.S. Secretary of State on July 10, 1915, the \nU.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire confirmed the persecution of \nArmenians by ``systematic attempts to uproot peaceful Armenian \npopulations, and through arbitrary arrests, terrible tortures, \nwholesale expulsions, and deportations from one end of the empire to \nother accompanied by frequent instances of rape, pillage, and murder, \nturning into massacre, to bring destruction and destitution on them.''\n  After 101 years of waiting, it is time for our President and the \nUnited States Government to recognize this fact and to acknowledge this \natrocity as the first genocide of the 21st century. Armenia is an \nimportant friend and ally of the United States, and it is critical that \nwe stand with our friends and honestly acknowledge the evil of the \nArmenian genocide.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to leave you with the words of \nPope Francis who last year reminded all of us that ``whenever memory \nfades, it means that evil allows wounds to fester. Concealing or \ndenying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without \nbandaging it.''\n  After more than 100 years of waiting, it is time for the United \nStates Government to finally recognize the Armenian genocide as the \nfirst genocide of the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2001-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2001-H2002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONFRONTING HEROIN AND OPIOID ABUSE CRISIS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Zeldin) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, the rapid rise in drug abuse across America, \nspecifically the sharp increase in heroin and prescription opioid \nabuse, has severely impacted our local communities and has become a \nmajor issue across our country.\n  Tragically, 78 people each day will lose their battle with addiction \nand their life as a result of an opioid or heroin overdose. Sadly, with \nthe trends moving the way they are, this number will only continue to \nincrease. According to the CDC, in 2014, over 28,000 people lost their \nlives due to prescription opioid pain relievers or heroin. This was the \nhighest recorded number of overdose deaths of any year. Newsday on Long \nIsland just reported an increase in overdose deaths in our region, \nstating that 442 people died of a heroin or opiate overdose in 2014, a \nnumber that has increased from 403 overdose deaths the prior year.\n  Addiction is a devastating disease that takes hold of our loved ones \nand impacts everyone around that person. This is a lonely and \nheartbreaking disease that is taking lives, tearing families apart, and \ndestroying our communities. It must be stopped.\n  In a report that highlights the growing drug abuse epidemic sweeping \nacross our Nation, the CDC found that over the past decade, heroin use \nhas doubled among young adults ages 18 to 25, and heroin-related \noverdose deaths have nearly quadrupled, with every 6 out of 10 drug \noverdoses linked to opioids or heroin. The CDC also found that almost \nhalf of the people who use heroin are also struggling with a \nprescription opioid addiction. As drug abuse continues to rise, \nclaiming lives and grabbing hold of our youth, it is clear that we must \ncome together to address this crisis.\n  Throughout my time in the New York State Senate, and now in the \nUnited States Congress, one of my top priorities has been to support \nlegislation to help those coping with drug addiction by increasing \ntreatment and recovery services.\n  One piece of legislation I am proud to support and cosponsor is H.R. \n953, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, also known as CARA. \nCARA would prevent and treat addiction on a local level through \ncommunity-based education, prevention, treatment, and recovery \nservices. The grants made available through this bill would also \nprovide the necessary funding to expand prescription drug monitoring in \nStates all throughout our country.\n  Additionally, CARA provides funding to supply our police force and \nemergency medical responders with higher quantities of Naloxone, a \nmedication that is proven to reverse an opioid overdose. Since this \nbill was introduced at the beginning of last year, I have been pushing \nfor a vote on CARA in the House. Just last month, the United States \nSenate passed this bill with an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 94-1. \nNow it is time to bring this bill to the House floor.\n  As a member of the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin \nEpidemic, passage in the House of CARA is a top priority of mine, and I \nwill keep fighting so that we can pass this essential piece of \nlegislation and send it to the President's desk for his signature.\n  There are many other bills, other than CARA, such as the Stop \nOverdose Stat Act, H.R. 2850. There are bills like the Examining Opioid \nTreatment Infrastructure Act of 2016, which would require the \nComptroller General to issue a report to Congress on substance abuse \ntreatment availability and infrastructure needs across the country, as \nwell as legislation that would task the FDA to create a plan on how to \ndeal with the opioid and heroin epidemic, H.R. 4976.\n  Fighting drug abuse must be an effort at all levels of government, \nbut it also must be a community effort as well. That is why I have \nhosted press conferences and panel discussions, including a community \nsummit and drug task force roundtable on Long Island to bring together \nlocal elected officials, law enforcement, health professionals, \ncommunity groups, parents, concerned residents, and recovering \nsubstance abusers so that we can all develop and pursue necessary \nsolutions.\n  The House is also expected to take up legislation to stop the flow of \nillegal substances into our country, such as H.R. 3380, which would \nhelp law enforcement officials identify and target drug traffickers; \nand H.R. 4985, which makes it easier to prosecute drug traffickers.\n  We must all continue to support legislation that addresses the rise \nin heroin and opioid abuse to stop this tragic loss of life, family, \nand community as a\n\n[[Page H2002]]\n\nresult of addiction. It is impacting our districts all across America. \nIt is our duty while we are here, as Members of Congress, to do \neverything in our power to address this now, to turn the tide, to fight \nback, and to save families that are being torn apart. That is why I \nsupport all of these great bills that are moving through the process \nhere in the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2002-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 101st \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide and honor the lives of 1.5 million \nArmenians who were killed between 1915 and 1923 by the Ottoman Empire. \nThe Republic of Turkey, sadly, continues to try to silence the voices \nof the survivors and their descendants around the world, but we will \nnever forget nor will we be intimidated into silence.\n  Several years ago I told the foreign minister of Turkey, who is now \nthe President, that Turkey must recognize the genocide and put this \nchapter of history to rest. It is extremely frustrating that Turkey \ncontinues to ignore what really happened, but in addition to that, it \nis very disappointing and unacceptable that President Obama failed once \nagain to call the murder of 1.5 million Armenians a genocide--because \nthat is what it was.\n  Recognizing the Armenian genocide is not something to be debated. The \nEurope Parliament has gone on record of recognizing the genocide, and \nlast year Pope Francis spoke of the tragedy that took place, the \nArmenian genocide. Scholars and historians acknowledge that the \nsystematic killings and deportations that took place constituted a \ngenocide.\n  I, however, simply do not have to rely on the word of historians. \nGrowing up in the San Joaquin Valley in the Fresno area, I heard \nstories from my friends and neighbors, the Kezerians, the Abrahamians, \nand the Koligians, whose families experienced the horrors at the hands \nof the Ottoman Empire.\n  As we reflect on this day, it is equally fitting to honor the \nhundreds of thousands of Armenian men and women who bravely began new \nlives in the United States after witnessing unspeakable tragedies to \ntheir families and in their villages. Survivors and their descendants, \nmany of whom settled in California, have become bright examples of what \nit means to live the American Dream in their own diaspora.\n  I would like to use this opportunity to tell you of an experience \nlast Friday in Fresno. I had the distinct honor of participating in a \nwreath-laying event with leaders of the Armenian community and the \nArmenian National Committee of America, its national chairman, Raffi \nHamparian.\n  I want to take this opportunity to honor someone who brought a sense \nof justice to those who perished during that time. We want to recognize \na true Armenian hero, Soghomon Tehlirian. As a part of Operation \nNemesis, planned by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, Soghomon \nTehlirian assassinated Talaat Pasha, who was the last prime minister of \nthe Ottoman Empire and the orchestrator of the Armenian genocide.\n  This was an act of justice served on behalf of the Armenian people. \nTehlirian was acquitted of the charges by a jury in Germany in the \n1920s and later moved to Serbia, and then to San Francisco, California. \nHe died in 1960 and is buried at the Ararat Massis Armenian Cemetery in \nFresno, California, which then was the only Armenian cemetery in the \ncountry.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me and the Armenians throughout the \nNation and throughout the world in honoring Mr. Tehlirian and to also \npay tribute to the 1.5 million lives lost in the genocide--the first \ngenocide in the 20th century--as well as their descendants who live \ntoday, for we must never ever forget the history. As Santayana once \nsaid: Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.\n\n\n                               Denim Day\n\n  Mr. COSTA.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Perry) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, this year, job creators should expect \nsignificant changes to Federal wage and hour laws, throwing yet one \nmore hurdle in front of them and their employees as the U.S. Department \nof Labor, the DOL, finalizes new overtime regulations under the Fair \nLabor Standards Act, or the FLSA.\n  The basic premise of the FLSA, which applies to many Pennsylvania \nemployers, is that if you are receiving a salary, it must be because \nyour employer is cheating you. The rule that has the force of law \ndiscourages salaried employees and discourages the give-and-take \nbetween employee and employer to work for the best interest of each \none.\n  There are limited exceptions to the FLSA's overtime obligations for \nnarrow categories of employees and for those in particular industries \nand occupations. The most common exemptions are for white-collar \nemployees like executive, administrative, and professional employees.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Currently, an employee must satisfy three criteria to qualify as \nexempt from Federal overtime pay: first, you must make a salary; \nsecond, your salary must be more than $455 per week, or $23,660 \nannually; and third, your primary duties must be consistent with \nmanagerial, professional, or administrative positions as defined by the \nDepartment of Labor. They don't know every single job in every \ncommunity across the country, but yet they are the ones that decide, \nnot the people actually doing the work or the ones who started and own \nthe business.\n  Last year, the DOL proposed arbitrarily increasing the salary \nthreshold to $50,440 per year, a 113 percent increase, just arbitrarily \nsaid that is the way it is going to be. It also proposed automatically \nincreasing the salary threshold on an annual basis regardless of what \nthe economy is. If the economy grew at 4 percent, I guess it would be \none thing. If it didn't grow or it grew at 0.3 percent, which is what \nGDP is currently, it would still go up--again, just arbitrary. This \ndoesn't come from Congress. This isn't bandied back and forth between \nthe Democrats and the Republicans, between the House and the Senate. \nThis is just bureaucrats making a rule, the force of law.\n  These proposed rules will bring sweeping changes to Federal wage and \nhour laws, and they will be especially burdensome on rural areas, like \ncentral Pennsylvania. They will also significantly impact local \ngovernments, nonprofit organizations, and small retailers, among many \nothers.\n  Because of this rule, for instance, a dry cleaner that I met with \nrecently simply is going to have to make a choice. They are either \ngoing to hire fewer people or raise prices for their customers.\n  I recently met with county commissioners in the district I am \nprivileged to represent. If the requirement is raised, as DOL proposes, \n50 county employees will be affected, which will result in either fewer \nemployees or nearly $400,000 in expenses for the county moving forward. \nHow do you think they are going to offset those costs if they don't \nlose those employees or fire those employees? You guessed it. You and I \nare going to pay--the local taxpayers.\n  I also met with the YWCA in my district, a nonprofit organization. \nThey looked at the potential impact of these regulations and determined \nthat approximately 30 staff members would be affected, resulting in \neither a loss of\n\n[[Page H2003]]\n\njobs or an additional expense of over $200,000. For a nonprofit that is \nstruggling to get by, struggling to provide services--whether it is a \ndaycare for underprivileged folks--or just to keep the doors open, they \nare going to have to make a choice, all because of a rule that didn't \ncome from here. It came from the regulators, as usual, who aren't \ninterested in the input of the Nation's citizens in all too many cases. \nThis is just another example of bureaucrats of the administrative \nstate--in this case, the Department of Labor--developing top-down \nregulations that crush organizations like nonprofits, small businesses, \nand communities that can least afford it.\n  For this reason, I am happy to support a solution. We shouldn't have \nto provide this solution because this is really a problem that doesn't \nexist. But there is a solution, the Protecting Workplace Advancement \nand Opportunity Act, introduced by my colleague from Michigan, Mr. Tim \nWalberg, which prevents the DOL from implementing this misguided and \ncompletely unnecessary proposal and rule. I strongly urge other Members \nto support this important legislation as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2003-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VISIT TO GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Curbelo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, I visited \nU.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, a critical military national \nsecurity asset serving key roles in the war on terrorism, drug and \nmigrant interdiction, and as a strategic forward base for the Atlantic \nFleet. Every day, approximately 7,000 U.S. military personnel and \ncontractors go to work at GTMO to keep our country safe and to advance \nour national security interests in the Americas and throughout the \nworld.\n  I had the privilege of meeting with Captain Culpepper, the base \ncommander, who briefed us on the base's preparedness to assist with \nmajor migrant events in the Caribbean. This is important, considering \nthe significant increase in Cubans fleeing the island over the last \nyear.\n  I also met with Rear Admiral Clarke, who serves as Commander of the \nJoint Task Force Guantanamo. The JTF is working professionally and \ndiligently to provide safe, humane, legal, and transparent care and \ncustody of detainees. I was able to inspect the detention facilities, \nand I was impressed with efforts to treat the detainees with dignity \nand respect.\n  Our brave young people in uniform do an extraordinary job of \nrepresenting our country, sometimes under very difficult circumstances, \nin this theater. Mr. Speaker, the men and women of Naval Air Station \nGuantanamo, the Joint Task Force, and the Marines who protect the base \nperimeter deserve the admiration, appreciation, and support of the \nAmerican people and this Congress.\n  I thank my colleague from south Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for \nleading our visit to GTMO. I urge all of my colleagues to work to \nprotect and strengthen this critical military asset.\n\n\n                Zika Eradication and Good Government Act\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the Zika virus has wreaked havoc \nthroughout Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. We have \nseen countless pregnant women infected, resulting in devastating fetal \nbrain defects on their newborn children.\n  As of mid-April, 87 cases of Zika have been identified in Florida, \nand another 380 cases have been reported across the country. We must be \nprepared for the first domestic transmission of the virus, especially \nas the summer mosquito season begins and international travel is more \nfrequent.\n  For these reasons, I have filed H.R. 5031, the Zika Eradication and \nGood Government Act. This bill will ensure no new funds are made \navailable for Zika until all unspent Ebola money is disbursed, which \nthe President already said he would do in early April.\n  This bill will also direct all Federal agencies that receive funds to \ncombat Zika to work in collaboration and share best practice methods.\n  Finally, this bill will require a report from the President to \nCongress each month when any future funds are appropriated for Zika, \ndetailing the obligations, expenditures, and effectiveness of the \nprogram.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support the President's call for funding emergency \nlegislation to ensure Zika is eradicated. I also want to make sure the \nfunds are spent wisely and effectively in fighting this virus.\n  This bill is an important first step forward. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor the Zika Eradication and Good Government Act.\n\n\n                        Criminal Justice Reform\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the need \nto improve our prisons and criminal justice system here in the United \nStates.\n  Currently, there are more than 2 million individuals who are \nincarcerated in our country, the majority of whom committed nonviolent \noffenses.\n  Last December, I had the opportunity to visit with over 20 inmates at \nDade Correctional Institution in south Florida. These individuals were \nvisibly moved that someone had taken the time to speak with them and \nlearn about their struggles. I felt very fortunate to have had the \nopportunity to hear their stories.\n  Criminal justice reform is desperately needed in our country, and it \nis vital that we break the school-to-prison pipeline and ensure that \nthose who have served their time have a second chance at success.\n  For all these reasons, I signed the Second Chance Petition, to allow \nnonviolent offenders to recover with dignity and become active members \nof their communities.\n  With this week's Criminal Justice Summit taking place at the White \nHouse, I call on all of my colleagues to build on this momentum and \nmeet with inmates to learn from their experiences. I am a cosponsor of \nbipartisan bills focused on criminal justice reform and look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to get these bills signed into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2003-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2003-H2004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING JIM BRADEN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jim \nBraden, pictured here with his granddaughter Cates. Jim is a native of \nRipley, West Virginia, who is being honored on April 30 for his \nsignificant accomplishments and contributions to the coaching of young \nmen and women for over 52 years in Tennessee and West Virginia.\n  Jim Braden's roots in Jackson County, West Virginia, baseball began \nwith his father, Ed Braden. Ed Braden was a member of the Sandy Valley \nbaseball club in the 1940s, which received numerous county pennants \nthat earned them the right to play in the Little World Series.\n  Ed built houses to accommodate the influx of people relocating to \nwork at the new Kaiser Aluminum plant in the 1960s. He also founded \nBraden Plumbing and Heating in Ripley and was responsible for \ninstalling the first bathrooms in many Jackson County homes. Throughout \nthe years, Ed was a staple at Ripley High School baseball and other \nathletic events.\n  While at Ripley High School, Jim Braden was in a car accident that \ncut his baseball career short. Once he recovered from the accident, \nJim, still a high school student in Ripley, West Virginia, started \ncoaching youth sports teams.\n  After a brief period at Glenville State College, Jim Braden proudly \nserved our country for years in the Vietnam war as a part of a U.S. \nNavy helicopter squadron.\n  Upon returning to the United States, he took employment as a teacher \nat Roane-Jackson Technical Center.\n  Jim moved to Farragut, Tennessee, in 1980, and enjoyed a long career \nas an industrial sales consultant. But he took his love of baseball \nand, most notably, his Cincinnati Reds with him, never forgetting his \nWest Virginia roots. His sister, Pam Braden, is on the board of Ripley \nConvention & Visitors Bureau.\n  Braden and his wife, Catherine, raised their two children, Laura and \nMark, while Braden continued coaching baseball, basketball, and \nfootball. In Farragut, Braden was instrumental in organizing and \nimplementing the countywide Knox County Middle Schools baseball league. \nHe created the Dugout Club's Web page and continues\n\n[[Page H2004]]\n\nto serve as one of its Web masters. He also serves as a guiding force \nto help raise funds for facilities and other activities supporting \nFarragut baseball.\n  Braden has coached numerous Division I and professional baseball \nplayers, including former Minnesota Twins pitcher Kyle Waldrop, Eli \nLorg, and Cale Lorg. He also coached White Sox player Nicky Delmonico, \nCurt Powell from the Detroit Tigers organization, Nick Williams from \nthe Marlins organization, and Philip Pfeifer from the Dodgers \norganization.\n  Thank you, Coach Braden, for your service to our country and for \ncoaching generations of young baseball players.\n\n\n                     Congratulating Brittany French\n\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \ncongratulate Ms. Brittany French of Berkeley County, West Virginia, for \nbeing named the National Volunteer Fire Council's Junior Firefighter of \nthe Year.\n  As a member of the Junior Volunteer Fire Company and the Volunteer \nFire Department in Hedgesville, Brittany is a third-generation \nfirefighter.\n  Brittany has continually demonstrated a passion for learning about \nhealth and emergency services. She studied these subjects, earning \nseveral certifications at James Rumsey Technical Institute during her \njunior and senior years in high school. She is now enrolled in the \nparamedic course at Blue Ridge Community and Technical College, \nallowing her to continue her education while still serving her \ncommunity.\n  Brittany clearly enjoys helping others and has excelled in doing so. \nShe previously won first place in EMT skills in a statewide health \ncompetition. She has helped the fire department fundraise, and she \ncontinues to be actively involved in her church.\n  Brittany is among West Virginia's most devoted young leaders. I am \nhonored to join her family, friends, and the dedicated firefighters \nwith whom she works in congratulating Brittany on being named the \nNational Volunteer Fire Council's Junior Firefighter of the Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2004-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SEXUAL ASSAULT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an issue that has \nimpacted millions of Americans from coast to coast, north to south, \nalso an issue that has impacted my family personally. Mr. Speaker, I \ncare deeply about the survivors of sexual assault and want to ensure \nthat their voices are heard.\n  Every 2 minutes, Mr. Speaker, an American is sexually assaulted. That \nis 200,000 of our fellow American citizens that are impacted by this \nhorrendous crime. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, less than half of those victims \nwill report their attack to law enforcement, making sexual assault one \nof the most underreported crimes in America.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  That is why I am proud to stand with my colleague from California, \nJackie Speier, to introduce a resolution to recognize April as Sexual \nAssault Awareness and Prevention Month.\n  As Members of Congress, we are in a unique position to raise \nawareness and speak out on behalf of sexual assault survivors. We must \nunite. When one in five women will be raped in her lifetime, we cannot \nafford to stand silent on this issue.\n  It is only right, Mr. Speaker, that we say enough is enough with \nsexual assault in America. Enough is enough to no longer speak about \nthis issue because it is something that is difficult to speak publicly \nabout.\n  That is why I am an ardent and active supporter of the NO MORE \nCampaign. The NO MORE Campaign has taken it upon itself to unite across \nthe country, to stand in one voice, and many of us across America have \nseen the commercials on our TVs to say no more to sexual assault.\n  No more can we put up with excuses like: ``She deserved it.'' ``She \nwas drunk.'' ``Of course she got what she was looking for.'' No more \ncan we say: ``Well, that is what boys do. That is what young men do.''\n  We need to stand together as American citizens, men and women in this \nChamber, to say: No more to sexual assault. It is unacceptable for us \nto stand silent any longer.\n  I ask my colleagues to join us in the effort to recognize April as \nSexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month and join us in one voice \nto send a clear message across America to say: No more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2004-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2004-H2005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HONORING DUNBAR HIGH SCHOOL'S BOYS BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Barr) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the boys basketball team at \nPaul Laurence Dunbar High School in Lexington, which is my hometown, \nfor winning the Kentucky High School Athletic Association's State \nchampionship, better known in Kentucky as the Sweet Sixteen.\n  As everyone knows, Kentucky is a basketball-crazy State, and this is \na great accomplishment. This is the school's first-ever State \nchampionship in boys' basketball and the first championship for a \nLexington high school since 2001.\n  In the first three games of the tournament, the Bulldogs posted come-\nfrom-behind wins over Mercer County, Bowling Green, and Newport Central \nCatholic to reach the finals.\n  However, in the final game, led by junior Taveion Hollingsworth, who \nwas the tournament MVP, they led wire to wire, defeating Louisville's \nDoss High School 61-52. Like any successful endeavor, the victory was \nwon by dedication, hours of practice, determination, and teamwork.\n  I congratulate the students, head coach Scott Chalk, and the entire \ncoaching staff on the State championship. I am proud to honor Dunbar \nHigh School before the United States House of Representatives.\n\n\n                 Honoring Prevent Child Abuse Kentucky\n\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of National Child Abuse \nPrevention Month and to highlight the work of Prevent Child Abuse \nKentucky.\n  This organization is on the front lines to make sure Kentucky's \nchildren are raised in safe, loving homes and are not abused, \nmistreated, or neglected. It develops and promotes effective strategies \nand programs through community involvement, public education, and \nadvocacy.\n  Efforts are centered on recognizing the inherent potential and \ngoodness of children, on strengthening families, and on empowering the \ncommunity to become involved with this important mission.\n  This cause is personal to me. As the father of two girls and as the \nformer president of the board of directors of Prevent Child Abuse \nKentucky, I am incredibly proud of the good work this group does every \nsingle day for Kentucky's children and all year long.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will join me in thanking Prevent Child \nAbuse Kentucky and similar organizations around the country as we \nrecognize National Child Abuse Prevention Month.\n\n\n                         Honoring Dinny Phipps\n\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Mr. Ogden \n``Dinny'' Phipps for his contributions to the American thoroughbred \nhorse-racing industry and in remembrance of a legend in the sport of \nkings.\n  Mr. Phipps leaves a proud legacy in his having made a profound and \npositive impact on the game for many decades. As an owner and breeder, \nMr. Phipps owned and reared numerous champions, including the 1993 \nKentucky Oaks winner Dispute, the 2005 Breeders' Cup Distaff winner \nPleasant Home, and, most recently, the 2013 winner of the Kentucky \nDerby, Orb.\n  However, one could argue that Mr. Phipps' greatest impact was felt \nbeyond the racetrack, as he was a steadfast advocate for the industry \nand served the racing community as an industry executive.\n  From 1983 until his recent retirement in 2015, Mr. Phipps served as \nchairman of The Jockey Club, the official breed registry of the \nthoroughbred industry. He also served as a longtime member of the New \nYork Racing Association, serving as the Association's chairman from \n1976 to 1983.\n  Mr. Phipps' love of this great American pastime will leave an \nenduring mark on the thoroughbred industry. Mr. Phipps is survived by \nhis wife, Andrea, and his children, Kayce, Kelley, Lilly, Daisy, \nSamantha, and Ogden.\n\n[[Page H2005]]\n\n  I extend my deepest sympathy to the Phipps' family, and I join my \nfellow Americans in honoring the life, contributions, and service of \nOgden ``Dinny'' Phipps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2005-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to welcome my good friend, Pastor Wade \nStevenson from Waukegan, Illinois, in Illinois' 10th Congressional \nDistrict.\n  For his entire life, Pastor Stevenson has been called to serve \nothers. Pastor Stevenson is the head pastor at Gideon Baptist Church in \nWaukegan, and at Gideon, he helps to bring God's grace and the word of \nthe Lord to our community.\n  Pastor Stevenson is the president of the North Shore Baptist \nMinisters' Alliance and the second vice president of the Lake County \nChapter of the NAACP. His numerous public recognitions and appointments \nreveal a life of public service to the people of our community.\n  But Pastor Stevenson's role in our community can't be summed up by a \nlist of titles or awards. Since he became pastor of Gideon Baptist \nChurch more than 10 years ago, he has become a beacon of hope for \ncountless people in our community. Pastor Stevenson is one of the first \npeople in our community that people turn to when they are looking for \nguidance, both spiritual or otherwise.\n  I have been blessed to work side by side with him to distribute \nThanksgiving turkeys to families in need. His dedication has brought \njoy to countless families around the holidays year in and year out.\n  It is a great honor to welcome my friend, Pastor Stevenson, to the \nHouse of Representatives today, and I am confident that the blessings \nhe brings will serve us well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2005-7", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Valadao).

Mr. Speaker, 19 students from Valley View High School \nin my hometown of Jonesboro, Arkansas, have been studying our Nation's \nconstitutional democracy for several months in an intensive course. The \ncourse called We the People is taught to students particularly \ninterested in the history and principles of the United States \nGovernment.\n  Last week, those students put their knowledge to the ultimate test in \nWashington, D.C. They competed in a simulated congressional hearing by \nevaluating, taking, and defending positions on a variety of historical \nand contemporary issues. Our government functions more efficiently when \npassionate citizens engage in the political and policymaking process, \nand I am proud that these students are already preparing themselves for \nthat process through their education.\n  Traci Smith, the group's civics teacher, deserves our thanks and \nrespect for the incredibly important role that she plays in preparing \nour rising generation. I would also like to applaud the efforts of the \nWe the People Arkansas State coordinator, Jeff Whittingham, associate \nprofessor at the University of Central Arkansas who has done such a \nremarkable job through the years organizing and directing the We the \nPeople program for our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2005-9", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AUTHORIZING DAVID'S SLING WEAPON SYSTEM\n\n  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HIGGINS.

The Rhode Island School for the Deaf \noffers essential support, guidance, and information for deaf and \nhearing-impaired children from the moment they are born until they are \nready to graduate high school and go on to college or a career.\n  The Rhode Island School for the Deaf's Parent Infant Partners program \nhelps children develop English and American Sign Language skills at an \nearly age. Its elementary, middle, and senior high school programs \nprovide quality education, as well as vocational programs and \nopportunities to participate fully in social activities and athletic \nevents alongside hearing children.\n  I applaud the extraordinary educators and staff at the Rhode Island \nSchool for the Deaf for their ongoing work to serve deaf and hearing-\nimpaired children, and I congratulate them on their 125th birthday \ncelebration this Friday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2006-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CELEBRATING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF BOB EPLING IN SOUTH FLORIDA\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

Bob earned this \ninstallment in part because of his arduous work as president of the \nOrange Bowl Committee. He also serves as chairman of Tomorrow's South \nDade, a project of vision that addresses business development, \ninfrastructure, agriculture, and other issues that impact the residents \nof south Dade.\n  Another testament to Bob's commitment to our community was as \nchairman of the board of the International Hurricane Research Center \nwhere he spent countless hours helping to rebuild homestead following \nthe devastating impact of Hurricane Andrew.\n  Bob has also been the recipient of numerous accolades, including the \nFlorida Bankers Association Legends Award, as well as the University \nDistinguished Service Award and FIU Medallion, both from my alma mater, \nFlorida International University.\n  I encourage our community to join me in honoring Bob Epling and his \ncontributions to the agricultural sector at this Saturday's Dade County \nFarm Bureau's Annual Barbecue and ``Fun'' Raiser.\n  Congratulations, Bob, on a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2006-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HAZING IN THE MILITARY\n\n  (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, this month marks the fifth \nanniversary of the death of my nephew, Harry Lew. While deployed in \nAfghanistan, Harry was hazed and brutally assaulted by his fellow \nmarines for almost 4 hours. Twenty minutes later, he took his own life. \nHe was 21 years old.\n  Harry's story is not unique. I have now heard from families and \nservicemembers across the country who have their own tragic stories and \ntried to seek help, but many are at a loss of where to turn. That is \nbecause the Pentagon's guidance on hazing is unclear, inconsistent, and \nimperfectly applied. Without an accurate system of tracking hazing \nincidents, we have no way to actually know the full extent of the \nproblem. This failure costs lives.\n  It is time the military treat this problem seriously. My bill, the \nHarry Lew Military Hazing Accountability and Prevention Act, would \nrequire the Department of Defense to track and report annually on the \nproblem of hazing in the military.\n  Our men and women in uniform protect us. We must do what we can to \nprotect them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2006-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF REGNAL WALLACE\n\n  (Mr. ABRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of \nRegnal Wallace, the ``Original Voice of Louisiana Agriculture.''\n  It is a nickname he earned for good reason. When you heard his voice \non the radio, you knew immediately that it was Reg. As a farmer myself, \nI knew I always needed to listen up because what he was going to tell \nme was important.\n  In 1981, Reg launched ``This Week in Louisiana Agriculture,'' a show \nhe imagined as a new way to tell the public about the incredible work \ntaking place in the fields and processing plants across the State by \nsome of the hardest working men and women in Louisiana.\n  Thirty-five years later, this show is still carried by 18 affiliates \nin Louisiana and nationwide by RFD-TV, bringing the story of \nagriculture to 400,000 people each week.\n  Reg died earlier this month at his home in Franklin Parish, which I \nrepresent. Those of us in Louisiana will be forever grateful for Reg's \ncontributions to agriculture in our State and the life he dedicated to \nserving farmers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2006-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING JUSTICE LAURA LIU\n\n  (Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. QUIGLEY.

She fought a courageous battle against breast cancer for 5 years, \nand her spirit, passion, and determination never faltered.\n  Born to immigrant parents, Justice Liu didn't start speaking English \nuntil elementary school, but ended up as class valedictorian.\n  For nearly 20 years, Justice Liu worked as a litigator, then as a \ncircuit court judge, and finally was appointed to the Illinois \nAppellate Court. In the court, Justice Liu was a strong advocate for \ninterpreter services for immigrants and people with limited English who \nmight have been otherwise overwhelmed.\n  She was a tremendous advocate and mentor to Chicago's Chinese \nAmerican community, setting an exemplary model for young boys and girls \nthat their opportunities were endless if you worked hard.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with Justice Liu's family during this \ndifficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2006-6", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2006-H2007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MANAGING WILD HORSES AND BURROS\n\n  (Mr. STEWART asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, the BLM just announced that it would \nsignificantly cut grazing allotments and possibly eliminate all cattle \ngrazing on Federal lands in Elko, Nevada, to accommodate the \noverpopulation of wild horses. Many rural areas in my district are \nfacing the exact identical situation where wild horses are taking over \nthe ranges.\n  I grew up ranching and riding horses, and I desperately want to \nprotect them. But with 50,000 wild horses on\n\n[[Page H2007]]\n\nranges in the West--which is double what the land can sustain--the \nranges are overgrazed, and now horses are starving to death.\n  Not only are the current conditions inhumane, but due to the \noverpopulation, the Federal Government is forced to house an additional \n50,000 horses at a cost of $55,000 per horse.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me to look for solutions to this \nproblem. One solution is my bill, the Wild Horse Oversight Act, which \nwould simply allow States to manage wild horses and burros.\n  If you care about these horses like I do, then help me solve the \nproblem.

Unfortunately, House Republican \nleadership has not responded with anything but inaction and \nindifference.\n  As reported by Roll Call: ``an average of 78 people are dying every \nday from opioid overdoses, and mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus have \nbeen found in 30 States. But Congress has shown no urgency about \naddressing those issues.

For many \nyears after the community's founding, it was advertised as a mountain \nresort location,\n\n[[Page H2008]]\n\nwith several large hotels built there before the turn of the 20th \ncentury.\n  Although it was the railroad that built Renovo and its mountain \nlocation that attracted travelers, the lumbering industry formed the \nbedrock of the town's heritage and economy. Clinton County's timber \nindustry continues to thrive, contributing more than $90 million to the \neconomy of that county.\n  Many celebrations are planned in May to mark Renovo Borough's \nanniversary, including a parade along Erie Street, the opening of a \ntime capsule, and a firework display.\n  I want to commend the local officials and the residents of Renovo and \nthe surrounding areas of western Clinton County for this recognition of \ntheir long history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2008-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNIZING THE RICHMOND HILL HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND\n\n  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the \nRichmond Hill High School marching band for being selected to perform \nin the 2016 National Cherry Blossom Parade.\n  The Richmond Hill band has gained many accolades and enjoyed numerous \nsuccesses since its beginning 9 years ago. Membership in the band has \nbecome popular among students, as it has grown from an original 90 \nmusicians to nearly 200. The band has also competed and performed \nacross the State of Georgia and twice at Universal Studios in Florida.\n  The selection process to perform at the National Cherry Blossom \nParade is highly competitive. High schools, universities, and specialty \nmarching bands from all across the U.S. apply to march in the parade. \nCrowds of people line the streets, and thousands at home watch on TV as \nthese bands march down Constitution Avenue.\n  The band also used the visit to Washington as an educational \nexperience. The students spent time visiting many museums and monuments \non The National Mall.\n  It is with great pride that I rise today to honor the members of the \nRichmond Hill marching band for their hard work, determination, and \nperseverance to become a successful marching band. It is truly an honor \nfor them to perform at the parade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2008-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2008-H2014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4498, HELPING ANGELS LEAD OUR \n                              STARTUPS ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I \ncall up House Resolution 701 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H.

The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 \nhour.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield \nthe customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMcGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nDuring consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the \npurpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and \nthe underlying legislation, which will benefit small innovative \ncompanies and startups by ensuring that they have access to the \nnecessary capital to succeed, grow, and create jobs in their companies.\n  But I also stand up today to make sure that we are here for a \nmarketplace that is fair and equitable to all Americans, regardless of \nwhether they work for a small company or a large company, whether they \nare a big-time investor or whether they are a person who is looking at \nthe marketplace, perhaps, with ideas and opportunities.\n  Last night, the Rules Committee met and reported a structured rule \nfor H.R. 4498, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups, or the HALOS, Act. \nThe rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided between the chair \nand ranking member of the Financial Services Committee.\n  I also want to point out that the Rules Committee asked all of our \nMembers of this body to submit their ideas and amendments. As a result, \nthis resolution makes in order all of the amendments that were \nsubmitted. That is important because what this Rules Committee is \nattempting to accomplish is to ask all of the Members for their \nfeedback about how to make bills better; and in this case, when \nsomething was germane, it was made in order.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission has a three-pronged statutory \nmission in overseeing U.S. capital markets: to protect investors; to \nmaintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and to facilitate \ncapital formation.\n  Unfortunately, the SEC historically has ignored its mandate to \nfacilitate capital formation in the absence of congressionally mandated \nrulemakings.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  The SEC's inability to fulfill its statutory mandate is ultimately to \nthe detriment of entrepreneurs, smaller companies, and startup \nventures, such as Teladoc, the Nation's first and largest telehealth \nplatform, which had it not received startup investment, may not have \nexisted at all.\n  To remedy the SEC's inaction on capital formation, my colleagues and \nI passed the bipartisan Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS Act, \nwhich was signed into law on April 5, 2012. The recognition that we had \nproblems in the marketplace for smaller companies and smaller groups of \npeople to bring their ideas to the marketplace was a huge impediment \nbased upon the SEC, and that is why this JOBS Act was created.\n  Although startups and small businesses are at the forefront of \ntechnological innovation and job creation, they often still face \nsignificant and unnecessary obstacles in obtaining funding in the \ncapital markets. The JOBS Act lifted the burden of certain securities \nregulations to help small companies obtain access to these important \nmarkets, but we are back at the table again.\n  Unfortunately, when the SEC promulgated rules to implement the JOBS \nAct, it classified events held by angel investors as general \nsolicitations, and thus, they were subject to accredited investor \nmandates, yet another example of the Federal Government's creating \nunnecessary red tape, stifling innovation, and quite honestly, making \nit hard for smaller, single entrepreneurs to participate in a worldwide \nmarketplace.\n  This new classification is burdensome and it jeopardizes educational \nand economic development for events like demo days. Demo days are held \nin marketplaces all across our country. It is an opportunity for not \njust investors, but for general communities to come, primarily in the \ntech field, and learn about the newest startups as they are occurring. \nWhen startups interact with angel investors and venture capitalists, it \nmeans that best ideas can then be brought forward to create more jobs, \ninvestment, and can move forward so an idea that perhaps was on \nsomebody's blackboard goes directly to the marketplace.\n  Demo days have been an important part of the entrepreneurial \nfinancing\n\n[[Page H2009]]\n\nprocess for decades--nothing new--often with lead sponsorships by \nFederal, State, and local governments, which are bringing these best \nideas into play for the marketplace to see not only about the idea, but \nfor it to become a reality in an economic development format.\n  To be clear, demo days have existed long before the passage of the \nJOBS Act and have created collaborative and engaging educational \nenvironments that have brought together startups, leading-edge thought \nleaders, young programmers, people who are looking to network, and, I \nthink, an overall more diverse network of individuals that is looking \nto exchange ideas. These are the kind of educational incubators that \nour country needs more of, not less of.\n  We are here today because the SEC developed rules that would change \ndemo days greatly--and other activities like this--to the detriment of \nthe marketplace, yes, but, more importantly, to the detriment of small \nbusiness and entrepreneurs.\n  To address the SEC's burdensome rule, Congressman Steve Chabot from \nOhio, the chairman of the Committee on Small Business, introduced H.R. \n4498, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act. This legislation \ndefines an ``angel investor group'' and clarifies that the Securities \nAct's general solicitation limitations do not apply to a presentation, \ncommunication, or event conducted on behalf of an issuer at an event \nthat is sponsored by certain organizations; where any advertising for \nthe event does not reference any specific offering of securities by the \nissuer; or where no specific information regarding an offering of \nsecurities by the issuer is communicated to or distributed by or on \nbehalf of the issuer.\n  What does this mean?\n  This means that these demo days that are regularly held across the \ncountry are opportunities whereby a presenter of an idea or a person \nwho represents that idea might bring forward those ideas, many times to \nhear about a collaborative basis, where there may be someone who \nrecognizes he could add on to that idea or be a part of that idea or \nwork with that idea or be a programmer for that idea or to host or to \nsponsor something that would enable that idea to get further down the \nroad.\n  What the SEC did is throw a wet blanket across it and said: You can't \ndo these.\n  We are trying to segment that out and say: For the purpose of a demo \nday, when it does not relate to a specific offer or ask for funding, it \nstill can take place.\n  This is not a narrow interpretation. The intent is to understand that \nthe purpose of a demo day should be to get ideas further down the road \nso they can gain not only the opportunity for investment, but so they \ncan make their ideas even better.\n  H.R. 4498 provides essential protections for States, municipalities, \ntrade associations, and other venues that facilitate such meetings \nbetween investors and fund managers.\n  It is important for Congress to act. Just because we are not aware of \nhow marketplaces work does not mean we should wait for the Federal \nGovernment to regulate them and then find out, whoops, they made a \nmistake. Members of Congress need to be active to understand that the \nSEC should live up to its statutes, that it should live up to its \nmission statement, and that it should not stifle innovation, but, \nrather, allow for the creative opportunity and development of these \nissues and ideas to come forth in order to better not only employment \nand ideas, but, more specifically, employment within the United States \nso consumers will then have better options over time. To ensure that \nangel investors play an active role in startups is why we are here \ntoday.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nSessions), my friend, the chairman of the Committee on Rules, for the \ncustomary 30 minutes.\n  I rise in opposition to this structured rule, which provides for the \nconsideration of H.R. 4498, the so-called Helping Angels Lead Our \nStartups Act, otherwise known as the HALOS Act. I also oppose the \nunderlying legislation unless through the amendment process we can \nimprove it.\n  The gentleman from Texas said something that I agree with: ``It is \nimportant for Congress to act.''\n  I think where we differ is: Act on what? What should Congress be \nacting on right now? Should we be talking about this? Or should we be \ntalking about other things, quite frankly, that are much more important \nto this country and to the American people?\n  Four days from now, Puerto Rico faces a $422 million debt payment. \nGiven the items listed for consideration in the House this week, it \nappears as though the Republican majority has no plans to act on \nlegislation to address the debt crisis in Puerto Rico.\n  I understand that my Republican friends in the majority are having a \ndifficult time in coming to an agreement within their Conference on how \nto move forward, but I urge my colleagues to continue working with \nLeader Pelosi and Ranking Member Grijalva toward a bipartisan solution \nthat allows Puerto Rico to restructure its debt. This is a big deal. \nThe Senate is waiting for us to act, the people of Puerto Rico are \nwaiting for us to act, and our constituents are waiting for us to act. \nRather than acting on that which is urgent, we are doing this.\n\n  Another thing we might want to think about acting on and is an area \nin which the House Republican leadership has also failed to act is that \nof the public health emergency created by the Zika virus. This is a big \ndeal. It is the public health. The well-being of our citizens is a big \ndeal, or at least it should be, but you would never know it if you are \nfollowing the proceedings on the House floor. My colleague from New \nYork, Congresswoman Lowey, has an emergency supplemental bill to help \nto fund what is necessary to protect our people from this virus, but we \nare told that is on the back burner.\n  What about doing something in response to the terrible tragedy that \nunfolded in Flint, Michigan, where that community was poisoned by the \nwater that came out of their faucets? Why aren't we addressing that \nemergency?\n  By the way, Flint is not unique, unfortunately. There are other \nplaces across this country where the levels of lead in the drinking \nwater are unacceptably high, are dangerously high. We need to make sure \nthat our infrastructure in this country is up to the point at which \npeople don't have to worry about drinking the water that comes out of \ntheir faucets. We should be addressing that issue, but for some reason \nwe don't have the time.\n  There are lots of young people here who are visiting the Capitol this \nweek. Why aren't we doing something about student financial aid so that \npeople can afford to go to college, creating a situation by which young \npeople who go to college are debt free when they get out of college, \nlowering the interest rates on college loans or eliminating the \ninterest rates on college loans, thus making college more affordable?\n  That is a huge priority. That is important, but we don't have time to \ntalk about that here in the people's House.\n  This Congress also continues to shirk its constitutional duty to vote \non an authorization for the war against ISIS. In the past week, the \nPentagon announced that the United States will send 250 more troops to \nSyria and 200 more to Iraq. In Iraq alone, the official number of U.S. \ntroops is now over 4,000, but this House still can't seem to find time \nto debate and vote on an AUMF.\n  I have great reservations about the President's policy with regard to \nthese wars. I think we ought to debate those wars and I think we ought \nto go on record as voting to authorize those wars. Instead, we don't \nwant to talk about it. We are putting the lives of young American men \nand women in harm's way. We are sending them halfway across the world \nto be engaged in an effort, in my opinion, in which there is not a \nclearly defined mission.\n  We are not living up to our constitutional responsibility, which is \nwe ought to debate and deliberate and vote on these wars. That is our \nconstitutional responsibility, and we are not doing it. We don't have \nthe time, or maybe we are just too cowardly to be able to tackle some \nof these important issues.\n  The American people are tired of endless wars, and it is our \nresponsibility to\n\n[[Page H2010]]\n\ndebate these escalations that continue to invest more American tax \ndollars, add more firepower, and put more U.S. troops closer to the \nfront lines; but, again, this leadership isn't focused on these very \nserious situations that call for immediate action.\n  Just so you know, we are not paying for most of these wars. While my \nfriends like to talk about our debt, I would point out that most of \nthese wars are unpaid for. They just go on the credit card. We don't \neven have the guts to have a vote on whether to pay for these wars. \nInstead, we are doing this today.\n  Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, House Republicans missed the legally \nmandated deadline for Congress to enact a budget, and it appears as \nthough we are not going to see a budget resolution on the floor this \nweek or anytime soon. On the most pressing issues facing our country \ntoday, my friends in the Republican majority have failed--and they have \nfailed miserably--to do their job, plain and simple.\n  So what is the House debating today? What is so urgent to debate \ntoday that all of these other things can be put to the side?\n  We are debating legislation, the so-called HALOS Act, that will undo \nan important investor protection that Democrats fought to include in \nthe 2012 JOBS Act.\n  I supported the JOBS Act, which expanded opportunities for small \nbusiness capital formation. Since the JOBS Act became law in 2012, \ncompanies have raised roughly $71 billion of capital by using the new \ngeneral solicitation and advertising exemption.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  But it is important to balance our desire for capital formation with \ntheir need to protect investors, particularly unsophisticated retail \ninvestors.\n  The JOBS Act removed the ban on solicitation in advertising to the \ngeneral public for private offerings, provided that companies verify \nthe purchasers of their offerings are accredited investors.\n  The legislation before us today repeals that verification requirement \nwhen companies solicit their offers at a wide range of sales events.\n  The private securities marketplace is already under limited SEC \noversight, and many of us share the concern that this legislation could \nunnecessarily expose investors to risks that they are unprepared to \nabsorb.\n  Now, my friend, Ranking Member Maxine Waters, will offer an amendment \nlater today to restore some of the investor protections that would be \neliminated by the underlying legislation. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport that amendment.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House is set to adjourn on Friday for yet another \nweeklong break and we have yet to consider any of the priority \nlegislation that I had just spoken about earlier. We need to focus on \nimportant issues. We need to focus on urgent issues rather than taking \naway important investor protections.\n  So I urge my colleagues to defeat this rule and the underlying \nlegislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I do appreciate the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) \nbringing up these issues. We try and talk about these issues up at the \nRules Committee. There is always a wide-ranging list of not only issues \nand ideas, but I certainly know that, as we talk about these, we are \nall after action on the floor.\n  I don't know the exact answer, but I believe, as it relates to the \nproblem with the Zika virus, that we are dealing with some $600 \nmillion. I note that Mrs. Lowey, the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee, has come on the floor and I am subject to \nbeing corrected by her.\n  But it is my understanding that right now, in an account that would \nbe allowed to be exchanged, some $600 million is left over in that fund \nthat is unspent from the Ebola crisis and that negotiations between our \nappropriators, the CDC, and other Federal agencies have said: We do \nrecognize from the House perspective that this is a very, very serious \nissue. We acknowledge that.\n  I have acknowledged that up at the Rules Committee. The gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Hastings) has several times, in the spirit that I \nappreciated and that was very complimentary to a proper answer, brought \nthis issue up, that this is what he is looking at, that it is an issue \nin our country.\n  The responses that I continue to, I believe, receive back is that our \nappropriators, on a very professional basis, have allowed use of the \nfunds to be used for that issue.\n  So I would like to say to the gentleman from Massachusetts that I do \nunderstand his concerns and, really, Mr. McGovern, I appreciate it.\n  I appreciate you, Ms. Slaughter, Mr. Polis, and Judge Hastings \nbringing these issues up. But we try and go and clarify what I think \nare proper or sustainable answers to your ideas. The ideas about other \npieces of legislation we will get to.\n  Where there are emergencies, I do agree with the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern). I do not think an AUMF, which is a \ndiscussion about military use of force, is necessarily in line right \nnow, but I know that Republicans are preparing that. I know that the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) could bring his effort \nforward and will at the appropriate time for his ideas. They will all \nfit.\n  Today, however, what we are here for is something that has been in \nline for some period of time that is a major issue. The gentleman very \nappropriately said the last time we brought forth legislation that it \ncreated $71 billion worth of entrepreneurial funding, funding that \nhelps our country's research and development, new ideas in medicine, \nnew ideas in communication, new ideas that employ people, money to the \nmarketplace.\n  That is why we are here today. We think this is just as powerful. \nAfter we passed the JOBS Act, the SEC got most of it right, not all of \nit right, and we are trying to politely--this is the way we do things \nin a democracy. We try and work with government agencies to say: You \ngot some of it right, but congressional intent needs to be done a \nlittle bit further.\n  Will it bring $71 billion to the marketplace? I don't know. Will it \nmean that a brighter future exists for innovation, job creation, and \ninvestment that keeps America's leading edge as opposed to ideas going \nsomewhere else around the world? Yes.\n  I would argue that Speaker Paul Ryan is aware of all the issues that \nneed to be debated. Today we feel like jobs and job creation and \nperhaps an opportunity to stimulate, whether it is $71 million or $71 \nbillion worth of new stimulating activity for new ideas, is important.\n  That is why we are here today. That is why people took a number, got \nin line, and developed their activity. Steve Chabot measured twice, \nbrought his legislation here, and understands what it is about.\n  I would also say, as Mr. McGovern I believe politely alluded to, this \nis a good idea because it does not say we will only form these \nopportunities in Republican districts, but we will form them in \ndistricts all over the country.\n  It is a good, bipartisan piece of legislation that helps smaller, \nless sophisticated people. It helps the marketplace. I think it is \nimportant.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to say to the gentleman from Texas that I appreciate the fact \nthat he appreciates the concerns that I have raised, but I would \nappreciate him even more if we could bring some of the legislation to \nthe floor that would actually solve some of the problems and deal with \nsome of the challenges that I outlined.\n  I had brought up earlier the issue of the Zika virus, which has \ninfected 891 individuals in the U.S. States and territories, including \nat least 81 pregnant women. This is a big, big deal.\n  Some of us are not interested in robbing from Peter to pay Paul to \ndeal with this. We don't want to be dipping into the Ebola fund, which \nis still an issue, to deal with the Zika crisis. I mean, we have \nmultiple challenges that we have to deal with.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, just a polite dialogue. Do you believe in \nany\n\n[[Page H2011]]\n\nway, because we have not moved a bill, that the Federal Government is \nstopping and waiting and doing nothing on this issue?\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reclaim my time.\n  We are doing something, but I think what people who are dealing with \nthis crisis would feel better about is if there was a certainty that \nthe resources were going to be there.\n  Those who are fighting the Ebola crisis are concerned that, if you \nare going to take money from Ebola to put into Zika, that maybe you are \nnot going to replenish the monies to deal with Ebola. We have some \nserious public health issues that we are trying to deal with.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge that we defeat the previous question. \nIf I do, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up a bill that \nwould provide desperately needed funding to combat the Zika virus.\n  The administration requested this funding more than 2 months ago, and \nit is reckless to delay our response to this public health crisis any \nlonger. Yes, we are doing things to respond to it. We can be doing a \nlot more. I think the American people want us to do all that we \npossibly can to protect the public health of the citizens of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my \namendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, with great respect for our distinguished \nchair with whom we work very collegiately, I urge my colleagues to vote \n``no'' on the previous question in order to provide the funding needed \nto mount a robust response to a pressing public health emergency.\n  More than 2 months ago the administration requested funding critical \nto respond to the Zika virus, a public health emergency tied to \nmicrocephaly and other neurological disorders in infants.\n  It is unconscionable that, when nearly 1,000 people in the U.S. and \nterritories have contracted Zika, the majority continues to drag their \nfeet on meeting our most basic responsibility.\n  The majority's inaction has forced the administration to redirect \nfunding needed to meet other basic responsibilities, shortchanging \nstill-needed investments to protect against Ebola and to help States \nand cities improve domestic public health.\n  The majority's claim that the administration has provided \ninsufficient detail on the request doesn't make any sense. Every cent \nhas been accounted for. Yet, we continue to wait to sit on our hands.\n  Further, the majority holds this emergency to a new standard, \nrequiring offsetting cuts before providing needed resources. This \nliterally holds emergency funding hostage to unrelated political \nfights.\n  This simply cannot go on. Are we waiting for the height of summer \nwhen mosquito control will be infinitely more difficult? Are we waiting \nfor this emergency to spiral out of control?\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with me and defeat the previous \nquestion so we can meet our responsibility to protect against Zika.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am delighted that the gentlewoman from New York, who is a regular \nvisitor to the Rules Committee and who really, I believe, adequately \nand fairly not only represents the needs of this Nation, but really \nargues many times on behalf of things that are common sense--I want to \nthank her for being here today.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not an argument at all about the Zika virus, \nabout Ebola. The Ebola circumstance to the United States in the United \nStates actually occurred first in Dallas, Texas, within the \ncongressional district that I am so lucky to represent. It did \nconstitute not only an immediate threat and danger to not only that \nhospital in Dallas, Texas, but, really, all across our country, and it \nevoked a scare. It did.\n  Well, we have that same type of circumstance today. That is why, in \nretouching base with our Appropriations Committee, I now can speak what \nI believe is from them directly as opposed to what I thought I heard, \nand that is that the appropriators have said that immediate funding \nneeds for Zika should be provided from unobligated funds that are \nalready available, which would then be backfilled in 17 appropriations \nbills as needed, which means that there still is money that the \napproval, the authorization, has been given.\n  Instead of us delaying through our process here, we have said that we \nconcur this is of immediate nature. Here is a bucket of money. Here is \na bucket of money.\n  As an example, there are some $400 million that is available that was \na part of the Ebola funding that is unobligated and is intended to be \nspent in future years. There is money available to meet the immediate \nneed.\n  The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, in working with Speaker Ryan, has made sure \nthat the money is available, can be used for this need, and Republicans \nagree it is the right thing to do.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  I do appreciate Mrs. Lowey coming down. I do appreciate the \ngentlemen, Judge Hastings and Mr. McGovern, seeking these questions.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are trying to make sure that this body understands \nthe money is available. It is there to be used properly, as with any \nother taxpayer money, but that it may be used for this purpose. Quite \nhonestly, I am very proud of what we are doing to match up the needs of \nthis Nation and its great people.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the gentlewoman from New York.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's eloquent \nremarks. However, I want to emphasize again that this is an emergency. \nPeople are severely, severely, being impacted because of the Zika \nvirus. This is an emergency. We should be doing it immediately.\n  I understand that it may be tempting to transfer money from another \naccount. However, to have to find offsets here when people are \nsuffering, dying, perhaps having deformed infants doesn't make any \nsense now.\n  I would just say in closing, I thank the gentleman for his concern, \nand I do hope that we can pass this emergency supplemental as soon as \npossible because so much of where the money is going to go is long-\nrange planning. Vaccines. We have to make sure that we prevent \nadditional cases of Zika, and developing a vaccine can't be done in a \nmonth or 2 months. It takes time.\n  So if, in fact, the administration has requested $1.9 billion, and we \nhave responded, and the administration has responded to the very \nsincere questions provided to us by the chair, Chairman Rogers of the \ncommittee, we think it has been documented very carefully.\n  I would ask again my colleagues to consider that this is an \nemergency, $1.9 billion is what has been documented in detail. It is \nall in writing. I thank the gentleman for listening.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, you are witnessing here a colloquy on the \nfloor between groups of people who can work together. Mrs. Lowey, Mr. \nMcGovern, Judge Hastings, Ms. Slaughter, and Mr. Polis represent not \njust the Democratic Party, but millions of people across the country.\n  I want to forthrightly try again to answer, if I can. I do hear them, \nChairman Rogers hears them. There is at least $500 million--granted, \nonly one-third of what has been requested--that we believe is available \nfor it to be transferred right now.\n  I talked to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern). I said: \nMr. McGovern, do you believe in any way that something is being held \nup?\n  He said: No, sir. We are working. This government is working \nfeverishly.\n  As a parent, I understand this. While I have an advantage of having a \ndisabled child as a son, that does not mean that I would want anyone \nelse to have a disabled child. I get this.\n  I have satisfied myself, and I believe my party has, through our \ngreat young Speaker, Paul Ryan, satisfied ourselves that pending the \ntime when we\n\n[[Page H2012]]\n\ncan get at a supplemental--perhaps later in the year there will be \nwildfires, perhaps later in the year there would be a hurricane. We \nhave the money available. No one disputes that the money right now is \nusable, it is fungible. The question is: When will it be backfilled?\n  I have properly said here today that Chairman Hal Rogers has the \near--and we have his ear--of every Member of this body who does \nunderstand when we need to get more money and when the new cycle \nbegins, and we will be starting this just in the next few weeks, that \nthat would be available as an option for Chairman Rogers to take Mrs. \nLowey's request, to take her detailed analysis of if it is a billion-\nsome, would be able to implant that into a priority for this \nConference, for this Congress, for these bodies to understand, and that \nwe would hope to work forth then with the United States Senate, with \nthe President of the United States, and work it well together.\n  Mr. Speaker, what you have seen here is a prime example of people \ntalking, people getting closer to an answer. I am trying to respond \nback that I believe our Speaker, Paul Ryan, I believe Hal Rogers, I \nbelieve myself as an instrument of a messaging back and forth properly \nare responding: The money is available. Please go get your work done. \nAs we get further down the line, we will be further down the process.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, what we are trying to do here is sound the alarm bells \nthat we need to do something much more robust than is currently being \ndone. I include in the Record the letter that we have referred to from \nthe administration signed by Shaun Donovan, Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, and Susan Rice, the National Security Adviser. \nThis is a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2016.\n     Hon. Paul D. Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan: As you are aware, on February 22, the \n     Administration transmitted to Congress its formal request for \n     $1.9 billion in emergency supplemental funding to address the \n     public health threat posed by the Zika virus. Sixty-four days \n     have passed since this initial request; yet still Congress \n     has not acted.\n       Since the time the Administration transmitted its request, \n     the public health threat posed by the Zika virus has \n     increased. After careful review of existing evidence, \n     scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC) concluded that the Zika virus is a cause of \n     microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. The Zika \n     virus has spread in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the U.S. \n     Virgin Islands and abroad. As of April 20, there were 891 \n     confirmed Zika cases in the continental United States and \n     U.S. territories, including 81 pregnant women with confirmed \n     cases of Zika. Based on similar experiences with other \n     diseases transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito--believed \n     to be the primary carrier of the Zika virus--scientists at \n     the CDC expect there could be local transmission within the \n     continental U.S. in the summer months. Updated estimate range \n     maps show that these mosquitoes have been found in cities as \n     far north as San Francisco, Kansas City and New York City.\n       In the absence of action from Congress to address the Zika \n     virus, the Administration has taken concrete and aggressive \n     steps to help keep America safe from this growing public \n     health threat. The Administration is working closely with \n     State and local governments to prepare for outbreaks in the \n     continental United States and to respond to the current \n     outbreak in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. We are \n     expanding mosquito control surveillance and laboratory \n     capacity; developing improved diagnostics as well as \n     vaccines; supporting affected expectant mothers, and \n     supporting other Zika response efforts in Puerto Rico, the \n     U.S. territories, the continental United States, and abroad. \n     These efforts are crucial, but they are costly and they fall \n     well outside of current agency appropriations. To meet these \n     immediate needs, the Administration conducted a careful \n     examination of existing Ebola balances and identified $510 \n     million to redirect towards Zika response activities. We have \n     also redirected an additional $79 million from other \n     activities. This reprogramming, while necessary, is not \n     without cost. It is particularly painful at a time when state \n     and local public health departments are already strained.\n       While this immediate infusion of resources is necessary to \n     enable the Administration to take critical first steps in our \n     response to the public health threat posed by Zika, it is \n     insufficient. Without significant additional appropriations \n     this summer, the Nation's efforts to comprehensively respond \n     to the disease will be severely undermined. In particular, \n     the Administration may need to suspend crucial activities, \n     such as mosquito control and surveillance in the absence of \n     emergency supplemental funding. State and local governments \n     that manage mosquito control and response operations will not \n     be able to hire needed responders to engage in mosquito \n     mitigation efforts. Additionally, the Administration's \n     ability to move to the next phase of vaccine development, \n     which requires multi-year commitments from the Government to \n     encourage the private sector to prioritize Zika research and \n     development, could be jeopardized. Without emergency \n     supplemental funding, the development of faster and more \n     accurate diagnostic tests also will be impeded. The \n     Administration may not be able to conduct follow up of \n     children born to pregnant women with Zika to better \n     understand the range of Zika impacts, particularly those \n     health effects that are not evident at birth. The \n     supplemental request is also needed to replenish the amounts \n     that we are now spending from our Ebola accounts to fund \n     Zika-related activities. This will ensure we have sufficient \n     contingency funds to address unanticipated needs related to \n     both Zika and Ebola. As we have seen with both Ebola and \n     Zika, there are still many unknowns about the science and \n     scale of the outbreak and how it will impact mothers, babies, \n     and health systems domestically and abroad.\n       The Administration is pleased to learn that there is \n     bipartisan support for providing emergency funding to address \n     the Zika crisis, but we remain concerned about the adequacy \n     and speed of this response. To properly protect the American \n     public, and in particular pregnant women and their newborns, \n     Congress must fund the Administration's request of $1.9 \n     billion and find a path forward to address this public health \n     emergency immediately. The American people deserve action \n     now. With the summer months fast approaching, we continue to \n     believe that the Zika supplemental should not be considered \n     as part of the regular appropriations process, as it relates \n     to funding we must receive this year in order to most \n     effectively prepare for and mitigate the impact of the virus.\n       We urge you to pass free-standing emergency supplemental \n     funding legislation at the level requested by the \n     Administration before Congress leaves town for the Memorial \n     Day recess. We look forward to working with you to protect \n     the safety and health of all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n     Shaun Donovan,\n       Director, The Office of Management and Budget.\n     Susan Rice,\n       National Security Advisor.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. The letter basically says that the existing \nappropriations are not enough. This is what the letter says: ``Without \nsignificant additional appropriations this summer, the Nation's efforts \nto comprehensively respond to the disease will be severely undermined. \nIn particular, the administration may need to suspend crucial \nactivities, such as mosquito control and surveillance in the absence of \nemergency supplemental funding. State and local governments that manage \nmosquito control and response operations will not be able to hire \nneeded responders to engage in mosquito mitigation efforts. \nAdditionally, the administration's ability to move to the next phase of \nvaccine development, which requires multiyear commitments from the \ngovernment to encourage the private sector to prioritize Zika research \nand development, could be jeopardized.''\n  I mean, I go right down the list on all the warnings here. This is a \nbig deal. This is a big deal. If my friends on the other side are \ntrying to rationalize putting this off, I would suggest to reread this \nletter. Reread this letter. Talk to the scientists. Talk to the \nexperts. We need to have the necessary resources to be able to combat \nwhat might come our way in terms of the Zika virus. I want to do this \nso that we don't have a loss of life here in this country, so we are \nprepared.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut \n(Ms. DeLauro).\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the previous \nquestion. I ask Members to defeat it so that the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) can offer an amendment for this House to \nimmediately consider legislation to confront the Zika crisis. There are \nalready 891 confirmed cases of the Zika virus in the United States and \nits territories, and 81 of them are pregnant women. This is an \nemergency.\n  We do have a disaster relief fund in this Congress. It is about $8 \nbillion so that when there is a flood, when there is a fire, when there \nis a hurricane, we can immediately move to take that\n\n[[Page H2013]]\n\nmoney and address the costs of life and other costs from that disaster.\n  Unfortunately, we don't have a public health emergency fund, which is \nwhy the President is asking for $1.9 billion. This is an emergency. We \ncannot afford to wait another day to approve the President's request. \nEvery day we delay, we redirect crucial resources away from city and \nState emergency preparedness funding. We are robbing Peter to pay Paul. \nCities and States across the country are being robbed of emergency \npreparedness grants, $44 million in total. Not only will these States \nhave fewer resources to address public health crises, they will have \nfewer resources to address the Zika virus itself. Already in addition \nto that $44 million, the administration has reprogrammed $510 million \nfrom the Ebola crisis funding, and that crisis is not over in western \nAfrica.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I am going to include in the Record a list \nof all of the States and the amount of money that they have already \nlost in emergency grants for preparedness for health emergencies.\n  California, almost 10 percent loss; Florida, almost 10 percent loss; \nNorth Carolina, 8 percent; Texas, almost 10 percent in money taken away \nfrom preparedness grants.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is unconscionable that in the midst of a global \nhealth crisis, we cannot appropriate emergency funds to save lives and \ninstead resort to gutting our States' emergency preparedness.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to think of the women \nacross our country and the predicament that they face today of choosing \nwhether or not they should get pregnant or, if they are already \npregnant, wondering whether or not their baby is okay. We must fund the \nPresident's request. It is the responsible and moral thing to do.\n  Yes, today, physicians are divided as to whether or not they should \ntell women of the United States not to get pregnant. Is that the \nmessage we want to send to American women? I don't think so.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In closing, I again urge my colleagues to vote against the previous \nquestion so we can bring forward a bill that we believe can help \nadequately prepare this country to deal with the Zika virus, something \nthat I think the majority of Americans support, whether they are \nDemocrats or Republicans.\n  This should not be a controversial issue. If it is, then people can \nvote against it if it comes to the floor, but what we do know is that \nwhat we have done up to this point in terms of our responsibility here \nin Congress in providing the funds has not been adequate. I read \nearlier from the letter from the White House all the things that could \nbe on hold or not move forward if we don't adequately fund the \nnecessary infrastructure to deal with this crisis.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would also say that it seems to me that dealing \neffectively with the Zika crisis is a heck of a lot more important than \nwhat we are being asked to vote on and debate today. I have been saying \nthis every time I come to the floor and handle a rule, but it seems \nthat legislation that has minimum impact or that in some cases might \neven be trivial takes precedence over legislation that actually might \ndo something to help lift up the lives of people in this country or, \neven in this case, protect the lives of people in this country.\n  We ought to come together in a bipartisan way to make sure that at \nleast priority items come to the floor of the House. This is supposed \nto be the people's House, and that is where the people's business is \nsupposed to be done. We are not doing it. By not addressing the Zika \ncrisis more forthrightly, we are not doing the people's business.\n  So, again, vote ``no'' on the previous question and vote ``no'' on \nthe rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  What a great day to be on the floor for us to really bring forth our \nideas. The obligations that we have here as Members of Congress to work \nwith each other, to listen to each other is apparent to me, but I don't \nthink apparent to every single person.\n  We have allowed, meaning Chairman Rogers has allowed, in consultation \nwith the Speaker, for money to be reprogrammed, which is aplenty right \nnow. We have agreed this is an immediate crisis. We have made sure the \nadministration is not wanting for a penny. We recognize that in the \nprocesses that will take place, we will go through in a regular order \nprocedure getting these funds reprogrammed and allocated to fill back \nup the bucket.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  I have satisfied myself that we are trying to do the right thing. I \nhave great concern that the American people understand we do care about \nthe children and the families. I get this. We do care. And until we go \nthrough this process to further develop it and add money, the \nadministration has the money necessary to do as they see fit to protect \nthe American people, to combat this virus--this disease--and to make \nsure that we get a handle on it.\n  Mr. Speaker, the value of startups, which is why we are here today, \ncannot be understated.\n  Founded in 2013, back home in Dallas, Texas, which I have the \npleasure of representing, is the Dallas Entrepreneur Center, or DEC, \nwhich is a nonprofit created to help entrepreneurs start, build, and \ngrow companies. According to the DEC, over 1,000 jobs were created in \nthe past 2 years and another 500 are expected to be hired by Dallas \nstartups in 2016. That is the power of what we are talking about.\n  The SEC has gotten in the way of this, not only with red tape, but \nwith consternation directly back at the process that the free \nenterprise system has to make these jobs happen.\n  Investment in startups has been done in Dallas. Companies like \nEdition Collective, Rise, PICKUP, and Visage Payroll in Dallas, Texas, \nare prime examples of the success that could take place all across this \ncountry, not just in Dallas, Texas, but in other places where \nentrepreneurs should be king also. And they are king because they are \nproviding jobs--good-paying jobs--for people.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act is a \nbipartisan, bicameral bill that provides small, innovative companies \nand startups access to the capital they need, just as we have talked \nabout that exists in Dallas, Texas. We are helping them succeed. We are \nhelping them to innovate and grow jobs and turn them into opportunities \nfor our Nation to have better products and services.\n  As Angus King, a Senator from Maine who is one of the Senate's \ncosponsors, said: ``By fixing flawed Federal rules, the HALOS Act will \nremove unnecessary roadblocks and help startups grow and thrive.''\n  I couldn't have said it better myself. He needs it in Maine. We need \nit in Dallas, Texas. We do not have all the jobs we need. There are \nstill too many people unemployed in our country. That is why we are \nhere doing this.\n  In particular, two Dallas startups, iSIGHT Partners and Bottle \nRocket, are revolutionizing the field of cyber threat intelligence and \nmobile strategy development, respectively. Imagine for just a moment \nwhat it took them, despite these problems in the marketplace, to get \nstarted and get done. I think it is time that we allow others the \nopportunity to make life a little bit easier.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this rule. This \nawesome legislation and what it represents is bipartisan, is bicameral, \nand has no boundaries of who may participate.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:\n\n          An Amendment to H. Res. 701 Offered by Mr. McGovern\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     5044) making supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2016 \n     to respond to Zika virus. The first reading of the bill shall \n     be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration \n     of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to \n     the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among \n     and controlled by the chair\n\n[[Page H2014]]\n\n     and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     Appropriations and the chair and ranking minority member of \n     the Committee on the Budget. After general debate the bill \n     shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. \n     All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 5044.\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate \n     ``(Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ``Upon \n     rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE NEED FOR A MISCELLANEOUS \n                   TARIFF BILL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As of the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States imposes \n     duties on imported goods for which there is no domestic \n     availability or insufficient domestic availability.\n       (2) The imposition of duties on such goods creates \n     artificial distortions in the economy of the United States \n     that negatively affect United States manufacturers and \n     consumers.\n       (3) The manufacturing competitiveness of the United States \n     around the world will be enhanced if Congress regularly and \n     predictably updates the Harmonized Tariff Schedule to suspend \n     or reduce duties on such goods.\n       (4) Creating and maintaining an open and transparent \n     process for consideration of petitions for duty suspensions \n     and reductions builds confidence that the process is fair, \n     open to all, and free of abuse.\n       (5) Complying with the Rules of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, in particular with clause 9 \n     of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives and \n     rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, is essential \n     to fostering and maintaining confidence in the process for \n     considering a miscellaneous tariff bill.\n       (6) A miscellaneous tariff bill developed under this \n     process will not contain any--\n       (A) congressional earmarks or limited tax benefits within \n     the meaning of clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House \n     of Representatives; or\n       (B) congressionally directed spending items or limited tax \n     benefits within the meaning of rule XLIV of the Standing \n     Rules of the Senate.\n       (7) Because any limited tariff benefits contained in any \n     miscellaneous tariff bill following the process set forth by \n     this Act will not have been the subject of legislation \n     introduced by an individual Member of Congress and will be \n     fully vetted through a transparent and fair process free of \n     abuse, it is appropriate for Congress to consider limited \n     tariff benefits as part of that miscellaneous tariff bill as \n     long as--\n       (A) in the case of a miscellaneous tariff bill considered \n     in the House of Representatives, consistent with the Rules of \n     the House of Representatives, a list of such limited tariff \n     benefits is published in the reports of the Committee on Ways \n     and Means of the House of Representatives accompanying the \n     miscellaneous tariff bill, or in the Congressional Record; \n     and\n       (B) in the case of a miscellaneous tariff bill considered \n     in the Senate, consistent with the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate--\n       (i) such limited tariff benefits have been identified \n     through lists, charts, or other similar means; and\n       (ii) the information identified in clause (i) has been \n     available on a publicly accessible congressional website in a \n     searchable format at least 48 hours before the vote on the \n     motion to proceed to the miscellaneous tariff bill or the \n     vote on the adoption of a report of a committee of conference \n     in connection with the miscellaneous tariff bill, as the case \n     may be.\n       (8) When the process set forth under paragraph (7) is \n     followed, it is consistent with the letter and intent of the \n     Rules of the House of Representatives and the Senate and \n     other related guidance.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, \n     to remove the competitive disadvantage to United States \n     manufacturers and consumers and to promote the \n     competitiveness of United States manufacturers, Congress \n     should, not later than 90 days after the United States \n     International Trade Commission issues a final report on \n     petitions for duty suspensions and reductions under section \n     3(b)(3)(E), consider a miscellaneous tariff bill.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROCESS FOR CONSIDERATION OF PETITIONS FOR DUTY \n                   SUSPENSIONS AND REDUCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to \n     establish a process for the submission and consideration of \n     petitions for duty suspensions and reductions.\n       (b) Requirements of Commission.--\n       (1) Initiation.--Not later than October 15, 2016, and \n     October 15, 2019, the Commission shall publish in the Federal \n     Register and on a publicly available Internet website of the \n     Commission a notice requesting members of the public who can \n     demonstrate that they are likely beneficiaries of duty \n     suspensions or reductions to\n\n[[Page H2015]]\n\n     submit to the Commission during the 60-day period beginning \n     on the date of such publication--\n       (A) petitions for duty suspensions and reductions;

This bipartisan bill will \nhelp our manufacturers of all sizes reduce costs, create jobs, and \ncompete in the global market by creating a transparent process that is \nentirely consistent with House rules.\n  This legislation is formally called the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill, or \nMTB for short, but it makes more sense to think of this as an MTB of \nanother kind: legislation providing manufacturing tax breaks, plain and \nsimple.\n  Before I begin to speak more specifically about what this bill does, \nI would like to tell you why it is so essential for the success of our \neconomy.\n  Since 2012, American manufactures have had to pay full tariffs--\nborder taxes, in essence--for certain imported products that aren't \nmade in the United States, unnecessarily increasing their costs. These \ntariffs, or border taxes, have cost them $748 million a year, and there \nhas been no opportunity for them to get relief from these taxes. These \nborder taxes, in turn, have made it harder for them to sell their \nproducts, grow their businesses, create jobs, and invest in their \ncommunities.\n  A coalition of American businesses of all sizes explained it best in \ntheir recent letter. They wrote:\n  ``As a result, manufacturers, especially small- and medium-sized \nmanufacturers, in industries ranging from\n\n[[Page H2017]]\n\nagriculture and electronics to textiles, chemicals and beyond, have \nseen their costs go up for inputs not produced in the United States, \nundermining American competitiveness and the ability of these companies \nto retain and create manufacturing jobs in the United States.''\n  The good news is that help is on the way. After working together for \nmonths, Trade Subcommittee Chairman Dave Reichert, Ranking Members \nLevin and Rangel, and I led a bipartisan group of Members in both the \nHouse and the Senate who recently introduced the American Manufacturing \nCompetitiveness Act of 2016. The bill is designed to solve this problem \nand deliver much-needed relief to manufacturers across our country. \nHere is how the new three-step process will work:\n  First, local businesses of all sizes throughout our districts will \npetition the independent, nonpartisan International Trade Commission. \nThey will make their case for why they need manufacturing tax breaks. \nAfter the ITC receives these petitions, it will solicit comments from \nthe American public and the administration. The ITC will conduct a \nthorough and transparent analysis.\n  Secondly, the ITC will then issue a public report to Congress with \nits analysis and recommendations regarding products that meet the MTB \nstandards. In these reports, the ITC will confirm that no company in \nAmerica makes these products and explain why it is important to offer \nthese tax breaks to our local manufacturers.\n  The third and final step in the process is for Congress to consider \nthe ITC's recommendations. The Ways and Means Committee will examine \nthe ITC's recommendations and prepare a package of legislation \nproviding tax breaks for American manufacturers. Consistent with our \nrules, we cannot add provisions that haven't received a favorable \nrecommendation from the ITC. Then, Congress will consider the entire \npackage.\n  At the end of this process, American manufacturers of all sizes will \nbe able to enjoy tax breaks that will make it easier for them to \ncompete in the global market and create more jobs in our communities.\n  While this bill is a victory for manufacturers and consumers, it is \nreally also a victory for openness and transparency. After all, our new \nMTB process upholds our strong earmark rules and also gives the \nAmerican people the opportunity to offer their opinion throughout the \nentire process. By passing this bill today, we are taking a tremendous \nstep to ensure that we finally have a system in place that helps our \nmanufacturers here in America compete in the global market--and win.\n  I would like to take a quick moment to recognize my colleagues who \nhave worked so hard on this legislation. Specifically, I would like to \nthank Ranking Member Sander Levin along with Subcommittee Chairman Dave \nReichert and Ranking Member Charlie Rangel for their help and \nleadership.\n  I am also grateful to committee members Pat Tiberi, Tom Reed, Jim \nRenacci, Earl Blumenauer, Bill Pascrell, and Danny Davis, who have been \nactively involved in developing this legislation.\n  We also got help throughout the conference. I would like to \nspecifically thank Representatives Mark Walker, Tom McClintock, Todd \nRokita, Mick Mulvaney, and Rod Blum for their considerable leadership \nthroughout this process.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this critical \nlegislation to provide tax breaks for our local manufacturers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                               Committee on Rules,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 2016.\n     Hon. Kevin Brady,\n     Chair, Committee on Ways and Means,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Brady: On April 19, 2016, the Committee on \n     Ways and Means ordered reported H.R. 4923, the American \n     Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2016. As you know, the \n     Committee on Rules was granted an additional referral upon \n     the bill's introduction pursuant to the Committee's \n     jurisdiction under rule X of the Rules of the House of \n     Representatives over the rules of the House and special \n     orders of business.\n       Because of your willingness to consult with my committee \n     regarding this matter, I will waive consideration of the bill \n     by the Rules Committee. By agreeing to waive its \n     consideration of the bill, the Rules Committee does not waive \n     its jurisdiction over H.R. 4923. In addition, the Committee \n     on Rules reserves its authority to seek conferees on any \n     provisions of the bill that are within its jurisdiction \n     during any House-Senate conference that may be convened on \n     this legislation. I ask your commitment to support any \n     request by the Committee on Rules for conferees on H.R. 4923 \n     or related legislation.\n       I request that you include this letter and your response as \n     part of your committee's report on the bill and the \n     Congressional Record during consideration of the legislation \n     on the House floor.\n       Thank you for your attention to these matters.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pete Sessions.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 2016.\n     Hon. Pete Sessions,\n     Chairman, Committee on Rules,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Sessions, Thank you for your letter regarding \n     H.R. 4923, the ``American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act \n     of 2016.'' As you noted, the Committee on Rules was granted \n     an additional referral of the bill.\n       I am most appreciative of your decision to waive \n     consideration of H.R. 4923 so that it may proceed \n     expeditiously to the House floor. I acknowledge that although \n     you waived formal consideration of the bill, the Committee on \n     Rules is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the subject \n     matter contained in those provisions of the bill that fall \n     within your Rule X jurisdiction. I would support your effort \n     to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees on \n     any House-Senate conference involving this legislation.\n       I will include a copy of our letters in our Committee's \n     report on H.R. 4923, as well as the Congressional Record \n     during consideration of this legislation on the House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Kevin Brady,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to join with the chairman \ntoday. We have welcomed the opportunity--indeed, the absolute \nnecessity--to try to work together. So I want to place what we are \ndoing today in some perspective.\n  It has been nearly 6 years since Congress last passed a miscellaneous \ntariff bill. We are just now establishing a process to consider a \nfuture MTB bill, which would not happen until the end of 2017. This \nyears-long delay has hurt U.S. manufacturers and our manufacturing \ncompetitiveness. It is long past time for this House to finally take \naction and to move forward.\n  MTB legislation boils down to one thing, basically: supporting and \ngrowing manufacturing jobs right here in America. And very importantly, \nthese jobs do not come at the expense of others.\n  In 2010, the bipartisan, thorough, and transparent process we \nestablished to consider MTB bills worked effectively. It included \ndirect input from the public, the administration, and the International \nTrade Commission.\n  The committee then posted all of these comments from the public and \nthe administration on a publicly available Web site. And perhaps most \nimportantly, that input was crucial in making sure that domestic \nproduction was not competing with imported products in the bill.\n  At that time, Republican leaders in Congress publicly objected to the \nMTB bill, conflating it with earmarks. When Democrats brought the bill \nto the floor in 2010, Republicans bucked their leadership and almost en \nmasse supported the bill because of its importance to U.S. \nmanufacturers and American jobs. It ultimately passed the House 378-43.\n  Unfortunately, as the Republicans became the majority, action on MTB \nwas frozen. For years, the result was injury to domestic manufacturing \nand the jobs it supports throughout our country.\n  This bill shifts the responsibility to formally propose to ITC. I \nsupport the bill today before us because it retains all of the uniquely \nstrong provisions on transparency developed in 2010, ensuring that all \npotential MTBs are thoroughly vetted.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  It provides a chance for valuable input from a variety of \nstakeholders. This input is the key to ensuring that MTB bills do not \nundermine domestic product or jobs.\n  The process makes sure that the benefits provided by the bill support \nand\n\n[[Page H2018]]\n\ncreate American jobs without hurting our domestic manufacturers.\n  Additionally, this bill allows a Member of Congress to object to and, \nessentially, remove an individual MTB from the final legislative \npackage.\n  So it has been a frustrating 6 years, and I say this with some \nemotion because we have worked hard over these years to try to move, \noften hitting obstacles. So it has been a frustrating 6 years since \nthis Congress passed an MTB.\n  It has been even more frustrating for manufacturing across the \ncountry, but I believe we have reached a sufficient path forward now \nthat will ultimately be beneficial for American manufacturers and for \nAmerican workers.\n  It is more than overdue. It is about time a solution has been found, \nnot one that I initially favored. But it is important to move ahead. \nSo, therefore, I strongly support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the honorable \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Reichert), chairman of the Subcommittee \non Trade, who has played such a key role, again, in advancing free \ntrade and the manufacturing tax breaks.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for yielding and \nfor his leadership and, also, Ranking Member Levin for his leadership.\n  This is truly a bipartisan effort working its way through Congress \ntoday. It is finally a pleasure to see this come to fruition.\n  We talk about MTBs. We throw a lot of acronyms around here in \nCongress, and sometimes it is hard to keep track of what all those \nacronyms mean.\n  But the definition of miscellaneous tariff, really, simply put, is a \ntax. It is a tax on businesses here in America taxed on imports from \nother countries on products used in building other products here in the \nUnited States.\n  Those products that are imported, that our companies are being taxed \non, are not made here in the United States. So it is an additional cost \non our manufacturers, who then have to raise their prices and that, of \ncourse, is passed on to our consumers and they pay a higher cost for \nthose goods.\n  Even sometimes, Mr. Speaker, these miscellaneous tariffs can result \nin jobs being moved overseas.\n  So the process is simple. Step one is businesses present their \nrequests to an independent board, nonpartisan, called the ITC, \nInternational Trade Commission.\n  Step two is that it is an open and transparent process. They asked \nfor input from all across the country, from the public, from \nbusinesses, from Congress, from the administration, an open, \ntransparent process.\n  Step three is Congress takes action.\n  And step four is America wins. They become more competitive.\n  What are the benefits of MTB? It is clear and simple.\n  The benefits are: Cuts costs for manufacturers importing products not \nmade in the U.S.; reduces prices for consumers; strengthens \ntransparency; and it grows the economy, creating the opportunity to \nmake more products, make more products, hire more people, obviously, \nmore people back to work creating jobs.\n  So today I rise in strong support of this solution to the problem \nthat we have been facing here for the last few years, as Mr. Levin \ndescribed.\n  It fully complies with our House rules, has strong bipartisan support \nin both the House and the Senate. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen), one of our key, most \neffective leaders on trade in the Ways and Means Committee in the \nHouse.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the American \nCompetitiveness Act to help our domestic manufacturers.\n  Today there are American companies that must unfairly pay \nmiscellaneous tariffs, or taxes, on the materials they need to make \ntheir products here in the United States simply because these materials \nare not available in the United States. Instead, they have to import \nthese materials.\n  The bill before us creates a new, transparent process for \nmiscellaneous tariff bills, or MTBs, to be enacted. And just how \nimportant are these MTBs?\n  Since the last MTB package expired in 2012, we have seen $748 million \nin additional taxes at the border for American manufacturers every \nyear.\n  That is a lot of money, Mr. Speaker. It is money that manufacturers \ncould use to hire more employees, to grow their business or, of course, \nto lower prices for their customers.\n  And this isn't speculation. The last MTB initiative supported 90,000 \nmanufacturing jobs here in the United States. In Minnesota, it is \nmanufacturers like 3M and Knitcraft and Honeywell that will see the \nbenefits.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me today in supporting our \nmanufacturers by voting in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from New York (Mr. Reed), one of our key members of the \nWays and Means Committee with a business background.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer congratulations not only \nto our chairman on the Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady, as well \nas the chairman of the Trade Subcommittee, David Reichert, but also the \nranking member, Mr. Levin.\n  We have come together on a bipartisan basis, Mr. Speaker, to stand \nfor this legislation that is going to help our U.S. domestic \nmanufacturers.\n  This is a reduction of cost that potentially could go in the \nmillions, if not billions, of dollars in the future and that is going \nto allow our U.S. manufacturers to compete on the world stage in a much \nbetter position than they find themselves today.\n  So I applaud the efforts of colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \ncome together to find a solution that allows us to honor an open and \ntransparent process, to stand with our U.S. manufacturers, to reduce \nthe tax burden, and to reduce the costs on these manufacturers that are \nthe heart and soul of our job creators across the country.\n  As I know companies in my district in western New York, the benefits \nthat these companies will see impact not only large corporations, but \nalso mom-and-pop domestic manufacturers, companies like Vere Sandals. \nIt is a small mom-and-pop shop in my district that has to rely upon an \nimport that it can only get outside of America.\n  They are now in a position, after this legislation is passed, to be \nable to build and manufacture those sandals in a competitive way. That \nmeans that that mom-and-pop operation is going be able to employ not \nonly their present employees, but potentially invest in expansion.\n  Why is that important, Mr. Speaker? Because those are the jobs that \nare being created today and tomorrow.\n  So I want to give, again, a congratulatory tip of the hat to my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle as well as to the chairman on \na job well done.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Iowa (Mr. Blum), one of our key new leaders in trade, \nmanufacturing, and agriculture, a new Member of Congress who played a \nkey role, again, in this legislation.\n  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank Chairman Brady, Ranking \nMember Levin, the rest of the House Committee on Ways and Means, and my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle who join in cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation, H.R. 4923, the American Manufacturing \nCompetitiveness Act of 2016.\n  I also want to thank my colleague from North Carolina (Mr. Walker) \nfor his leadership in educating our freshman class about this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation creates an open and transparent process \nto consider reducing burdensome manufacturing tariffs through \nmiscellaneous tariff bills while at the same time maintaining the \ncommonsense House ban on earmarks.\n  Without this legislation, American manufacturers will continue to pay \nhigh tariffs on essential raw materials that have no domestic source. \nThis undermines manufacturers' competitiveness with foreign \nmanufacturers and damages their ability to create manufacturing jobs \nhere in America.\n\n[[Page H2019]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, our economy has been limping along for quite some time \nnow. This is the worst economic recovery following a recession since \nWorld War II. GDP growth is just 60 percent of our 70-year average. I \nwill say that again: 60 percent of average. Because of this, wages for \nworking families are stagnant.\n  American businesses are being stifled by red tape, high taxes, and a \nFederal Government that crowds out private investment through its \naddiction to deficit spending.\n  I am not willing to accept that this economy is the new normal. We \ncan do far better, Mr. Speaker. We need to make America the best place \nin the world to do business.\n  I believe that, by instituting progrowth policies, we can get wages \nfor Americans moving up again and encourage businesses to invest in \ngrowing here instead of going overseas.\n  This bipartisan legislation is a concrete, direct example of \nsomething Congress can do immediately to make American manufacturing \nmore competitive. Helping our manufacturers create good-paying jobs for \nAmerican workers instead of moving them overseas should not be a \npartisan issue.\n  I look forward to seeing this bill move through Congress and will \ncontinue to be a voice for workers and manufacturers in Iowa and across \nthe country so we can reignite our economy, raise wages for working \nfamilies and once again make America the best place in the world to do \nbusiness.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I will \nbe very brief.\n  We have welcomed the chance to work together, and I want to thank the \nstaff on both sides for doing that.\n  There were obstacles, I think unfortunate ones, in terms of the \ninterpretation of the rules of this House. Lots of jobs were lost. \nTariffs were placed on goods when we could have avoided that.\n  I am proud that, in 2010, when we were in the majority and we worked \ntogether up to a point, we developed the most transparent procedures. \nThey were given the gold seal.\n  Everything had to be out in the open. Everything had to be there for \nthe public to see. If any one of us on either side of the aisle, \nDemocratic or Republican, Senate or House, objected to a provision, \nsaying, for example, that it would impact jobs in the United States, \nthat provision was gone.\n  As a result of that effort in 2010, when it came up for a vote, only \none Democrat of all of us voted against it.\n  So time has been lost. Jobs have been lost. We have lost some ground \non manufacturing that never should have happened.\n  But the important thing today is that we are moving ahead and we are \ngoing to pass a bill that sets in motion a procedure that will go into \neffect the end of next year.\n  So I hope we learn from this experience that we should not be tied up \nby procedures in this Congress. Instead, we should look at what is the \nreal impact of what we do on jobs in this country. These are basically \nvery middle-income jobs, and we have lost too many.\n  We are now trying to recapture some of that lost ground with this \nprocedure. I think it is something that we now need to adopt.\n  So I urge all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle and, I hope, \nthe vast majority of you on your side of the aisle, Mr. Chairman, that \nwe will join together at long last to pass what we have come to know as \nMTB.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Think about the benefits of this bipartisan bill: tax cuts to \nAmerican manufacturers; more jobs in our community, both retained and, \nin some cases, grown; lower costs for consumers and our businesses as \nwell; Congress retains its strong constitutional powers over tariffs; \nand this bill complies fully with the current House earmark ban. That \nis a win-win for American consumers and our economy. It was achieved \nthrough bipartisan work.\n  I thank Ranking Member Levin and those who came together across the \naisle and across the rotunda to make this process and this solution a \nreality.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  This is good for America. This is good for our manufacturers, it is \ngood for our local jobs, and I urge support for this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support passage of H.R. \n4923, the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2016. This \nbipartisan, bicameral legislation creates an open and transparent \nprocess for the House to consider manufacturing tax cuts through the \nMiscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB). This new process corrects distortions \nin the U.S. tariff code that place an unnecessary and anti-competitive \ntax on manufacturers, retailers and other businesses across the country \nthat rely on imported products not available domestically.\n  As an active promoter of free trade, I want to commend my good friend \nand fellow Texan, Congressman Brady for steering this important \nlegislation to the House floor. I thank him for consulting with me on \nthe development of this legislation, and I am pleased to support his \nefforts to ensure swift passage of this critical bill. Our partnership \nwas memorialized in the exchange of letters contained in the Ways and \nMeans Committee's report on the measure.\n  Congress has not renewed MTBs since the U.S. Manufacturing \nEnhancement Act in 2010 expired at the end of 2012. Since then, U.S. \nbusinesses faced an annual $748 million tax increase on manufacturing \nwith an overall economic loss of $1.875 billion for the U.S. economy.\n  The new MTB process will help American manufacturers compete in the \nglobal market while also ensuring a transparent and public process for \nconsideration of MTBs. U.S. businesses will be able to petition the \nindependent, non-partisan International Trade Commission (ITC), \nexplaining the need for a specific tariff reduction or suspension. The \nITC will then be able to issue a public report to Congress analyzing \nthe request and whether or not it meets MTB standards, including that \nthere is no domestic production. Congress would then be able to \nconsider the bill within existing House Rules.\n  Small businesses and manufacturers across the country have long \nvoiced their support for this new process. I am proud to have worked \nwith Congressman Brady to ensure passage of this job creating \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4923, the \nAmerican Manufacturing Competitiveness Act.\n  In today's competitive global economy, too often government hampers \nAmerican businesses with onerous regulations and red tape. As other \nnations increase their own global competitiveness, we must provide a \nlevel playing field for our businesses in diverse fields that include \ntextiles, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing.\n  The American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act only allows for tariff \nwaivers on materials that lack a domestic equivalent. Other countries \nare already regularly granting similar waivers. The National \nAssociation of Manufacturers estimates that these tariffs are costing \nthe American economy $748 million a year. The Indiana Manufacturers \nAssociation has said that ``helping eliminate these miscellaneous \ntariffs will reduce costs and lower incentives to relocate \nmanufacturing operations abroad, keeping good jobs here.''\n  I thank Chairman Brady, for bringing together our working group to \nget this vital legislation done. I urge passage of the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rice of South Carolina). The question is \non the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) that the \nHouse suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4923, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, across the globe, nations are on alert as the threat of \nISIS spreads. France, Turkey, Belgium, and the United States have each \nbeen tragically affected by ISIS or ISIS-inspired terror plots. It is \nimperative that America's first lines of defense against ISIS and other \nterror groups are working effectively.\n  H.R. 4240, the No Fly for Foreign Fighters Act, is a commonsense bill \nthat requires the U.S. Government Accountability Office to conduct an \nindependent review of the operation and administration of the Terrorist \nScreening Database, or TSDB, which is sometimes referred to as the \nterrorist watch list. The gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) has \nworked diligently on this important issue, and I am pleased to support \nthis bill.\n  The terrorist watch list is a critical tool in our fight against \nterrorism. The watch list and the screening process support the U.S. \nGovernment's efforts to combat terrorism by consolidating the terrorist \nwatch list and providing screening and law enforcement agencies with \ninformation to help them respond appropriately during encounters with \nknown or suspected terrorists, among other things. At the same time, we \nmust ensure that the watch list and the accompanying processes and \nprocedures comport with the Constitution and the values of the American \npeople.\n  The GAO previously conducted a study of the terrorist watch list \nfollowing the December 25, 2009, attempted bombing of Northwest \nAirlines Flight 253, which exposed weaknesses in how the Federal \nGovernment nominated individuals to the terrorist watch list and gaps \nin how agencies use the list to screen individuals to determine if they \nposed a security threat. Several improvements were made to the watch \nlisting processes and procedures following the December 25, 2009, \nattempted bombing.\n  However, concerns have been raised over the effect the watch listing \nprocesses and procedures may have on law-abiding persons, including \nU.S. citizens, based on inaccurate or incomplete information in the \ndatabase or similar or identical names to watch listed individuals.\n  The GAO stated in its 2012 watch listing report that routine, \ngovernment-wide assessments of the outcomes and impacts of agencies' \nwatch list screening or vetting programs could help ensure that these \nprograms are achieving their intended results or identify if revisions \nare needed. Such assessments could also help identify broader issues \nthat require attention, determine if impacts on agency resources and \nthe traveling public are acceptable, and communicate to key \nstakeholders how the Nation's investment in the watch list screening or \nvetting processes is enhancing security of the Nation's borders, \ncommercial aviation, and other security-related activities.\n  This bill provides for an independent review of the operation and \nadministration of the watch list. It reaffirms our commitment to our \nNation's security while upholding the constitutional values that make \nAmerica unique in the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying that this is evidence of the \nimportant commitment that the Judiciary Committee has to the issues of \ncriminal justice, but as well recognizes the title of this committee \nthat covers crime, terrorism, homeland security, and investigations.\n  So I want to thank the chairman, Mr. Goodlatte, for working with me \nand his staff, along with Mr. Conyers, the ranking member, and his \nstaff, and, of course, Mr. Ratcliffe for his support for my \nlegislation, H.R. 4240, the No Fly for Foreign Fighters Act.\n  I particularly want to thank the staff because as they well know, my \nlate staff, Tiffany Joslyn, worked very hard with staff members as well \non this legislation. So here we are today with an important initiative \ncoming out of the Judiciary Committee working collaboratively, and I \nbelieve that is extremely important.\n  As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and \nthe ranking member of the House Committee on the Judiciary's \nSubcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \nInvestigations, the topic of threats to homeland security has always \nbeen of particular concern to me. But over the last couple of months, \nmaybe over the last couple of years, as we have seen ISIL raise its \nugly head, we have heard of Americans going for the fight, joining and \nbeing a part of the caliphate. We have heard of ISIS members moving \naround, particularly in Europe, moving from country to country. Some \nmay say that they are crossing in a number of modes of transportation, \nbut we also know they are using aviation modes of transportation. \nTherefore, they pose a serious threat.\n  I initially introduced the No Fly for Foreign Fighters Act after the \ninvestigation of an attempt to detonate explosives on a Northwest \nAirlines Flight on Christmas Day, 2009. Yes, Mr. Speaker, that was a \nlong time ago.\n  An investigation of the incident revealed that counter-terrorism \nagencies had information that raised flags about this individual \nreferred to as the ``underwear bomber,'' but the dots were not \nconnected and he was not placed in the Terrorist Screening Database, or \nthe TSDB. This incident shone a light on potential gaps in our watching \nand screening process, and that resulted in significant improvements.\n\n  That said, questions about the system remain. In fact, it is not \nuncommon to see news of a flight being diverted or an emergency landing \nbecause a passenger happened to be on the no-fly list, but there was a \ndelay getting that information. Mr. Speaker, we are here today to \nreally ensure that we get it right because one wrong time again \njeopardizes maybe hundreds of thousands of lives.\n  It is even more common to read articles about the frequency of false \npositives and individuals being mistakenly identified as being on the \nlist, causing them and their fellow passengers significant delay and \nfrustration. I remember, having been on the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity since the heinous and tragic terrorist acts of 9/11, in those \nearly days, Members of Congress, United States Senators, and others \nwere on the no-fly list. While it may, after the fact, be a little bit \nhumorous, it is not. So we must get it right. The issue of false \npositives is something that I know\n\n[[Page H2021]]\n\nmany of my colleagues on the committee are particularly interested in, \nas well as groups such as the ACLU who was kept very busy by so many \npeople being on wrongly.\n  In light of the events of the last 12 months, however, the issue of \nhomeland security and, in particular, the accuracy of our screening and \nwatch listing process has become even more significant to me. More than \n30,000 foreign fighters from at least 100 different countries have \ntraveled to Syria and Iraq to fight with ISIL since 2011. I want to say \nthat number again: 30,000 foreign fighters have traveled. That means \nthey may return and move throughout Europe or attempt to come to the \nUnited States.\n  In the last 18 months, the number of foreign fighters traveling to \nSyria and Iraq has more than doubled. If those individuals try to go \nthroughout places in Europe or elsewhere or to the United States, the \nmode of transportation would be aviation.\n  In the first 6 months of 2015, more than 7,000 foreign fighters have \narrived in Syria and Iraq. Of those traveling to Syria and Iraq to \nfight for the Islamic State terrorist group, it is estimated that at \nleast 250 hold U.S. citizenship.\n  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, we only need one. The accuracy of our \nterrorist screening tools is more critical now than ever before. That \nis why I worked with the chairman, Mr. Ratcliffe, and Mr. Conyers to \nintroduce H.R. 4240, which mandates an independent review of the TSDB's \noperation and administration.\n  Although the Inspector General for the Department of Justice conducts \nannual audits of the TSDB, there has not been an independent review \nsince the GAO study after the 2009 incident.\n  H.R. 4240 directs the GAO to conduct an independent review of the \noperation and administration of the TSDB and subsets of the TSDB, to \nassess whether past weaknesses have been addressed, the extent to which \nexisting vulnerabilities may be resolved or mitigated through \nadditional changes.\n  This legislation is drafted broadly to allow the GAO to conduct a \ncomprehensive review not just of the TSDB's accuracy, but its entire \noperation and administration in the name of securing the American \npeople.\n  Following its study, the GAO will submit a report to the House and \nSenate Judiciary Committees with its findings and any recommendations \nfor improvements. I am very glad that my colleagues joined me in \nshortening that timeframe in which a report is to come back so that we \ncan quickly move to urge any changes that need to be made in the list \nto be accurate and to secure the Nation.\n  Let me close by thanking the members of this committee who are \ncosponsors of H.R. 4240 and urge my colleagues to vote to send this \ncritical and timely bipartisan legislation to the House floor, which we \nare now.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me begin by extending my appreciation to Chairman \nGoodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers, and Mr. Ratcliffe for your support \nof my legislation, H.R. 4240, the ``No Fly for Foreign Fighters Act.''\n  As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and \nthe Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, \nHomeland Security & Investigations, the topic of threats to homeland \nsecurity has always of particular concern to me.\n  I initially introduced the ``No Fly for Foreign Fighters Act'' after \nthe investigation of an attempt to detonate explosives on a Northwest \nAirlines Flight on Christmas Day 2009.\n  Investigation of the incident revealed that counterterrorism agencies \nhad information that raised red flags about this individual, referred \nto as the ``underwear bomber,'' but the dots were not connected and he \nwas not placed in the Terrorist Screening Database or the TSDB.\n  This incident shone a spotlight on potential gaps in our watching and \nscreening process and that resulted significant improvements.\n  That said, questions about the system remain.\n  In fact, it is not uncommon to see news of a flight being diverted or \nan emergency landing because a passenger happened to be on the No Fly \nlist but there was a delay getting that information.\n  It is even more common to read articles about the frequency of false \npositives and individuals being mistakenly identified as being on the \nlist--causing them and their fellow passenger significant delay and \nfrustration.\n  The issue of false positives is something that I know many of my \ncolleagues on the Committee are particularly interested in, as well as \ngroups such as the ACLU.\n  In light of the events of the last 12 months, however, the issue of \nhomeland security and, in particular, the accuracy of our screening and \nwatchlisting process has become even more significant to me.\n  More than 30,000 foreign fighters from at least 100 different \ncountries have traveled to Syria and Iraq to fight for ISIL since 2011.\n  In the last 18 months, the number of foreign fighters traveling to \nSyria and Iraq has more than doubled.\n  In the first six months of 2015, more than 7.000 foreign fighters \nhave arrived in Syria and Iraq.\n  Of those traveling to Syria and Iraq to fight for the Islamic State \nterrorist group, it is estimated at least 250 hold U.S. Citizenship.\n  The accuracy of our terrorist screening tools is more critical now \nthan ever before.\n   That is why I worked with the Chairman and Mr. Ratcliffe, to \nintroduce H.R. 4240, which mandates an independent review of the TSDB's \noperation and administration.\n  Although the Inspector General for the Department of Justice conducts \nannual audits of the TSDB, there has not been an independent review \nsince the GAO study after the 2009 incident.\n  H.R. 4240 directs the GAO to conduct an independent review of the \noperation and administration of the TSDB, and subsets of the TSDB, to \nassess: (1) whether past weaknesses have been address; and (2) the \nextent to which existing vulnerabilities may be resolved or mitigated \nthrough additional changes.\n  This legislation is drafted broadly, to allow the GAO to conduct a \ncomprehensive review not just of the TSDB's accuracy, but of its entire \noperation and administration.\n  Following its study, the GAO will submit a report to the House and \nSenate Judiciary Committees, with its findings and any recommendations \nfor improvements.\n  I would like to thank the many Members of this Committee who are co-\nsponsors of H.R. 4240 and urge my colleagues to vote to send this \ncritical and timely bipartisan legislation to the House floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude by also thanking the many individuals \nwho work tirelessly to make the Terrorist Screening Center an asset to \nour homeland security infrastructure.\n  We want to make certain that those men and women have the tools they \nneed to continue to keep this nation safe.\n  H.R. 4240 is the next step in ensuring that the screening and \nwatchlisting process works as it is intended.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan \nmeasure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield such time \nas he may consume to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the \ndistinguished ranking member who now is the dean of this House.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the author of this bill, the \ngentlewoman from Texas, who first saw the importance of it. I want to \ntell you that this measure before us today strengthens the Terrorist \nScreening Database maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nand in doing so, aids in our efforts to combat terrorism and keep our \nNation safe.\n  The FBI's Terrorist Screening Center helps to identify known and \nsuspected terrorists by integrating information collected by law \nenforcement and the intelligence community.\n  Since its inception in 2003, this sophisticated watch list and \nscreening system has undoubtedly saved lives; but despite the work of \nthe dedicated individuals who make the screening database possible, the \nsystem is not flawless. Past incidents, such as the 2009 Christmas Day \nattempted attack on a Northwest Airlines flight bound for my hometown \nof Detroit, already mentioned by the gentlewoman from Texas, has put a \nspotlight on potential gaps in the system.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Over the years since, the FBI has made significant improvements to \nthe database. Audits by the Department of Justice's Office of the \nInspector General reveal movement in the right direction; but, to date, \nno independent review has been conducted to evaluate the sufficiency of \nthese changes.\n  H.R. 4240 addresses this precise issue by directing the Government \nAccountability Office to conduct a review of the operation and \nadministration of the Terrorist Screening Database. This review will \nassess whether past weaknesses have been eliminated and the extent to \nwhich existing vulnerabilities may be addressed or mitigated\n\n[[Page H2022]]\n\nthrough additional changes. An independent audit will give us the tools \nwe need to make additional changes if necessary.\n  I want to commend, once again, the distinguished gentlewoman from \nTexas, Sheila Jackson Lee, ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations of the Judiciary \nCommittee, for her leadership on this important issue.\n  I also want to thank the chairman of the full committee, Chairman \nGoodlatte, and former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chairman \nSensenbrenner, for their assistance in bringing this important \nlegislation to the floor today.\n  I join with all of those who are with us in supporting this measure.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, in concluding, a lot of thanks go to, as I indicated, \nthe chairman, Chairman Goodlatte; Ranking Member Conyers; Mr. \nRatcliffe, who is a member of the committee; and my colleagues on \nHomeland Security as well, who have a great interest in this \nlegislation.\n  Our commitment in this legislation is to leave no stone unturned, no \npage unturned, and no iota of information that will be necessary to \nmake this list a more viable and secure list. That work now will be \ndone by this legislation, the No Fly for Foreign Fighters Act. It will \nhelp to make the Terrorist Screening Center a further asset to our \nHomeland Security infrastructure.\n  We want to make certain that those men and women have the tools they \nneed to continue to keep the Nation safe. With 30,000 foreign fighters \nand others going every day, 250 Americans who have gone to the \ncaliphate, have gone to the fight, individuals who may have an interest \nin returning to this country and doing us harm, doing us damage, I \nbelieve H.R. 4240 is the next step in ensuring that the screening and \nwatch-listing process works as it was intended to have worked and works \nwithout as many errors as possible--errorless, if you will--because \nthat is what we need to secure this Nation.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan \nmeasure.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, this is good legislation. It is common \nsense to conduct a review of the terrorist watch-listing process.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 4240, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2022-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2022-H2028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EMAIL PRIVACY ACT\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on H.R. 699, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Today is an historic day. Today, the House of Representatives will be \nthe first Chamber in Congress to approve legislation that has been \npending before the House and Senate for several years to reform and \nmodernize the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, or ECPA. Reforming \nthis outdated law has been a priority for me as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. I have worked with Members of Congress, advocacy \ngroups, and law enforcement agencies for years on many complicated \nnuances involved in updating this law.\n  Two weeks ago, the House Judiciary Committee unanimously reported a \nrevised version of H.R. 699, the Email Privacy Act. The resulting bill \nis a carefully negotiated agreement to update the procedures governing \ngovernment access to stored communications content and records.\n  Thirty years ago, when personal computing was still in its infancy \nand few of us had ever heard of something called the World Wide Web, \nCongress enacted ECPA to establish procedures that strike ``a fair \nbalance between the privacy expectations of American citizens and the \nlegitimate needs of law enforcement agencies.''\n  In 1986, mail was sent through the U.S. Postal Service, a search \nengine was called a library, tweets were the sounds made by birds in \nthe trees, and clouds were found only in the sky. In 1986, computer \nstorage was finite and expensive. It was unheard of that a commercial \nproduct would allow users to send and receive electronic communications \naround the globe for free and store those communications for years with \na third-party provider.\n  So much has changed in the last three decades. The technology \nexplosion over the last three decades has placed a great deal of \ninformation on the Internet, in our emails, and on the cloud. Today, \ncommercial providers, businesses, schools, and governments of all \nshapes and sizes provide email and cloud computing services to \ncustomers, students, and employees.\n  The Email Privacy Act establishes, for the first time in Federal \nstatute, a uniform warrant requirement for stored communication content \nin criminal investigations, regardless of the type of service provider, \nthe age of an email, or whether the email has been opened.\n  The bill preserves the authority for law enforcement agents to serve \nthe warrant on the provider because, as with any other third-party \ncustodian, the information sought is stored with them. However, the \nbill acknowledges that providers may give notice to their customers \nwhen in receipt of a warrant, court order, or subpoena, unless the \nprovider is court-ordered to delay such notification.\n  The bill continues current practice that delineates which remote \ncomputing service providers, or cloud providers, are subject to the \nwarrant requirement for content in a criminal investigation.\n  ECPA has traditionally imposed heightened legal process and \nprocedures to obtain information for which the customer has a \nreasonable expectation of privacy, namely, emails, texts,\n\n[[Page H2024]]\n\nphotos, videos, and documents stored in the cloud. H.R. 699 preserves \nthis treatment by maintaining in the statute limiting language \nregarding remote computing services.\n  Contrary to practice 30 years ago, today, vast amounts of private, \nsensitive information are transmitted and stored electronically. But \nthis information may also contain evidence of a crime, and law \nenforcement agencies are increasingly dependent on stored \ncommunications content and records in their investigations.\n  To facilitate timely disclosure of evidence to law enforcement, the \nbill authorizes a court to require a date for return of service of the \nwarrant. In the absence of such a requirement, H.R. 699 requires email \nand cloud providers to promptly respond to warrants for communications \ncontent.\n  Current law makes no distinction between content disclosed to the \npublic, like an advertisement on a Web site, versus content disclosed \nonly to one or a handful of persons, like an email or a text message. \nThe result is that law enforcement could be required to obtain a \nwarrant even for publicly disclosed content. The bill clarifies that \ncommercial public content can be obtained with process other than a \nwarrant.\n  Lastly, H.R. 699 clarifies that nothing in the law limits Congress' \nauthority to compel a third-party provider to disclose content in \nfurtherance of its investigative and oversight responsibilities.\n  Thirty years ago, the extent to which people communicated \nelectronically was much more limited. Today, however, the ubiquity of \nelectronic communications requires Congress to ensure that legitimate \nexpectations of privacy are protected, while respecting the needs of \nlaw enforcement.\n  I am confident that this bill strikes the necessary balance and does \nso in a way that continues to promote the development and use of new \ntechnologies and services that reflect how people communicate with one \nanother today and into the future.\n  I would like to thank Congressman Yoder and Congressman Polis for \nintroducing the underlying legislation and for working with the \ncommittee on improvements to the bill.\n  With this historic vote today, Congress will approve legislation that \nembodies the principles of the Fourth Amendment and reaffirms our \ncommitment to protecting the privacy interests of the American people \nwithout unduly sacrificing public safety.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In 2014, in a unanimous ruling delivered by Chief Justice Roberts, \nthe Supreme Court concluded that the police may not search a cell phone \nwithout first demonstrating probable cause. Citing an obvious Fourth \nAmendment interest in the vast amount of data we store on our personal \ndevices, the Court wrote: ``The fact that technology now allows an \nindividual to carry such information in his hand does not make the \ninformation any less worthy of the protection for which the Founders \nfought. Our answer to the question of what police must do before \nsearching a cell phone seized incident to an arrest is accordingly \nsimple--get a warrant.''\n  With that decision, the Court took a bold step toward reconciling the \nFourth Amendment with the advent of modern communications technology. \nToday, the House takes a similar step to reconcile our interests in \nprivacy and due process with the realities of modern computing.\n  H.R. 699, the Email Privacy Act, recognizes that the content of our \ncommunications, although often stored in digital format, remains worthy \nof Fourth Amendment protection. And to the investigators and government \nagents who seek access to our email, our advice is accordingly simple: \nGet a warrant. It is an idea whose time has long since come. This bill \nwill allow us to move to a clear, uniform standard for law enforcement \nagencies to access the content of our communications, namely, a warrant \nbased on probable cause.\n  H.R. 699 also codifies the right of the providers to give notice of \nthis intrusion to their customers, except in certain exigent \ncircumstances that must also be validated by the court.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  We should note the absence of a special carve-out from the warrant \nrequirement for the civil agencies, like the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the Internal Revenue Service. In the House Judiciary \nCommittee, we reached quick consensus that a civil carve-out of any \nkind is unworkable, unconstitutional, or both. I would have preferred \nto have kept the notice provisions of the original bill, which are \nabsent from the version we reported from committee.\n  In the digital world, no amount of due diligence necessarily tells us \nthat the government has accessed our electronic communications. The \ngovernment should have an obligation to provide us with some form of \nnotice when intruding on a record of our most private conversations; \nbut I understand that not everyone shares this view, and I am willing \nto compromise, for now, in order to advance the important reforms that \nwe will adopt today.\n  I am proud of the work we have done. This legislation is several \nyears in the making, and it should not be delayed any further. I \ncompliment our colleague Mr. Polis. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues \nto support H.R. 699, the Email Privacy Act.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nKansas (Mr. Yoder), the chief sponsor of the legislation.\n  Mr. YODER. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, today is a great day for the Constitution. It is a great \nday for the spirit of bipartisanship in this Chamber. It is a great day \nfor Americans everywhere who use modern technology, such as emails and \ntext messages and cell phones, to communicate with one another.\n  This day has been a long time in the making, and I want to thank the \nchairman and his staff, Ranking Member Conyers, my colleague Mr. Polis, \nand everyone who has worked on this legislation. This is the most \ncosponsored bill in the entire United States House--the most popular \nbill--because it is a commonsense piece of legislation that affects \nevery American and will clear up a long-time hole in the law that has \nallowed the government to intrude on Americans' privacy.\n  You have to go back to 1986 when this law was passed: Halley's Comet \nwas passing by Earth; ``Top Gun'' was coming out as a new movie; \nCabbage Patch dolls were flying off the shelves. It was a good time in \nAmerica. It was also the time in which Congress last wrote the laws \nthat updated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. At that point, \nthere were only 10 million Americans who even had email accounts. \nToday, there is an estimated 232 million Americans who have email \naccounts. It wasn't until 6 years later that someone sent the first \ntext message in 1992. Yet, now, we expect 1 billion text messages to be \nsent every single year.\n  The current law, which is the law that was written in 1986, allows an \nabuse of our constitutional rights by treating our digital information \nas if it is not private information--as if it can be searched and \nseized by the government without a warrant, without probable cause, \nwithout due process. The theory in 1986 was, if you left your email on \na server, once it was left there, it was considered abandoned. It was \nlike trash that was left out on the street corner, which didn't have an \nexpectation of privacy anymore. We know the ways that Americans \ncommunicate today is in a way in which they expect that those \ntransmissions are private, and they expect that the government will \nhonor that and not search those emails or capture them for other \npurposes. The Fourth Amendment is being violated.\n  Today, we restore the Fourth Amendment by treating digital \ninformation just like paper information, and we stand strong on the \nnotion that Americans do have an expectation of privacy in their email \naccounts. I would think, if I and my colleagues would each ask our \nconstituents if they expect that their email conversations are private, \nthey would know that they are, and they would expect that they are. As \nwe are debating this bill, Americans are sending emails and text \nmessages back and forth, and they expect that their government is not \nreviewing those.\n  What we do in this legislation is require a warrant. We say the \ngovernment must have probable cause. They must go to a judge whether it \nis at the\n\n[[Page H2025]]\n\nFederal level, the State level, or the local level. To review those \npieces of digital information that are stored either in a drop box or \non the iCloud--or just a text message that is sent back and forth--you \nhave to have a warrant, and in a civil matter, you have to have a \nsubpoena, and that subpoena is served on the individual.\n  We have documents on our desks at home. The police can't kick in your \ndoor and go read those documents unless they have a warrant backed up \non probable cause. We have a digital set of documents that goes around \nwith us wherever we go. There is a file cabinet with us. When we store \nthings, we are doing so not because we are abandoning it. We are \nstoring it because we are wanting to protect it, and we are wanting to \nensure that we can keep it. We don't want to lose our Fourth Amendment \nprotections because of that. This legislation would require that a \nwarrant or a civil subpoena exist in order to read that information so \nthat due process occurs.\n  This is a great unifier. Quite often on the House floor, we are \ndivided--Republicans and Democrats--and we are not able to find \nresolution on some of the biggest challenges that face us; but the \nFourth Amendment in the Constitution has to be preserved. I am \nheartened by the fact that my colleague Mr. Polis and groups on the \nleft and groups on the right and groups in the center and that America \nhas come together on this legislation to say we are going to fix this, \nand we are going to ensure that this Congress modernizes its laws and \nthat it does so in a bipartisan fashion so that we can put this bill on \nthe President's desk and he will sign it into law. As we continue to \nadvance, we must remember to advance the laws that this country \nutilizes, and as Americans communicate in different ways, we have to \nmodernize the way the laws treat that communication.\n  I am proud of the work we are doing in the House today. I thank the \nchairman and his team. I thank Ranking Member Conyers and my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle. This is a great day for America, a great \nday for the Constitution, and a great day for each and every one of us \nwho uses email to correspond to know that the Fourth Amendment \ncontinues to protect us and to know that the Internet is not immune \nfrom the protections of the Constitution.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Polis), one of the authors of the measure before us.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, the passage of the Email Privacy Act is an \nenormous victory. It is a victory for all Americans who believe in the \nright to privacy, in the Fourth Amendment, and in due process.\n  The Email Privacy Act mandates, for the first time, that Americans \nhave the same legal protection for their emails as they do for papers, \nletters, faxes, and other old communications. The bill protects those \nof us--myself included and many Members of this body--who have email \naccounts in the cloud. Maybe it is Google mail or Yahoo Mail or AOL or \nother email accounts on their hard drives. It makes sure that the \ngovernment doesn't have the right, without a warrant, to search emails \nthat are older than 180 days.\n  This bill is also a victory for bipartisanship. When I introduced the \nbill, along with my colleague Mr. Yoder, in the winter of 2015, we knew \nit would be popular. Yet, as this bill sits before us today, ready for \npassage, I am very proud to say it has garnered 314 cosponsors, and it \nstands as the single most popular bill in this session of the House of \nRepresentatives. I am excited that it is scheduled for a floor vote.\n  When Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act in \n1986, electronic communications were different than they are today. \nThey didn't really exist as such. A few professors were using a \npredecessor for the Internet. It was not a mass form of communication. \nToday, with 24/7 accessibility with mobile devices and laptops, over \n205 billion emails are sent every day, according to some estimates, \nincluding many that contain our private communications for millions of \nAmericans who deserve the same right to privacy as documents in a file \ncabinet.\n  With the passage of the Email Privacy Act, Congress will ensure that \nyour emails that are older than 180 days are subject to the same \nprotection under the Fourth Amendment. You often hear Members on both \nsides of the aisle talk about commonsense bills. When you read our bill \nand when you look at the immense support, there is nothing more common \nsense than the Email Privacy Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and pass the bill. I urge the \nSenate to take it up and act. There is the unanimous support from the \nHouse Judiciary Committee and, as of today--hopefully soon--\noverwhelming support on the floor of the House. This bill should be \npassed. It should be brought to the desk of the President of the United \nStates. We should finally bring our email privacy laws into the 21st \ncentury.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe), a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman for bringing this bill up and \nfor his work on it in a bipartisan way.\n  I especially want to thank Congressman Yoder for pushing this \nlegislation that has overwhelming support in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act was passed in \n1986--30 years ago. It was an eternity. Understand that IBM invented \nand put on the market its first laptop in 1986. A lot has changed since \nthat day 30 years ago. As the chairman mentioned, the cloud was where \nrain came from, or sometimes we see it here in Washington, D.C.--the \ncloud. No one even knew what that was. The Electronic Communications \nPrivacy Act needs to be fixed because it does not protect the right of \nprivacy of Americans.\n  If something is stored in the cloud that is over 180 days old, then \nit is open season for government to seize all of that information. All \ngovernments--local or State or Federal--can go in and get those emails, \ntexts, photographs, documents that you are storing. Up to 180 days, it \nis protected by the Constitution. Interesting--180 days of \nconstitutional rights--but on the 181st day, you have no right of \nprivacy. That is absurd. This bill fixes that former legislation.\n  I used to be a judge in Texas for 22 years, and I had peace officers \nall the time come to see me who wanted a warrant. They followed the \nFourth Amendment and described the place to be searched. They would go \nin with that warrant, after stating probable cause, and they were \nallowed to seize whatever they could seize under the warrant. The \nFourth Amendment ought to apply today. It ought to apply in the \nelectronic age. It ought to apply to emails that are stored in the \ncloud or to anything else that is stored in the cloud. If the police \nofficers have to have a warrant to go into your house and take \ndocuments you store in your desk or wherever, then they have to have a \nwarrant if you store documents in the cloud. That is what this \nlegislation does, and it makes sense that we protect the constitutional \nright.\n  The government cannot tap our phones without a warrant, it can't read \nhard mail without a warrant, and it can't enter our homes without a \nwarrant because of the Fourth Amendment. We are unique among all \npeoples because we have in our Constitution the Fourth Amendment that \nprotects Americans--I think better than any other population anywhere--\nof their rights.\n  Speaking of rights, the government doesn't have rights. People have \nrights, and the Bill of Rights protects the citizens of the United \nStates. Government has authority--it has power--and if you read the \nBill of Rights, the 10 Amendments especially, it is to limit government \npower and authority against us, the citizens. So, of course, the Fourth \nAmendment should apply to the Federal Government in this area.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen in our own government abuses of the \ngovernment in the area, especially of snooping and spying on Americans, \nwith the NSA and its story that we are all familiar with. We have to \ncontrol government, and it is our obligation, the House of \nRepresentatives, to protect the Constitution--the Bill of Rights \nespecially--from government intrusion.\n  I support this legislation. It is a good piece of legislation. I \nthank the chairman and the ranking member and Ms. Lofgren for her \nsupport of this legislation that we have been working on for a long \ntime. Let Congress speak out\n\n[[Page H2026]]\n\nand support the right of privacy for all Americans and keep the \ngovernment out of the snooping business.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Nadler), a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. NADLER. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the Email Privacy Act.\n  It has long been evident that we need to update the laws impacting \nelectronic communications and privacy. I am pleased that, today, the \nHouse will take a major step forward by considering and approving the \nEmail Privacy Act. Its passage is long overdue.\n  In 2009 and 2010, when I was the chair of the House Judiciary \nSubcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, we \nheld multiple hearings on ECPA, or electronic communication and privacy \nlaws, and began to seriously consider reforms to our Nation's \nelectronic communication and privacy laws. During the 112th Congress, \nRepresentative Conyers and I introduced the Electronic Communications \nPrivacy Act Modernization Act of 2012, which would have required law \nenforcement to obtain a warrant based on probable cause before \nsearching email. That approach, now embodied in the Yoder-Polis Email \nPrivacy Act, is what we are here to consider today.\n  The Email Privacy Act requires the government to obtain a warrant in \norder to access people's electronic communications from a third-party \nprovider, protecting Americans' privacy rights while still enabling law \nenforcement to do its job.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  This is consistent with a stark American practice going back to the \nFourth Amendment. Current law is inconsistent and unclear regarding the \nstandards for government access to the content of communications, and a \nsingle email is potentially subject to multiple different legal \nstandards.\n  Clarifying the laws will help industry stakeholders, who currently \nstruggle to apply the existing, outdated categories of information to \ntheir products and services, and it will provide a clear standard for \nlaw enforcement.\n  In an era where government access to people's private information \nheld by third-party providers has become far too easy, Congress is \nfinally taking steps to update our laws to reflect our new \nunderstanding of what it means for ``people to be secure in their \npersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and \nseizures,'' in the words of the Fourth Amendment.\n  This bill is not perfect, and clearly there is more to be done. In \nparticular, we must ensure that we keep working to require a probable \ncause warrant for location information.\n  I am pleased that Chairman Goodlatte has announced that he plans to \nhold hearings on location information, and I look forward to those \nhearings and to subsequent legislation.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill, and I applaud \nthe House for considering this landmark legislation today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this bill to ensure \nthat our laws strike the right balance between the interests and needs \nof law enforcement and the privacy rights of the American people.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Sanford).\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud my colleagues from Kansas \nand from Colorado for their work in crafting this bill. I think it is \nawfully important.\n  I think it is what people expect. When they think about government, \nthey want a government that works for them. Part of having a government \nthat works for them means actually updating laws as technology has \nchanged.\n  So I think that, at the core, this is about keeping current with the \nrate of change in the world of technology.\n  It is amazing to me--I pulled the numbers--that there are roughly 205 \nbillion emails sent every day around the world. If you presuppose that \nAmerica's economy is about 20 percent of that world pie, that means \naround 40 million or more emails are sent across this country every \nsingle day.\n  In contrast is the U.S. Postal Service. There are about 600 million \nletters that go across this country every day, which is to say, \nmathematically, you are saying that about 1.5 percent of the \ncommunication flow, either via mail or electronic means, are sent by \nthe Postal Service.\n  The other, in essence, 99 percent of the communications are sent via \nemail, which is to say we have a real problem with a law that was \ncreated in the 1980s that doesn't take into account the way the world \nhas changed.\n  So I applaud the crafters of this bill for what they have done in \nrecognizing technology change. I applaud them for the way that they \nstayed true to the Fourth Amendment.\n  Our Founding Fathers were so deliberate in recognizing the notion \nthat you didn't want to have British soldiers coming into a house and \nrumbling around until they finally found something to charge you with \nand then moving forward.\n  The Fourth Amendment is about protecting individual liberty. \nJefferson said: ``The natural progress of things is for the government \nto gain ground and for liberty to yield.''\n  Fundamentally, what this bill is about is pushing back in the way \nthat the government has now encroached on that space of individual \nliberty.\n  Finally, I would say simply this: This is about recognizing how true \nhistory is on the importance of protecting liberty.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Costello of Pennsylvania). The time of \nthe gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, Edward Gibbon wrote a book back in 1776 \nabout the fall of the Romans. In it, he harkens back to the fall of \nGreece and the Athenians.\n  He said, at the end of the day, in the end, more than they wanted \nfreedom, they wanted security. They wanted a comfortable life, and they \nlost it all--security, comfort, and freedom--when the Athenians no \nlonger wanted to give to society, but to receive. And he goes on with a \nlong quote from there.\n  He talks about the fundamental tension that exists in any developed \nsociety between freedom and security. We have moved too far in the \nopposite direction as it relates to email. This bill brings us back \ntoward the center.\n  I again applaud Mr. Yoder and Mr. Polis for what they have done. I \nalso applaud Chairman Goodlatte for what he has done on this front.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nWashington (Ms. DelBene), a very effective member on the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, updating our laws to reflect the way the \nworld works in the 21st century has been one of my top priorities in \nCongress.\n  After spending two decades in the technology sector where things \nchange at light speed, it can be hard to understand why we still have \nlaws on the books that don't reflect how society functions in the \ndigital age. Nowhere has this been more obvious than in our email \nprivacy laws that date back to the 1980s.\n  Under current law, there are more protections for a letter in a \nfiling cabinet than an email on a server. This was never really the \nintent, but email's evolution has made it clear that our policies are \nwoefully outdated.\n  I have supported a number of different proposals to reform our \nelectronic privacy laws, and I will continue to push for those. Today's \nvote on the Email Privacy Act is a great step forward for American \ncivil liberties.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important \nlegislation, and I urge our friends in the Senate to take up the bill \nwithout delay so we can send it to the President and ensure Americans \nare guaranteed the privacy protections most think that they already \nhave.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to close today by thanking Chairman Goodlatte of the \nJudiciary Committee and his staff for working with us to develop the \nfinal draft of this legislation. Once again the chairman has helped us \nfind a way to resolve our differences and advance core civil liberties \nand constitutional values.\n  I would also like to thank the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Yoder) and\n\n[[Page H2027]]\n\nthe gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis) for their leadership on this \nissue from the very beginning.\n  The Email Privacy Act comes to the floor today in large part because \nof your work in gathering more than 300 cosponsors for this bill.\n  Finally, I want to express appreciation to the coalition of \ntechnology companies, civil liberties organizations, and individual \nexperts whose persistence and dedication have made this moment \npossible.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 699, the Email Privacy Act. I \nbelieve that they will do so. I also urge our comparable body in the \nSenate to take up this measure as quickly as possible.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority whip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte for moving this \nbill through his committee. I especially thank Congressman Yoder of \nKansas for bringing this bill forward and for being bold enough to say \nlet's modernize a law that is so outdated that it goes back to 1986, \ngoverning email communication when we didn't even have email and text \nmessages.\n  Why do we want to do this? We want to do it because Federal agencies \nare abusing this law to invade the privacy of hardworking, law-abiding \ncitizens all across this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a document from the Internal Revenue Service \ntitled ``Search Warrant Handbook.'' In this document by the IRS, their \nprotocol says: ``In general, the Fourth Amendment does not protect \ncommunications held in electronic storage, such as email messages \nstored on a server, because internet users do not have a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy in such communications.''\n  The IRS has made it clear that they don't believe that American \ncitizens have a Fourth Amendment protection of privacy for their email \ncommunications. The IRS has gone further and is actually reading emails \nof American citizens, and no one across the country knows about it \nunless the IRS finds something that then they are going to go after you \ncriminally on.\n  So they are reading the private emails, Mr. Speaker, of American \ncitizens every single day, and they have been doing it for years. It is \ntime for this abuse of power to end.\n  We need to pass this bill with strong bipartisan support, send it \nover to the Senate, and get it to the President's desk so that American \ncitizens have real privacy protections that they deserve, that they \nthink they have, but they don't have, Mr. Speaker, because Federal \nagencies like the IRS today are reading the private emails of American \ncitizens and using them against them.\n  It is wrong. They ought to go get a warrant, but they should not be \nreading our private emails when people haven't done anything wrong.\n  Let's pass this bill.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Farenthold), a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, we are here today talking about \nmodernizing a law, but we are modernizing a law that encompasses a \ncenturies-old principle.\n  Back in the days when the Founding Fathers wrote our Constitution, \nthey were concerned about the government rifling through our papers. \nToday we have electronic papers. Stuff is stored in the cloud.\n  This piece of legislation brings us back in line with the intent of \nthe Founding Fathers that the government can't just rifle through your \npapers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I want to take this time to thank the ranking member, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Conyers), and many Members on his side of the aisle, \nincluding Mr. Polis.\n  I especially want to thank Mr. Yoder, who has worked long and hard on \nthis legislation for which he is the chief sponsor.\n  I most especially want to take note of the fact that we have very \ndisparate points of view from a whole array of people around this \ncountry, from law enforcement, to technology companies, to civil \nliberties organizations. It took a long time to sort through that and \nfind the common ground that is the legislation we have before us today.\n  That ground would not have been found without the outstanding work of \nour staff, most especially Caroline Lynch, the chief counsel of the \nJudiciary Committee's Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \nInvestigations Subcommittee, and her able team of attorneys, and Aaron \nHiller, minority counsel as well.\n  They deserve a great deal of gratitude for the years of work to bring \nus to this point where we can pass this important, important \nlegislation by what I believe will be a resounding majority.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. \n699, the Email Privacy Act.\n  Current law protecting electronic privacy is drastically out of step \nwith modern technology, and H.R. 699 represents a long overdue update. \nThis bill would provide Americans the privacy protections in their \nelectronic communications they expect and deserve.\n  While it is important that the House advance H.R. 699 today, no bill \nis perfect. Law enforcement has raised a few concerns about it, such as \nthat it does not provide them the ability to access to critical \ninformation quickly enough. As a former prosecutor, I take their views \nseriously. I hope we can continue the dialogue with law enforcement and \nconsider ways to improve the bill as it moves along in the legislative \nprocess.\n  I encourage all Members to support H.R. 699.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 699, the \nEmail Privacy Act.\n  This is an important and long negotiated bill that will update the \nElectronic Communications Privacy Act, a law that both protects the \nprivacy of our email communications and provides a critical tool for \nlaw enforcement to investigate crime.\n  I want to thank Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Ranking Member \nJohn Conyers for their leadership and for working together on this \nlegislation to accomplish the goals of this bill for the benefit and \nprotection of citizens, law enforcement, and communications providers.\n  I am an original cosponsor of this bill, which has 314 cosponsors, \nenjoying overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  The Electronic Communications Privacy Act, or ECPA, was enacted in \n1986.\n  The statute is outdated and provides unjustifiably inconsistent \nstandards for law enforcement access to stored communications.\n  The law was designed at a time when few of us used email or could \nhave imagined a world in which we could securely share information and \nedit electronic documents online with others, or where businesses could \ninput, store, process, and access all data related to their operation.\n  The outdated, inconsistent, and unclear aspects of this statute \nundermine both our privacy interests and law enforcement goals.\n  It is critical that we enact the central reforms provided by this \nbill.\n  For instance, a probable cause standard should apply to the \ngovernment's ability to compel a communications provider to disclose a \ncustomer's email message--no matter how old the message is.\n  Currently, the statute requires the government to obtain a warrant \nbased on probable cause to compel disclosure of an email that is in \nstorage for 180 days or less.\n  However, the statute only requires a subpoena for the government to \nobtain email messages that are older than 180 days.\n  This makes no sense because citizens have the same, reasonable \nexpectation that these stored communications are private.\n  Therefore, we must change the law so that the higher standard applies \nregardless of the age of these communications, and H.R. 699 would \naccomplish this.\n  In addition, the law does not adequately protect communications \nstored ``in the cloud'' by third parties on behalf of consumers, and a \nprobable cause warrant should be required for government access.\n  ECPA additionally provides a lesser standard for some cloud storage \nthan it does for many communications stored by electronic \ncommunications services.\n  To further complicate matters, many companies provide both \ncommunications services and remote storage, making the services to the \nsame customer difficult to separate for purposes of determining which \nstandard applies.\n  Applying inadequate and unclear standards to government access to \ncloud communications undermines consumer confidence in cloud privacy \nand threatens to hamper the development of this important engine of \neconomic growth.\n\n[[Page H2028]]\n\n  H.R. 699 addresses this issue by providing a clear and consistent \nprobable cause standard for access to the contents of stored \ncommunications for which customers have a reasonable expectation of \nprivacy.\n  H.R. 699 would accomplish these fairly straightforward reforms and \nthat is why it has the support of privacy advocates and electronic \ncommunications companies.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan \nmeasure.\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, as a proud original cosponsor of H.R. 699, \nthe Email Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), I am pleased to rise in \nfull support of this bill on the House floor.\n  Since being introduced on February 4, 2015, we have been able to \nsecure more than 300 cosponsors of this important bill, which will \nimprove privacy protections for the email communications of ordinary \nAmerican citizens.\n  Under current law there is little protection for the content of \nelectronic communications stored or maintained by third party service \nproviders. ECPA corrects this oversight and updates our laws to require \na court ordered warrant that is based on probable cause before an email \nservice provider can disclose these private communications.\n  In the current era where individual privacy is often overlooked or \nsidelined, this bill takes an important step to protect your privacy.\n  It is long past due that we update our privacy laws to give emails--a \nmajor means of communication today--the same protection as traditional \nmail and telephone calls. This bill has been endorsed by a broad range \nof privacy groups, including such conservative organizations as the \nHeritage Foundation and FreedomWorks.\n  Our bill modernizes these outdated statutes to ensure that the rights \nprotected by the Fourth Amendment extend to Americans' email \ncorrespondence and digital data.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 699, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2028-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2028-H2034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DEFEND TRADE SECRETS ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on S. 1890, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Today we are here to consider S. 1890, the Defend Trade Secrets Act \nof 2016. This bill puts forward enhancements to our Federal trade \nsecrets law, creating a Federal civil remedy for trade secrets \nmisappropriation that will help American innovators protect their \nintellectual property from criminal theft by foreign agents and those \nengaging in economic espionage. This bill will help U.S. \ncompetitiveness, job creation, and our Nation's future economic \nsecurity.\n  Our intellectual property laws cover everything from patents, \ncopyrights and trademarks, and include trade secrets.\n  But what are trade secrets?\n  Trade secrets law is used to protect some of the most iconic \ninventions in America. For example, a trade secret can include recipes \nlike Colonel Sanders' secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices, and the \n125-year-old formula for Coca-Cola housed in a vault at the World of \nCoca-Cola in Atlanta, Georgia.\n  However, trade secrets are not simply isolated to the realm of food \nand\n\n[[Page H2031]]\n\nbeverages. They can include confidential formulas like the formula for \nWD-40, manufacturing techniques, customer lists, and algorithms like \nGoogle's search engine.\n  Trade secrets occupy a unique place in the IP portfolios of our most \ninnovative companies, but because they are unregistered and not \nformally reviewed like patents, there are no limitations on discovering \na trade secret by fair, lawful methods, such as reverse engineering or \nindependent development. In innovative industries, that is simply the \nfree market at work.\n  Though trade secrets are not formally reviewed, they are protected \nfrom misappropriation, which includes obtaining the trade secret \nthrough improper or unlawful means. Misappropriation can take many \nforms, whether it is an employee selling blueprints to a competitor or \na foreign agent hacking into a server. In addition, one could argue \nthat even a foreign government's policies to require forced technology \ntransfer is a form of misappropriation.\n  Though most States base their trade secrets laws on the Uniform Trade \nSecrets Act, the Federal Government protects trade secrets through the \nEconomic Espionage Act. In the 112th Congress, the Committee on the \nJudiciary helped enact two pieces of legislation to help improve the \nprotection of trade secrets, and in the 113th Congress, we introduced \nand passed out of committee the first version of this trade secrets \nbill unanimously.\n  Today we build on our efforts over these past 2 years and are taking \na significant and positive step toward improving our Nation's trade \nsecrets laws and continuing to build on our important work in this area \nof intellectual property. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                            Information Technology\n\n\n                                             Industry Council,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2016.\n     Hon. Kevin McCarthy,\n     Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Doug Collins,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Conyers,\n     Ranking Member, House Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Jerrold Nadler,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader McCarthy, Democratic Leader Pelosi, \n     Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers, Representative \n     Collins, and Representative Nadler: On behalf of the members \n     of the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), I write \n     to express our support for S. 1890, the Defend Trade Secrets \n     Act of 2016 (DTSA), and commend your efforts to bring it to \n     the House floor for debate and vote. Given the importance of \n     trade secrets protection to the high-tech industry, we will \n     consider scoring votes in support of DTSA in our 114th \n     Congressional Voting Guide.\n       ITI companies are at the forefront of innovation and have \n     some of the largest trade secret and patent portfolios in the \n     world tied to numerous goods and services offered to \n     governments, commercial enterprises and consumers around the \n     globe. In fact, patent portfolios often grow as a result of \n     the ideas and products originating as trade secrets. Customer \n     lists, manufacturing processes, and source code are just a \n     few examples of important assets considered to be trade \n     secrets by many companies.\n       Our companies pour billions of dollars into research and \n     development to create products and services that ultimately \n     become the backbone of their businesses. Trade secrets \n     produced through this research and development increasingly \n     have become attractive to competitors in other countries. In \n     addition, advances in technology now make it easy to copy \n     trade secret materials onto a jump drive or lap top computer \n     that once would have taken reams of paper to reproduce. As a \n     result, the threat posed to American trade secrets has \n     increased and theft of these secrets robs our economy of \n     growth and innovation.\n       It is long overdue for our trade secrets law to be \n     modernized to keep pace with the rapid developments of our \n     companies and the technologies and methods used by the \n     criminals who target them. The patchwork of state trade \n     secrets laws, while effective for local theft, fail to meet \n     the demands of the global nature of today's trade secret \n     misappropriation. In addition, trade secrets do not enjoy the \n     same federal protections as other types of intellectual \n     property. While it is a federal crime to steal a trade \n     secret, unlike patents, copyrights and trademarks, there is \n     no federal civil remedy.\n       DTSA provides a solution to these problematic gaps by \n     making federal law more comprehensive and providing trade \n     secrets owners with remedies all forms of intellectual \n     property should be afforded. With both a federal criminal and \n     a federal civil cause of action, large and small companies \n     alike will have access to more tools they need to effectively \n     combat trade secret theft and help to ensure future \n     innovation continues to occur in the United States.\n       While trade secret protection is important domestically, as \n     American companies expand in the global marketplace, this \n     protection is also needed worldwide. As we operate in other \n     countries and work with them to encourage strong intellectual \n     property protection within their own borders, the Defend \n     Trade Secrets Act will serve as a model for effective \n     protection.\n       We thank the House Judiciary Committee for quickly \n     approving this legislation, and we look forward to seeing the \n     bill pass in the House of Representatives and move to the \n     president's desk to become law.\n       On behalf of ITI's member companies, I thank you for your \n     leadership on intellectual property protection and urge you \n     and your colleagues to support S. 1890.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dean C. Garfield,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                Manufacturers,\n\n                                                   April 26, 2016.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representatives: The National Association of \n     Manufacturers (NAM), the largest manufacturing association in \n     the United States representing manufacturers in every \n     industrial sector and in all 50 states urges you to support \n     S. 1890, the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016. S. 1890 passed \n     the Senate by a vote of 87-0, and represents a bipartisan and \n     amended version of H.R. 3326, introduced by Representatives \n     Doug Collins (R-GA) and Jerrold Nadler (D-NY).\n       The NAM supports further safeguarding of confidential \n     business information and trade secrets through the expansion \n     of federal jurisdiction to enable faster, nationwide \n     enforcement of all intellectual property (IP) rights. IP is \n     one of the most valued business assets for manufacturers of \n     all sizes. The impact of its theft has increased \n     exponentially in today's digitally-driven environment. Mass \n     amounts of this critical business information can now be \n     illegally transferred to a small data storage device and \n     removed easily and quickly from a manufacturers' facility. \n     The value of this business information creates an inseparable \n     link between the need for protection of intellectual property \n     rights and innovation, competitiveness, and sound economic \n     growth.\n       The NAM supports S. 1890 because it would strengthen the \n     ability of manufacturers to protect their IP by creating a \n     federal civil right of action to help prevent and prosecute \n     trade secret theft, an important tool that does not exist \n     today. Such a tool eliminates the difficult, time-consuming, \n     and costly process imposed on manufacturers as they currently \n     must work with multiple state jurisdictions in order to \n     apprehend perpetrators of trade secret theft. A federal \n     process that cuts across state lines would also increase the \n     likelihood of preventing this valuable data from leaving the \n     country permanently.\n       Manufacturers deploy the latest technology and controls to \n     protect the critical information guarded by trade secrets. In \n     the unfortunate instances when this data is compromised, \n     manufacturers need to act quickly before it is disclosed and \n     its value is lost forever. S. 1890 would modernize our \n     current system, providing owners of trade secrets the same \n     legal options as owners of other forms of IP, and give them \n     the ability to pursue trade secret theft aggressively and \n     efficiently.\n       The NAM's Key Vote Advisory Committee has indicated that \n     votes on S. 1890, including procedural motions, may be \n     considered for designation as Key Manufacturing Votes in the \n     114th Congress. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Aric Newhouse.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Chamber of Commerce,\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2016.\n       To The Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation representing the interests of more than three \n     million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as \n     well as state and local chambers and industry associations, \n     and dedicated to promoting, protecting, and defending \n     America's free enterprise system, strongly supports S. 1890, \n     the ``Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016,'' and urges the House \n     to expeditiously pass this bill.\n       Intellectual property sector industries generate 35% of all \n     U.S. Gross Domestic Product and are responsible for two-\n     thirds of all exports and over forty million good-paying \n     jobs. The threat of trade secrets theft is of increasing \n     concern to U.S. economic security and domestic jobs, and S. \n     1890 would provide companies with an effective tool to combat \n     this growing problem. Creating a federal civil cause of \n     action to complement existing criminal remedies and providing \n     a uniform system and legal framework would enable companies \n     to better mitigate the commercial injury and loss of \n     employment that often occur when trade secrets are stolen.\n       The Chamber appreciates the House's attention to this \n     important issue that impacts\n\n[[Page H2032]]\n\n     companies that depend on intellectual property to spur \n     innovation, create jobs, and bring new products to market \n     that benefit consumers. By creating a federal civil remedy \n     for trade secrets theft, this bill would help ensure the \n     trade secrets of U.S. companies are given similar protections \n     afforded to other forms of intellectual property including \n     patents, trademarks, and copyrights.\n       The Chamber urges you to support S. 1890 and may consider \n     votes on, or in relation to, this bill in our annual How They \n     Voted scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of S. 1890, the Defend Trade Secrets Act. This \nmeasure amends the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 to create a Federal \ncivil cause of action and to facilitate expedited ex parte seizure of \nproperty when necessary to preserve evidence or prevent dissemination.\n  The House counterpart to this bill, H.R. 3326, which was introduced \nby our committee colleagues, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) \nand the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), now has 164 \nbipartisan cosponsors, including myself.\n  Likewise, S. 1890 enjoys broad bipartisan and bicameral support, as \nevidenced by the fact that the Senate passed this bill by a vote of 87-\n0 earlier this month. The House Committee on the Judiciary reported \nthis bill favorably by a unanimous voice vote only last week.\n  There are several reasons that I support the legislation. To begin \nwith, S. 1890 will enhance the protection of trade secrets, which is \nintegral to the success of any business. It is estimated that the value \nof trade secrets owned by United States companies as of 2009 was \napproximately $5 trillion.\n  Although trade secrets are fundamental to the success of any \nbusiness, United States companies have struggled to protect these \nvaluable assets, especially in the digital age of smartphones and the \nInternet. It is estimated that the loss of trade secrets as a result of \ncyber espionage costs these businesses between $200 billion and $300 \nbillion annually.\n  Thieves take advantage of ever-evolving, innovative technologies to \naccess sensitive trade secrets information and to distribute it \nimmediately.\n  While Federal law protects other forms of intellectual property by \nproviding access to Federal courts for aggrieved parties to seek \nredress, there is no Federal civil cause of action for enforcement of \ntrade secrets protection.\n  S. 1890 addresses this need by establishing a Federal cause of action \nfor trade secrets owners to obtain injunctive and monetary relief, \nwhich will be a powerful new tool to protect their intellectual \nproperty.\n  Now, another reason I support the bill is that it would foster \nuniformity among the States. Although States provide civil remedies for \ntrade secrets theft, these laws often fall short when trade secrets are \ntaken across State lines. As a result, businesses that have nationwide \noperations must deal with various differing State laws, which can be \ntoo costly for some businesses, particularly smaller ones. This also \nprevents businesses from taking full advantage of the rights that they \nmight have under the law.\n  S. 1890 would provide trade secrets owners access to uniform national \nlaw and the ability to make their case in Federal court.\n  Lastly, I support the bill because it reflects constructive feedback \nfrom various stakeholders.\n  We have been working on this legislation for almost 2 years. It \nreflects the input from a broad spectrum of stakeholders, and the bill \nis an excellent example of what can be achieved when there is \nbipartisan collaboration.\n  I close by urging my colleagues to support this important legislation \nso that we can send it to the President's desk for signature.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 5 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins), the chief sponsor of the \nHouse version of this bill and a member of the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. \n1890, the Defend Trade Secrets Act. I introduced the House companion, \nand I am proud to see this bill moving forward. This legislation is \nsorely needed to protect the United States from the billions of dollars \nit faces in losses each year due to trade secrets theft.\n  However, the legislation could not have reached this point without \nthe hard work and dedication of several people. First, I would like to \nthank Chairman Goodlatte and his staff for their efforts to move this \nbill through the Committee on the Judiciary and bring it to the floor. \nThis has been, as the ranking member said, a several-year process. We \nare glad to see it here.\n  I also wanted to thank those who introduced the House legislation \nwith me, Mr. Nadler and Mr. Jeffries, both from New York, and their \nstaff, for their commitment to the issue and their willingness to work \nacross the aisle to implement meaningful reform.\n  On the Senate side, Senators Hatch and Coons were instrumental in \ngetting us to this point. Their leadership, along with the leadership \nof Chairman Grassley and Senator Leahy, helped ensure the strong Senate \nvote of 87-0 and ensured this product was able to come to the House.\n  I would finally like to take just a moment to thank Jennifer \nChoudhry, my former legislative director, for her hand in introducing \nand shepherding this bill through the legislative process. Her \ncontributions were invaluable, and she should be proud of her part in \ngetting this legislation to the House floor today. I also thank Sally \nRose Larson, who has taken up the mantle in my office and helped to get \nus here to the finish line.\n  The Defend Trade Secrets Act enjoys support from a broad coalition of \ngroups and industries, from Americans for Tax Reform, the American Bar \nAssociation Intellectual Property Law Section, the Information \nTechnology Industry Council, the chamber of commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, and many more. In fact, Mr. Speaker, this \nbill has more than 160 bipartisan cosponsors.\n  Mr. Speaker, estimates show that as much as 80 percent of companies' \nassets are intangible, many in the form of trade secrets. Couple that \nwith the fact that trade secrets theft is costing America billions of \ndollars each year. In fact, one study indicates that trade secrets \ntheft costs America approximately $300 billion annually. That price tag \nwill continue to grow as technology and thieves become more \nsophisticated. Trade secrets theft jeopardizes our economic security \nand threatens jobs, which is why it is so important that we take steps \nto address it.\n  Trade secrets include everything from business information to \ndesigns, prototypes, and formulas. Coming from Georgia, one good \nexample is the recipe for Coca-Cola. Trade secrets are commercially \nvaluable information subject to secrecy protection. They are a critical \nform of intellectual property, yet they do not enjoy the same \nprotections that apply to other forms of intellectual property, such as \ncopyrights, patents, and trademarks.\n  Additionally, trade secrets derive economic value from not being \npublicly known, and this confidential business information can be \nprotected for an unlimited time. However, once trade secrets are \ndisclosed, they instantly lose their value, making it even more \nimportant to have the mechanisms in place to protect them.\n  Currently, Federal law is insufficient to address many of the \nchallenges related to trade secrets theft in today's economy. The only \nFederal mechanism for trade secrets protection under current law is the \n1996 Economic Espionage Act, which made trade secrets theft by foreign \nnationals a criminal offense.\n  However, this only addresses part of the problem, and criminalizes \nonly a portion of trade secrets theft, whereas a civil remedy for \nmisuse and misappropriation would allow companies to more broadly \nprotect their property.\n  The Defend Trade Secrets Act will address that, and it will \nstrengthen the ability of companies to protect valuable trade secrets, \nwhich, in turn, allows them to protect American jobs and innovation. \nThe bill will empower companies to protect their trade secrets in \nFederal court by creating a Federal private right of action.\n  The bill streamlines access to relief, and, in extraordinary \ncircumstances, allows victims of trade secrets theft to obtain a \nseizure to ensure trade secrets\n\n[[Page H2033]]\n\nare not abused while cases are pending. The Defend Trade Secrets Act \nalso provides for an injunction and damages.\n  Protecting the trade secrets of American businesses is crucial to \nkeeping our country a leader in the world economy. Providing a Federal \ncivil remedy will create certainty for companies throughout the Nation, \nincluding my home State of Georgia.\n  Congress has the responsibility to give industries the tools they \nneed to protect their intellectual property and, in turn, encourage job \ncreation and economic growth. This bill takes a step forward in better \nprotecting American innovation.\n  Again, I want to thank the tireless work of my House and Senate \ncolleagues in advancing this critical legislation. I am proud to see \nthis bill, which provides critical intellectual property protections \nand protects American businesses, move forward. I would encourage all \nmy colleagues to join me today in supporting the Defend Trade Secrets \nAct.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Nadler), a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary \nand author of this bill.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1890, the \nDefend Trade Secrets Act of 2016. This long overdue legislation would \nprotect businesses across the country from the growing threat of trade \nsecrets theft by creating a uniform Federal civil cause of action for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets.\n  Trade secrets are proprietary business information that derive their \nvalue from being and remaining secret. This includes secret recipes, \nsoftware codes, and manufacturing processes--information that, if \ndisclosed, could prove ruinous to a company. As the United States \neconomy becomes more and more knowledge- and service-based, trade \nsecrets are increasingly becoming the foundation of businesses across \nthe country, with one estimate placing the value of trade secrets in \nthe United States at $5 trillion.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Unfortunately, with such fortunes resting on trade secrets, theft of \nthis property is inevitable. And in today's digital environment, it has \nnever been easier to transfer stolen property across the globe with the \nclick of a button. By one estimate, the American economy loses annually \nas much as $300 billion or more due to misappropriation of trade \nsecrets, leading to loss of up to 2.1 billion jobs each year.\n  With so much at stake, it is absolutely vital that the law include \nstrong protections against theft of trade secrets. However, our current \npatchwork of Federal and State laws has proven inadequate to the job. \nWhile the Federal Government may bring criminal prosecutions and may \nmove for civil injunctions, this power is rarely exercised and often \nfails to adequately compensate the victims.\n  The States provide civil causes of action for victims of theft, with \nmoney damages available, but this system has not proven efficient or \neffective for incidents that cross State and, sometimes, international \nborders.\n  Once upon a time, trade secrets might have been kept in a file \ncabinet somewhere, and would-be thieves would have to spirit away a \nphysical copy, making it likely that they would be caught before \ncrossing State lines. But today, trade secrets can be loaded onto a \nthumb drive and mailed out of State or even sent electronically \nanywhere across the globe in an instant.\n  Pursuing a defendant and the evidence in dispute across State lines \npresent a host of challenges for victims of trade secret theft, \nparticularly when time is of the essence. The need for a Federal \nsolution is, therefore, clear.\n  The Defend Trade Secrets Act fills this gap by creating a uniform \nFederal civil cause of action for theft of trade secrets. It also \nprovides for expedited ex parte seizure of property, but only in \nextraordinary circumstances where necessary to preserve evidence or \nprevent dissemination.\n  As the lead Democratic cosponsor of H.R. 3326, the House companion to \nthis legislation, I am very pleased that this bill is on the floor \ntoday, and I want to thank everyone who worked hard to bring us to this \npoint. In particular, I want to thank the sponsor of H.R. 3326, the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins), as well as Ranking Member \nConyers, Chairman Goodlatte, and the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nJeffries). I also appreciate the sponsors of the Senate bill, S. 1890, \nSenators Hatch and Coons, for all of their work on this legislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. CONYERS. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. NADLER. The bill we are considering today represents the \nculmination of over 2 years of negotiations with various stakeholders \nand has strong bipartisan support, with 164 cosponsors in the House and \n65 in the Senate.\n  This is good legislation that carefully balances the rights of \ndefendants and the needs of American businesses to protect their most \nvaluable assets. The Senate passed the bill 87-0. With passage here \ntoday, we can send it straight to the President's desk.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Jeffries), a distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding, \nas well as for his tremendous leadership, and Chairman Goodlatte, \nCongressman Collins, Congressman Nadler, as well as the Protect Trade \nSecrets Coalition, for their tremendous work in getting us to this \npoint where we are on the verge of passing this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Whether it is the original recipe created by Colonel Sanders in \nconnection with Kentucky Fried Chicken or whether it is the special \nsauce made famous by the iconic Big Mac of McDonald's or whether it is \nCorning's glass that is so frequently used and found in many of our \nsmartphones all across the country, trade secrets are as American as \nbaseball and apple pie. Unfortunately, we have found ourselves, over \nthe last few years, in a situation where trade secret theft has become \na significant problem, by some accounts costing us in excess of $300 \nbillion per year and more than 2 million jobs annually.\n  Traditionally, trade secret theft has been dealt with on the civil \nside as a matter of State law. But because of the increasing nature of \nthe problem and the fact that it is both multistate and multinational \nin nature, the State law domain has become inadequate, which brings us \nto this piece of legislation that would create a Federal civil cause of \naction for trade secret misappropriation, giving our companies and \nstakeholders access to a uniform body of law that can deal with trade \nsecret theft in a more appropriate fashion.\n  That is why this piece of legislation is so significant in this \nclimate and why I am so thankful for the leadership of all those who \nhave brought us to this point. I urge everyone to support this bill.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my fellow Judiciary \nCommittee colleagues and their staffs who have devoted much time and \nenergy and intellect to this project. We have worked together for the \ncommon goal of improving our Nation's trade secret laws for the past 2 \nyears.\n  I want to particularly thank Representatives Doug Collins, Jerrold \nNadler, and the over 150 Members of Congress who joined as cosponsors \nof this legislation in the House. In the Senate, we have worked closely \nwith Senators Hatch, Grassley, Leahy, Coons, and others, and I want to \nthank them and their staffs for their contributions to this effort.\n  Furthermore, I would like to thank the White House and the U.S. \nPatent and Trademark Office for working collaboratively with us, as \nwell as the Protect Trade Secrets Coalition for its work on this \neffort. I also want to thank my staff for all their hard work on this \nimportant legislation.\n  This bill is the product of years of bipartisan, bicameral work, and \nit will have a positive impact on U.S. competitiveness, job creation, \nand our Nation's future economic security. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport S. 1890.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1890, \nthe ``Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016''.\n\n[[Page H2034]]\n\n  S. 1890, amends the, ``Economic Espionage Act of 1996,'' to create a \nfederal civil remedy for trade secret misappropriation, and expedite ex \nparte seizure of trade secrets to preserve evidence or prevent \ndissemination, without preempting state law.\n  ``Trade secrets'' are the form of intellectual property that protect \nconfidential information, including: marketing data and strategies, \nmanufacturing processes or techniques, confidential and chemical \nformulae, product design, customer lists, business leads, pricing \nschedules, and sales techniques.\n  Trade secret law offers protection from trade secret \n``misappropriation,'' which is the unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisclosure of such secrets obtained by some improper means.\n  Under U.S. law, trade secrets consist of three parts: (i) information \nthat is non-public; (2) the reasonable measures taken to protect that \ninformation; and (3) the fact that the information derives independent \neconomic value from not being publicly known.\n  American companies are at the forefront of innovation and have some \nof the largest trade secret and patent portfolios in the world tied to \nnumerous goods and services offered to governments, commercial \nenterprises, and consumers around the globe.\n  In fact, patent portfolios often grow as a result of the ideas and \nproducts that originated as trade secrets.\n  President Obama's Administration identified the importance of this \nlegislation and, ``strongly supports the Defend Trade Secrets Act,'' \nbecause he recognizes that as the United States continues to shift from \na manufacturing, to a knowledge- and service-based economy, businesses \nincreasingly depend on trade secrets to protect their confidential \nknow-how.\n  A 2009 estimate placed the value of trade secrets owned by U.S. \ncompanies at five trillion dollars, demonstrating that trade secrets \nhave become an increasingly important part of most companies' overall \nassets.\n  But, the global economy creates a competitive environment in which \ncompanies struggle to safeguard this information in light of innovative \ntechnologies, such as cell phones, which allow nearly anyone to \nphotograph or otherwise record data and send information nearly \ninstantaneously.\n  A 2013 report, by the Commission on the Theft of American \nIntellectual Property, estimated that the American economy loses more \nthan $300 billion annually as a result of theft of intellectual \nproperty, largely trade secrets, leading to a loss of up to 2.1 million \njobs each year.\n  The same theft is slowing U.S. economic growth and diminishing the \nincentive to innovate that we celebrate today.\n  Our companies pour billions of dollars into research and development, \ncreating products and services that ultimately become the backbone of \ntheir businesses.\n  And rightly so, those trade secrets produced through research and \ndevelopment increasingly have become the attractive envy of competitors \nin other countries.\n  In addition, advances in technology now make it easy to copy trade \nsecret materials onto a jump drive or laptop computer that in a world \nof less advanced technology would have taken reams of paper to \nreproduce.\n  Modernization of trade secrets law is long overdue if our legislation \nis to keep pace with the rapid developments of premier American \ncompanies and the technologies and methodologies used by the criminals \nwho target them.\n  The patchwork of state trade secrets laws, while effective for local \ntheft, fail to meet the demands of the global nature of today's trade \nsecret misappropriations.\n  In addition, trade secrets do not enjoy the same federal protections \nas other types of intellectual property. While it is a federal crime to \nsteal a trade secret, unlike patents, copyrights and trademarks, there \nis no current federal civil remedy.\n  This confidential business information can be protected for an \nunlimited time, unlike patents, and requires no formal registration \nprocess.\n  But unlike patents, once this information is disclosed it instantly \nloses its value and the property right itself ceases to exist, \ndemonstrating a stark difference in the potential consequences of \nsecuring patent protections versus keeping an innovation as a trade \nsecret.\n  When an inventor seeks patent protection, he or she agrees to \ndisclose to the world their invention and how it works, furthering \ninnovation and research, as well as securing a 20-year exclusive term \nof protection, and the right to prevent others from making, using, \nselling, importing, or distributing a patented invention without \npermission.\n  However, in contrast by maintaining it as a trade secret, an inventor \ncould theoretically keep their invention secret indefinitely (ex: \nformula for Coca-Cola; the KFC Colonel's Secret Recipe); but, the \ndownside is there is no protection if the trade secret is uncovered by \nothers through reverse engineering or independent development.\n  Trade secrets must be valiantly guarded because discovery of a trade \nsecret by fair, lawful methods, such as reverse engineering or \nindependent development, is permitted.\n  As a result, the threat posed to American trade secrets has increased \nand theft of these secrets robs our economy of growth and innovation. \nS. 1890, provides a solution to these problematic gaps by making \nfederal law more comprehensive and providing trade secrets owners with \nremedies that all forms of intellectual property should be afforded.\n  With both a federal criminal and a federal civil cause of action, \nlarge and small companies alike will have access to more of the tools \nthat they need to effectively combat trade secret theft and help to \nensure future innovation continues to occur within the United States.\n  While trade secret protection is important domestically, as American \ncompanies expand in the global marketplace, this protection is also \nparamount worldwide.\n  As we operate in other countries and work with them to encourage \nstrong intellectual property protection within their own borders, the \n``Defend Trade Secrets Act'' will serve as a model for effective \nprotection.\n  S. 1890 will prevent the occurrence of (1) trade secret theft \noccurring in the United States and around the world; and (2) trade \nsecret theft harming owner companies and their employees; while \nallowing the ``Economic Espionage Act of 1996'' to continue to apply \nbroadly to protect trade secrets from theft.\n  I thank the House Judiciary Committee for quickly approving this \nlegislation, and look forward to seeing this bill pass in the House to \nmove to the President's desk to become law.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank our Leadership for its prowess on intellectual \nproperty protection and urge you and your colleagues to support S. \n1890.\n\n                                              Chamber of Commerce,\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2016.\n       To The Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation representing the interests of more than three \n     million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as \n     well as state and local chambers and industry associations, \n     and dedicated to promoting, protecting, and defending \n     America's free enterprise system, strongly supports S. 1890, \n     the ``Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016,'' and urges the House \n     to expeditiously pass this bill.\n       Intellectual property sector industries generate 35% of all \n     U.S. Gross Domestic Product and are responsible for two-\n     thirds of all exports and over forty million good-paying \n     jobs. The threat of trade secrets theft is of increasing \n     concern to U.S. economic security and domestic jobs, and S. \n     1890 would provide companies with an effective tool to combat \n     this growing problem. Creating a federal civil cause of \n     action to complement existing criminal remedies and providing \n     a uniform system and legal framework would enable companies \n     to better mitigate the commercial injury and loss of \n     employment that often occur when trade secrets are stolen.\n       The Chamber appreciates the House's attention to this \n     important issue that impacts companies that depend on \n     intellectual property to spur innovation, create jobs, and \n     bring new products to market that benefit consumers. By \n     creating a federal civil remedy for trade secrets theft, this \n     bill would help ensure the trade secrets of U.S. companies \n     are given similar protections afforded to other forms of \n     intellectual property including patents, trademarks, and \n     copyrights.\n       The Chamber urges you to support S. 1890 and may consider \n     votes on, or in relation to, this bill in our annual How They \n     Voted scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, S. 1890.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Helping Angels Lead Our \n     Startups Act'' or the ``HALOS Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF ANGEL INVESTOR GROUP.\n\n       As used in this Act, the term ``angel investor group'' \n     means any group that--\n       (1) is composed of accredited investors interested in \n     investing personal capital in early-stage companies;\n       (2) holds regular meetings and has defined processes and \n     procedures for making investment decisions, either \n     individually or among the membership of the group as a whole; \n     and\n       (3) is neither associated nor affiliated with brokers, \n     dealers, or investment advisers.\n\n     SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF GENERAL SOLICITATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission \n     shall revise Regulation D of its rules (17 C.F.R. 230.500 et \n     seq.) to require that in carrying out the prohibition against \n     general solicitation or general advertising contained in \n     section 230.502(c) of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, \n     the prohibition shall not apply to a presentation or other \n     communication made by or on behalf of an issuer which is made \n     at an event--\n       (1) sponsored by--\n       (A) the United States or any territory thereof, by the \n     District of Columbia, by any State, by a political \n     subdivision of any State or territory, or by any agency or \n     public instrumentality of any of the foregoing;\n       (B) a college, university, or other institution of higher \n     education;\n       (C) a nonprofit organization;\n       (D) an angel investor group;\n       (E) a venture forum, venture capital association, or trade \n     association; or\n       (F) any other group, person or entity as the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission may determine by rule;\n       (2) where any advertising for the event does not reference \n     any specific offering of securities by the issuer;\n       (3) the sponsor of which--\n       (A) does not make investment recommendations or provide \n     investment advice to event attendees;\n       (B) does not engage in an active role in any investment \n     negotiations between the issuer and investors attending the \n     event;\n       (C) does not charge event attendees any fees other than \n     administrative fees; and\n       (D) does not receive any compensation with respect to such \n     event that would require registration of the sponsor as a \n     broker or a dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, \n     or as an investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act \n     of 1940; and\n       (4) where no specific information regarding an offering of \n     securities by the issuer is communicated or distributed by or \n     on behalf of the issuer, other than--\n\n[[Page H2038]]\n\n       (A) that the issuer is in the process of offering \n     securities or planning to offer securities;\n       (B) the type and amount of securities being offered;\n       (C) the amount of securities being offered that have \n     already been subscribed for; and\n       (D) the intended use of proceeds of the offering.\n       (b) Rule of Construction.--Subsection (a) may only be \n     construed as requiring the Securities and Exchange Commission \n     to amend the requirements of Regulation D with respect to \n     presentations and communications, and not with respect to \n     purchases or sales.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour, \nequally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member \nof the Committee on Financial Services.\n  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand submit extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support today of H.R. 4498, the Helping \nAngels Lead Our Startups Act, known as the HALOS Act. This is yet \nanother bipartisan bill that has been passed out of the Financial \nServices Committee that I know will help create jobs and grow our \neconomy.\n  We all know from listening to our constituents that jobs and the \neconomy continue to be the number one issue of concern because this \neconomy is still not working for working Americans. After many years, \nthey still see their paychecks have stagnated. They have seen their \nsavings evaporate. They are losing hope. We see entrepreneurship is at \na generational low.\n  The HALOS Act is a step in the right direction. It is one of many \nsolutions that we need to enact in this body.\n  I commend the bipartisan sponsor of the bill, Mr. Chabot, the \nchairman of the Small Business Committee; Mr. Hurt of Virginia and Ms. \nSinema of Arizona, the latter two who serve with me on the Financial \nServices Committee.\n  I want to thank all of my colleagues on the Financial Services \nCommittee for voting overwhelmingly in favor of this bill. Almost 80 \npercent of the membership of the committee voted to advance it to the \nfloor.\n  I am proud that our committee has a strong record of bipartisanship. \nSince the beginning of the 114th Congress, Mr. Speaker, the House has \npassed 56 of our measures--30 have been signed into law--and each one \nof these measures received bipartisan support. In an era of divided \ngovernment, that is not a bad record.\n  I believe that most Americans also believe that our economy works \nbetter for all Americans when small businesses can focus on creating \njobs rather than navigating meaningless bureaucratic red tape.\n  The HALOS Act provides an important fix to regulations so it will be \neasier for our small businesses to attract investments. Again, Mr. \nSpeaker, so critical when entrepreneurship is at a generational low and \nour economy limps along at even less than 2 percent of economic growth.\n  The HALOS Act provides a clearer path for startup businesses to \nconnect with angel investors and allows investors to make their own \ninformed decisions. Angel investors play an incredibly active role in \nhelping small businesses open their doors and grow so they can open \ntheir doors even wider and hire more workers.\n  We should remember--and many of our colleagues are now aware--that \ncompanies like Amazon, Costco, Google, Facebook, and Starbucks were all \nfirst funded by angel investors. Now, today, not only the services they \nprovide in our economy, but approximately 600,000 employees earn their \npaychecks and provide for their families working for companies that \nwere started with angel investors.\n  Unfortunately, as so often happens, when Washington regulators get \nout of control, they step into the picture and we have yet more \nunintended consequences. Four years ago, Congress passed a bipartisan \nJOBS Act to make it easier for business startups to gain access to \ncapital, but the Securities and Exchange Commission issued misguided \nregulations on angel investors that had exactly the opposite effect.\n  By inappropriately classifying events where entrepreneurs showcased \ntheir business models to angel investors as general solicitations, the \nSEC regulations are causing innovative startups to lose access to \ncapital, which means our economy loses jobs. This is counter to \nCongress' intent when we passed the JOBS Act, and it is certainly \ncounter to what our economy needs now. Mr. Speaker, what is so ironic \nis that the practice was legal and proper before the passage of the \nJOBS Act. It should remain legal and proper after the passage of the \nJOBS Act.\n  This is a problem that Congress can easily fix by approving the HALOS \nAct. It is not a complicated bill, Mr. Speaker. It is four pages long. \nIt simply ensures that funding from angel investors remains available \nto business startups.\n  The bipartisan bill makes sure that events where entrepreneurs and \nangel investors get together are not classified as general \nsolicitations because they are not. Instead of onerous bureaucratic red \ntape that deters investors from backing new business startups, the \nfour-page HALOS Act will help new businesses gain investor support when \nthey need it most.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, this bill sailed through the \nHouse Financial Services Committee with strong bipartisan support. Out \nof 57 members voting in committee that day, only 13 opposed the bill. \nIn other words, 80 percent of the committee voted in favor of the HALOS \nAct.\n  The bill has strong bipartisan support because it is common sense. It \nis about jobs; it is about helping small businesses overcome misguided \nregulation; and it is about making sure that Congress makes the law--\nnot the regulators, who are unelected and who are unaccountable.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I rise in opposition to H.R. 4498, the Helping Angels Lead Our \nStartups Act.\n  This bill will make changes to investor protections under the JOBS \nAct that I believe are ill-advised and could lead to unintended \nconsequences for our regulatory framework.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  It would do so by broadening the scope of when private securities \nofferings can be solicited or advertised to the public without first \nverifying that the purchaser is financially sophisticated enough to \nunderstand the risk involved, what we call ``accredited investors.''\n  Specifically, the bill would require the SEC to amend its safe harbor \nrules for private placements under Rule 506 of Regulation D so that the \ncurrent verification requirements for general solicitation and \nadvertising do not effectively apply to sales events that are sponsored \nby certain groups, colleges, nonprofits, trade associations, or angel \ninvestor groups, for example.\n  The bill's intent is to expand the role of angel investors in capital \nformation. It is a laudable goal, but it is one that needs appropriate \nrules to ensure investors have the protection and legal recourse needed \nto make sound investments.\n  So, while the bill would limit the amount and type of information \nthat can be communicated for these events, it would still allow \ncompanies to condition the markets for their securities and offer them \nto any member of the public who walks in the door.\n  Let me be clear. If a university wants to sponsor a so-called demo \nday with companies that want to pitch their ideas and products, they \nalready can, and the entire public can attend. The companies, however, \njust can't talk about offers or sell securities in their companies.\n  I am concerned that this bill, however, would cause real harm to \nretail investors. For example, a hedge fund could set up an event that \nis sponsored by a questionable college, like Corinthian, could pass out \nflyers on campus\n\n[[Page H2039]]\n\nthat advertise their shares, and then sell those shares to anyone who \nhad attended the event, including the students who may know nothing \nabout how this whole operation works. They would not have to take \nreasonable steps to verify that these purchasers are accredited \ninvestors.\n  Furthermore, events sponsored by government entities, nonprofits, and \nuniversities are likely to attract the very people we are trying to \nprotect, investors who are not accredited and do not have enough \nfinancial sophistication or wherewithal to understand the investments \nor bear their high risk of loss.\n  We created the Rule 506 exemption under the JOBS Act to expand the \nmarket for private offerings. Private companies can now advertise and \nsolicit offerings to the general public, which helps them to raise the \ncapital they need to grow their businesses.\n  In exchange for the expanded framework and lower levels of investor \nprotection, we passed a simple amendment that I offered to require \ncompanies to just take reasonable steps to verify that the purchaser of \nthe security is an accredited investor.\n  The intent was simple. If a company is going to advertise riskier \nprivate offerings, it must ensure that the buyer has the necessary \nincome and assets to qualify for such a purchase rather than rely on \nso-called self-certification. The bill would effectively reverse this \nsensible amendment during these sales events.\n  At best, the bill is also unnecessary. The SEC has already provided \nrelief to angel investor groups if they curate the people who attend \nthese sales events. They have to either make sure they have a \npreexisting relationship with the investor or verify their income and \nassets at the time of purchase, which is consistent with our regulatory \nframework.\n  I have offered an amendment, which will be debated later today, that \nwould codify the SEC's relief and prevent harm to everyday investors. \nIt would also limit the exemptions to operating companies so that shell \ncompanies and investment vehicles, like hedge funds, can't solicit \npotentially risky offerings to unknowing investors.\n  These revisions to the bill would strike an appropriate balance \nbetween capital formation and investor protection while still \nsupporting angel investor groups. However, without my amendment, I \ncannot support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished Republican leader and a \nleader in the JOBS Act and in innovation.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Before I move on, I \nthank the gentleman for his work on the Committee on Financial \nServices.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is another bill that comes to the floor with a \nlarge bipartisan vote coming out so as to create jobs, and that is what \nthis floor is all about. Today we are talking about an American economy \nthat is ripe for innovation. This is what is needed to create jobs and \nopportunity.\n  To my colleagues, I ask them: How many times have you traveled back \nto your districts and sat down and seen individuals who crave to be \nentrepreneurs? It could be that single mom or maybe it is that person \nwho is stuck in a job or is a young kid with a great idea.\n  But as they roll out their ideas, they find they are not going to get \nstopped except by, maybe, a government regulation. Think of the jobs \nthey could create and the places in which we can grow.\n  Because of the technological revolution of our country's experience, \nthe startups we have come to know are now some of the largest companies \nin our economy. Our goal shouldn't be to stop the next great American \ncompany from coming into existence. We should actually enable it.\n  We should tear down the government-made barriers to their potential \nand embrace the positive disruption that will keep America as the world \nleader in innovation. That is the goal of the Innovation Initiative, \nand that is what we are doing here today.\n  We will pass today the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act, which \nenables ready investors to invest in startups. Startups are in a world \nof high risk and high reward.\n  They can't just go to a bank for a loan. They need angel investors \nwho are willing to take that risk for the next company that will change \nthe world, and Washington should not stand in the way of making that \nhappen.\n  Several years ago Congress passed and the President did sign the JOBS \nAct. Our goal was to help increase access to capital. Unfortunately, \nsome of the provisions in our bill were misinterpreted by the SEC \nagainst the spirit of entrepreneurship, thus keeping the barriers to \ncapital in place.\n  Today's bill gives new companies an opportunity to identify and to \ninteract with potential investors, thus opening the door for the next \ngreat idea to get the funding it needs to get up and running.\n  I give a special thanks to Chairman Chabot for identifying this \ninefficiency and acting to solve it.\n  I started my first business when I was 19 years old. There are three \nlessons you learn: you are the first one to work; you are the last one \nto leave; and you are the last one to be paid. The last thing you need \nis for government to stop you from achieving your dream.\n  It is very simple, when I talk to my colleagues here, in that there \nare one or two ways to go on this bill. If you sit back and you look at \nFacebook, Amazon, or Starbucks, they are amazing success stories in \nAmerica and are where millions of people work.\n\n  The idea would be, if you believe America needs to continue the \nopportunity for our entrepreneurs and for more companies such as those, \nit starts with angel investing. So you would vote ``yes.''\n  If you believe America doesn't need innovation, that America thinks \nthat the new Facebook shouldn't be there, that we should put up new \nbarriers to stop a dream, to stop the growth, you would probably vote \n``no.''\n  That is why later today, when this bill gets through, it will be a \nbig bipartisan vote: because we believe in America.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema).\n  Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Maxine Waters for \ngranting me time.\n  I thank Mr. Chabot and Mr. Hurt and others for working with me on \nthis bipartisan bill to help entrepreneurs and startup companies create \njobs and grow our economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, American startup businesses are growing both in number \nand diversity. Entrepreneurs are finding new and better ways to bring \ntogether talent, innovation, and investment capital in an increasingly \ncompetitive small-business environment.\n  The HALOS Act clarifies SEC regulations to ensure small businesses \nmay participate in educational demo days without the burden of having \nto verify that attendees are accredited investors. These events provide \ninvaluable opportunities for entrepreneurs to meet and exchange ideas \nwith students, professors, business professionals, and potential future \ninvestors.\n  The HALOS Act creates a clear path for startups to participate in \ndemo days that are sponsored by a government entity, a nonprofit \norganization, an angel investor group, a venture association, or other \nentity that is permitted by the SEC.\n  Specifically, this act clarifies the definition of ``general \nsolicitation'' to exempt communications and presentations at these \nevents where advertising does not make specific investment offerings \nand where no specific securities offering information is communicated \nat the event.\n  This permits startups to connect with business experts, potential \nfuture investors, and other entrepreneurs while maintaining existing \naccredited investor verification requirements and exceptions already \nunder Regulation D for the actual purchase or sale of securities. It \ndoes not in any way permit the sale of securities to unaccredited \ninvestors at demo days.\n  Companies such as Amazon, Costco, Facebook, Google, and Starbucks \nwere all initially funded by angel investors. As we work to make \nAmerica more competitive in the new global economy, we need to \nencourage the growth of innovative startups and job-creating small \nbusinesses.\n\n[[Page H2040]]\n\n  Again I thank my cosponsors and the chairman for working with us on \nthis commonsense, bipartisan bill. I am committed to working with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that Arizona startups \nhave the support that they need to grow their businesses and create \njobs.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Chabot), who is the chief sponsor of the HALOS Act and is the \nchairman of our Small Business Committee.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank Mr. Hensarling for his leadership on this. I \nthank the gentlewoman from Arizona, who just spoke, for her leadership \non this as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I \nhave the pleasure of hearing from America's small-business owners each \nand every day, both in my district and up here in Washington.\n  The stories of success are always encouraging to hear, but all too \noften, what I am told is how the government is making it difficult for \nsmall businesses to grow and succeed and to, therefore, create jobs.\n  Perhaps the most common concern is just how difficult it is for \nentrepreneurs who are starting out to access the needed capital to \ngrow. This bill expands access to capital by ensuring small businesses \ncan continue to connect with so-called angel investors.\n  One popular way small businesses have connected with angel investors \nis through demo days. These are events that are sponsored by \nuniversities, nonprofits, local governments, accelerators, incubators, \nand other groups that allow entrepreneurs to showcase their products \nand to informally meet investors and customers.\n  However, SEC regulations are threatening to force these events out of \nbusiness by imposing unwieldy regulations that dictate who is and who \nis not allowed to simply attend.\n  These regulations would force everybody who merely walks through the \ndoor to go through what is essentially a full financial interrogation \nin one's handing over of tax documents and bank statements, paybook \ninformation, and on and on and on.\n  Mr. Speaker, this doesn't make any sense. We should be encouraging \nparticipation in demo days, not creating obstacles. After all, not only \nare these events places at which to connect investors with our \ncommunities' small businesses and entrepreneurs, but they also provide \na great opportunity for students, for example, and our next generation \nof entrepreneurs to ask questions and learn what it takes to get a \nbusiness off the ground.\n  Mr. Speaker, again I thank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership in \ngetting this bill through the committee, as well as to thank \nRepresentative Hurt, Representative Sinema, and Representative Takai \nfor working in a cooperative and bipartisan manner to move this bill to \nthe House floor.\n  It was very bipartisan. All of the Republicans voted for it, and \nalmost half of the Democrats voted for it in committee. It is always \nwonderful when we are able to work together to support small business, \nand there is no better time than now.\n  Next week is National Small Business Week, when we will be \ncelebrating the contributions of small businesses and entrepreneurs in \nevery community all across America. Every one of us has small \nbusinesses in our districts. It serves as a reminder to us in this \nChamber of how important it is to create policies that promote an \nenvironment for small businesses to succeed, and this bill is one more \nstep in that direction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4498. Again, I really appreciate \nthe bipartisan nature of this bill and its support thus far.\n\n                                  1615\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Hurt), a sponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the HALOS \nAct. I first would like to thank the chairman of the Financial Services \nCommittee, Mr. Hensarling, for his leadership on the JOBS Act and on \nthis issue specifically.\n  I would also like to commend the efforts of Representatives Chabot \nand Sinema. It has been an honor to be able to work with them on such \nan important issue, and it is an honor to be able to work with them to \ncraft a sensible bipartisan bill aimed at removing a regulatory hurdle \nfor innovative companies and startups seeking early-stage equity \ncapital investment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I represent a rural district in Virginia, Virginia's \nFifth District, that stretches from the northern Piedmont of Virginia \nto the North Carolina border. As I travel across my district, a \nrecurring theme that I hear from my constituents is that they are \nconcerned about jobs and the economy.\n  At a time when our economy is struggling, Congress must do everything \npossible to help small businesses achieve success. These entities are \nour Nation's most dynamic job creators, and their success is essential \nto our economy.\n  Earlier this year Charlottesville, Virginia, was recognized as one of \nthe Nation's fastest growing markets for venture capital investment. \nOver the past 5 years, the amount of capital invested in \nCharlottesville has grown over 150 percent.\n  This type of investment can have a profound impact on a community, \nmaking it more attractive to other startup companies and ultimately \nproducing more job growth. Indeed, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut \nsaid it best when he introduced the Senate version of the HALOS Act:\n\n       I have heard from local entrepreneurs and interested \n     backers alike that the most important thing we can do to help \n     these businesses is make it easier for angel investors to put \n     capital behind them, and that is exactly what our bipartisan \n     HALOS Act will do.\n\n  In 2014 alone, angel investors deployed over $24 billion to over \n70,000 startups. Many of these investments go into companies in their \nown communities and States.\n  Beyond capital, angel investors often provide advice and guidance to \nhelp these companies succeed and create jobs. It is for these reasons \nthat I ask my colleagues to support this bill.\n  If enacted, the HALOS Act would amend the Securities Act to define an \nangel investor group and would clarify the definition of general \nsolicitation so that startup enterprises would be able to continue to \npromote their businesses at certain events called demo days where there \nis no direct investment offering.\n  The HALOS Act would alleviate the burden placed on startups with \nregard to privacy and compliance concerns, which often require \nentrepreneurs and startups to take on burdens that they do not have the \nmeans to handle.\n  These burdens have a significant impact on an entrepreneur's ability \nto interface with investors because of the risk of violating Federal \nsecurities laws by having their interactions with investors being \nviewed as a general solicitation.\n  HALOS would lift this burden and is an important step to continuing \nthe success that this committee has achieved with the bipartisan JOBS \nAct.\n  The JOBS Act made it easier for startup enterprises to market their \nsecurities to a larger pool of investors. Unfortunately, while \nimplementing the JOBS Act, the SEC has classified events held by angel \ninvestors as general solicitations, requiring entrepreneurs and \nstartups to verify accredited investor status.\n  This jeopardizes the future of events like demo days where startups \ncan interact with these investors and venture capitalists.\n  The HALOS Act would simply ensure that angel funding remains \navailable to startups by defining the term ``angel investor group'' and \nexempting an angel investor event from being considered general \nsolicitation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Virginia an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the HALOS Act is a simple, \nbipartisan, bicameral solution that will ensure that investors and \ncompanies can continue this commonsense interaction.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire if the other side has any \nfurther speakers before we use all our time?\n\n[[Page H2041]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, we have no further \nspeakers.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Garrett), the chairman of our Capital Markets and \nGovernment Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the sponsor of the \nunderlying legislation for the underlying bill.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4498, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups \nAct. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support \nthis very important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, it was 2 weeks ago at the Capital Markets and Government \nSponsored Enterprises Subcommittee that we held a hearing that examined \nthe positive impact the 2012 JOBS Act is having on our economy. By \nreducing burdens on startup companies and modernizing our security \nlaws, the consensus was very clear.\n  The JOBS Act was a big win for entrepreneurs, innovation, and, \nultimately, economic growth and opportunity and job creation in this \ncountry.\n  But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be doing more besides the \nJOBS Act, and it certainly doesn't mean that the Securities and \nExchange Commission, the SEC, has done a perfect job, by any means, \nwhen it comes to implementing the important provisions of the JOBS Act.\n  At times, the SEC has taken liberties, if you will, with their \nrulemaking that run contrary to the wishes and purposes of Congress, \nwhich ultimately could limit the impact this great, new revolutionary \nlegislation has for our economy.\n  One example of this was the way in which the SEC implemented title II \nof the JOBS Act, which made it easier for companies to use general \nsolicitation in order to attract investors for private offering of \nstocks.\n  You see, what happened here was, in their final rule, the SEC \nclassified events such as demo days held by angel investors as being \ngeneral solicitation. This means that angel groups would have to then \ncomply with all the rules and regulations that are designed for issuers \nwho are actually engaged in the offering of securities, which this is \nnot.\n  So events such as demo days are an important economic development \ntool, if you will, used by small startup companies to help educate \npeople, educate a pool of potential investors. They are not security \nofferings, and they should really, really not be treated as such.\n\n  Why is this important? Well, in 2014, angel investors put some $24 \nbillion to work in over 73,000 startups. So, clearly, this is a \npreferred source of capital throughout the economy.\n  Any kind of regulation that would hamper the ability of angel \ninvestors to communicate with startup companies would jeopardize the \nability of angel investors to fund the next Apple or Google or startup.\n  So here we are with H.R. 4498. It would simply make a small technical \nfix to the JOBS Act and would allow such events to continue without \nthat heavy hand of government getting in the way. So I want to thank \nthe sponsors.\n  I urge bipartisan support of this underlying bill.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Huizenga), chairman of Monetary Policy and Trade \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, as a small-business owner and \ncoming from a family of very entrepreneurial people, I know the \nimportance of fostering an environment that promotes economic \nopportunity and especially allows small businesses to grow and create \njobs.\n  West Michigan, which I represent, is a hub of entrepreneurial \nactivity. Organizations like the Grand Rapids Inventors Network and a \nvery innovative place called Start Garden are the center of that.\n  Start Garden does two demo days a year with very sophisticated \ninvestors. In fact, over the last 3 years of Start Garden's existence, \nthey have helped and launched 200 various companies and have given them \nthat investment.\n  One of those is Boxed Water is Better. Just this past week, my office \nreceived its first shipment from Holland, Michigan, of Boxed Water is \nBetter.\n  Founded in 2009, the team at Boxed Water combined west Michigan \ningenuity with capital from investors through Start Garden, who now \nemploy 60 people and have facilities in both Michigan and Utah. They \nsell their product in over 8,000 stores nationwide and are now starting \nto sell around the globe.\n  Small businesses across the globe and across the country like Boxed \nWater are looking for real solutions from Congress to help them \ninnovate and thrive.\n  The JOBS Act, a solution designed to jump-start capital formation for \nsmall businesses, entrepreneurs, and startups, was signed into law in \n2012. Instead of helping small businesses access capital through the \nJOBS Act, as Congress had intended, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission has choked off avenues of that capital formation.\n  In order to participate in a demo day, the SEC requires startups to \nregister a securities offering and verify the sophistication level of \npotential funders, something most of them do not have the physical or \nfinancial means to do, according to Start Garden.\n  I thank the gentleman from Ohio for introducing the HALOS Act, an \nimportant bill that connects fledgling companies to angel investors who \nmay provide them with the capital that they need to turn their startup \ninto a growing, thriving business.\n  By exempting demo days featuring many small businesses like Boxed \nWater and others, these participants are not considered as general \nsolicitors under the Securities Act.\n  We need more entrepreneurs to expand, hire, and invest, and the HALOS \nAct is an innovative way of doing that.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Chabot of Ohio for \nintroducing this bipartisan piece of legislation as well as my \ncolleagues on the Financial Services Committee, Congressman Hurt of \nVirginia and Congresswoman Sinema of Arizona, for sponsoring the \nlegislation.\n  H.R. 4498, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act, provides an \nimportant fix to our securities regulations that removes friction \nbetween entrepreneurs and the potential investors that are looking to \nsupport startup companies.\n  When we think about angel investing or venture capital, we naturally \nthink of the Silicon Valley tech scene or the financial powerhouse of \nNew York City.\n  However, more and more startups all across the country are using \nimportant changes under the JOBS Act in order to raise financing no \nmatter where they are located. In fact, as reported in the St. Louis \nBusiness Journal, St. Louis has the Nation's fastest growing startup \nscene.\n  As more and more investors are drawn to the St. Louis area, these \nearly-stage investments are critical for helping keep these companies \nin Missouri and creating more local Missouri jobs.\n  Yet, while St. Louis' startups have experienced tremendous growth \nrecently, small businesses and startups everywhere are still having \ndifficulty in obtaining financing and investment in today's economy at \na crucial stage when they are trying to grow and expand.\n  The HALOS Act will make a small change that makes it easier for small \nbusinesses to find those vital investments. It would exempt demo days \nfrom general solicitation requirements that would put a burden on \nentrepreneurs and that would make it more difficult for investors to \nprovide financing.\n  For those companies that are not yet ready to go public, it is \nimportant that they are given the opportunity to pitch their business \nideas to those who are interested in learning more.\n  I urge passage of this bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Hultgren).\n\n[[Page H2042]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to be able to speak in \nsupport of the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups, or HALOS, Act.\n  I would also like to thank Chairman Chabot, Congressman Hurt, and \nCongresswoman Sinema for putting forward this important bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  I am fortunate to hear regularly from innovators across Illinois and \nthrough my work on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee.\n  Chicago is recognized nationally as a hub for angel investors. The \nIllinois Venture Capital Association was one of the first associations \nto represent private equity and venture capital groups.\n  The State of Illinois also offers an angel investment credit program \nto attract and encourage investment into early-stage innovative \ncompanies throughout my State.\n  These innovators oftentimes have a simple idea that can be life \nchanging, but financing these ideas so that they can become a reality \nis harder than you might think.\n  Angel investors play a key role in the earliest stages of these \nstartups. They provide the initial round of funding to help get these \nlife-changing ideas off the ground. Startups are the job creators that \ndrive our economy, make life-changing medical breakthroughs, and \nharness technology to accomplish the impossible.\n  These startup companies frequently participate in demo days, as has \nbeen talked about, to increase the visibility of their company, explain \ntheir ideas and hope to informally attract investors. These demo days \nare sponsored by a variety of organizations interested in promoting \ninnovation and job creation.\n  For example, the University of Illinois Research Park told me that \nthis bill would address some of the unintended consequences of the JOBS \nAct and crowdfunding, which could make things like Cozad New Venture \nCompetition, Urbana-Champaign Angel Network angel presentations, the \nShare the Vision Technology Showcase, pitch practice at \nEnterpriseWorks, and other public forums for startups in Illinois \nproblematic.\n  They want to encourage showcasing our startups without fear that \nthese programs would be constituting a formal fundraising solicitation \nthat would require reporting to the SEC.\n  This bill simply clarifies SEC regulations to ensure small businesses \nmay participate in educational demo days without having to verify that \nattendees are accredited investors. This is a burdensome process meant \nonly for security solicitation, not just informal conversations.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to support this important bill.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 8\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Schweikert).\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, there is a crisis right now in our \ncountry, and the fact of the matter is, we have more business concerns \nclosing, going out of business, than being started. If you are \nconcerned about economic growth, if you are concerned about growing \npayrolls, people being able to survive financially, you should be \nfixated on the fact that we have more businesses closing than opening.\n  Being someone who was here and spent a year of his life working on \nthe JOBS Act, the individual bills, who was almost giddy that we had a \nbipartisan piece of success that so many of us were incredibly \noptimistic that was going to create some economic growth, and to be \nhere today 4 years later dealing with something, I am sorry, that is \nalmost absurd in the discussion: that the SEC has made it more \nrestrictive today than it was before the JOBS Act.\n  Think about this: your university, your community college, your group \nbrings together a number of little businesses that are trying to raise \ncapital, and now under the interpretation that is coming at us, you are \ngoing to have to have security at the door to interview people, look at \ntheir financials. I mean, this is crazy.\n  Is the caterer going to have to get certified? How about the security \nperson at the door, are they going to have to get secure?\n  Think about what this means and the absurdity that little businesses \nthat were trying to capitalize can't even tell their story without \nmaking sure that the people in the room hearing it have met some sort \nof definition that the SEC has imposed after we all thought we did a \npiece of legislation that opened up this type of communication.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello).\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nH.R. 4498, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act.\n  I cosponsored this bipartisan legislation because it will assist \nentrepreneurs in accessing angel investors, who provide critical \nfinancing for startup businesses and local entrepreneurs.\n  From construction companies to medical technology producers and \nmanufacturing and perhaps even the next iPhone app, there are \nPennsylvanians in my district who are full of forward-thinking ideas \nwho need access to capital.\n  By revising an unintended bureaucratic regulation that places an \nencumbrance on startup businesses, this legislation will further enable \nentrepreneurs access to the capital they need to create jobs and be \nsuccessful.\n  Let me just say that again, Mr. Speaker. Here we have an example of a \nWashington, D.C., bureaucratic rulemaking interpretation getting in the \nway of enabling entrepreneurs with good ideas from getting access to \ncapital and subsequently creating jobs in local communities. There is a \nsimple solution to fix that.\n  That is why I am supporting this legislation. I am proud of \nPennsylvania's longstanding history as a leader in innovation, and I \nwant to do everything I can to remove barriers and support our local \njob creators. I encourage all my colleagues to support this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Polis), a member of the Committee on Rules.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the \ntime.\n  The United States leads the global economy on innovation. There are a \nlot of pieces of the innovation agenda, some that Republicans and \nDemocrats disagree on, some that they agree on. I am pleased to be here \ntoday on a small but important piece that can help move the innovation \nagenda forward, help America retain and grow its competitive advantage.\n  Let me set the scene. This could be a ballroom at a university, it \ncould be a theater that is rented out for the night. There might be 5 \nor 10 teams of entrepreneurs who worked hard on their business plans. \nPerhaps they were part of some business plan competition to refine what \nthey call their pitch deck. The audience fills out.\n  Who is in the audience?\n  It wouldn't be a worthwhile event if there weren't potential \ninvestors there. So, of course, the bulk of the audience--it could be \nhalf, it could be three-quarters, it could be most of it--will be \naccredited investors. They are the only people who can invest in these \ncompanies.\n  Who else should be in the room? Who do we want to make sure that we \ndon't seal off the opportunity to learn and gain from that experience?\n  Well, it could be university faculty, graduate students, professors. \nThey don't happen to be worth $2 million, but they might have technical \nexpertise. They might be able to be consultants. They might be \nprofessionals, lawyers and bankers, who might be able to assist the \ncompanies develop, patent their ideas, and raise money. It might be \nstudents and future entrepreneurs who want to learn about the pitch \nprocess so they, too, can refine their ideas and be on the stage the \nnext time around.\n  That is what this bill allows, for us to make sure that the great \nopportunity that this country offers reaches\n\n[[Page H2043]]\n\npeople from all economic backgrounds. We can't lock everybody except \nfor the millionaires and billionaires out of the room that helps form \nthe seed capital for tomorrow's great company.\n  HALOS does not change the existing law about who can and can't buy \nprivate securities. What it does do is allow folks who are not \naccredited investors, who are not there as a potential investor to be \nin the room, to learn from the experience, to perhaps get a job if they \nare an aspiring programmer, to have to team up with one of the \ncompanies that presented as a cofounder to complement some of the \ncompetencies that the other founder has, to make sure that they, too, \nare in that great room of opportunity.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. POLIS. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe our startup communities will be strengthened. \nStartup ecosystems like the ones that I am proud to say exist in towns \nlike Fort Collins and Boulder in my district can be made more diverse \nthrough this law and will inevitably make sure that those in the room \ncan expand opportunity beyond people who are already millionaires and \nbillionaires.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, we have heard a lot of conversation from the \nopposite side of the aisle about what the SEC has done or has not done. \nAs a matter of fact, it was represented that the SEC had misinterpreted \nthe bill. That is not true.\n  We absolutely need rules of the road. We need to make sure that we \nare protecting investors. We need to make sure that we are not allowing \nfolks to be put at great risk who don't understand or know what is \nhappening in these rooms. I am concerned about these demo days on \ncampuses where students may be encouraged in these presentations to \ninvest their parents' money or get their parents involved in schemes \nthat they may not be aware of.\n  Why is this so important to us?\n  It is important to us because we have arrived at a time in the \nCongress of the United States where we recognize the need for consumer \nprotection. Prior to the recession that we had that was created in 2008 \nbecause of the subprime meltdown and the faulty products that were \nplaced out in the marketplace by banks and financial institutions, \nconsumers were really ignored and not protected.\n  We have payday loans that target our communities that charge 400 to \n500 percent interest and take advantage of some of the most vulnerable \npeople in our society. We have all of these fraudulent mortgages that \nalmost brought this country down, that created a recession--almost a \ndepression--and we are still finding out about some of the exotic \nproducts that they put out on the market that tricked people into \nsigning on the dotted line who eventually lost their homes.\n  We have the fiduciary duty that we have been debating in Congress.\n  Do you know why we are debating that?\n  We are debating that because we have investment advisers who were in \nconflict with the people they were supposed to be protecting and \nsupposed to be advising, and they literally were advising seniors, who \nhad savings for their retirement, to invest in plans that they would \nultimately lose all of their money in.\n  So in addition to payday loans and fraudulent mortgages and conflict \nof interest and fiduciary, we have had mandatory arbitration and on and \non and on. We have arrived at a time when Democrats are implementing \nDodd-Frank. We are making sure that we have the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau that is doing the work that had not been done all of \nthese years.\n  Yes, we are concerned about this. We supported the JOBS Act. We \nsupported it with an amendment that I put in there that said that you \nmust take reasonable opportunities to ensure that you know who these \ninvestors are. We are talking about accredited investors, folks who \nhave resources, folks who know how this game is operated, folks who can \nprotect themselves. They have lawyers, they have consultants, all of \nthat.\n  What we don't want is--we don't want these students and we don't want \npeople who walk in off the street who may be presented with an \nopportunity that is not a real opportunity.\n  For example, what if we had something like Corinthian that is a \nprivate, postsecondary school that we had to close down, or DeVry \nUniversity, or the University of Phoenix, or the Trump University?\n  Any of these could present themselves as credible businesses to be \ninvested in, only to find out later that the students have been misled, \nthey have not gotten jobs, they don't have anything. They have not made \nany money. We are saying this is another effort to simply protect those \nwho oftentimes are the targets of the rip-offs and the fraud.\n  I would ask my colleagues to support the amendment that I am going to \nput to the bill to make sure that they know who is in the room. I would \nask them to support this simple amendment that was made in order in the \nCommittee on Rules to make sure that we are protecting those investors \nand keeping them from getting ripped off.\n  Now, some of my friends on the opposite side of the aisle would have \nyou believe that we are not interested in capital formation, that we \nare not interested in entrepreneurship, that we are not interested in \njoint ventures. That is absolutely not true. As a matter of fact, folks \non this side of the aisle are fighting to make the financial \ninstitutions responsible and the banks to make loans where they should \nbe making loans. We have to have a CRA to make sure that they are doing \nwhat they should be doing with the depositors' money and on and on and \non. We fight for small businesses every day.\n  We joined up with our colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle to \nsupport the JOBS Act even though we had some concerns, and the SEC \ntried to make sure that we had the kind of legislation that would \nprotect these investors.\n  Now they are saying: We don't like what the SEC is doing. They are \nmisinterpreting it. They are messing this all up.\n  Well, that is not true. Now, we know they don't like the SEC. As a \nmatter of fact, they do everything that they can to limit their funding \nso that they cannot be effective. But these are our cops on the block. \nThe SEC is our cop on the block to try and make sure that we limit the \nrip-off and the fraud and the undermining of average citizens in our \nsociety. We support the JOBS Act. We believe that we should not have \nthese operations on the campuses without knowing who is in the room and \nallowing investors to be put at risk.\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, I would ask for a ``no'' vote on the bill. I \nam going to ask for an ``aye'' vote on the amendment that is going to \ncome up. If my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle accept this \nvery, very reasonable amendment, then I will vote to support the bill. \nBut if they don't show any concern or compassion for the interests of \ninvestors, then I cannot support the bill, and I will ask my caucus not \nto support the bill. It is as simple as that.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  When are we going to stop the fraudulent operations in this country \nthat rip off working people every day, rip off students, and don't care \nabout our investors who are interested in capital formation and \ninvesting in real enterprises that can help to grow their business and \nmake some money themselves? When are we going to recognize we can do \nboth?\n  We don't have to just be on the side of those who would take \nadvantage of people. We must be on the side of both--our investors who \nare willing to put up money and our businesses who need capital \nformation--but somehow we always end up letting the most vulnerable \npeople in our society be the target of fraud by those who take \nadvantage of them.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n\n[[Page H2044]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, I am very, very happy that yet another bipartisan \nbill has come out of the Financial Services Committee to try to get \nthis economy working for working people. I took note that there were \nmore Democrats coming to the floor in favor of the bill than against \nthe bill, and that almost 80 percent of the members of the Financial \nServices Committee reported this bill favorably.\n  Now, the ranking member spoke passionately about trying to help the \nmost vulnerable. She cares about investor protection. But, Mr. Speaker, \nthe only people who can buy these securities in a private offering are \nmillionaires. So the question is: Who do you care more about, the \nmillionaire investors or the working poor who need better jobs?\n  You can't have capitalism without capital, and yet the ranking member \nwould put one more burden in front of small businesses and \nentrepreneurs trying to create businesses so that people can have \nbetter jobs and a better future for themselves and their families.\n  I am glad we have millionaire investors. I wish we had more of them. \nBut they are already protected. You must be an accredited investor in \norder to partake, to actually buy the security. All we are debating now \nis whether you are going to have to prescreen, as the gentleman from \nArizona said, the caterer or the security guard at the door, to be part \nof the demo day--something, Mr. Speaker, that was perfectly legal and \nhad gone on for years and years and years prior to this SEC rule.\n  Yet we have an agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, \ncreating law out of thin air, making it more difficult for the working \npoor to find better jobs, to make sure that people have a better career \npath, to make sure that we can find the next Facebook. They are making \nit more difficult.\n  I believe this will have strong bipartisan support on the floor. We \nall need to support the HALOS Act, H.R. 4498. At the end of the day, \nwho are you going to come down in favor of, the working poor or \nmillionaire investors who are already protected? This side of the aisle \nwill come down in favor of the working poor who need jobs in an economy \nthat has been hurt by Obamanomics.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.\n\n\n       Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Maxine Waters of California\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at \nthe desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 5, line 5, strike ``and''.\n       Page 5, after line 5, insert the following:\n       (D) does not receive any compensation for making \n     introductions between investors attending the event and \n     issuers, or for investment negotiations between such parties; \n     and\n       Page 5, line 6, strike ``(D)'' and insert ``(E)''.\n       Page 5, line 11, strike ``and''.\n       Page 5, line 23, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       Page 5, after line 23, insert the following:\n       (5) where attendance to the event is limited to members of \n     an angel investor group or to accredited investors.\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following:\n       (c) Definition of Issuer.--For purposes of this section and \n     the revision of rules required under this section, the term \n     ``issuer'' means an issuer that is in day-to-day operations \n     as a business, is not in bankruptcy or receivership, is not \n     an investment company, and is not a blank check, blind pool, \n     or shell company.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 701, the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters), and a Member opposed \neach will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned during \nthe general debate on H.R. 4498, I am offering this amendment today in \norder to clarify and improve the bill. If this amendment is accepted, I \nam prepared to support this legislation.\n  Indeed, I support the goal of connecting angel investor groups with \ncompanies seeking funding, particularly startups and emerging firms. \nAngel investor groups tend to be comprised of highly sophisticated \nindividuals with significant experience investing in higher risk \nofferings. They tend to curate their groups carefully and are good \ngatekeepers for these demo day events.\n  As such, my amendment seeks to support the efforts of these angel \ninvestor associations without creating a harmful loophole in some of \nthe protections we put in place when we adopted the JOBS Act of 2012. \nThis amendment includes several provisions to advance these goals.\n  First, my amendment stipulates that no sponsor of a demo day can \ncollect finders' fees for connecting investors to companies. This \nprovision ensures that event sponsors--colleges, nonprofits, trade \nassociations, or otherwise--don't have perverse incentives to drum up \nsecurities sales.\n  Second, my amendment limits the relief offered under the bill to \nactual operating companies in the ``real economy.'' As such, it \nexcludes certain entities like shell companies and investment vehicles \nlike hedge funds. I think that my amendment is appropriately calibrated \nto ensure that the benefits provided under the bill go to startups like \ntechnology firms or manufacturing companies rather than opaque or \nspeculative firms.\n  Third, my amendment would codify the relief the SEC has already \nprovided for angel investor groups as it relates to these demo days. \nThis will provide legal certainty to these groups without opening up \nany new loopholes. Let me describe how this would work.\n  If the company wants to hold a demo day and also condition the market \nfor a securities sale, as H.R. 4498 would allow, they would have to \ncurate the group of people that attend the event. To be clear, under \nthe bill as currently drafted, companies aren't limited to holding \nscience fair-style demonstrations. They can discuss actual securities \nbeing offered, the types and amounts of those securities, who has \nalready subscribed to their offerings, and how they intend to use the \nproceeds of the offering.\n  Under the SEC's relief and codified in this provision in my \namendment, companies can hold these presentations, can talk about their \nsecurities, and can solicit attendance. They can even avoid the \naccredited investor verification requirement in the JOBS Act. They just \nhave to call their existing networks of accredited investors and angel \ninvestor group members rather than blasting out an invitation to an \nentire college campus. If companies do want to blast out the invitation \nto entire campuses, they still can; they just have to abide by the \nverification provisions in the JOBS Act.\n  In summary, this amendment I am offering today ensures that no \nloopholes to the JOBS Act verification requirement are opened up, that \nall manner of conflicted fees are prohibited, and that the benefits of \nthe bill go to actual operating companies. And that is very important, \nactual operating companies.\n  Mr. Speaker, whether it is through my work to clarify and improve the \nJOBS Act during the 112th Congress or my work with members on the \ncommittee this Congress to amend the definition of ``accredited \ninvestors'' or through my amendment today, I have long shown a \nwillingness to work in good faith on issues related to capital \nformation. I would urge my colleagues to adopt my amendment so that we \ncan all support a strong, bipartisan bill.\n  Mr. Hensarling brags about how many Democrats supported this bill. He \nbrags about the fact that, in committee and then on the floor, we all \ntried to be very cooperative in the JOBS Act. And I bent over backwards \nto ensure that we could get a JOBS Act to see what could happen with \ncreating jobs, but what they have done now is to go a step further \nbeyond what we agreed upon.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask for an ``aye'' vote on my amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, the amendment from the ranking member of \nthe Financial Services Committee effectively repeals the HALOS Act.\n  We are having the same debate that we just had. It would effectively \noutlaw\n\n[[Page H2045]]\n\ndemo days as they are currently practiced. The whole idea of the HALOS \nAct is to ensure that demo days, which existed prior to this SEC rule, \nwill continue and that startups can continue to have access to capital \nwithout the additional burden of having to screen those who actually \ncome in to demo days.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, a private offering. The security can only be \npurchased by an accredited investor. Those are the existing rules. So \nthere is almost a mythical group that the ranking member is attempting \nto protect. At the end of the day, these are millionaire investors who \nare the angel investors, who are the accredited investors whom we need \nto help fund these startups.\n  What the gentlewoman from California's amendment does, again, is guts \nthe bill. It basically just simply codifies this SEC rule, and that \nabsolutely overturns the congressional intent to make sure that we have \ngreater access to capital.\n  In addition, there is an entire new defined term of ``issuer'' in her \namendment, notwithstanding the fact that this is already defined in \nsection 3(aa) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. So we have \nundefined, vague terms that are being introduced here.\n  I would also remind the gentlewoman from California and all that the \nHALOS Act already prohibits a sponsor from engaging in investment \nnegotiations between the issuer and investors, charging event attendees \nany fees other than administrative fees, and receiving any compensation \nthat would require the sponsor to register with the SEC as a broker-\ndealer or investment adviser.\n  So these are ill-placed concerns that at the end of the day put up \nyet another hurdle for angel investors funding the next new Facebook, \nthe next new Costco, the next new Starbucks, and putting tens of \nthousands of Americans back to work.\n  It is time that we affirm the JOBS bill, not gut the JOBS bill, and I \nwould urge all Members to reject the amendment of the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question \nis ordered on the bill, and on the amendment by the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Maxine Waters).\n  The question is on the amendment by the gentlewoman from California \n(Ms. Maxine Waters).\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the \nyeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on adoption of the amendment will be followed \nby 5-minute votes on:\n  A motion to recommit, if ordered;\n  Passage of the bill, if ordered; and\n  The motion to suspend the rules and pass S. 1890.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 139, \nnays 272, not voting 22, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 170]\n\n                               YEAS--139\n\n     Adams\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brown (FL)\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Castro (TX)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeFazio\n     DeGette\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Edwards\n     Engel\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Hinojosa\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

Half of the victims do not report their \nattacks.

These \nvolunteers must know that America will protect them overseas. If a \ncrime occurs against them, America will stand by them, not abandon \nthem.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today \nto recognize April 30 as El Dia de Los Ninos: Celebrating Young \nAmericans.\n  This holiday serves to honor and celebrate the importance of children \nin our Nation. El Dia de Los Ninos, which when translated means Day of \nthe Children, helps bring Hispanic families and other communities \ntogether nationwide to recognize the importance of literacy and \neducation for all children.\n  Recognizing this day highlights the growing presence of Hispanic \nyouth in the United States and the lasting impact of Hispanic Americans \non the social, political, economic, and cultural fabric of this Nation.\n  This important holiday is celebrated by numerous countries and more \nthan 130 cities across the United States. In order to support the many \ncities, counties, States, and communities that already celebrate El Dia \nde Los Ninos, I will introduce a resolution with Senator Bob Menendez \nto recognize April 30 as El Dia de Los Ninos: Celebrating Young \nAmericans.\n  Senator Bob Menendez, Senator Jack Reed, and Representative Ruben \nHinojosa began the movement to recognize El Dia de Los Ninos 17 years \nago. I am committed to continuing their work.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important holiday and to join me \nin cosponsoring my resolution to recognize April 30 as El Dia de Los \nNinos: Celebrating Young Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2047-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2047-H2054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNAUTHORIZED SPENDING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Trott).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on tonight's \nSpecial Order.\n\n[[Page H2048]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I want to very quickly thank all of the \nMembers who have volunteered their time to speak tonight. I know they \nare running on a tight schedule, as we all are.\n  With that in mind, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. \nMcMorris Rodgers), a tireless advocate for conservative values, whose \nbold leadership, tenacity, and kindness make her one of this body's \ngreatest Members. I would like to thank her for introducing H.R. 4730, \nthe Unauthorized Spending Accountability Act, that is a vitally \nimportant piece of legislation that will go a long way in helping to \neliminate Federal programs that have not been authorized by Congress, \nyet somehow still come in to receive appropriations. I am a proud \ncosponsor of this legislation, and encourage all Members of the House \nto support it.\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nbringing us together this evening. This is a very important discussion. \nIt really goes to what is foundational about America in Article I and \nthe authority that rests in Congress, as outlined in Article I.\n  I am looking forward to this Special Order and hope that we will \ncontinue this discussion in the weeks ahead. But a big thank you to the \ngentleman from Florida for his leadership and bringing us all together.\n  In the fall of 2014--so this was right after the Ice Bucket \nChallenge--Gail Gleason, who is a mom in my district in eastern \nWashington, had a meeting with me. She was almost in tears because CMS, \nthe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, was proposing new rules \nand regulations that would take away the important communication device \nfor those who have lost their ability to speak, largely impacting a lot \nof ALS patients. Her son, Dave Gleason, is a football player, a \nfootball star. She came to me in desperation because CMS rules were \ngoing to take away his communication device.\n  Do you know what? This is just one of many examples where \nbureaucrats, arrogant and unaccountable so often and disconnected from \ntheir mission, are making rules and regulations outside of the \nCongress, outside of the vote and of the approval of the elected \nrepresentatives of the people.\n  I think about the VA, the Veterans Administration. This is an agency \nthat is dedicated to our veterans. So often our veterans feel like they \nget lost. Instead of having the red-carpet treatment, they feel like \nthey are given the runaround. They have to wait weeks and weeks, even, \njust to schedule a simple doctor's appointment.\n  Recently, the FDA came out with new rules, 400-page menu labeling \nrules, that for a pizza restaurant would require them to somehow \ndisclose on a menu board the 34 million combinations of pizza. Land \nmanagement, environmental regulations, threatening to regulate every \nmud puddle in America from Washington, D.C., and the list goes on and \non.\n  Our Founding Fathers envisioned three branches of government--very \nimportant. There was the judicial branch, the legislative branch, and \nthe executive branch. Each one has very important roles. No one person \nwas to be making all of the decisions.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Part of the reason that people in this country are so frustrated \ntoday is due to 1600 Pennsylvania. The President has been \ndelegitimizing us as an institution and in our role as Representatives \non behalf of the people. Too often, Members of Congress feel like we \nare bystanders in the process as more and more rules and regulations \nare generated outside of our input and certainly outside of our \napproval.\n  It is interesting to note that the Capitol--the Congress--is really \nthe center of Washington, D.C. Our Founding Fathers, I think, \nenvisioned that this would be the center and that all other roads would \nlead from the Capitol. The White House is actually on a side street \ndown on Pennsylvania.\n  How did we go so far from being what our Founders envisioned--a body \nthat is closest to the people, most accountable to the people? How do \nwe restore people's trust in this institution, which is the branch of \ngovernment that is directly elected by them?\n  At the start is Article I of the Constitution--getting our government \noff of autopilot and restoring the decision-making that belongs in the \nHouse and in the Senate with the elected Representatives of the people.\n  There are many ideas out there as to how to restore the balance of \npowers, but I want to focus on one in particular--a way that we can be \npositive disruptors, can challenge the status quo, take back the power \nof the purse, and get the Federal Government off of autopilot. That is \nby tackling what we refer to as ``unauthorized spending.''\n  There are hundreds of programs and departments that have stayed on \nthe books despite the fact that their deadlines have come and gone. I \nlike to refer to them as ``zombie'' government programs, potentially \nliving beyond their intended lifespans because they have not been \nauthorized in years and sometimes in decades. For example, the VA \nhasn't been authorized since 1996; the BLM hasn't been authorized since \n1998, as well as other agencies, such as the Federal Election \nCommission. There is a long list. It is estimated that over $300 \nbillion in spending is in these unauthorized programs.\n  If we, the elected Representatives, committed to doing our jobs--\nreviewing, rethinking, possibly eliminating these programs if they have \nexceeded their lives--the people would be well served.\n  I recently introduced the USA Act, the Unauthorized Spending \nAccountability Act, to require these expired ``zombie'' programs to be \nrenewed, to hold the bureaucrats accountable who have become \ndisconnected from their missions. Programs and agencies should not \nreceive taxpayer funding unless the people's Representatives--their \nvoices in government--have authorized them to do so.\n  The demands on families, on businesses, and on institutions have \nchanged. In some ways, the only place that hasn't changed is Congress. \nWe need to rethink government from the top-down and restore the power \nof the purse. Article I is just as relevant today as it was at the \nfounding of our country. Our Founders recognized that every individual \nis made in the image of God. We celebrate the potential of every \nindividual, and our laws must reflect the will of the people. This is \nthe genius of America.\n  Mr. YOHO. I thank the gentlewoman from Washington for her great words \nin preserving our Constitution and for the work that she is doing to \nbring Article I powers back to the House.\n  We get blamed a lot for the dysfunction in this country about what \nthis body is not doing, and the gentlewoman is so right in bringing \nthis power here; so I thank her for her leadership on that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to a stalwart from the great State of Utah, Mrs. \nMia Love, who is leading a charge and is making quite a name for \nherself.\n  Mrs. LOVE. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am so excited to talk about Article I. Right now I am \nworking on a project called the Article I Project in order to restore \nArticle I back to the United States Congress.\n  Today I rise on behalf of all of the Utahans in my home State who \nhave expressed frustration with our regulatory state. For decades, \nCongress has essentially delegated many responsibilities to executive \nagencies. As a result, unelected and unaccountable agencies have \nimpacted American lives more than the decisions have of their elected \nofficials. In this Congress, for example, 146 bills have been signed \ninto law after going through the House and the Senate. Meanwhile 3,378 \nrules and regulations were finalized last year alone, joining thousands \nof others that ultimately cost the American economy $4 trillion a year.\n  Our Constitution is designed to preserve individual liberty, but this \ngovernment instead seeks to increase bureaucratic influence. The \nAmerican people deserve better. They deserve Representatives of their \nchoosing who are empowered to make decisions. They also deserve to know \nthat if those Representatives fail, they can hold them accountable and \nbring about change. At the end of the day, that is what restoring \nconstitutional powers is about--giving the American people a voice. It \nis for that cause, especially, I am proud to fight.\n  Mr. YOHO. I thank the gentlewoman from Utah, and I appreciate the \nwork she is doing.\n\n[[Page H2049]]\n\n  Keep it up. We only have a Nation to save.\n  Mr. Speaker, the United States Constitution is the supreme law of the \nUnited States of America. Ours is the shortest Constitution in \nexistence and is the longest-serving--227 years since its ratification \nin 1789. Our Founders can have many things said of them, but one thing \nwe can all agree on is, through divine guidance, they got this as near \nto perfection as a document can be.\n  Our Constitution has created the freest, the largest middle class, \nthe most successful country on the planet. For the first time in \nrecorded history, it has allowed people to become self-determining, it \nhas allowed for personal freedoms never before seen in human history. \nIt grants us unalienable rights, those being life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness. It allows for personal property rights.\n  These are the things that allow a Republic, as ours, to flourish and \nfor ideas to be created and expanded upon because they allow for the \npossibility of that unlimited potential inside each and every human on \nthe planet. It is our Constitution that allows for the way of life we \nhave for which others will risk everything, including life, so as to \nhave a chance at freedom.\n  So it is a document worth protecting, preserving. It is a document \nthat should be revered by all so we can pass it on to our future \ngenerations, as well as the prosperity and the good fortune that was \ninherited by us, this generation. The price that has been paid came \nfrom the blood, sweat, and tears of our Founders, from the people who \ncame before us, and from every military person, including their spouses \nand families; and each and every Member of Congress takes an oath and a \npledge to uphold our Constitution.\n  Article I, section 1 reads: ``All legislative Powers herein granted \nshall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist \nof a Senate and House of Representatives.''\n  Article I, section 8 lists clearly that Congress has the power to lay \nand collect taxes, to provide for the common defense, to regulate \ncommerce, to declare war, to establish a uniform rule of \nnaturalization. It ends in section 8: ``To make all Laws which shall be \nnecessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, \nand all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of \nthe United States or in any Department or Officer thereof.''\n\n  The President's responsibility, as delineated in Article II, section \n3, reads that the President is to see that the Laws are faithfully \nexecuted. I want to repeat that. The President is to see that the Laws \nare faithfully executed. This is called the Take Care Clause.\n  I have only spent 3 years here, but in that time we have watched this \nbody work multiple times to rein in not just the executive branch, but \nthe administrative agencies. We have sued the President and have won \ntwo times in the Supreme Court. We have had fights over the power of \nthe purse. We have had Supreme Court fights whether it has been dealing \nwith immigration laws and rules or not enforcing the laws on the books. \nWe have fought the President just on enforcing the laws that are \nalready on the books. We don't need any more laws. We just need to \nfollow the ones we have.\n  This is not just this administration--this is previous \nadministrations--but I fear where we are going in this next election. \nIf we don't get our House in order, if we don't bring back Article I \npowers to this House, at that point, when we overstep the boundaries of \nour Constitution by an executive branch or by administrative agencies, \nit is too late to try to reel them in. Now it is urgent to do that. To \nput it off any longer would be buying fire insurance for your house \nafter your house catches on fire. It is too late.\n  In addition, as I talked about, we have fought overstepping, out-of-\ncontrol Federal agencies that are wreaking havoc on American businesses \nand are costing every American, according to the CBO estimates, \napproximately $14,500.\n  If I look at the administration's rules and regulations that have \ncome out since 1999 to 2008, there have been approximately 750 rules \nthat have come out. From 2009 to 2015, there have been over 530 rules \ncoming out just from the Obama administration. If I look at the final \nrules and regulations that were issued just under George Bush, the \namount for his 8 years was 2,430. When I look at President Obama's \nrules and regulations--and we are only 4 months into his last year and \nterm--to date, the Obama administration has had over 28,000 rules and \nregulations coming out, which are strangling and suffocating American \nbusinesses, paid for by the American taxpayers.\n  I recently introduced H. Res. 693, which asks for a permanent select \ncommittee to investigate not just this executive branch, but all future \nones so that we can have in place a vehicle to rein in an overstepping \nadministration.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to a colleague and a classmate of mine from the \nState of Texas, Mr. Randy Weber, who has cosponsored H. Res. 693. I \nappreciate the gentleman's work on this important topic.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. I thank my friend from Florida (Mr. Yoho) for \nyielding the floor and for leading this Special Order and introducing \nH. Res. 693.\n  Mr. Speaker, as of yesterday, the Obama Presidency was 90 percent \nover. So let's do a quick recap of just what has happened over these \npast 7\\1/2\\ years.\n  First, the President violated the Constitution by unilaterally \nchanging sections of the Affordable Care Act at least 23 times without \nhaving congressional approval. That is Public Law 111-148. Even though \nhe said, probably, on some 20 occasions that he didn't have \nconstitutional authority to do things, he still did them.\n  Two, the President and the Department of Justice were in direct \nviolation of their constitutional responsibility to the Defense of \nMarriage Act, which is Public Law 104-199.\n  The President and his department of injustice continue to choose not \nto enforce Federal drug laws, which are Public Law 91-513, the \nControlled Substances Act, and Public Law 100-690, the Anti-Drug Abuse \nAct of 1986.\n  The President violated the Constitution by making Presidential \nappointments to the National Labor Relations Board and to the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau while Congress was not in session, so \ndeclared by him.\n  I have read the Constitution, Mr. Speaker. Only the Senate majority \nleader can decide when the Senate is in session, not the President. I \nmight add that the President was slapped down by the Supreme Court 9-\nzip.\n  Further, the President and the department of injustice abused \nexecutive privilege in the Operation Fast and Furious scandal by \nrefusing to comply with a subpoena that was issued by the Committee on \nOversight and Government Reform of the United States House of \nRepresentatives, thereby violating section 192 of title II, United \nStates Code.\n  The President violated the law, which is Public Law 89-236, by \nunilaterally changing our Nation's immigration laws with regard to \ndeferred action, giving illegal aliens access to government programs \nand tax credits that are funded by our constituents, which is in \ncontravention of our Constitution.\n  The President and the Department of Health and Human Services failed \nto enforce Federal law, which is Public Law 111-5, by illegally waiving \nthe work requirement for welfare recipients.\n  Under this President, the IRS violated the First Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution by targeting nonprofit organizations because \nof their religious or political beliefs.\n  The President and the Department of Defense knowingly violated the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, the NDAA of 2014, which is Public \nLaw 113-66, by not providing a 30-day notice to Congress prior to \ntransporting five Guantanamo detainees to Qatar in a prisoner swap.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Some would say in military terms that the terrorists got five nuclear \nweapons and we got one conventional weapon, which turned out to be a \ndud.\n  The President and his administration continue to move forward with \nhis plan to close the Guantanamo detention facility and move the \ndetainees.\n  By the way, did you know that one out of three prisoners released \nrejoin their terrorist organizations and wind up at the front lines, \nseeking to kill yet more Americans?\n  Folks, it is the duty of the legislative branch to write and pass \nlaws, the judicial branch to interpret those laws, and\n\n[[Page H2050]]\n\nthe executive branch's duty to enforce those same laws.\n  The very success of our form of government comes from this simple \nbalance of powers. This critically important founding principle is \ncurrently being trampled on by this President while most of our \ncitizens may not even be aware of its damaging implications.\n  Our Nation's laws are not mere suggestions to be dismissed on a whim. \nOur laws are binding. If we in Congress allow this or any President to \nignore the rule of law, then we allow the foundation of our Nation to \nbe shattered.\n  I thank my colleague, Mr. Yoho, for introducing this resolution of \nwhich I am a proud cosponsor.\n  Mr. Speaker, there you have it. You know I am right.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber). \nI appreciate him standing up for the rule of law because, if we are not \na Nation of law, everything falls apart, civil society falls apart.\n  Just last week in my district there was a fight over transgender \nbathrooms. It is a fight people want to have.\n  We came up here at the beginning of last week and spoke in front of \nthe Supreme Court. They heard the argument on the President's Executive \norder on November 20, 2014, to waive our immigration laws and grant 4 \nto 5 million people here illegally resident status.\n  That case was heard last week, and there was a large group of \nproponents wanting the Supreme Court to side with the President. Our \nPresident has said over 22 times that he cannot change that law. He has \nadmitted to that.\n  I thought it was ironic that the people in my district were arguing \nover transgender bathrooms and the group up here--and I know a lot of \nthem were here illegally--were arguing in the United States of America \nin front of the Supreme Court, the freest country in the world. The \nonly reason that they can come up and have a voice of dissension is \nbecause we have a Constitution.\n  Our Constitution, when it was formed, wasn't a Republican idea and \nwasn't a Democratic idea. It was something that came together after \n1,000 years from the Magna Carta on up that formed a Constitution that \nformed the Republic that we have.\n  When I look at the people arguing--and, you know, it is the \nRepublicans against the Democrats or the Conservatives against the \nLiberals or whatever group you want to put in there--the only reason we \nhave those arguments is because we have a document that is an American \ndocument. It is American ideology that all parties should come together \nto preserve. That is why this argument is so important.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman, a freshman from the State of \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I commend Representative Yoho for \nholding this Special Order on executive overreach.\n  As a lifelong healthcare professional and former businessowner, I \nbelieve the healthcare industry is flooded with examples of President \nObama's administration overreaching its authority and either ignoring \ncongressional intent or refusing to enforce laws enacted by Congress.\n  As recent as last Monday, April 18, the FDA issued new guidance \nrelated to the Drug Quality and Security Act and compounding \npharmacists.\n  On November 27, 2013, President Obama signed the Drug Quality and \nSecurity Act, DQSA, into law. Within the DQSA, several important \nprovisions were related to the oversight of compounding human \nmedications.\n  In fact, DQSA created two types of compounding pharmacies, 503A \npharmacies and 503B pharmacies. 503A compounding pharmacies are small, \ncommunity pharmacies that only compound small quantities of medication \nto a very limited number of doctors and patients with very specific \nneeds.\n  A perfect example of this is a servicemember who has lost a limb in \nwar. Some servicemen and -women who have lost their limbs experience \nsignificant amounts of pain that regular medication does not adequately \naddress. Compounded medication helps with this specialized need.\n  503B compounding facilities are those outsourcing facilities that \nmanufacture compounded medications and ship them all over the country.\n  When Congress debated DQSA, many statements were made by both House \nand Senate congressional Members stating that there was no intent for \nthis bill to restrict State pharmacy licensing boards and their local \ncontrol of small, community pharmacies.\n  In fact, the FDA was directed by Congress that, in regards to \ninspection standards, 503B facilities would be the only ones subjected \nto good manufacturing inspection standards. You would think that that \nwould make sense, that only manufacturing facilities would be subjected \nto good manufacturing practice standards.\n  In addition, congressional intent was clear that 503A community \npharmacies could continue to provide office-use compounded medication \nas they had always done. Did FDA adhere to the obvious congressional \nintent of DQSA related to compounding? No.\n  FDA's recent guidance states that all medication that is compounded \nby small, community pharmacists needs to have a specific patient \nprescription.\n  Your local dermatologist, who keeps a local anesthetic in the office \nto remove skin to test for cancer, is going to have to write a \nprescription, have the patient go to the pharmacist, get their \nprescription filled, and then schedule another appointment before \nchecking to see if they have skin cancer.\n  This goes against all congressional intent, to allow State pharmacy \nboards to continue local control of their small pharmacies. Now, all \nState pharmacy boards that allow office use have had their powers taken \naway from them.\n  The FDA guidance also pointed out that, except under certain \ncircumstances, good manufacturing inspection standards will always be \nused to inspect all compounding pharmacies.\n  So pharmacists who provide specialized compounded medication to one \npatient with a specific need will be subjected to large corporation \ninspection standards that will cost significant financial investments.\n  In essence, the FDA has ignored congressional intent related to the \nDQSA and has ultimately eliminated an entire sector of the healthcare \nindustry that was providing specialized care to patients with special \nneeds.\n  In fact, the HHS informed my office that, if we continue to pursue \nthis matter and try to rein in the FDA's overreach, we, Congress, would \nbe responsible for the next 100 deaths from compounded medication. \nThis example is just one of many that I have experienced with this \nadministration.\n\n  Recently, HHS instituted a rule that would require pharmacy benefit \nmanagers to update their maximum allowable cost list every 7 days. \nThese MAC lists control what pharmacists are reimbursed. If they are \nnot updated regularly, pharmacists lose business because they are not \nreimbursed by Medicare at the present market price.\n  A recent call with the inspector general of HHS informed my office \nthat pharmacy benefit managers are not complying with this new rule \nbecause HHS has not designated anyone to ensure that pricing lists are \nupdated every 7 days.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me rephrase that. HHS is not enforcing their rules \non MAC price updating because no one is assigned to enforce this law. \nYou would think that, if a rule was created, the agency would work to \nenforce that rule, but apparently not.\n  Over the last 7\\1/2\\ years, President Obama's administration has \nshown a complete disregard for Article I of our Constitution and the \npowers that our Founding Fathers wanted this institution to have.\n  They interpret enacted legislation against the intent of Congress, \nthey refuse to enforce laws that were meant to bring transparency to \nthe American people, and they choose when congressional direction is \napplicable law and when it is not.\n  This body should take a long, hard look at the actions of these \nagencies. They are not following the law and intent that was created by \nthis body, and action should be taken to remove these bureaucrats so \nthe American people can have the government they deserve.\n  Again I want to thank the gentleman, Representative Yoho, for \nbringing this to light. This is a very serious subject that needs to be \naddressed.\n\n[[Page H2051]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his \ncomments, for his work, and for bringing this to light because, again, \nthese issues that we are discussing are not Republican or Democrat.\n  This is about the rule of law and maintaining the uniqueness of this \ninstitution, and that is something all Americans benefit from. If we \nlose it, all Americans are going to be hurt by that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek), a \nfriend and colleague.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Yoho for organizing this \nSpecial Order hour.\n  You know, this is one of the reasons I ran for Congress. The abuse of \npower and executive overreach coming from the White House right now is \ncompletely unacceptable.\n  Like many of my colleagues here tonight, I am a firm believer in the \nConstitution. I believe it is the duty of the President to faithfully \nexecute the law, not to willfully ignore it for political gain.\n  A President cannot implement legislation through Executive orders or \nagency rulemaking. Yet, we have witnessed this administration launch \nattacks against the Second Amendment, impose burdensome regulations \nthrough the EPA and other agencies, and enact many policies without the \nsupport of Congress or the American people.\n  I have spoken to a wide array of my constituents throughout the \nnorthern half of Michigan in the time I have been here in Congress. \nThey are constantly telling me about some new regulation that some \nFederal agency is coming up with that doesn't seem to do anything as \nfar as promoting welfare or improving the environment, but it is simply \nmaking it more difficult for businesses to remain open. It is really \naffecting their ability to hire people.\n  In my district, one of the big complaints we have had is the EPA \nattempting to limit the ability to have a wood stove. Well, it gets \npretty cold in northern Michigan in the winter, and people save money \nby cutting their own wood and burning it in their homes. Then the EPA \ncomes out saying that we can't have wood stoves that don't meet this \ncriterion, and it doesn't make any sense for people in my district.\n  Furthermore, the EPA's waters of the U.S. proposal to regulate \nditches to manmade ponds doesn't do one thing to truly protect our \nwater resources. Instead, it overloads small farmers, loggers, and \nother businesses with needless red tape and compliance costs.\n  There is a reason that our Founding Fathers created separate, but \nequal, branches of government. The executive branch and agencies like \nthe EPA are charged with carrying out the intent of Congress. We have \nmade incredible strides in cleaning up our Nation's air and water.\n  However, what happens when these giant bureaucracies start to feel \nthemselves becoming relevant? Unelected bureaucrats began writing \nonerous legislation to justify their own existence, and they do this \nwith absolutely no regard for the practical effect that these \nregulations have on local families and businesses.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I reclaim my time.\n  I got a notice from the EPA when I first got up here. It was January \n2014, and it was a pamphlet with their new regulations.\n  In that, what they were talking about is that their new rules and \nregulations would have minimal effect on air quality and human health, \nbut they are going ahead anyway.\n  In the example you brought up about the wood-burning fireplaces, we \nhave done a tremendous job of cleaning up the air quality in this \ncountry, as other countries need to do, but we shouldn't go after \nthings that aren't going to really have a difference.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman from Florida.\n  In my district, although it has been several years, the EPA shut down \nthe construction of a brand-new coal plant. Okay? This coal plant would \nhave been the purest coal-fired power plant in the country.\n  It ran with new technology, and there is no reason for it being shut \ndown. This plant would not even produce any CO2. That \nCO2 was being captured by the coal plant and used by \nindustry to create other products.\n  So this administration has taken on a proposal and used the EPA not \nto make our environment better, but to have a war on coal. I mean, the \nEPA and the President doesn't talk about making our atmosphere and our \nenvironment cleaner. It talks about a war on coal.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  That is just the wrong attitude to have, and it really needs to be \ndirected by Congress. It is unbelievable what we have gone through. It \ncan cause economic damage to this country. Right now we are competing \nwith the Chinese who don't have any significant pollution controls on \ntheir power plants, and we have invested billions as Americans, each \none of us, by paying for more expensive power to really clean up our \natmosphere.\n  How are the Chinese doing that?\n  Now that we have basically cleaned up our atmosphere, they want to \nimpose even higher and higher standards that actually are causing our \nbusiness to go down and steel production is going over there where they \nare polluting even worse.\n  Mr. YOHO. Reclaiming my time, I think you and I were in a meeting the \nother day in one of the committees. We had a fellow, he was an attorney \nwho worked under the Reagan White House, and he worked with the EPA. He \nwas saying the EPA went from regulations to clean stuff up. Now it is \nregulations that you can't. You can't have coal-fired power plants, you \ncan't do this, and it was an agency of can't. I think you were in that \nmeeting. It shows, again, the overstepping of agencies, and it shows \nhow administrations or executive branches rewrite laws or they \nlegislate from the executive branch through the administrative \nagencies, and we have seen an increase in this.\n  Again, it is not just this administration, but I think President \nObama, this administration has done us a favor by bringing this to \nlight with the 24,000 regulations that are coming out that are \ncrippling the American economy and businesses. If it is doing that, it \nis crushing the middle class and all Americans.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. YOHO. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, the things we are talking about here today \nreally are examples of the Federal Government getting involved in \nthings that they don't have the right to do. I think a lot of it comes \nfrom these bureaucrats that are just writing regulations that really \nyou can't comply with, and that is basically the reason that these \ncoal-fired power plants are going out of existence.\n  Most of these problems have been eliminated by the work that we have \ndone on improving our environment, and I applaud that America has made \nthe investment before any other country in making that happen, but to \nregulate us to the point that businesses are going overseas and \npolluting the planet worse because of our policies, because if we did \nthe stuff here, we would do it cleaner.\n  The University of Michigan has had an environmental research station \nin northern Michigan in my district for the last 60, 70 years. The \nscientists at the University of Michigan tell me that most of the \nmercury that falls from the sky in Michigan comes from China and India, \nthat we have essentially eliminated mercury as a problem in the \nenvironment from our industry here. But because we are not dealing with \nthat problem of the Indians and the Chinese doing that, we are ignoring \nthat and actually giving them the ability--by not having to comply with \na lot of these rules, the ability to pollute the planet worse than we \nwould if we were doing those things here.\n  Mr. YOHO. May I add to that?\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Sure.\n  Mr. YOHO. We went to a coal-fired power plant in our district, and \nthey were saying in the old days a typical coal-fired power plant would \nput out approximately 50 pounds of mercury a year. Today it is less \nthan 2 pounds. That is a significant difference from 50 to 2. That is a \n48-pound reduction in mercury going into the atmosphere.\n\n[[Page H2052]]\n\n  What is the significance and the benefit going from 2 pounds to 0, \nand at what cost do you go forward?\n  Being a veterinarian for 30 years, I have never treated an animal \nwith mercury toxicity. I think you need to have common sense in \nregulations, and, of course, the worst place to go for that is \ngovernment.\n  I will let you continue.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Yoho for putting on \nthis Special Order hour. I am very happy to be able to participate in \nit. I think that we really need to be sure the American people are \naware of what is going on and that they make their decisions when they \ngo to the polls based on this information. So thank you very much.\n  Mr. YOHO. I appreciate the gentleman's participation and his \nleadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not a Republican or Democratic argument. That \nshould not even weigh into this. It is not conservatives versus \nliberals. These are American ideologies that we all have to come \ntogether to preserve, and I can't think of one person more suited to \ntalk about this than somebody I have a lot of admiration for who sits \non the House Committee on Agriculture with me. He is from the State my \nwife is from, the State of Iowa.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for \npulling this Special Order together and for his generous introduction, \nand especially for Mr. Yoho's leadership on the restoration of article \nI authority and addressing the executive overreach that has become part \nand parcel of the Obama administration. It didn't begin there, but it \nneeds to end with the next President of the United States and be slowed \ndown in the last months of the Obama administration.\n  Mr. Speaker, I was just exercising a thought here as I was reviewing \nsome of the executive overreach that we have seen from this President, \nand it occurred to me to take a look at the Declaration of Independence \nand review some of what I will call the lamentations of our Founding \nFathers. It is to this effect, Mr. Speaker. When we get to the laments, \nthese are the things, the wrongs that have been committed by the King \nof England.\n  It says in the Declaration: ``The history of the present King of \nGreat Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations''--that \nsounds like the history of our current President of the United States--\n``all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny \nover these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid \nworld.''\n  This is from our Declaration, Mr. Speaker. I will just quickly hit \nsome of these.\n  ``He has refused his Assent to Laws . . .''\n  ``He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws . . .''\n  ``He has refused to pass other Laws for the Accommodation . . . of \npeople . . .''\n  ``He has called together Legislative Bodies at Places unusual . . .''\n  ``He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly . . .''\n  ``He has refused for a long Time, after such Dissolutions, to cause \nothers to be elected; whereby''--summarizing that, hindering \nlegislative activity elsewhere.\n  ``He has endeavored to prevent the Population of these States; for \nthat Purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; \nrefusing to pass others to encourage their Migrations hither . . .''\n  ``He has obstructed the Administration of Justice . . .''\n  ``He has made Judges dependent on his Will . . .''\n  ``He has erected a Multitude of new Offices''--that would be his \nczars.\n\n  ``He has kept among us, in Times of Peace, Standing Armies . . .''\n  Well, not quite, but rumors of them do exist.\n  We could go on and on and on, the grief that King George dished out \non our original colonists here at the time of the Revolution, at the \ntime of this Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, but I look at \nthe present times, and it rings to be pretty close--along the way there \nare echoes of 1776--in the overreach of the President of the United \nStates.\n  I mentioned them. This is a list from some testimony before the \nExecutive Overreach Task Force, which I have the privilege to chair, \nand among this list are some of these:\n  He has appointed policy czars to high-level positions to avoid \nconstitutionally required confirmation hearings--that could be lifted \nalmost right out of the Declaration of Independence.\n  By modifying, delaying, and ignoring various provisions of ObamaCare, \nin violation of the law itself--that is a long list of things on \nObamaCare that the President has altered outside of the law.\n  By attacking private citizens for engaging in constitutionally \nprotected speech--utilizing the IRS to diminish that as well.\n  By issuing draconian regulations regarding sexual assault on campus.\n  By ignoring 100 years of legal rulings and the plain text of the \nConstitution and trying to get a vote in Congress for the D.C. \nDelegate--I had forgotten that one, actually.\n  By trying to enact massive immigration reform via an executive order, \ndemanding that the Department of Homeland Security both refuse to \nenforce existing immigration law and provide work permits to millions \nof people residing in the U.S. illegally.\n  Now, these all ring like the laments, the charges that were laid \nagainst King George in 1776. It is the same tone. It is a similar \nmessage. It is going outside the law and outside the Constitution.\n  By imposing Common Core standards on the States via administrative \nfiat.\n  By ignoring bankruptcy law and arranging Chrysler's bankruptcy to \nbenefit labor unions at the expense of bondholders.\n  And I could continue.\n  Well, here is one that is of significant interest to my State and I \nthink to Florida and many other States, and that is his imposition of a \nregulation called the Waters of the United States. That dropped on us \non May 27, 2015.\n  The Waters of the United States said we are going to regulate all the \nnavigable waters of the United States. Oh, and this ambiguous term that \nis called--let's see. It used to be ``and waters hydrologically \nconnected to them.'' That got litigated into being too ambiguous even \nfor the courts to tolerate. They are the masters of ambiguity. But \ninstead they put the language in that said ``these waters of the United \nStates shall be the navigable waters of the United States and waters \nthat have a significant nexus to the waters of the United States.''\n  Now, a significant nexus is going to be determined by the \nadministration, another term of ambiguity.\n  I see some eagerness over here on the part of the gentleman from \nFlorida. Does he have something to add?\n  Mr. YOHO. The interpretation we got: ``and seasonably wet areas.'' I \ncome from Florida. It is seasonably wet all year long. I mean, we get \n57 to 60 inches of rain a year, so everything is seasonably wet in our \ngreat State, and they fall into that. The little puddle in my yard, \nwhen it rains, it might stand 3 or 4 inches. We are on a sandy soil. \nWhen it stops raining, it goes away in 5 minutes, but that could be \ninterpreted as navigable waters, and I am probably 10 miles from a body \nof water. It is just amazing.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Well, to the gentleman from Florida, we may have a \nlegitimate competition going on here. The Waters of the United States \nregulation would put 96.7 percent of my State under the EPA's \nregulatory jurisdiction. Florida would be a competitor to that number, \nI would think.\n  Mr. YOHO. Yes, it would be all of Florida.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. All of Florida. I have said that once you regulate \nwaters hydrologically connected to or once you get to define \nsignificant nexus, that goes all the way up to the kitchen sink. We \nknow that soil itself, whether it is under water, it can be saturated \nwith water, and just old black Iowa dirt can be 25 percent water, so \nthey have got it all, this overreach of the Federal Government.\n  Our Founding Fathers envisioned that there would be a competition \nbetween the branches of government to sustain their constitutional \nauthority in each branch. They wanted to draw as bright a line as \npossible between the three branches of government, with the courts \nbeing the weakest of the three. They expected that we would jealously \nguard the constitutional authority. Congress writes all the laws. The \nPresident is supposed to enforce all the laws. That should be pretty \nclear. But\n\n[[Page H2053]]\n\nthe President has reached across that over and over and over again, as \nevidenced by this list of laments that I offer, Mr. Speaker.\n  Does the gentleman from Florida have something to add?\n  Mr. YOHO. As I traveled as a veterinarian, and I was talking to \nsomebody, we got in a discussion about the Constitution, and they \nwanted to know why I was so hung up on it. I explained to them that the \nvery people that are fighting to preserve our founding principles that \nour rights come from a Creator, not from government, that government is \ninstituted by men and women to preserve those God-given rights, and \nthat our core values of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, \nthe unalienable rights of those things, that all men are created equal, \nand they are protected by the Constitution.\n  I said it is that very document that people are fighting to preserve \nthat give people on the left a voice of dissension or people on the \nright a voice of dissension. I said: If we lose those very things that \nmade America great, if we lose those, people will lose their voice of \ndissension. If you don't believe that, go to a country like Cuba, go to \nChina, go to Iran and proselytize. It is not possible.\n  The amazing thing is that person called me about 30 minutes later and \nsaid: You know, we got thinking about that, and that really is what \nthis is about. It is not Republican or Democrat. It is not conservative \nor liberal. Those are American ideologies that made this country great.\n  I would hope our friends on the other side of the aisle would come \nand say: You guys are right, we want to preserve the constitutional \nprinciples.\n  Does the gentleman from Iowa have anything else to add?\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gentleman from Florida for those \ntimeless thoughts. Something that our Founding Fathers discovered was a \nconcept that was relatively new to society at the time, and that is the \nconcept of God-given liberty and God-given rights, natural rights, \nnatural rights that did emerge with Locke, for example, in the United \nKingdom, but they hadn't been implanted into culture and civilization \nuntil they were implanted in America.\n  Here we are in this country, everyone that serves in this Chamber \ntakes an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates, as do all the Senators on the other end of this Capitol \nBuilding, as does everyone who puts on a uniform to defend our country, \nand many of them who serve within our executive branch as well. The \nPresident is a bit of an exception because he is required to deliver an \noath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates, and he is required to take care that the laws be faithfully \nexecuted.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  And what he has done, instead, is turn himself into an independent \nlegislative body. He has said 22 times: I don't have the constitutional \nauthority--and I am going to summarize here--to grant amnesty to \nmillions of people in America. That is up to the legislature.\n  He taught the Constitution at the University of Chicago for 10 years \nas an adjunct professor teaching Con law. And that was the message, I \nam sure, that he taught in those classrooms; and it was a message he \ntaught in a classroom out here at one of the high schools in D.C. \nshortly before he decided to reverse his position and impose this edict \nof amnesty on the United States, which went down through a long path of \nlitigation for more than 2 years and a week ago last Monday was heard \nbefore the United States Supreme Court, at least in the DAPA case--the \ndeferred action for parents of anchor babies is actually what that \nacronym stands for, in my view.\n  So I take this oath that I have to support and defend the \nConstitution seriously. I have the privilege of serving on the \nConstitution and Civil Justice Subcommittee of the House Judiciary \nCommittee and of chairing this task force. I congratulate the gentleman \nfrom Florida for stepping up to the lead on this issue.\n  Mr. YOHO. If I may add to one of your comments, because you brought \nup the philosophers Locke and Howe, philosophers of old, when we look \nat the American period of time--227 years, roughly, the U.S. \nConstitution and a constitutional Republic as a country have been in \nexistence, the longest time a republic has been in existence--when you \ngo back to the beginning of human recorded history to today and you \nlook at the American period where we are at today, it is but a dot on \nthat timeline.\n  Yet that dot represents the largest middle class that has ever been \nallowed to happen. It is the first time there have been property rights \nthat you can have and the right to pursue life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness. It is only possible because we had a Constitution \nthat preserved those rights. So I would think we could all come \ntogether and protect those rights for the next generation, for the \nposterity of this Nation.\n  I would like to see if you had any thoughts on that, and then I will \nclose.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. I am looking at our job and our destiny here, and I \nthink that our constitutional obligation is to restore the pillars of \nAmerican exceptionalism. You can identify many of them in the \nConstitution itself. In the Bill of Rights it is pretty well \nsummarized: freedom of speech, religion, the press, the freedom to \npeaceably assemble and petition the government for redress of \ngrievances.\n  The Second Amendment rights, which are the property rights that the \ngentleman mentioned, I would point out that, in the Kelo decision, \nwhich happened about 10 years, the Supreme Court ruled that they could \namend the Constitution itself. Well, they didn't say they did, but that \nwas the effect of their decision. ``Nor shall private property be taken \nfor public use without just compensation'' is part of the Fifth \nAmendment. The Supreme Court ruled that private property could be taken \nfor private use as long as there was just compensation. So they struck \nthe three words ``for public use'' as a conditional clause out of the \nFifth Amendment. We had a Supreme Court that amended the Constitution, \neffectively.\n  We have a Supreme Court last June that amended ObamaCare by writing \nwords into it; ``or Federal Government'' would be the three words \ninserted there. And then, the next day, they decided they would create \na new command in the Constitution, a command that all States shall \nconduct same-sex weddings and honor them from other States, as if \nsomehow that were the will of the people or something done under the \nConstitution.\n  This is an appalling reach on the part of the Supreme Court. It is \neven more appalling on the part of the President of the United States, \nand it is our task to identify what needs to be done and start down \nthat mission of restoring the constitutional authority and this balance \nbetween the branches of government.\n  I am happy to have a chance to say a few words.\n  Mr. YOHO. Today, in one of our committees, we were hearing about the \nAttorney General and how she stated that those who speak out against \nthe administration's climate change policy possibly being a crime.\n  Think about that. They are examining if you speak out against \nsomething that is unfavorable to an administration. It is going against \nfreedom of speech, our First Amendment, the very things that we fought \nfor and that everybody who has come before us has fought for. I think \nthis would be something that would scare everybody, if we are that \nclose to losing the very document.\n  I hold in my hand--and you have seen me do this before--the \nDeclaration of Independence, in total, and the U.S. Constitution, in \ntotal. I think we can all agree this is not an epic in volume. I can \nread this in a day. This is not an epic in volume, but yet it is an \nepic in ideology of what free men and women can do in a country that \nhonors and reveres this document. It just so important that we come \ntogether.\n  As I stated earlier, I think Mr. Obama has done us a favor in showing \nus how weak we have become as an institution and how weak our rule of \nlaw is. And for us to succeed and continue as a constitutional \nRepublic, we must--we have to--bring those Article I powers back to \nthis body.\n  I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gentleman from Florida for that \nstatement. I absolutely believe that, deeply.\n  I think one of the important things is that we educate the young \npeople on\n\n[[Page H2054]]\n\nwhat the Constitution says and what it means. We have a President of \nthe United States who was a professional Constitution teacher, who we \nknow knows the history and the text of the Constitution and takes his \noath to preserve, protect, and defend it and take care that the laws be \nfaithfully executed and explains it in stop after stop succinctly, in \nways that I agree with this President, and then he turns around and, by \nhis own definition--and by his definition is all I am referring to \nhere, Mr. Speaker--breaks his own oath. So we are here now trying to \nrestore the knowledge base of America.\n  Members of Congress arrive here as freshmen, and they take an oath to \nthe Constitution. They don't know what it means anymore. The Supreme \nCourt thinks they can amend the Constitution; they can manufacture new \ncommands in the Constitution; they can violate Article I authority. And \nthe President can do so at will.\n  But I would point out that, 13 times, the President of the United \nStates' position has been unanimously reversed by the United States \nSupreme Court--President Obama, 13 times, unanimously reversed. Another \n11 times, he has lost on a 5-4 decision.\n  So he has stretched this Constitution beyond that. Even his own \nappointees in the Supreme Court can't stomach it; that is how bad this \nis. But I want to see the right appointments to the Supreme Court so \nthe whole Constitution is revered, respected, and we see cases go \nbefore the Court and, once again, we can predict the Court will rule on \nthe Constitution rather than their political whims.\n  Mr. YOHO. I appreciate you bringing that up, because you bring up how \nmany times it has been overstepped as of recent, but other \nadministrations have done it in the past. But it sets a precedent from \nthis point forward. If we don't rein it in now, when do you rein it in? \nDo you wait for the next candidate to come in? And we have had talks \nabout that. If we don't do it now, it be would like buying fire \ninsurance after your house catches on fire. It doesn't work.\n\n  So it is so important that we come together as a body. Again, the \nConstitution is not a product of Republicans or Democrats or \nconservatives or liberals. The Constitution is not a function of \ngovernment. Government is a function of the Constitution.\n  When government steps over the boundaries of the Constitution, it is \nus--we, the people--the Representatives that were sent up here to hold \nand rein in the branches that are out of balance. This is all about \nbringing the three branches of government into balance.\n  Let me just wind up with this. Mr. Speaker, once again, I would like \nto thank all the Members who have joined me this evening. Restoring \nArticle I powers is so vital to the survival of our constitutional \nRepublic.\n  At this very moment, there are individuals seeking the highest office \nin the land who have stated, if Congress disagrees with them, they have \nno qualms about taking action on their own, circumventing Congress and \ndisregarding the founding principles enshrined in our Constitution. \nThat should give concern to everybody.\n  The time has arrived for us to take action to restore this \ninstitution to the one the Founders envisioned. Granted, you can say \nwhat you want about our Founding Fathers, but they got this right--\nagain, as you and have I have talked about, with divine intervention--\nand they put in place a way to amend it to make it better, not to get \nrid of it. It is time for us to stand up for this body, the people's \nHouse.\n  I will leave you with this reminder. All it takes for evil or tyranny \nto prevail or for our constitutional Republic to fail is for those good \nmen and women to do nothing.\n  I, Mr. Speaker, and the people that have joined us tonight, our \ncolleagues that participated, will not sit idly by when the very \ndocument that has allowed so many people to be free, to achieve beyond \ntheir beliefs to a level never before ever achieved in human history, \nis being marginalized by inaction.\n  I know my good friend from Iowa feels the same. And if you have any \nlast remarks, you have got about 1 minute, if you want to wrap it up.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank, again, the gentleman from Florida. I \nappreciate you coming to the floor with this leadership that is here. \nIf no one stepped forward in leadership and we just went along as if \nsomehow the Constitution were going to be restored, it would never be \nrestored. And I would remind people, Mr. Speaker, that it is one thing \nto give lip service to the Constitution; it is another to exercise it.\n  Freedom of speech is being exercised here right now. Freedom of \nassembly is being exercised across this country right now. The right to \nkeep and bear arms, if it were never exercised, the liberals would \ndefine it away from us.\n  Any one of these rights that we have that come from God, defined by \nour Founding Fathers, is also something we have got to exercise and \nutilize; if not, over time, the enemies of freedom will find a way to \nsay: Well, it is just an artifact of history.\n  If we stop exercising our right to keep and bear arms, in a matter of \na generation, someone will say it is just an artifact of history. We \nare going to confiscate your guns. And after a while, they will zip \nyour lip if you don't watch it. We can't let that happen.\n  So I appreciate this Special Order here tonight with the gentleman \nfrom Florida's leadership, and I appreciate my Constitution and the \nrights that come, especially from God.\n  Mr. YOHO. I thank my colleague from Iowa, and I want to thank \neverybody that participated.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are advised to refrain from engaging \nin personalities toward the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2054-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2054-H2059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CHILD NUTRITION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revised and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, more than 60 years ago, Congress \nresponded to the Defense Department's concern that so many children \nwere malnourished, they would be unfit for military service, that they \npassed the National School Lunch Act as a measure of national security \nto safeguard the health and well-being of our Nation's children.\n  Through the enactment of the first Federal child nutrition program, \nCongress recognized that feeding hungry children is not just a moral \nimperative, it is vital to the health and security of our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I serve as the ranking member of the House Committee on \nEducation and the Workforce. Our committee is tasked with making sure \nthat all children have an equal shot at success, so it is only fitting \nthat child nutrition programs fall within our committee's jurisdiction.\n  Just as there is a Federal role in ensuring that all children have \naccess to quality education, regardless of where they live, what they \nlook like, or their family's income, there is also a Federal role in \nensuring that every child has access to healthy and nutritious food.\n  Research has repeatedly shown us that a lack of adequate consumption \nof specific foods, especially fruits and vegetables, is associated with \nlower grades among students; and child obesity affects all aspects of a \nchild's life, from their physical well-being to their academic success \nand self-confidence.\n  So we have a choice to make. We can put money into these programs now \nand support healthy eating in schools, or we can cut corners and spend \nmore money down the road on chronic diseases and other social services, \nputting the well-being of our children and our Nation's future at risk.\n  Either way, we will spend the money. In fact, researchers estimate \nthat $19,000 was the incremental lifetime medical costs of an obese \nchild relative to a normal weight child who maintains that normal \nweight throughout adulthood. So it is important to keep\n\n[[Page H2055]]\n\nthis tradeoff in mind as we talk about reauthorization of child \nnutrition programs.\n  The hallmark of a good reauthorization is that it makes progress; it \nmoves us forward; it builds on what works and improves on what needs to \nbe improved. So with this in mind, Democrats are ready to make \nimprovements to the child nutrition programs and to protect the \nprogress that has been made.\n  For example, we have made progress in creating a healthier school \nenvironment for students. The nutrition standards enacted after the \n2010 bipartisan reauthorization are working. Around 99 percent of all \nschools are meeting the standards. Kids are eating better foods. \nStudies show that kids are eating up to 16 percent more vegetables and \n23 percent more fruit at lunch.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Now, unfortunately, many are now advocating that we roll back the \nstandards, and the Republican draft bill released last week makes \nnumerous steps backwards by making less nutritious foods available in \nschools.\n  Another example of progress is the community eligibility provision. \nEnacted in the 2010 reauthorization, the community eligibility \nprovision, or CEP, allows schools to provide free nutritious meals to \nall students without using the paper applications when a large portion \nof the students are deemed eligible because they are already receiving \ncertain social benefits.\n  Schools love this, teachers love this, families love it, and kids \nlove it. So why go backwards?\n  Again, unfortunately, the Republican bill does just that by making it \nharder for schools to use CEP, kicking thousands of schools out of CEP \nand back into the individualized paper application process.\n  So we are talking about a hugely popular option for schools that \nimproves the health of children, makes everyone's job easier. If it \nain't broke, don't fix it. And if it ain't broke, you shouldn't make a \nspecial effort to try to break it.\n  Our work on reauthorization of our school nutrition programs \nrepresents a great opportunity to continue to change the way children \neat, to expand their access to nutritious meals, and to end the child \nhunger crisis in our Nation.\n  So we should ask ourselves if these are goals that we are willing to \ncompromise or whether we will continue on that path that has resulted \nin healthier schools and communities.\n  The success of these programs are too many to mention, but it is my \nhope that we will continue to build on our success and invest in the \nfuture of our country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Ohio (Ms. Fudge), the ranking \nmember on the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and \nSecondary Education.\n  Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, more than 21 percent of American children live in \npoverty. More than 15 million children live in food-insecure \nhouseholds. In fact, households with children are more likely to be \nfood insecure than those without.\n  In my home State of Ohio, 16.9 percent of households experience food \ninsecurity, and Ohio's rate is higher than the national average of \n14.3.\n  Programs that affect child nutrition, such as the National School \nLunch Program, the National School Breakfast Program, and the Summer \nFood Service Program, are essential tools in the fight to end child \nhunger.\n  Access to healthy foods during the school day and throughout summer \nfeeding programs is essential to helping children thrive both \nacademically and developmentally.\n  The Improving Child Nutrition and Education Act would increase the \nburden on schools with new verification requirements and increased \ncommunity eligibility thresholds, or CEP.\n  I represent one of the Nation's most impoverished districts, with \nnearly 200,000 people living in poverty. Out of 435 districts and the \nDistrict of Columbia, my district ranks 420th. Only 16 other districts \nin the United States fare worse than mine.\n  If passed, the changes to CEP alone could result in children across \nthe country losing access to free and reduced-price meals at school, \nand that is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker.\n  The bill fails to make critical investments in the summer meal \nprogram. Meals served through the summer feeding program may be the \nonly ones some children have in a day.\n  If the sponsors of the bill truly wanted to improve child nutrition, \nthey would invest in summer meals to ensure eligible children do not go \nhungry during the summer months.\n  As we move towards reauthorization, we must strengthen and expand \nchild nutrition programs. Our children's health and education are not \nbudget-saving gimmicks.\n  I firmly believe that any attempt to reauthorize child nutrition \nprograms must improve access to healthy foods year-round. This bill \ndoes not even come close to meeting the minimum requirement.\n  We must engage in bipartisan conversations about how to best meet the \nneeds of all children.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her \ncomments.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nDeSaulnier), a hardworking member of the Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in support of \nmy colleagues in urging the reauthorization of this act based on \nnutritional value and investment in this country's future and our young \npeople.\n  Specifically, I want to take a minute to talk about the simultaneous \nissues of extreme hunger and obesity in this country and in my home \nState of California, which are nothing short of staggering.\n  Fourteen percent of people in California are food insecure. Twenty-\nthree percent of California's children are food insecure. In my \ndistrict, 14 percent of the total population is food insecure.\n  In the United States, three out of four public school teachers tell \nus that students regularly come to class hungry. Eighty-one percent say \nit happens at least once a week. Over 15 million American kids struggle \nwith hunger.\n  On the other hand, American kids who eat school breakfast miss less \nschool, get better grades, and are more likely to graduate from high \nschool.\n  At the same time, there is a childhood obesity epidemic in this \ncountry. Childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and \nquadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years, according to the \nCenters for Disease Control.\n  In 2012, more than one-third of children and adolescents were \noverweight or obese. One in three children in California are currently \noverweight or obese, according to the Pew Endowment Foundation.\n  Research shows that children living in States with strong school \nnutrition standards are more likely to maintain healthier weights.\n  The estimated annual health costs of obesity-related illness in the \nU.S. is a staggering $190.2 billion, or nearly 21 percent of annual \nmedical spending in the United States.\n  Childhood obesity alone is responsible for $14 billion in direct \nmedical costs. Ironically, the Federal Government spends $15 billion \nevery year on school food.\n  The work that we began with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2010 \nis having an important and positive effect on both of these problems at \nonce.\n  School meal participants are less likely to have nutrient \ninadequacies and are more likely to consume fruit, vegetables, and milk \nat breakfast and lunch.\n  Low-income students who eat both school breakfast and lunch have \nsignificantly better overall diet quality than low-income students who \ndo not eat school meals.\n  The school meal nutrition standards are having a positive impact on \nstudent food selection and consumption, especially for fruits and \nvegetables.\n\n  Few packed lunches and snacks brought from home meet National School \nLunch Program standards and Child and Adult Care Food Program \nstandards.\n  Children in after-school programs consume more calories, more salty \nfoods, and sugary foods on days that they bring their own snacks than \non days they only eat the afterschool snack provided by the National \nSchool Lunch Program.\n\n[[Page H2056]]\n\n  In California, I am pleased to say that we have figured it out for \nthe kids, for their parents, for the purveyors who provide all of this \nhealthy product, and for the students, the school administrators, and \nrank-and-file staff who distribute these foods.\n  Over 93 percent of school districts nationwide have met the improved \nlunch and breakfast standards, certifying them to receive Federally \nauthorized school lunch reimbursement rate increases.\n  In California, we exceed the national compliance rates with 100 \npercent of our schools currently in compliance.\n  These standards are going a long way toward decreasing the health \ncosts associated with malnutrition for both hungry and obese children. \nWe must double down on these efforts, not turn away from them. Our \nchildren deserve at least this much from us.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this effort.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from \nWisconsin (Ms. Moore), a strong child advocate.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for recognizing me. I \nam really pleased to join the Ranking Member, Bobby Scott, a mentor of \nmine and a good friend, Marcia Fudge, and others about the \nreauthorization of school meals and the WIC program. They are truly \nchampions for ending hunger among children in this country.\n  And I believe no conversation could occur about hunger without having \nthe indomitable Mr. McGovern with us this evening.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Child Nutrition Reauthorization is really a critical \nopportunity for us to talk about the importance of improving access to \nhealthy meals in schools and for maintaining strong nutrition \nstandards.\n  For too many kids, Mr. Speaker, the only sure meals that they can \ncount on on any given day are provided in school.\n  Yet, Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the majority on the other side of \nthe aisle are talking about how to make it harder for children, \nespecially low-income children who are eligible for free and reduced-\nprice meals, breakfast and lunch, to access these programs.\n  We should be using this reauthorization to address known gaps and to \nhelp children connect to these healthy meals. Nearly 10,000 more \nschools offer school lunch than offer school breakfast programs, and we \nshould be trying to expand school breakfast rather than restricting \nthem.\n  The Healthy, Hunger-Free Act in the nationwide implementation of the \ncommunity eligibility program was so insightful. But, yet, we need to \ndo more. Over 162,000 kids in my State qualify for free or reduced \nmeals for lunch, and we need to reach them.\n  Now, what does the reauthorization that Republicans are bringing \nbefore us entail? What does it talk about? It talks about scaling back \nthe successful and proven community eligibility provision which we just \nimplemented nationwide last year and really haven't scaled up to what \nit could be.\n  This innovative program actually works. We have proven it. We have \nmetrics that prove that the program increases access and participation \nfor low-income students, and it helps to reduce administrative burdens \nand costs for school staff.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, you have heard my colleagues here talk about \nobesity. Now, obesity is not just a cosmetic problem. It is a major \nhealth problem.\n  We also last year put new nutrition standards in to ward off obesity. \nNinety-seven percent--97 percent--of the schools have successfully met \nthese new standards, and USDA has shown great eagerness to work with \nthose who have not.\n  Of course, these new requirements require more servings of fruits, \nvegetables, whole grains, fat-free and low-fat fluid milk in schools \nwhile cutting sodium-saturated fats and trans fats.\n  Mr. Speaker, I can tell you that, when you introduce these foods to \nchildren at a young age, they will start to prefer them and we can \nreally transform their lives.\n  I want to skip over many of my comments and just add them to the \nRecord because I just want to focus on one little disease that is \nassociated with poor nutrition, and that is diabetes.\n  The burden to individuals and families is gargantuan. You hear of \npeople losing their limbs because of diabetes. But, Mr. Speaker, I want \nto talk about the burden to the economy and to the budget by allowing \ndiabetes to run amok.\n  Diabetes is a budget-busting disease. It is an epidemic that is \naffecting an increasing number of Americans, including more and more of \nour youth.\n  Right now--right now--in 2014, 29 million people in the United \nStates, 9.3 percent of our population, have had diabetes. That is about \n1 in 11 people. According to the CDC, by 2050, that number could be as \nhigh as 100 million, or 1 in 3 persons.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  The time to stop this is now while we are reauthorizing the child \nnutrition bill. We can help our children develop healthy eating habits. \nI have seen kids love avocados, love grapes, and love these things that \nare introduced to them while they are young. Our investment in school \nlunch and school breakfast pales in comparison to the cost of treating \ndiabetes.\n  In 2012, diabetes and its related complications accounted for $245 \nbillion in total costs. Now, that is $176 billion in direct medical \ncosts--think Medicaid and Medicare--and lost wages and work. The CDC \nestimates that the growth in these--if their predictions hold, if we \ndon't do something, just think, this will go from 1 in 11 people having \ndiabetes to 1 in 3. So we are looking at 2050--2050, I don't think I am \ngoing to be around in 2050--this is clearly a clarion call to feed our \nchildren properly now.\n  In the school year 2016, we spent $12.5 billion on the school lunch \nprogram and $4.3 billion on the school breakfast program. Compare that \nwith the $245 billion that we have spent on diabetes for just 1 year.\n  With that, I will add the rest of my comments to the Record. I would \njust say, Mr. Scott and Mr. Speaker, that school breakfast, school \nlunch, and WIC, it is a doggone good deal when you think about it.\n  Mr. Speaker, child nutrition reauthorization is a critical time for \nus to talk about the importance of improving access to healthy foods in \nschools, and for maintaining strong nutrition standards. For too many \nkids, the only sure meals they can count on on a given day are the ones \nprovided in school.\n  Yet, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are talking about \nhow to make it harder for children, especially low-income children who \nare eligible for free and reduced price meals, to access these \nprograms.\n  The draft Republican Child Nutrition Reauthorization bill is an \nassault on the programs that help to ensure that our children and get \nthe nutrition they need to be active and engaged learners. A growling \nstomach does not advance educational achievement. They want to roll \nback programs that have been proven to help eligible children get \naccess to school breakfast and school lunch programs.\n  It is reportedly titled the ``Improving Child Nutrition and Education \nAct of 2016'' but it really should be the ``Increasing Child Hunger and \nHobbling Education Act.''\n  We should be using child nutrition reauthorization to address know \ngaps and help connect more children to healthy meals. Nearly 10,000 \nmore schools offer school lunch than offer a school breakfast program. \nParticipation in school breakfast programs, though improving since the \nenactment of the Healthy Hunger Free Act and the nationwide \nimplementation of CEP, still lags drastically behind participation in \nthe school lunch program. Only about half of students who eat school \nlunch nationwide eat a school breakfast. My state of Wisconsin is at \nthe bottom when it comes to the number of schools that participate in \nschool breakfast nationwide. Over 162,000 kids that qualify for Free or \nReduced meals are eating lunch, but miss breakfast and Wisconsin loses \n$22 million federal breakfast reimbursement dollars annually. We need \nto be discussing how to help the states and schools do better.\n  Mr. Speaker, we just passed the Every Student Succeeds Act last year \nreauthorizing federal elementary and secondary education policy. Let me \ntell you, no child can succeed when they're hungry. Any teacher can \ntell you that. So can a range of experts who have conducted studies on \nthis issue and found overwhelmingly that hunger does not promote \nacademic achievement.\n  So what are Republicans talking about doing in this reauthorization:\n  Scaling back the successful and proven Community Eligiblity Provision \n(CEP) which just went into effect nationwide last year. This is an \ninnovative program authorized in 2010 that makes it easier for high \nneed schools and school districts to serve free meals to all students \nby eliminating traditional free/reduced priced applications.\n\n[[Page H2057]]\n\n  With all the rhetoric about wasteful government spending and \nduplicative programs, what happens when we have successful and proven \nfederal programs and policies that work like CEP, like SNAP? \nRepublicans want to cut them and roll them back.\n  This program has been proven--I emphasize that word again--to \nincrease access and participation in the school meals programs for the \nlow-income students while helping to reduce administrative burdens and \ncosts for school staff. School meal programs benefit from the economics \nof scale. The more kids who participate, the cheaper it is to serve \neach child. Thousands of schools have adopted CEP and are seeing \nbenefits including the 156 schools in the Milwaukee Public School \nsystem. In its first year, MPS reported serving 22% more school \nbreakfasts. School lunches also saw a gain. CEP means fewer kids are \ngoing hungry in Milwaukee and nationwide.\n  Enacting the GOP bill would means that 7,000 schools that now \ncurrently participate would be dropped. That is a gigantic step \nbackwards for the health and nutrition of tens of thousands, even \nhundreds of thousands, of school children who are at key stages of \ndevelopment, physically and academically.\n  Not to mention the students in thousands of schools currently \neligible to participate in CEP but would be kicked off under the \nRepublican bill.\n  We have put in place new nutrition standards for school meals--97% of \nschools have successful met these new standards and the USDA has shown \ngreat eagerness to work with those that have not to do so. These new \nrequirements require more servings of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, \nand fat-free and low-fat fluid milk in school meals while cutting \nsodium, saturated fat and transfats.\n  Now, some are trying to block the new rules and the savings to our \nnation both short term and long term for helping kids develop lifelong \nhealthy eating habits.\n  Let me just talk about the burden to individuals and taxpayers of \njust one disease: diabetes--a budget busting disease. This is an \nepidemic affecting an increasing number of Americans, including more \nand more of our youth.\n  The number of Americans with diabetes is estimated to drastically in \nthe next three decades. In 2014, 29 million people in the U.S. (9.3 \npercent) had diabetes (about 1 in 11). According to the CDC, by 2050 \nthat number could be as high as 100 Million Americans (or 1 in 3).\n  The time to stop this trend is right now when we can help our \nchildren develop healthy eating habits that will stay with them for the \nrest of their lives and a taste for healthy and nutritious foods \nthrough the school nutrition programs.\n  I want to compare our investments in school lunch and breakfast \nprograms and helping to provide nutritious meals that will support \nlifelong eating habits to young people with what it will cost us to \ntreat diabetes.\n  Diabetes is an extremely expensive condition for our healthcare \nsystem given that it is associated with a number of complicated health \neffects. In 2012, diabetes and its related complications accounted for \n$245 billion in total costs, including $176 billion in direct medical \ncosts (think Medicaid and Medicare) and lost work and wages. If the CDC \nestimates about the growth in cases holds, the cost of just this one \ndisease will grow dramatically over the next three decades. These costs \nwill be picked up by all of us, including through Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  In contrast, in FY 2016, we will spend $12.5 billion on the school \nlunch program and $4.3 billion on the school breakfast program. \nMaintaining healthy and nutrition meals and standards and ensuring that \nall who are eligible can participate in these programs seems like a \nvery wise investment to me.\n  The GOP proposal would bar schools from including the eligibility \nrequirements for school meals on the school meal applications. \nAbsolutely absurd. What public policy purpose is served by such a \nrequirement other than to make sure people don't know about a benefit \nto which they are entitled.\n  I also want to emphasize the need to further strengthen WIC during \nthis reauthorization. WIC works. That's what the research tells us. The \nprogram helps improve health and nutrition outcomes for at risk women, \ninfants, and children. WIC breastfeeding rates are rising. We all know \nthe benefits of breastfeeding for both mother and child.\n  We can make WIC better by increasing the certification period for \ninfants and women, taking steps to ensure that children a better \ntransition by WIC eligible children from the program to the school \nmeals programs Under current law, children that age out of WIC may not \nbe enrolled in school (and participating the school meals programs), \nrisking gains to their health and well-being from having participated \nin WIC.\n  How about making WIC work better for our men and women in uniform? \nYes, there are members of our military who receive WIC. In fact, I know \nof efforts in the last year to close a WIC clinic located on a military \nbase in Washington State serving over 700 people including Navy \nfamilies.\n  There is room for bipartisanship. The Senate Agriculture Committee \nreported a bipartisan bill--which while not perfect and I don't support \nevery element--reflects an honest effort to reach across the aisle that \nis simply nonexistent in this chamber at this point.\n  And that is a shame. For the children who rely on the school meal \nprograms to meet their nutritional needs. For the schools and school \nadministrators who fight hard every day to put the students under their \ncharge in a position to succeed. For the American taxpayer, who expect \nus to govern.\n  I know the will is there on this side of the aisle to work together \non things like increasing the breakfast (and lunch for that matter) \nreimbursement rates. To support grant programs to help increase access \nto school breakfast which remains woefully undersubscribed compared to \nthe school lunch program. We can provide grants to support innovative \nand proven models such as Breakfast after the bell and in the Classroom \nas well as school equipment grants to help offset some of the costs.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentlewoman. The gentlewoman is \nabsolutely right.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMcGovern), who is one of our strongest advocates for ending hunger in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I want to thank my colleague from Virginia (Mr. Scott) \nfor organizing this today and for his leadership on child nutrition \nprograms. I want to thank all my colleagues for being here. This is an \nimportant issue. There is no question about that.\n  We are here because we are outraged. We are outraged at Republican \nattempts to undermine our child nutrition programs. We are outraged at \ntheir lousy child reauthorization bill. It is a terrible, terrible, \nterrible bill. My friends should be ashamed of this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, a nutritious school meal is just as important to a \nchild's success in school as a textbook. Hungry children can't \nconcentrate. They can't focus on their studies. In short, hungry \nchildren cannot learn. That is a fact. Everybody knows that. Yet we \nhave a bill that my Republican friends have drafted that will increase \nhunger and that will actually take food out of the mouths of children. \nIt is outrageous.\n  Together, our child nutrition programs, WIC, school breakfast and \nlunch, the Summer Food Service Program, and the Child and Adult Care \nFood Program provide nutritional support for children year round in \nplaces where they live, learn, and play.\n  Unfortunately, H.R. 5003, which is the Republican reauthorization \nbill, includes a number of harmful provisions that would roll back \nyears of progress and hamper the ability of children to access healthy \nmeals. As I said, to be very blunt, it makes hunger worse in this \ncountry.\n  Specifically, the bill would undermine the successful Community \nEligibility Provision, which some of my colleagues have talked about \nfirst, included in the last reauthorization bill that has allowed high-\npoverty school districts to offer universal school meals to all \nstudents. In its first 2 years, CEP helped more than 8.5 million low-\nincome students access free meals.\n  Instead of building on the success of this program, my Republican \nfriends would severely restrict schools' eligibility for the community \neligibility option. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \nestimates that 7,022 schools currently using community eligibility \nwould lose it under this Republican bill, and another 11,647 schools \nthat qualify for community eligibility but who have not yet adopted it \nwould be prevented from doing so in the future.\n  As we approach the summer months, it is also important to remember \nthat child hunger gets worse in the summer. Consider this: for every \nsix children who get a lunch in school each day, only one receives a \nmeal in the summertime. Instead of being a carefree time for children \nwho depend on getting healthy, reliable meals during the school year, \nthe summer months can be a time of stress, anxiety, and hunger. But it \ndoesn't have to be this way.\n  Unfortunately, this Republican bill cuts the successful summer EBT \npilot program which provides a temporary boost in food assistance \nbenefits during the summer months for families whose\n\n[[Page H2058]]\n\nchildren receive free school meals during the school year, and it fails \nto make necessary investments to expand the reach of summer food \nservice programs so that more kids have access to healthy summer meals \nin their neighborhoods.\n  In addition, Mr. Speaker, this bill rolls back, as my colleagues have \nmentioned, evidence-based standards that make school meals healthier. \nUSDA estimates that more than 90 percent of schools have successfully--\nhave successfully--implemented these standards.\n  My grandmother used to say to me when I was growing up that an apple \na day keeps the doctor away. I wish she was still alive so I could tell \nher she was right. Food is medicine. When we eat good food, we eat \nnutritious food, we tend to have healthy lives. If you eat bad food, if \nyou eat junk food, then you end up getting health issues like diabetes, \nlike high blood pressure, and like obesity. I could go on and on and \non.\n  Why in the world would anybody want to lower the nutrition standards \nin our school meals to give our kids junkier, less nutritious food? \nWhat sense does that make?\n  If my colleagues who are advocating these reversals of smart policy \nare doing so only because they want to save a few dollars, then let me \ntell you something: you are saving nothing.\n  If we don't get this right, if we don't insist that our kids have \naccess to nutritious, healthier food, the medical costs associated with \nthe health challenges that they will experience are astronomical, as my \ncolleague from Wisconsin mentioned earlier, hundreds of billions of \ndollars in avoidable healthcare costs as a result of children not \nhaving access to good food.\n  Mr. Speaker, 15 million children face hunger in this country. Instead \nof undoing the success we have already achieved, Congress should be \nfocused on ways we can strengthen these vital child nutrition programs.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me say, finally, it is hard for me to understand why \nwe have to be here today, why everything is a fight when it comes to \ndealing with issues of hunger and when it comes to dealing with issues \nand making sure our kids get access to good nutrition. It is always a \nfight. It is always a fight to protect so many vital food and nutrition \nprograms that help our kids. There is either a shocking ignorance about \nthe reality of the poverty that millions of our children face in this \ncountry or there is simply indifference. Those are the only two ways I \ncan explain what is going on in this Chamber. Whichever one it is, it \nis a sad excuse for what my Republican friends are trying to do.\n  Let's come together. This should be a bipartisan issue. There was a \ntime when fighting hunger and when making sure that our kids had access \nto nutritious food was a bipartisan issue. George McGovern and Bob Dole \nworked together in the 1970s to strengthen our food and nutrition \nprograms. But now in this Chamber these issues have become \ncontroversial.\n  It is sad because there are a lot of people in this country who are \ndepending on us to find ways to end hunger in America. They are \ndepending on us to make sure that their kids, when they go to school, \nhave access to nutritious food, and that they have access to nutritious \nfood during the summer months as well.\n  Why are my friends making it so difficult?\n  Enough. Enough of this. Stop beating up on the most vulnerable people \nin this country. Let's come together. Let's reject this awful draft of \nthe Child Nutrition Reauthorization bill. Let's come together and do \nthis right. It is the least we can do.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for all of his advocacy \non ending hunger.\n  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nTakano), an effective member of the Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce.\n  Mr. TAKANO. I thank the ranking member. I appreciate the time \nallotted.\n  Mr. Speaker, in my 24 years as a public schoolteacher, I learned a \nlot about helping students reach their potential. I learned about \nproject-based learning and STEM education, and I learned about the \nimportance of arts and music in keeping students engaged and excited. \nBut I also learned that there is no lesson plan or study guide that can \nimprove a student's performance if they are hungry. Good nutrition is \nthe foundation to a good education.\n  With that experience in mind, I rise to express my frustration and \nsadness with the Republicans' proposal to reauthorize the so-called \nImproving Child Nutrition and Education Act. The draft bill published \nlast week includes several provisions that would restrict students' \naccess to nutritious food, particularly children in America's poorest \nneighborhoods.\n  The proposal undermines nutritional standards for schools despite \nthose standards receiving overwhelming support from pediatricians and \npublic health officials. It weakens a popular program designed to give \npoor students access to fresh fruits and vegetables in communities \nwhere they are scarce, and it increases the burden on poor families to \nprove that their children are eligible for lunch programs.\n  But the impact of these provisions is mild compared to what \nRepublicans are proposing to do with CEP, or the Community Eligibility \nProvision. CEP streamlines National School Breakfast and Lunch Programs \nby automatically enrolling students who live in areas with high rates \nof poverty. It was passed with bipartisan support just 6 years ago and \nit is responsible for feeding more than 3 million students every year.\n  Now Republicans are seeking to change the CEP formula to kick many \npoor communities out of the program. Their goal is to save money by \nallowing fewer students to enroll in breakfast and lunch programs. Not \nonly is this bad policy that will hurt student performance in low-\nincome schools, it is cruel. In my district alone, this would affect \nmore than 6,000 students. Nationwide it will severely damage a program \nthat is critical to both fighting child poverty and closing the \nachievement gap in education.\n  There is a troubling asymmetry to conservatives' approach to \nspending. When it comes to tax cuts for large businesses that cost this \ncountry billions of dollars, conservatives are generous with taxpayer \nmoney. But when it comes to hungry students in America's poorest \ncommunities, that is when it is time to cut back. That is when it is \ntime to be stingy. That is when they turn their backs on people in \nneed.\n  Earlier this week, Speaker Ryan said that conservatism is just a \nhappy way of life. This brand of conservatism is not a happy way of \nlife for thousands of hungry children who will lose access to food at \nschool. It is not a happy life for the parents of those children who \nare struggling every day to provide for them, and it is not a happy \nlife for the generation of students who do not have the foundation to \nreach their potential.\n  Who could be happy when so many Americans are suffering?\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman, Mr. Takano. I thank the \ngentleman for his leadership on the committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), \nthe leader of the Democratic Whip's Task Force on Poverty, Income \nInequality, and Opportunity.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding and \nalso for his long-term and longstanding commitment to child nutrition \nprograms and to our Nation's children.\n  I have to say to Mr. Takano that I am not happy at all, and I don't \nthink many of us are happy at what is taking place with regard to this \nImproving Child Nutrition Education Act and what is happening to our \nchildren who many go to bed hungry at night. So I thank the gentleman \nvery much for his leadership.\n  Let me just say to Mr. Scott, who is our ranking member, it is very \nimportant that we recognize the gentleman's leadership and know that he \nis on this committee fighting each and every day to make sure that this \nreauthorization bill, which would take food out of mouths of American \nschoolchildren, does not do that. So I thank the gentleman for his \nfight on the committee.\n  Let me say just a couple of things with regard to H.R. 5003. It would \nturn the clock back on years of progress and prevent children from \neating healthy meals every day. This Republican child nutrition bill \nwould roll back critical, evidence-based nutrition standards made in \nthe 2010 reauthorization bill,\n\n[[Page H2059]]\n\nwhich we were very actively involved with.\n  Sadly, but unsurprisingly, it would also deny eligible children \naccess to the Free or Reduced Price School Meals Program, and it would \nslash funding for some electronics benefits transfer.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  I just have to say that as a young, single mother on public \nassistance and food stamps, I don't know what I would have done had my \nchildren not had school lunches. This was a bridge over troubled waters \nfor me, and my children and I have to thank my government for that \nhelping hand. But today, in 2016, this bill will roll back these \nprograms, which means more hungry kids in our schools and in our \nneighborhoods.\n  That is why several of us are sending a letter to the Education and \nthe Workforce Committee outlining our deep concerns with the changes to \nour child nutrition programs. I hope that everyone on our side of the \naisle signs this important letter, and I hope that the majority will \nread it carefully. It lays out some of the basic problems in this bill. \nWe want to make sure that everyone on the committee and this entire \nbody understands the impact of what this will cause.\n  When we take away access to these meals, we jeopardize children's \nhealth, their educational attainment, and, really, their future. We \nknow that children who have access to healthy meals are more likely to \ndo well in school, have decreased behavioral problems, and come to \nclass ready to learn. That is what we should want for all of our \nchildren.\n  For the children growing up in high-poverty neighborhoods and who \nlack equal access to healthy meals, these school meals really are a \nlifeline. We are not just talking about a few students. The numbers are \nclear. More than 15.3 million children are living in food-insecure \nhouseholds. Let me say that again. More than 15 million kids are at \nrisk of going to bed hungry every night in America, the richest and \nmost powerful country in the world.\n  We also know that childhood hunger is far from colorblind. Children \nof color are disproportionately affected by hunger every day. For \nexample, in 2014, one in three African American children and one in \nfour Latino children were food insecure. For children who live in rural \ncommunities, food insecurity is coupled with other barriers, like lack \nof access to transportation to get to summer feeding sites. More than \n17 percent of rural households--that is 3.3 million households--are \nfood insecure.\n  Child hunger and the lack of nutritious food is a problem that \naffects every child in every ZIP Code. It is endemic in our country, in \nrural, urban, and suburban schools. Every Member of Congress has \nconstituents who are hungry. This should be a priority for all of us.\n  I have seen the impact of food insecurity in my own community in \nOakland, California, where one in four children at the Oakland Unified \nSchool District do not have access to affordable, nutritious food. \nThese families are forced to make impossible choices to feed their \nchildren, especially during the summer months when schools are closed. \nThese families are making decisions every day between food and \nmedicine, food and rent, or food and paying the electric bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need real solutions to these very real problems. Let \nme just mention my legislation, the Half in Ten Act, H.R. 258, that \nwould develop a national strategy to cut poverty in half over the next \ndecade. That is more than 23 million Americans lifted out of poverty \nand into the middle class in just the next 10 years.\n  This bill that we are talking about tonight goes just the opposite \nway. Surely, we can all recognize that ensuring healthy meals for \nAmerican children is the first step in this ongoing War on Poverty. It \nshould not be a partisan issue. Feeding hungry kids is a moral \nimperative.\n  So let's put our children first, and let's strengthen our child \nnutrition programs rather than cut them. Our children deserve the \nsecurity of knowing where their next meal is coming from. That is just \nbasic. It is a basic American value.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Scott for his leadership and thank \nhim for yielding.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Lee for all of her \nhard work on the task force.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardenas), \na Member who has been fighting for children as a member of the State \nlegislature, a member of the Los Angeles City Council, and now is a \nMember of Congress.\n  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Scott for working so \nhard and tirelessly to fight for those young little voices and those \nfamilies that need food in their children's stomachs every single day. \nIt is a tireless battle; and once again, today, we are trying to make \npeople aware of the disingenuous, misguided efforts that are in this \nbill. I rise today to express concern over harmful provisions included \nin the so-called Improving Child Nutrition and Education Act of 2016.\n  In 2014, more than 17 million American households were at risk of \ngoing without having food, including 3.7 million households with \nAmerican children. We should make every effort possible to help \nAmerican children access the proper nutrition that is vital to their \ngrowth, development, and success in school and beyond.\n  The provisions outlined in this bill are doing just the opposite by \ntampering with programs that have been working well, such as the \nCommunity Eligibility Provision, the process that ensures that meals \ncan be served to American children in schools. The provisions in this \nbill will cause too many American children, especially low-income \nchildren, to lose access to these vital programs and to have healthier \nmeals.\n  The Community Eligibility Provision allows high-poverty school \ndistricts to offer universal school meals to all students. This bill \nraises bureaucratic red tape. It will only lead to fewer schools \nqualifying for the program and more low-income American children going \nhungry every single day.\n  Why add burdensome paperwork on school districts and each and every \nfamily in them? Instead, Congress should focus on improving and \nexpanding direct certification, an approach that has been shown to \nimprove program integrity.\n  What this bill should be doing is addressing the barriers faced by \neligible families who are currently not even accessing the benefits of \nthe results of these programs because of the lack of awareness. This \nbill will freeze the progress that we have made on reducing the intake \nof salts for American children in their food diets. It would allow junk \nfood to be an acceptable snack, which would undermine our children's \nhealth and their entire future.\n  We must do more to improve school nutrition, attack undernourishment, \nand combat hunger for millions of American children because, otherwise, \nwe are robbing them of the opportunity to reach their full potential \nboth physically and academically.\n  Once again, I want to thank my colleague from the great State of \nVirginia for all the wonderful work that he has been doing and for \nbeing so tireless in his effort to make sure that the voices of these \nfamilies and these children are heard not only in the Education and the \nWorkforce Committee, but beyond.\n  Thank you for bringing the attention of this to the floor. I am glad \nto be a partner in this effort.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Cardenas very much \nfor his hard work, too.\n  Mr. Speaker, reauthorization is an opportunity to improve \nlegislation. Unfortunately, the pending Republican bill reduces \nnutrition standards and kicks kids off the school meal programs. \nInstead, we should be improving the program and expanding the child \nnutrition and the school lunch programs.\n  I thank my colleagues for saying why this is so important.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2059-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2059-H2062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          IDEOLOGICAL EXTREMISM IS SPREADING ACROSS THE GLOBE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rouzer). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNebraska (Mr. Fortenberry) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, upon visiting some of our wounded\n\n[[Page H2060]]\n\ntroops at Walter Reed Hospital, I entered a rehab area that was full of \nmen and women who had wounds of varying severity. The place was really \na place of tough love--men and women struggling with pain and debility, \ntrying to walk again, recover, and learn new skills.\n  What struck me the most, perhaps, amidst all of this suffering, was \nthe desire, the will, to keep working, to get well, and to maintain an \nattitude of strength in the face of great adversity.\n  Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of speaking with one officer. He had \nlost an arm and an eye, and he was throwing a ball, a simple little \nball, back and forth with his attendant. Now, normally, for us, this is \na simple task, but this activity was necessary to retrain his brain for \na new type of coordination. He had lost the dominant eye and the \ndominant arm.\n  In spite of the many scars that he wore on his face and a really \ntough road to recovery, he had a great attitude--no bitterness, no \nanger, no resentments. He believed in his mission, and he believed in \nhis duty. He was impressive and uplifting, and just to be near him was \na great privilege, as well as the other men and women who have fought \nso vigorously and so hard to overcome their wounds at this particular \nplace and throughout the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, keeping you safe depends upon the men and women who are \nwilling to put themselves on the front line for our security. We do \nremain the strongest country in the world militarily and economically. \nUnfortunately, though, I cannot report that the world is growing any \ncalmer or more stable or more secure. Ideological extremism is \nspreading across the globe and, most alarmingly, is manifested in ISIS' \ntwisted Islamic ideology.\n  In the face of the barbaric onslaught in the Middle East, compounded \nby the Syrian dictator's war of attrition, Europe is now contending \nwith its worst refugee crisis since World War II, and the Continent's \nleadership seems ill-equipped to understand their own plight.\n  Not long ago, Mr. Speaker, the great cities of Europe were secure \nplaces of cultural strength. Today, they are targets for ISIS and other \nterrorist organizations.\n  And, of course, we stand in solidarity with the citizens of Belgium \nas we all continue to deal with the shock of the indiscriminate \nslaughter of civilians in Brussels. Jihadists there orchestrated \ncoordinating bombings at the Brussels airport and the city's metro \nstation--suicide assaults that murdered 31 people in a grim replay of \nthe horrifying attacks in Paris.\n  This maelstrom of violence is a consequence of reckless open border \npolicies and naive assumptions about the potential for multicultural \nconversion to Western economic and political freedoms. Although these \nbombings, these particular ones, in Brussels were probably in \nretaliation for the capture of the mastermind of the suicide strikes \nearlier in Paris, Brussels has long contended with a seedbed of warped \nIslamic aggression, particularly in its Molenbeek neighborhood.\n  The Middle East conflict and the resulting humanitarian catastrophe \nprompted some European leaders to embrace very well-intentioned but \nmisguided immigration postures. Now, nations from Greece to Sweden are \nconfronting capacity issues and deadly security risks. No immigration \nsystem can remain just and orderly without necessary and robust border \nprotection measures.\n  It is not fair. It is not fair to the people who are there, who have \nset up the political systems that are welcoming others, and it is not \nfair to people who do need to flee the violence and reestablish \nthemselves in other nations. It is simply not fair.\n  Contributing also to this problem is the decline of a European myth: \na romanticized vision of cultural and political tradition. What is \ntaking its place is a new narrative that says that particular \ncountries, individual countries, decreasingly should matter. \nSupranational entities, like the European Union, are forging a new \nsettlement of administrative conformity to deal with the pressures of \nglobalization.\n  Originally, the European Union arose from fears of past nationalist \nmovements, such as fascism, that ravaged and sacrificed the Continent \non the alter of ruthless ideology. The European Union, importantly and \npurposefully, serves to check this dark past, while also appropriately \nfacilitating commonalities in commerce, travel, and enhanced \nunderstanding. However, the limits of this type of bureaucratic \narrangement are reached when identity and self-preservation are at \nstake.\n  Unfortunately, the very idea of Europe may be disintegrating.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  So what to do?\n  To turn this around, the Continent should regain a healthy instinct \nof its respective nations that places an emphasis on the interests of \npeoples with shared culture, history, and political traditions. The \nContinent's vibrancy depends on sustaining the dynamism of longstanding \nlocal difference while maintaining proper pride in the ideals that bind \nand animate wider Western civilization.\n  Nothing exists in a vacuum. The lack of a bonding identity in Europe, \ncomplicated by clashing cultural values, has created the Molenbeek \nneighborhood in other major European cities as well. Self-isolating \nMuslim communities can help perpetuate an environment of mutual \nmisunderstanding and distrust, breeding alienation, resentment, and \nhostility. Genuine multiculturalism is an important goal and should be \nupheld by us all, but it is difficult without enculturation among \nimmigrant populations.\n  Thousands of Europeans have left the Continent for the battlegrounds \nof Syria and Iraq. These radicalized fighters, passport holders--\nhardened by war and dedicated to jihadist militancy--pose a security \nrisk to their countries of origin in the West. Even some so-called \nAmericans have joined the ranks of terrorist organizations that are \nmetastasizing across the Middle East and North Africa. San Bernardino \ndemonstrated to all of us that the United States is far from immune to \nthe cancer of ISIS' expansion.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, our Nation, for decades, has shouldered a great \nburden in confronting havoc throughout the world. We will continue to \nlead the fight against extremism, but we will not do so alone. A \ngeneral assumption that we will maintain the majority of heavy lifting \nin combating regional terror, coupled with the lack of will amongst \nsome of our allies, has created a status quo that is no longer \nsustainable.\n  As we recover from the shock of the bombings in Brussels, we must \nreclaim a central principal. Europe must fight. Complacency is no \nlonger possible. The combined effects of a drifting European identity \nand a lack of appropriate enculturation among certain migrant \npopulations, further compounded by this new migrant crisis, must be \nconfronted with reason and resolve in order to keep Europe and the \nworld safe. Only through this approach will Europe stabilize, regain a \nsense of vision, and remain a great and important source of a welcoming \nand cultural strength.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the world has focused on the death cult created by \nISIS, our focus has drifted away from an equally grave threat: the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons. Although the Iran agreement has, \nunderstandably, dominated headlines on this issue of late, North \nKorea's dynastic and despotic leadership continues its provocations. \nThe country's young, insecure, ego-driven ruler seeks to consolidate \nhis power and standing through destabilizing bravado, and he is backing \nit up with nuclear weapons development. In a region already roiled by \nincreased Chinese military posturing, particularly in the South China \nSea, North Korea's ongoing threats linger as one of the most \ncomplicated international dilemmas.\n  The possibility of nuclear weapon devastation is one of the most \nserious threats to civilization, itself. Unfortunately, the gravity of \nthis challenge has not received ongoing critical attention in this body \nas a first order of priority. New intellectual rigor, strategic \nprojection, and next generation ownership are necessary for nuclear \nsecurity in the 21st century.\n  Mr. Speaker, I recall an incident when I was in graduate school. A \nprominent philosophy professor was visiting the campus, and he was \nknown for a particular expertise.\n\n[[Page H2061]]\n\n  I asked him: Would you give me a concise summary of the philosophical \nargument for immortality?\n  He was very excited by my request, and he actually invited me to his \nlectures on the topic. I did consider this a great privilege as, again, \nhe was a very renowned professor. He was very kind to eagerly invite me \nto his class, but I could not really manage the 4 hours necessary to \nsit through his lectures, so I politely declined.\n  He then looked at me, and said: Ah, you have asked me a question \nabout immortality, but you do not have the time.\n  We cannot afford to make the same mistake here on nuclear security--\nnot having the time. We are distracted by all types of considerations, \nbut if we are to bring the probability of a nuclear catastrophe to as \nnear zero as possible, we must make the time. Understanding how nuclear \nthreats have evolved and how to resolve them most effectively is an \nurgent national priority.\n  Imagine, just for a moment, one of several scenarios. A terrorist \norganization collects enough radiological material to set off what is \ncalled a dirty bomb in the stadium, perhaps, of a major city. This \nwould trigger widespread harm and panic. A smuggled package on a \ncontainership, with no need for a sophisticated weapons delivery \nsystem, explodes in a major U.S. harbor, causing widespread destruction \nand a loss of life. Worse yet, a reckless nation-state actor, such as \nNorth Korea's autocratic strongman, launches a missile attack against \nSeoul or even Los Angeles. Each future scenario is alarmingly feasible. \nNo one enjoys thinking about this, nor do I, but ignoring this problem \nonly amplifies the ongoing threat.\n  Americans deserve the assurance that our best and brightest minds are \nfervently engaged in their defense. They should be able to trust that \npolicymakers on both sides of the aisle are working together for \ninnovative and sustainable solutions to nuclear security concerns. In \nthis age of anxiety and sound bite foreign policy, constituents should \nknow, should believe, should have trust that Congress is leading where \nit matters most.\n  The leaders who courageously helmed our formidable nuclear enterprise \nthrough World War II and the cold war have now passed the baton to a \nnew generation of policymakers and scientists. Now, as our world grows \nmore complex, the challenges of nuclear proliferation have multiplied. \nThe binary concept of mutually assured destruction is no longer \nrelevant in an increasingly unstable geopolitical environment. Nonstate \nactors play havoc with global treaties and normative rules, seeking to \ndo horrifying harm. Rational responses to deterrence are no longer a \nguarantee.\n  Despite all of these challenges and the important issues that come \nbefore Congress, nuclear security, ironically, seldom surfaces in our \nnational conversation outside highly specialized forums. The problem is \nreal. The United States and our allies face a stark deficiency: nuclear \nsecurity as a multidimensional issue with no longstanding constituency \nsupportive of initiatives in Congress. That constituency must be built. \nThis is of grave concern to us all. The constituency must be built.\n  In light of this problem, the Nuclear Security Working Group in \nCongress was founded to advance this discussion and help prevent the \nunthinkable. While the analytical and tactical expertise rightly should \nremain embedded in the Department of Defense, in the Department of \nEnergy, in the Department of State, and in other executive branch \nentities, Congress must create an agile policy environment in this age \nof globalization and swiftly advancing technologies. We also need to \nawaken citizen concern in order to give momentum and consideration of \nthe time necessary in this body with so many other distractions. \nUnfortunately, there is very little. The need for broader involvement, \nI believe, particularly extends to the millennial generation, the \ncoming stewards of our nuclear security.\n\n  The community of responsible nations has much work ahead to achieve \nan ideal nuclear security settlement. Advances in reprocessing \ntechnology, nuclear power, and weapons infrastructure, once the \nexclusive domain of the nation-state, now pose serious proliferation \nconcerns. Although many countries, thankfully, have altogether \nrenounced the pursuit of nuclear weapons, turbulent situations in the \nMiddle East and elsewhere are worsening an already hazardous global \nnuclear dynamic. A new architecture for nuclear security demands an \nongoing effort by the responsible nations of the world.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, this fourth and final Nuclear Security Summit, \nhosted by President Obama recently in Washington, represented another \nimportant step in securing loose nuclear materials and in heightening \ncollaboration. We need to sustain this in more international gatherings \nand multinational efforts to achieve an effective 21st century nuclear \nsecurity strategy, one that prioritizes common ground on important \nstrategic and nonproliferation priorities in a cooperative campaign to \nmake our world safer.\n  Looking ahead, Mr. Speaker, in this regard, I anticipate an augmented \nrole for the International Atomic Energy Agency, known as the IAEA, as \na primary implementing agency of future verification initiatives. A \nrevitalized spirit of unity, common purpose, and renewed dedication is \nessential to nuclear security in the 21st century, and we need robust \nplatforms to do so, multilateral ones. Our challenge is that we cannot \nreact to a nuclear crisis. We must act to prevent one--if we have the \ntime.\n  Given the collapse of the nation-state order in the Middle East, as \nwell as the technological advances and the potential for highly \ndestructive weaponry to evolve in short order, what will our national \nsecurity challenges look like in the next 20 to 30 years? It is quite \nserious. The answer lies in as much a values proposition as a military \none. On a fundamental level, the question is whether the world can \nembrace, enculturate, and institutionalize the belief in human dignity \nand, from there, build out the governing and economic systems \nconsistent with protecting innocent persons. That is the key.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, we owe so much to the young men and women who are \nwilling to risk everything in military service to take this integrated \napproach to international security. Put simply, I believe in the three \nDs: strong defense, smart diplomacy, and sustainable development. All \nare necessary components for international stability and, thereby, our \nown national security. Closer to home, in order to have a stable \nsociety here, we also depend upon economic security.\n  We need to reexamine some fundamental questions as to what is causing \nsuch anxiety in our American culture. Our security problems are \ncompounded by globalization trends that have left millions of Americans \nin dire need and dire straits of financial vulnerability. I recently \nsaw a presentation by a CEO of a major company. I thought we were \ngetting ready for a PowerPoint with charts and graphs of financials. \nInstead, this CEO put a picture up of a father with his daughter, a \nbride on his arm, as they were walking down the aisle on her wedding \nday. He said this to us: Everyone is someone's daughter. Every person \nis someone's son.\n  The point was powerfully made. The understanding of work and the \nworkplace are essential to human dignity and happiness.\n  I learned a little more about this company. During the financial \ncrisis of 2008, the business lost about a third of its contracts. \nReeling from the economic pressure, this CEO pulled all of his \nemployees together and asked: Team, what are we going to do?\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  He had earned their trust. Because there was an interdependency in \nthat workplace, because there were demands--they had to be profitable, \nthey had to make efficiency gains in order to be competitive--because \nhe created a culture of trust and interdependency, the entire company \ndecided to take a 30-day furlough with no pay. No job was lost. By \nsharing in that sacrifice, no job was lost. No one person was laid off. \nNot one job either was moved overseas.\n  Contrast that, Mr. Speaker, with an Indianapolis-based company that \nrecently announced they are relocating 1,400 jobs to Mexico.\n  The fallout from this move was captured on a video camera as worker \noutrage built during the condescending\n\n[[Page H2062]]\n\nspeech of a company executive, who channeled corporate elitism in his \nexplanation. Basically, he said: It is nothing personal. It is just \nbusiness.\n  Seen here and elsewhere across our country, a dehumanizing, abstract, \neconomic construct that elevates balance sheets and projected earnings \nover the needs of persons is not a sustainable economic model for well-\nbeing, happiness, and commitment.\n  The economy and our society are inextricably intertwined. When this \nworks, it works well. When it doesn't, there are problems. Social \nfracture leads to economic decline. Economic decline leads to social \nfracture. Interdependency can fray into downward mobility and decreased \nearning power.\n  A market that fails to deliver for the many, improperly prioritizing \nonly measurable efficiency gains, breaks down communities. Creative \ndestruction should not eviscerate the social environments in which \npeople work. More than the loss of one company, economic disruption \ncreates aftershocks that further result in the decline of community.\n  While the theory that globalization, including so-called free trade \nagreements, reduces the cost of consumer goods does have truth, people \nare not only consumers.\n  A disordered economy that operates solely from the principle of \nprofit maximization can devalue the rich texture of ecosystems that are \nbuilt and shared by working families, local businesses, local \ninstitutions, and community heritage. Trust and commitment are \nimmeasurables that do not show up on the balance sheet.\n  Government policy here also has to bear some blame. Our convoluted \nand burdensome Tax Code incentivizes companies to move overseas or \nretain their earnings there. Escalated healthcare costs don't help \neither. Beyond government policy, the harsh reality is that the \nphilosophy and the purpose of the corporation has changed, prioritizing \nshort-term earnings, quarterly profit statements, and the stock price \nover the long-term viability of the business itself and the people \nwithin it who grew the business in the first place.\n  Mix in a new class of aloof CEOs accountable for only spreadsheets \nand no wonder people in Indianapolis started shouting at the corporate \nspokesperson when he announced the jobs were moving to Mexico. It is \njust business.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is a better way forward. Take the example that I \ngave of the CEO who called his team together and said: Team, we have \ngot a problem. We have got a big problem. What can we do about it?\n  The team shared in the sacrifice in order to keep the business \nviable, in order to maintain profitability, in order to protect the \necosystem built upon trust, shared commitment, and interdependency.\n  The better way forward is not a compromise. It is a commonsense \nconsensus that a proper balance between globalized business interests \nand the daily life of most Americans should cultivate a culture of work \nto benefit the business itself, employees, and customers. Injecting the \nvalue proposition that work should have meaning, that companies should \nstrive to protect the persons under their employ, and that product \ndevelopment should be seen as a shared experience provides the very \nfoundation for profitability and long-term survivability of the \nbusiness itself with innovation and efficiency properly ordered. What \nis good for persons is good for business.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2062-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2062-H2065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SOLUTION TO FLOODING IN HOUSTON, TEXAS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al \nGreen) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the date was April 14, 1970. The \nmission was Apollo 13. The message was: Houston, we have a problem.\n  Mr. Speaker, that was a clarion call from a mission that was in \ntrouble. Tonight I ring and sound this clarion call from the people of \nHouston, Texas, because we have some troubles. We have trouble that is \nrelated to floodwaters in Houston, Texas, that inundated our city and \ncaused great harm and great damages.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am on a mission of mercy tonight, a mission of mercy \non behalf of my constituents in Houston, but also on behalf of all of \nthose in Houston and the immediate area.\n  I am on this mission of mercy, but I am not without a solution. We \nhave a solution to the flooding problem in Houston, Texas, and that \nsolution is H.R. 5025. It is a bill that will help to mitigate the \nflood damages. It will not eliminate the flood damages in Houston, \nTexas.\n  I am not sure that we can construct a system that will totally \neliminate all flood damages in Houston, Texas, but I am sure that we \ncan mitigate, that we can eliminate many, that we can do something \nabout the magnitude of the problem.\n  I am absolutely confident, Mr. Speaker, that my mother was correct \nwhen she informed me that there will be times in life when you cannot \ndo enough. No matter what you do, you won't be able to do enough. But \nshe also went on to explain to me, Mr. Speaker, when you cannot do \nenough and more needs to be done, you have a duty to do all that you \ncan.\n  I am here tonight to let this Congress know that we can do more to \nhelp in Houston, Texas. We can do more to mitigate the flood damages \nthat we have in Houston, Texas.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 5025, would accord $311 million. This \nmoney would be for projects that have already been approved that are \nrelated to flood control in Houston, projects that have not been \ncompleted.\n  This bill would authorize this funding up to 2026. This bill is \nneeded in Houston, Texas, for many, many reasons. I shall share but a \nfew, then I will yield to a colleague, and then I will say more.\n  This bill is needed because it would not only mitigate the flood \ndamages, but it would also help us with jobs. For those who are \ninterested in jobs, this bill would create 6,220 jobs. The people who \nacquire these jobs will pay taxes. These taxpayers will help us, in \nturn, by helping with some of our fire, our police, and schools.\n  There are many ways that these tax dollars will be used, including a \ngood deal of them sent to Washington, D.C., to help others across the \nlength and breadth of our great country.\n  This bill will save lives. I will say more about that, and my \ncolleague may say something about this as well. But I think it is \nimportant for us to note now that this bill will have a meaningful, \npowerful, significant impact on Houston, Texas.\n  I am proud to tell you that this Congress has been helpful. We have \nalready accorded for one project $212 million, but we need $34 million \nto complete the project. This is the Brays project in Houston, Texas. \nWe need $34 million more to complete it.\n  This project is in an area where we do get flooding, in the Meyerland \narea. This project would help prevent homes from being flooded and cars \nfrom being damaged. This is a great project.\n  We just need to finish the project. The project was authorized in \n1990, and it is projected to be finished in 2021, Mr. Speaker. While I \ndo want to make sure we complete it, I do think it is taking us a bit \ntoo long to complete the Brays project.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Golden Gate Bridge with all of its majesty only took \n4 years, approximately, to complete. The Hoover Dam, a great monument \nto what we can do to channel water and turn that water into electrical \npower, only took 5 years to complete. For the Erie Canal, we didn't \nhave the advances in technology that we have today; yet, the Erie Canal \ntook 8 years to complete.\n  Mr. Speaker, I spoke of Apollo 13 just a moment ago. Well, it only \ntook us 8 years, Mr. Speaker, to place a person on the Moon. Surely, \nMr. Speaker, if we can place a person on the Moon in 8 years, we can \ncomplete these projects in less than 30 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am honored at this time to yield to my colleague, who \nis a cosponsor of this piece of legislation, who serves us well in the \nCongress of the United States on the Energy and Commerce Committee, a \nreal stalwart when it comes to serving his constituents and standing up \nfor the people of our city, our county, our State and indeed our \ncountry, the honorable Gene Green.\n\n[[Page H2063]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for \nyielding to me, and I also thank him for last Friday, when I was able \nto be in your district there along Brays Bayou in the Westbury area and \nthe Meyerland area and see it.\n  That happened in your district in southwest Houston, but it also \nhappened in north Houston and east Houston. It was not as much as some \nof the tragedies in other parts of the county, but we have hundreds of \nhomes that have been flooded.\n  On April 18, the city of Houston in Harris County, Texas, was \nsubjected to paralyzing flooding that claimed the lives of our citizens \nand required the rescue of 1,200 more. Approximately 2,000 housing \nunits were flooded, and we are currently working to figure out where to \nhouse these folks who cannot return to their homes.\n  This is the second major flooding disaster Houston has experienced in \nthe last 6 months, and the city is expecting additional rain and \nthunderstorms this week. Residents of our congressional districts, as \nwell my colleagues' member districts, have been severely affected, and \nwe must stop the needless loss of life.\n  The President has recognized the significance of the catastrophe and \nfulfilled a request for disaster declaration. Now it is the job of \nCongress to help our constituents.\n\n  I have worked closely with my neighbor and friend, Representative Al \nGreen, to introduce the Tax Day Flood Supplemental Funding Act. The \nlegislation would provide $311 million to the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers for construction and, in many cases, completion of our bayous \nand flood control projects.\n  Flooding is not new in Houston, but we have learned how to control \nit. Our bayou system has saved countless lives and millions of dollars \nin damages since being created.\n  Unfortunately, due to the consistent budget pressure, the Army Corps \nof Engineers cannot adequately fund these projects that need to be \nfinished. This bill would ensure that our Federal, State, and local \nauthorities have the resources necessary to expedite the flood control \nprojects we know protect people and property.\n  Additionally, I want to make sure folks on the ground have the \ninformation they need to get back into their homes.\n  If residents are subject to flood damage, please report flood damage \nby calling 311. Download the Houston 311 app and visit Houston311.org \nto submit flood damage reports.\n  Residents must file an insurance claim with their home or their auto \ninsurance company for damages they have incurred.\n  Failure to file an insurance claim may affect your eligibility for \nthe Federal assistance because, by law, FEMA cannot provide money for \nlosses that are covered by insurance.\n  Also, it is important to know that, if Spanish-speaking households \nhave children that are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, FEMA \nwill assist you.\n  Before submitting your application, folks should have the following \ninformation ready: their Social Security number, their home and auto \ninsurance information, flood damage information, personal financial \ninformation, and personal contact information.\n  You can apply by phone for FEMA assistance. You can call 1-800-621-\n3362. Again, that is 1-800-261-FEMA, 1-800-621-3362.\n  FEMA can offer two types of assistance: housing assistance, temporary \nhousing, money to help repair or replace your primary residence.\n  Nonhousing needs include medical, dental, funeral costs, clothing, \nhousehold items, tools, home fuel, disaster-related moving and storage \nand replacement of disaster-damaged vehicles.\n  After 24 hours, you need to follow up with FEMA. A FEMA inspector \nshould contact you within 10 to 14 days.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  Mr. Speaker, we can help the victims in our neighborhoods, and we \nmust help them. I urge this body to pass this emergency funding \nlegislation so we won't have this tragedy again while we are trying to \nget people out of the water and back into their homes and back into a \nregular life.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleague for having this Special Order \ntonight. Again, our office and all our congressional offices who are \nimpacted across Houston--whether they be Republican or Democrat--are \nhere to serve you and serve our constituents. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for sharing \nthe time with us tonight. I especially thank him for coming in to the \nNinth Congressional District, his neighboring district, and being of \nassistance to my constituents because, as we do this, we really assist \neach other.\n  I would want to, if I may, magnify, amplify what the gentleman said \nabout this not being partisan. That wasn't his exact terminology, but \nthis really is not a partisan effort. This is something that impacts \npeople. Democrats and Republicans have been impacted by these storms. \nRich and poor alike have been impacted by these storms. It doesn't \nmatter what your gender is. It doesn't matter what your nationality is. \nIf you have been in Houston, Texas, when these storms have hit, you \nhave been impacted by these storms.\n  Tonight, Mr. Speaker, I do think it is appropriate that we say more \nabout these storms to give some indication as to what we have to cope \nwith in Houston, Texas. Houston, we do have a problem, but, again, we \nalso have a solution, H.R. 5025.\n  So let's say just a bit more about the problem. Let's talk about the \ndamages in terms of cost. In 2015, we had the Memorial Day flood, and \nin 2016, we had the tax day flood. I am going to compare the two, and \nin so doing, you can see not only do we have damages occasionally, it \nappears that we are starting to have these damages quite regularly.\n  The damages and costs for the 2015 Memorial Day flood: Approximately \n$3 billion in damages. Mind you now, this bill will cost $311 million. \nWe had $3 billion in damages just for the Memorial Day flood alone in \n2015. A billion is still 1,000 million--1,000 million. So we had 3,000 \nmillion dollars' worth of damages from this Memorial Day flood in 2015.\n  The tax day flood of 2016 brought us $5 billion as an estimate of \ndamages. $5 billion. All of these are estimates. Nobody knows the exact \nnumber. There was $5 billion in 2016, another $3 billion in 2015. That \nis $8 billion. Mr. Speaker, the $8 billion happens to be about 25 \ntimes--25.72 times--the $311 million.\n  The point is, why don't we spend the money upfront?\n  You have heard the phrase ``pay me now or pay me later.''\n  Why not pay the cost to prevent some of this flooding as opposed to \nthe cost of repairs after the floods have taken place?\n  It is interesting to note that these appropriation dollars that we \nare talking about are going to be spent. These are not dollars that \nwill never be spent on these projects in Houston. What we are trying to \ndo is not allow the projects to be prolonged such that other things are \nimpacted in our city. We want the projects to be completed as \nexpeditiously as possible, and there will be many more reasons why I \nwill call that to your attention in just a moment.\n  One will be deaths. With the Memorial Day flood, our research \nindicates that approximately four people were killed. Four people lost \ntheir lives in floodwaters or as a result of flooding. In 2016, with \nthe tax day flood, that number doubled to eight people losing their \nlives.\n  We have an opportunity to do something to save lives. There are other \nthings that can be done to help us save lives as well, but these \nthings, working with these projects that the Corps of Engineers already \nhas on its docket, has on its agenda, is working on, finishing these \nprojects can indeed help us to save lives.\n  Let's talk about the rainfall so that you can get some sense of how \nmuch water inundates our city. In 2015, we had 11 inches of rain. That \nis a lot. In 2016, we had 17 inches of rain. In 2016, that amounted to \nabout 240 billion gallons of rain. That is a lot of water in one place \nat one time.\n  The rescues. My colleague alluded to people being rescued. In 2015, \nwe had 531 water rescues. In 2016, 1,200 high-water rescues took place.\n  This is a good point for me, Mr. Speaker, a good place for me to \ncommend the newly elected mayor of Houston, Texas, the Honorable \nSylvester\n\n[[Page H2064]]\n\nTurner, who is doing an outstanding job, a stellar job. He just arrived \non the job, but he has really done well with the circumstances that he \nhas had to deal with, so I commend him.\n  I also would like to mention now the homes that have been damaged. In \n2015, the estimate is that about 6,000 homes were damaged with the \nMemorial Day flood. With the flood in 2016, the tax day flood--called \ntax day because it was the last day to file your income taxes. In 2016, \non tax day, we had 6,700. Seven hundred more homes approximately were \nestimated in 2016 than in 2015. As you can see, we have a problem in \nHouston.\n  Well, let's talk about vehicular damage. In Houston in 2015, the \nMemorial Day flood, we had about 10,000 vehicles damaged. 10,000. \nImagine being on your way home and you have this water to inundate the \ncity. That means that you cannot continue to traverse the city. You \nhave to take shelter. You have to stop. You try to get your water into \na place wherein you have high terrain. Unfortunately in Houston, most \nplaces are at sea level and a good many are below sea level. As a \nresult, when we have these types of conditions, we will have damages \nthat will occur, and many cars will be a part of these damages.\n  In 2015, approximately 10,000 vehicles. In 2016, approximately 40,000 \nvehicles damaged. In 2016, 40,000 vehicles. Now, if it takes about \n$10,000 per vehicle to repair these vehicles or to replace the \nvehicles, $10,000 per vehicle, that is approximately, in a hypothetical \nsense, $40 million. So the cost, Mr. Speaker, for vehicle repairs alone \nexceeds the amount that we need for the bill to take preventive \nmeasures such that we won't get as many cars in this condition. I say \nas many simply because I will reiterate what I said earlier, we will \nnever eliminate all of the flooding. We can never do enough, but we do \nhave a duty to do all that we can. We can spare a good many people from \nbeing stranded in vehicles; a good many who lose their lives, I might \nadd, as well.\n  Loss of power, meaning electrical power. In 2015, we had 88,000 \ncustomers lose power. That is a lot. 88,000 people without power. \nSurely we have had more than this in many other places. I am not saying \nthat this loss of power would in any way compare to some of our other \ncircumstances that we have had to cope with in different places in our \ncountry, but I do want you to know that this happens whenever we have \nthese conditions. So year after year after year, the number adds up \nbecause while we had 88,000 customers in 2015, in 2016 we had 123,000 \npeople lose power. We had 88,000 the year earlier; 123,000 this year. \nIt adds up.\n  Houston has a problem, but Houston has a solution. The solution is \nH.R. 5025, a bill that would accord $311 million to complete projects \nthat are already being worked on in Houston, Texas, money that is \nalready going to be spent by virtue of the projects having been \nappropriated.\n  So we have to do this. Why not do this now or as quickly as we can, \nsave lives, save money, and create jobs?\n  Let's now talk about FEMA assistance. On the Memorial Day flood of \n2015, $57 million was paid out from FEMA to persons who suffered flood \ndamages. For the tax day flood, we have yet to determine this because \nwe are still in the process of getting FEMA into the city to assist us.\n  If I may say so, I want to thank the President of the United States \nof America, the Honorable Barack Obama. I want to thank the Governor of \nthe State of Texas. I thank the Governor for immediately responding and \nasking the President to declare certain areas in the State of Texas \ndisaster areas.\n  The Houston area has been declared a disaster area. Harris County is \none of the areas so declared. Harris County happens to be, for the most \npart, within Houston, Texas. Houston is over 600 square miles. It \nliterally almost consumes Harris County.\n  So we have to realize that the Governor did a great thing, in my \nopinion. He is a Republican, by the way. And the President did a great \nthing, in my opinion. He is a Democrat, for edification purposes. These \ntwo people--one Republican, one Democrat--worked to make sure that we \nget FEMA in, that we get all of the aid that we can into the area as \nquickly as we can so that people can receive assistance.\n  There are people who are going to need shelter. It is estimated that \nout in the Greenspoint area--this is the area where my colleague, \nSheila Jackson Lee, happens to be the representative from--1,800 \napartments have flood damages. 1,800. We have got some 400 workers at \nthe time I received this intelligence out there helping to make \nrepairs. These workers are going to be paid for the jobs that they are \ndoing. That is additional cost.\n  We had more than 150 families who needed accommodations. They will \nneed these accommodations for perhaps as much as 3 weeks. This could \nend up costing us an additional $150,000. These are all costs that we \ncan mitigate, that we can reduce. We may not eliminate them, but we can \nreduce these costs.\n  In the Meyerland area, this is an area that was hit hard when we had \nthe Memorial Day flood, and now when we had this tax day flood--we are \ntalking about within a year--we have people who are just moving back \ninto their homes--just moving back into their homes--and they are \nflooded again.\n  This area and the people of this area have sent out a clarion call \nfor help. They have sent the hew and cry not only to the Congress, but \nalso to the Corps of Engineers, also to the county commissioners. They \nwant the city council, the State to do something about this problem.\n  Houston has a problem, but Houston has a solution. H.R. 5025 is that \nsolution.\n  In that Meyerland area that I am speaking of there lives a family, \nthe Tice family. I want to express my gratitude to the Tice family \nbecause when we set out to visit with people in the area and call these \nproblems to the attention on a city-wide basis by publishing these \nproblems, that Tice family opened the doors of their home to us so that \nwe could come in and meet at their home. They didn't have to do it, but \nI am appreciative that they opened the doors of their home. I am \nespecially appreciative as it relates to this family, Mr. Speaker, \nbecause this family, the Tice family, has a son who is being held \ncaptive in Syria as I speak. This family is suffering the problems \nassociated with somebody that they love dearly, their son being held \ncaptive in Syria, and they get flooded. Fortunately, this time they \nbarely escaped, but they had to do mitigation. They had to raise their \nfloors. They had to do things so that they would not get flooded.\n  I am calling on us in the Congress to please, let's help the many \nfamilies who will suffer again. This is not going to be the last time \nthat I will come to the floor with this bill if we don't get the help \nthis time. I assure you that within the foreseeable future, we will \nhave a similar circumstance.\n  How do you know, Al Green? How do you know you are going to have a \nsimilar circumstance?\n  Well, I know because between 1996 and 2014, we had 86 days of \nflooding and/or flash flooding in Houston, Harris County. That averages \nto four to five days of flooding each year. This is not--N-O-T--this is \nnot a problem that is going away.\n  We can resolve it this time with H.R. 5025 or I will be back to the \nfloor, and I will be calling this problem to our attention again; we \nwill be talking about more damages to homes; we will be talking about \ncars that have been flooded and in need of repair; and we will be \ntalking about, unfortunately--and I pray that I am entirely wrong--we \nwill be talking about lives that have been lost; and we will be talking \nabout how we could have then, how we could have now, how we could have \ndone things to avoid some of these consequences.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  These consequences can be mitigated, and it is up to us to take the \naffirmative action to do so.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank the cosponsors of this \nlegislation, H.R. 5025. Many have signed onto it. I think that, in a \nfew short days, we have nearly 50 cosponsors, and we will be asking \nothers to sign on to H.R. 5025.\n  In thanking the leadership, I am asking that we have an opportunity \nto, please, let us, at some point, either\n\n[[Page H2065]]\n\nbring the bill to the floor or let us incorporate it into some of the \nsupplemental relief that we will be according persons in the immediate \nfuture.\n  Houston has a problem, but H.R. 5025 can be a great part of the \nsolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2065-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mrs. Lawrence (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for April 26 and today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/house-section/article/H2065-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas.
