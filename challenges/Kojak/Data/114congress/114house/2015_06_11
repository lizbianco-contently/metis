The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that after 55 months in \ncontrol, my Republican friends have scheduled their first hearing on \ntransportation and finance. This is a very important, very welcome \ndevelopment, as welcome as it is long overdue. I appreciate my friend, \nPaul Ryan, the chairman of the committee, keeping his word that we \nwould actually have a hearing.\n  Now, the question is whether this is going to be one that is more or \nless perfunctory, sort of a plain vanilla, or whether it is going to be \nthe start of a critical dialogue involving not just ideologues, but the \npeople who do more than just study the issue, hear from the vast army \nof people who plan, build, maintain, and use our transportation \ninfrastructure. Theirs is a unique, shared, forceful vision. Congress \nshould spend the time not just to listen to those stakeholders, but to \nunderstand how they got to where they are and what we need to do.\n  We shouldn't settle for half steps to just get past the next \ntransportation deadline, which is looming next month, which would be \nthe 34th short-term extension. Just as bad or worse, we would fail to \ngive the country the bold transportation investment that is so sorely \nneeded.\n  The next hearings are even more important following next Wednesday's \neffort. That is the time to actually follow regular order, to debate \nreal options.\n  I have introduced a path. After 20 years of working on transportation \nfunding, it is still the simplest, the best, and the most widely \nsupported. It is the widest coalition, in fact, of any major issue \nconfronting people on Capitol Hill. It includes the AFL-CIO, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, contractors, transit, local government, \nbicyclists, engineers. It includes the AAA, representing automobile \nusers, and the American Trucking Association. They all support, for the \nfirst time in 22 years, raising the Federal gas tax.\n  We are in the problem we are in now because we are paying for 2015 \ntransportation needs with 1993 dollars. It doesn't work.\n  My approach would not just raise the gas tax, index the gas tax, but \nwork to abolish the gas tax because it is no longer a sustainable long-\nterm solution. We can, in fact, replace it with a much more viable, \neffective, fair system based on road user charges, which we are \nexperimenting with in Oregon, and States around the country are looking \nat.\n  In the meantime, we ought to step up and do our job on the gas tax. \nIt is interesting that six red States have already raised the gas tax \nthis year. If it was good enough for Eisenhower, if it was good enough \nfor Ronald Reagan, who used his Thanksgiving Day speech in 1982 to \nsummon Congress back to more than double the gas tax, which he and Tip \nO'Neill did, it ought to be good enough for us today.\n  Let's discuss, examine, and understand all the viable solutions, the \nhealth of our infrastructure, our economy, and the impacts on the \npeople we serve.\n  Whatever solution we come up with must meet three tests: It must \nraise enough to do the job of giving America its first 6-year \ntransportation bill since 1998; it must be dedicated to allow the \ncertainty to be able to build a transportation vision for the future; \nand it must be sustainable so that we don't end up back in the same \nplace in a year or 2 or 4 or even 5.\n  My legislation would provide 210 additional billion dollars, enough \nfor the transportation committee to fashion that vision for the future. \nIt is ironclad dedicated over the next 6 years, but it is sustainable \nbecause, if Congress hasn't moved to abolish the gas tax by then, at \nleast we don't fall off a cliff.\n  There was a time when America had the best infrastructure in the \nworld. Sadly, that time has passed. There was a time when \ninfrastructure used to be bipartisan. I am hopeful that if we step up \nto the plate, approach it in a bipartisan fashion, we can do the job so \nthat we start repairing infrastructure that is now rated 25th or 27th \nin the world, and going down.\n\n[[Page H4164]]\n\n  We no longer have the finest infrastructure, but we can be bipartisan \nand thoughtful. We can reverse this 20-year slide. We can put hundreds \nof thousands of people to work across America at family-wage jobs this \nyear and rebuild and renew America so our families are safer, \nhealthier, and more economically secure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4164-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WE NEED THE RIGHT TRACK, NOT THE FAST TRACK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOklahoma (Mr. Russell) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, TPA, TPP, TTIP, WTO, GATT, fast track, to \nthe American people, we have made the ability to understand trade \nrelations with other nations nigh on impossible.\n  Politicians, pundits, and prophetic economists are issuing clarion \ncalls to free trade. We all like free trade, but these same advocates \ninsist that we do it fast, you know, put it on a fast track with \n``trade promotional authority.'' Listening to these experts, they \ninsist that we cannot do trade without it. Never mind that for 160 \nyears we negotiated without it under the guide of the Constitution and \nthe watchful eye of the Representatives of the people.\n  Now, they want the negotiations to be secret: Don't worry. The trade \nagreements are complex. They will give us the final agreement, and we \nwill have a little bit of time to look it over. Can't change it. Just \nlook it over, and then you can have a simple up-or-down vote that could \nbind America to the terms of other nations.\n  ``But it will create jobs?'' they say, just like NAFTA, just like the \nworld trade agreement, just like CAFTA. We were reassured then that \nthose would fix everything. We passed them. We are still waiting for \nthose jobs.\n  Americans need to ask a few questions of us in this body before we \ncommit to something that could have decades of impact.\n  The Pacific Partnership includes a transnational commission with a \nliving agreement clause to change it. Why would we surrender \ncongressional authority of a two-thirds vote to stand guard against \nsomething that could clearly damage our laws and Nation?\n  Why would we want to isolate China, possibly driving them toward \nRussia, and create cold war II. The Army Chief of Staff saw a need this \nweek to ease tensions with China. Why would we want to increase them \nwith anti-Chinese trade rhetoric? You think military spending is high \nnow; try it in a cold war or worse. Let's trade with China instead, not \nmake them our adversary.\n  Even a partial pruning of commercial links or even a gradual upsurge \nin Western protectionism toward China would have a profound impact on \nthe world's well-being. Why would we pursue a path that most likely \ncreates tension that could spill over in other areas with devastating \nconsequences, sending ripples throughout the world?\n  The current President's talent for negotiation among nations should \nbe measured by his foreign policy. Have we forgotten the line in the \nsand, the arming of al Qaeda and other nefarious Syrian rebels to fight \nAssad, only to watch them become ISIS, and then dismiss them as a JV \nteam, only to see them tear through Iraq, which fell apart after we \nabandoned it, after we were assured that they could stand on their own \nif we left early? Now, there is no strategy to fix it. Then there is \nthe Arab Spring, which has morphed into the potential for a nuclear \nwinter with Iran. Let's not forget Crimea and Ukraine. I can go on.\n  The question is: Why are we? Like Lucy holding the football, we are \ntold that the President needs the power to negotiate. If we just come \nand take a kick at it, all will be well.\n  Much is at stake. National security, American jobs, capital, \nmanufacturing, pharmaceuticals, agricultural, and, contrary to economic \ntheorists, even American law. One only has to look at the case of \nAustralia's law that made generic packaging required on cigarettes. The \nlaw was challenged by a cigarette company who went treaty shopping by \nusing its Hong Kong subsidiary and was able to interfere with \nAustralia's law because of her treaty with Hong Kong.\n  Perhaps most concerning is all the anti-Chinese rhetoric. China is an \nenormous trading partner, a holder of large amounts of U.S. Treasury \nbonds that have kept interest rates low and our purchasing power at the \nstore high. They are not our enemy. Yet the rhetoric coming from the \nWhite House and the architects of the TPA bill seem set on anti-Chinese \ndictums to make their case.\n  We need China. China needs us. Let's establish some rules of the road \nas competitors rather than laying the track for the smashup derby. It \nwill take time, it will be hard, but dialogue and diplomacy are better \nthan tanks and Tomahawks. We can do this without turning it into a \nforeign policy disaster that gives the President and Congress a chance \nto make China our enemy.\n  We can engage without granting TPA, but we have to lead. TPA without \nleadership is less valuable than leadership without TPA. Among the \nproposed Pacific Partnership's 11 other nations, we already have high-\nstandard, free trade agreements with seven of them. We do not have to \nsubject ourselves to this multilateral trade treaty to work with them, \nand we certainly should not do it fast by granting TPA to a President \nthat has exhibited poor leadership in foreign affairs.\n  We need the right track, not the fast track.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4164-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4164-H4165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WORST TRADE AGREEMENT IN A 20-YEAR HISTORY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. DeFazio) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, the House of Representatives will \nbe asked to grease the skids for the last and worst trade agreement in \na 20-year history of job-killing trade agreements. I say ``last'' \nbecause this is a new concept. It is a living trade agreement. Anybody \ncan access to it in the future. All they have to do is say: We \npretend--or will pretend--to follow the very weak rules of this trade \nagreement.\n  When the President began the negotiations, China was concerned \nbecause he talked about the pivot to Asia, confronting China. Now China \nis saying: Hey, we want in. This is great. We know how to game it. We \ncan take away the last of your manufacturing, and we are not going to \nlet it just go to Japan who is already in the agreement.\n  The worst, for many reasons, but among them is something called the \ninvestor-state dispute resolution process. What is that? It means there \nwill be a special private court set up for corporations to challenge \nour domestic laws, any and all domestic laws, that they find to be \ntrade restrictive.\n  Now, the President came to Oregon and said those of us who are \ncritical of this are making things up because we said they can repeal \notherwise. Now, the President danced on the head of a rhetorical pin \nthere, a bit duplicitously. He is right. They can't make us repeal our \nlaws. We can pay to keep them.\n  Yes, you heard that right. We can pay to keep our laws that protect \nconsumers, and we can pay to protect our laws that protect the \nenvironment or labor or Buy America or anything else. We can keep them \nif we want to pay.\n  Here are four examples:\n  Yesterday, the House of Representatives repealed requirements that \nmeat, poultry be labeled as to country of origin. American consumers \nwould kind of like to know. We have got enough problems in our own \nindustry here. We would like to know if this stuff is coming overseas \nfrom someplace where maybe the sanitary conditions aren't quite so \ngood. Well, we lost a trade dispute on that issue.\n  Now, we could keep the law if we wanted to pay billions of dollars \nor, no, a Republican rush to repeal the law. It makes a few giant \nagribusiness companies happy. Of course, it kind of sticks it to the \ndomestic producers who know they are producing a good product. That is \none loss.\n  Brazilian cotton, now, this is a funny one. We provide these bizarre \nsubsidies through our foreign program, and one of them goes to cotton.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  We were found to be subsidizing, therefore, putting Brazil at a \ndisadvantage. For years, we paid Brazil $147 million a year so we could \nkeep subsidizing our cotton producers. Isn't that great?\n  Yeah, we kept our law; we just cost us $147 million to subsidize the \ncotton\n\n[[Page H4165]]\n\nproducers. Last year, we got a settlement out of them. They are going \nto give us a 3-year grace. We gave them a one-time $300 million \npenalty, and they won't challenge it again until 2018.\n  Now, Mexican trucks--personally involved in this one--they don't have \nmeaningful driver's licenses; they don't have hours of service \nstandards; they don't have drug testing; they don't have alcohol \ntesting, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, so we didn't want them \nranging around the United States of America. We passed a bill almost \nunanimously in the House to prevent that.\n  Mexico went to one of these secret tribunals; they won. The Obama \nadministration caved under threats of billions of dollars of punitive \ntariffs against the U.S. to allow those Mexican trucks free and \npermanent access to the highways of the United States of America.\n  You are right, we can't. You are right, Mr. President--no, you are \nnot right, Mr. President; actually, you are wrong on that one.\n  One last one, dolphin-safe tuna--now, we just wanted to say the \nMexicans go out and slaughter dolphins to catch tuna. They cast the \nnets over the dolphins who swim on top of the tuna. There are some \npeople who thought: well, hey, it would be good marketing for StarKist \nand others if we had dolphin-safe tuna, where people don't slaughter \ndolphins to get the tuna.\n  Well, Mexico won a trade dispute saying: no, you can't do that, that \nis trade restricted; you can pay us not to slaughter dolphins, or we \ncan slaughter dolphins, and you can't label those cans as dolphin-safe \ntuna.\n  Yeah, the President is sort of, kind of technically right. They can't \nforce us to repeal our laws. They can just blackmail us to repeal our \nlaws in secret tribunals.\n  Now, the ones I mentioned are under a state-to-state resolution. The \nTPP that this trade promotion authority facilitates allows corporations \nspecial standing to go to a special private secret tribunal, only \navailable to corporations, to challenge our laws.\n  Just think of the mischief in the future. One will certainly be \npharmaceuticals. Most certainly, they will challenge the requirement \nthat we negotiate lower drug prices for our veterans and people on \nMedicaid, and they will win.\n  The President is right; we won't have to repeal the subsidies for \nthose drugs or the reduced price. We can just pay the pharmaceutical \nindustry tens of billions of dollars to keep providing affordable drugs \nto veterans and seniors.\n  This is a great day for America.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Williams) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, up until several weeks ago, my State of \nTexas experienced a drought so severe that water levels were reduced to \nhistoric lows while conservation efforts were set to all-time highs. \nLakes and reservoirs were bone dry. Wildfires were a constant threat.\n  In a cruel twist of fate, Texas is now recovering from the worst \nflooding in recent memory. Rivers overflowed, and dams burst.\n  In Wimberley, Texas, a town about 40 miles southwest of the Texas \ncapital, water rushed over the banks of the Blanco River with enough \nforce to rip houses off their foundations and carry cars like they were \ntoys. Loved ones were lost. Belongings and memories were washed away.\n  The last month has been marked by death, destruction, and disbelief. \nI have met with first responders, toured flood damage, and spoke to the \nNational Guard and regional FEMA officers about response and recovery \noperations. My office established a response center in town to help \nwith the recovery process.\n  Although we are still in a period of mourning, the strong Texas \nspirit of resolve has proven more powerful than Mother Nature's fury. \nJust this week, a nearby newspaper ran the headline, ``Hard hit by \nflood, Wimberley assures tourists: We're open for business.'' I \npersonally might add ``wide open for business.''\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the Texas way; it is what we do. Today, just a \nfew weeks since the rains eased and the floodwaters subsided, Wimberley \nis making a comeback. Nearly all of the businesses in downtown \nWimberley have reopened.\n  Cathy Moreman, the executive director of the Wimberley Valley Chamber \nof Commerce, told my office they have had offers of help from around \nthe country. Locals and visitors alike have come in and out and offered \nmuch in help from rescue to cleanup efforts. She said the outpouring of \nsupport has been astounding.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is what I mean when I cite the Texas spirit of \nresolve. We have and will continue to take care of each other, look out \nfor our neighbors, and together push forward.\n  I assure you, we will rebound from this tragedy quickly and fully.\n  May God bless the residents of Wimberley, and may God bless all of \nTexas.\n  In God we trust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4165-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            KING KAMEHAMEHA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nHawaii (Ms. Gabbard) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, today, in my home State of Hawaii, we are \ncelebrating King Kamehameha Day to honor the legacy of King Kamehameha \nI, who established the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1810.\n  King Kamehameha knew that for a nation to be vibrant, its citizens \nmust feel safe and secure. He proclaimed the Kanawai Mamalahoe, the Law \nof the Splintered Paddle, as the law of the land. This law, still \nenshrined in the Hawaii State Constitution today, protects the \nunalienable rights of all men and women to be safe and secure in their \nhome.\n  Kamehameha also knew that, to ensure the health, safety, and welfare \nof his people, it was imperative to create economic opportunities. He \ninvested resources to maintain viable fish ponds and taro patches, \nprotect freshwater streams, fertile soils, and forestlands; he built \nschools and trained an entire new generation of leaders.\n  As we observe Kamehameha Day, it is a true day of aloha for the \npeople of Hawaii. Those who are visiting the Capitol this week may have \nseen the many fragrant and beautiful flower leis draped on the statue \nof King Kamehameha in Emancipation Hall.\n  All this week, in Hawaii, across the State, there will be further \nlei-draping ceremonies taking place to pay homage to the legacy of \nHawaii's first King.\n  As legislators, we are called upon to embody the servant leadership \nand the humility of leaders like King Kamehameha I.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4165-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4165-H4166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          IRS RESPONSE LETTER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the IRS response \nletter that was sent to me and 51 of my colleagues asking for an \ninvestigation of the Clinton Foundation's tax-exempt status.\n  Now, the IRS responded to us with a letter. It is dated May 21. What \nwe received back, Mr. Speaker, from the IRS was simply a form letter. \nIt was addressed, ``Dear Sir or Madam,'' not even my name. The director \nof the Exempt Organizations Examinations didn't even take the time to \nsign the letter.\n  What we have is this: the IRS has so little respect for Members of \nCongress who are asking a question, who are seeking clarity on behalf \nof their constituents, that they respond to a congressional inquiry \nwith a letter that is a form letter, not even signed. Well, you can \nimagine that we were a little bit surprised by this.\n  I think it is important to talk about why we were asking for clarity \non the Clinton Foundation and their tax-exempt status. We all have \n501(c)(3) not-for-profit organizations that do great work in our \ncommunities. Many of these organizations had come to us--their Member \nof Congress--and said: What do you know about how the Clinton \nFoundation works? What about\n\n[[Page H4166]]\n\nthese foreign donations that are coming into the Clinton Foundation?\n  We were continuing to look at this because when you go to \ncharitynavigator.org, which many of our colleagues or our constituents \nwould do, and you pull up, you enter in the search engine ``the Bill, \nHillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation,'' what comes up is this:\n\n       We don't evaluate Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton \n     Foundation. Why not? We have determined that this charity's \n     atypical business model cannot be accurately captured in our \n     current rating methodology.\n\n  How interesting is that; how very interesting. The American people \nare wanting to know how this charity keeps a not-for-profit status and \nhow they conduct business. It is appropriate that we write the IRS and \nask for clarity on this situation, doing it on behalf of our \nconstituents who are seeking answers to questions.\n  Now, I have to tell you, we know that there is no shortage of pens in \nthe executive branch of this government. The President has said he has \ngot a pen and a phone and he will work around Congress if he needs to. \nWe understand that.\n  We know they have pens over at the IRS. We know that they have just \nchosen to dismiss what we have asked for, which is clarity. We have a \ndivided government; we have a system of checks and balances, and we do \nexpect to have a response from the IRS that addresses the structure of \nthis organization.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are going to continue to follow this issue.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nOregon (Ms. Bonamici) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, recently, I visited Warrenton High School \nin a small coastal community in my district in beautiful northwest \nOregon.\n  I met with students who were working on an underwater robotics team. \nThese talented students are running simulation experiments in a pool in \npreparation for the Marine Advanced Technology Education competition.\n  This year, students were asked to maneuver their underwater robots to \nretrieve items like algae and sea urchins from the ocean floor. This \nhands-on learning fosters collaboration and creativity in students and \nhelps them see the connections between what is in their textbook and \nhow it translates to practical work that can make a difference for our \nplanet.\n  Perhaps more importantly, this kind of activity builds problem-\nsolving skills and shows students that trial and error is a natural \npart of growth and discovery and learning.\n  After visiting the underwater robotics team, I joined students at \ntheir school's fish hatchery, where they raise salmon for release into \nlocal waterways. This program provides opportunities for students to \ndevelop skills in biology, water chemistry, engineering, and natural \nresources management and contributes to our ability to sustain an \neconomically and culturally important fishery; importantly, it also \ngives them valuable skills and leadership in management.\n  In the United States, we face a growing shortage of innovative \nworkers, people who are prepared to tackle the challenges of the \nfuture. This is an especially serious problem because we absolutely \nmust grapple with one of the greatest environmental threats this Nation \nhas faced, climate change.\n  Today, too many students, particularly young women and minorities, \nlack access and opportunities to engage in this hands-on kind of STEM \nlearning occurring at Warrenton High School. Here in Congress, we must \nbe doing more to foster and support students who have become the \nproblem-solvers of tomorrow. Doing so makes economic sense and \nenvironmental sense.\n  We need smart, passionate students to help understand environmental \nchallenges and changes, to develop the technology to address our \ngrowing impact on our planet, and to find more sustainable practices.\n  Oregon is home to some excellent research universities. The \nUniversity of Oregon, Oregon State University, and Oregon Health & \nScience University are all working on a wide range of research and \ndevelopment programs to help combat and adapt to climate change.\n  These universities are conducting the basic science we need to \nunderstand and anticipate changes and trends, as well as the applied \nscience to help use existing information to develop practical tools and \ntechnologies to meet the challenges presented by climate change.\n  They model changes caused by sea level rise; they help shellfish \nhatcheries adapt to ocean acidification, or they develop new types of \nbiofuel. This is exciting, important research; and we need smart, \npassionate young people to take up this mantle.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  June is National Oceans Month. This month, we recognize the value of \nour oceans, lakes, and coastline, and we recommit to protecting these \nbodies of water.\n  I would also like to recommit to developing and investing in \ntechnologies to help stop and begin to repair the damage we have done \nto our oceans, our coasts, and our ecosystems. Improved and innovative \ntechnology development in areas such as renewable energy and water \nconservation have the power to make a real difference for our planet \nand for current and future generations, but we can't do it without \npeople like smart, skilled students who will become the workers in the \nworkforce of tomorrow.\n  Those students in Warrenton, Oregon, and others like them are our \nfuture leaders and problem-solvers. Let's help do all we can to make \nsure that they have the tools and the resources they need today as \nstudents and tomorrow as scientists, engineers, and innovators who can \nmeet the complex challenges ahead and turn them into productive \nopportunities that will better their communities, their States, our \ncountry, and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4166-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4166-H4167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HIPAA CHANGES IN THE HELPING FAMILIES IN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Murphy) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as part of my 3-year \ninvestigation into the Nation's mental health system, I have been \nmeeting with families and caregivers of those with mental illness. \nTheir number one concern is the HIPAA privacy rule. Since its inception \nin 2002, the rule has generated nearly 70,000 complaints.\n  Families are locked out from helping in treatment by Federal \nregulations that don't understand the complexity of treating a serious \nmental illness in someone who has other medical problems, like diabetes \nor lung disease or skin problems or other illnesses that require \ntreatment. When you have those with the diminished capacity to follow \nthrough on their own care, should we just let them languish and suffer? \nShould we let their mental illness and poor medical care become what \nsome consider to be a slow-motion suicide?\n\n[[Page H4167]]\n\n  If a family member has a head injury or a stroke or Alzheimer's \nillness, a doctor would not hesitate to explain the medical concerns to \na family member. A doctor would do this because the doctor recognizes \nthe brain illness can make the individual unable to clearly understand \nthe severity of his illness. According to the current HIPAA laws, when \na child is in severe psychosis, the doctor is unable to tell the \nparents anything.\n  We must recognize that severe mental illness like schizophrenia, \nbipolar, and severe depression is brain disease--it is not an attitude. \nIt is not something cured by pulling oneself up by the bootstraps no \nmore than dementia is cured by a different outlook on life or by a \nmotivational poster. We cannot continue to make care the most difficult \nfor those who have the most difficulty in caring for themselves. This \nhas to change. There is merit to those 70,000 complaints, and we must \naddress them compassionately.\n  The Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, H.R. 2646, allows \nthe doctor or mental health professional to provide the diagnosis, \ntreatment plans, appointment scheduling, and prescriptions for an \nindividual with a serious mental illness to a known caregiver. This \nchange would apply to those who can benefit from care yet who are \nunable to follow through on their own self-directed care.\n  Put yourself in the shoes of a family member. Imagine yourself trying \nto help a parent or a sibling or a child, and a caseworker who doesn't \neven know your family member can't help you because he is bound from \nletting you--a loving and caring parent--help your son or daughter. The \nlaw puts you behind this heartless barrier where you have to passively \nwatch your child wither away. But what parent would not run into a \nburning building or throw himself in front of a car to save his child? \nYet, with our current HIPAA laws, you have to watch and suffer along \nwith your child.\n  We have to change this, and H.R. 2646 does make this important \nchange. My legislation does not allow for the sharing of psychotherapy \nnotes or of personal conversations between a therapist and a patient. \nIt is limited to the information that is essential to caring for \nsomeone with a serious mental illness to make sure he stays in care. \nLet's make it easier. Let's make it more compassionate for those who \nneed help the most. I urge my colleagues to please support H.R. 2646 \nand to sign on as cosponsors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4167-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GENESIS WITH REVELATIONS YET TO COME\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Al Green) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is always a preeminent \nprivilege to stand in the well of the House of Representatives to \nadvocate on behalf of my constituents in the Ninth Congressional \nDistrict of Texas, but it is also a greater honor to advocate on behalf \nof the American people. I contend that no one could have predicted that \nI would have had this great opportunity at my birth, and I am always \ngrateful to have it, and I want people to know that I appreciate it \ngreatly.\n  Mr. Speaker, last night, the House of Representatives passed a \nbipartisan piece of legislation, H. Res. 295. This is a resolution that \nwould encourage law enforcement agencies to use body cameras. It passed \noverwhelmingly, and I am here today to express my gratitude to the many \nMembers who supported this piece of legislation.\n  I would like to start with the leadership. I am honored that the \nleadership supported it because, without the support of leadership, \nlegislation does not come to the floor.\n  Mr. Boehner, I am grateful that you supported and allowed it to come \nto the floor.\n  Ms. Pelosi, I am grateful that you supported and allowed it to come \nto the floor.\n  Mr. Hoyer, I am honored that we had the opportunity to visit with you \nabout it as well as with other members of leadership, including Mr. \nBoehner, and that you allowed it to come to the floor.\n  I also want to mention the chair of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. \nGoodlatte. He allowed us to visit with him about this legislation. We \nare grateful that he participated in the process and allowed it to come \nto the floor.\n  I am also especially honored to mention Mr. Conyers, the sage of the \nHouse of Representatives, the dean of the House of Representatives, and \nI am grateful that he has been understanding and has given us the \nopportunity to have this piece of legislation come to the floor in the \nform of a resolution.\n  There were Members who supported this, and they were cosponsors. I \nhave to mention my very dear friend Mr. Cleaver. I will say candidly \nthat, without him, we wouldn't have been able to have succeeded. He has \nbeen a partner with me on this legislation, and we have worked through \nthe entirety of the process.\n  I will mention Mr. Ted Poe from Texas. He and I were lawyers \ntogether, and we were judges together. He was the first person to \nactually sign onto the resolution, and that meant something to have his \nsupport.\n  Mr. Poe, I am grateful that you signed on as the first original \ncosponsor, and my prayer is that this piece of legislation is something \nthat you will be proud of in the years to come.\n  Mr. Luetkemeyer signed onto it, Mr. Lacy Clay, Mr. Yoder, and Ms. \nClarke--all persons who were original cosponsors of the legislation. I \nam grateful that they chose to allow their names to be associated with \nit, and I am grateful to all of the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives who voted for it, some 421 Members.\n  Let me now just focus on the legislation for just a moment and remind \neverybody that this, in a metaphorical sense, is not the end; it is the \nbeginning. In a metaphorical sense, it is not the closing argument as \nwe might have in a trial; it is the opening statement. As a Christian, \nin a metaphorical sense, this is Genesis; it is not Revelation. There \nare many other things to come. In fact, we have a piece of \nlegislation--the CAM TIP Act--that is currently pending before the \nHouse, and my hope is that we will get some additional cosponsors on \nthat piece of legislation.\n  As for this piece of legislation, let me announce that what it does \nis to simply provide encouragement to law enforcement agencies to know \nthat the consensus of the House of Representatives is that you have \nbody cameras. We ask that you please consider the rationale for body \ncameras.\n  One, transparency. This means that there won't be disputes about what \nhappened. With cameras, you can still have some disputes. This is not a \npanacea; it will not cure all that ails some of our concerns. Yet it \ndoes provide some empirical evidence, empirical evidence that we would \nnot acquire otherwise because of the contentions that can be at odds \nwith each other about facts. By the way, as a judge, I know that you \ncan have persons with the best of intentions who can see the same facts \nand come away with different conclusions as to what occurred. This \nprovides the additional transparency.\n  It also provides an opportunity for us to allow this evidence to go \ninto court. It is not enough for the public to see what is going on. \nThose who serve as jurors will have an opportunity to see what happened \nand base their decisions on more than what one person says as opposed \nto what another person says.\n  I am proud to tell you that the piece of legislation will provide an \nopportunity for people to adjust their behavior. A wonderful thing can \nhappen when cameras are on. People will know that they are being \nwatched, and they can adjust their behavior.\n  I am so honored that the legislation has passed, and I am grateful \nfor the opportunity to speak this morning. I thank those who were \nsupportive of it. This is the genesis. The revelations are yet to come.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to support Gustavo \nPerez Silverio, an historian in Cuba who has had to endure continued \nthreats from Castro's state security forces.\n\n[[Page H4168]]\n\n  This week, Castro's thugs threatened Gustavo Perez Silverio by \ntelling him that he would be prosecuted for terrorist activities, but \nhis only crime was to support activism and engagement in Cuban civil \nsociety. That is not a crime. This is not the first time he has had to \nendure these dire threats.\n  While in the United States last year, Gustavo issued statements about \nthe current difficult situation in Cuba for human rights, but when he \nreturned to the island, he learned that he lost his job as a professor \nat the university where he was teaching. This is another attempt by the \nCastro regime to silence peaceful opposition leaders.\n  We cannot let this continue. What is happening to Gustavo happens to \ndozens of Cubans every day, innocent but brave dissidents who try to \nspeak the truth about the human rights violations occurring in Cuba, \nviolations that go unpunished due to the undeserved concessions given \nto the Castro brothers by this administration.\n  Let's stand with the oppressed, the brave dissidents like Gustavo \nPerez Silverio, and not stand with their oppressor, the Castro regime.\n\n\n                              Claudia Puig\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to honor Claudia Puig, a \nleader in television and radio broadcasting, on her receipt of the Bill \nBrooks Award from the Florida Association of Broadcasters.\n  Claudia is a prominent figure in our south Florida community, and \nwith over 25 years of experience, her opinion is trusted and credible. \nClaudia has been recognized by Radio Ink magazine as one of the 50 Most \nInfluential Women in Radio and has been honored as Manager of the Year \nwith the prestigious Medallas de Cortez Award in 2012. Claudia has \nserved on many prestigious boards, including Florida International \nUniversity's Board of Trustees, the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting, and the Orange Bowl Committee.\n  For those of us who know her, the Bill Brooks Award is a deserved \nhonor and a testament to her hard work.\n  Congratulations, Claudia. I wish you many more years of continued \nsuccess.\n\n\n                  22nd Anniversary of Amigos for Kids\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Amigos \nfor Kids, an organization in my congressional district that works to \nmitigate the harmful effects of child abuse and neglect. It has now \nembarked on its 22nd year of service to families in my congressional \ndistrict in south Florida.\n  As part of its mission, this noble organization, Amigos for Kids, \nadministers an afterschool program at Jose Marti Park in Little Havana \nthat provides kids with academic and extracurricular enrichment \nactivities. Funded by the Children's Trust, Amigos for Kids also offers \nworkshops to fortify the family bond. On June 20, Amigos for Kids will \nhost its annual Miami Celebrity Domino Night. It is an event at which \nguests will enjoy live entertainment and culinary delights, which will \nbenefit these kids.\n  I thank Amigos for Kids for its commitment to assisting the less \nfortunate, and I encourage our community to get involved for the \nbetterment of children and families.

Mr. Speaker, June is Alzheimer's Awareness Month, \nand I rise today to shed light on one of the fastest growing and \ncostliest epidemics facing our Nation. Having lost my mother due to \ncomplications of Alzheimer's, I am all too familiar with how it impacts \nnot only the person, but the person's loved ones and the caregivers.\n  Over 5.3 million Americans are living with this disease, including \nhalf a million Floridians. The Alzheimer's Association projects that, \nwithin the next 10 years, every State will experience significant \nincreases in the number of people living with Alzheimer's. That means \nskyrocketing healthcare costs for impacted families and across all \nlevels of government.\n  Research is our best hope to save taxpayer dollars, and most \nimportantly, to save lives. My thanks to all who are working every day \ntoward curing Alzheimer's, a devastating disease. I also thank them for \nimproving the patient's well-being and the caregiver's.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4168-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4168-H4169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased this morning to speak \nabout a topic that I really believe there is a strong pathway forward. \nI have said often, as the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, that as we look at \nthe criminal justice system with a myriad of issues that have come to \nour attention from the American public, from asset forfeiture to mens \nrea to a number of issues dealing with police interaction with the \ncommunity, this is a significant moment in America's history.\n  We are a nation of laws, and we pride ourselves with understanding \nthe very words of the Declaration of Independence that clearly says \nthat we all are created equal with certain inalienable rights of life \nand liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The beginning words of the \nConstitution say that our Founding Fathers--although imperfect in many \nof the aspects of the Constitution based upon rights not given to women \nand rights not given to African Americans--did say that they formed \nthis government to create a more perfect Union.\n  Now, in 2015, we have an opportunity, again, as I said, to assess the \ncriminal justice system in many ways. Let me cite for you some of the \nchallenges that we face. For example, a 16-year-old in New York who was \narrested for taking a knapsack--he shouldn't have taken a knapsack--was \nthrown into Rikers Island and had a $3,000 bail, which he or his family \ncould not pay. He stayed in isolation for 3 years. His case never came \nbefore the courts. The lawyers obviously were backlogged, whatever \ncourt-appointed lawyer he might have had. During that time, there was \nabuse, and this youngster suffered. At 19 going on 20, he was finally \nreleased, no action taken against him. Tragically, 2 weeks after he was \nreleased, this young man committed suicide.\n  We understand the brain does not mature to its fullest before the age \nof 24 or 25, and so when you are dealing with teenagers between 18 and \n24, you are dealing with kids. You are dealing with individuals who \nhave yet formulated their full judgment.\n  These incidents, along with the cases of Walter Scott and Freddie \nGray, begin to have us question how we make better our law enforcement. \nAs we mourn those who have fallen in duty--and we do, as I have over \nthe years--I recognize that we must give skills training and give more \nresources for professional development and change the concept that we \nhave forced our law enforcement to be in.\n  We have forced the concept of warrior versus guardian. Maybe that \ncaused the incident of the gentleman who was in his doorstep in \nsuburban Virginia, right outside of Washington, D.C. I think the case \nwas 3 years ago where the gentleman came to the door. Of course he was \nhaving a disagreement with the officer who was at the door, but he \nwound up dead in his doorstep. Of course the family settled because \nthere was, in essence, an inappropriate use of excessive force and it \ndid not have to happen.\n  As we work in the Committee on the Judiciary and work with Members, I \nam looking forward to finding a significant moment. We will be \nintroducing legislation dealing with police accountability--we hope it \nwill draw a number of Members' bipartisan support--using this concept \nof guardian versus warrior, giving the amount of resources for \ntraining, but also giving the necessary equipment that will be helpful, \nnew technology, and a criteria utilized by small departments that will \nallow them to get a rating of having a police force that meets certain \nstandards to know how to deal with the elderly, to know how to deal \nwith the physically and mentally disabled, how to deal with juveniles, \nhow to deal with women. Certainly we know that bad actors and those who \nare tending to do us harm, we are ultimately concerned that we have \nvery safe communities.\n  I hope that as we confront this that the sheer shrillness of dealing \nwith criminal justice will be put aside so that we can studiously get a \nbill to the\n\n[[Page H4169]]\n\nPresident's desk, we can get a bill about youth offenders that I will \nintroduce, a bill about building trust, which means that we don't force \ncommunities to use police officers as revenue gatherers, so it is not \nabout how many we stop on the street or how many we give tickets to to \nprovide money to the coffers of our local community. That puts the \npolice sometimes in unnecessary confrontational roles when they could \nvery well be engaging in warnings or other ways of dealing with the \ncommunity. I would like to enhance PAL, the Police Athletic League, an \nexcellent community-based approach to police and children getting to \nknow each other. Many things can happen.\n  This is a significant moment that captures the constitutional premise \nthat we want to create a more perfect Union.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4169-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, chained to a bed in a warehouse, \nbranded like cattle, these are just some of the horrific stories that I \nhave heard from young girls who suffered as victims of human \ntrafficking in my home State of Texas.\n  Human trafficking is modern-day slavery. Sadly, according to the \nNational Human Trafficking Resource Center, Texas has the second \nhighest number of reported instances of human trafficking in the \ncountry. My hometown of Houston is the hub for domestic trafficking of \nminor children.\n  While this dastardly underground industry has been hidden for years \nin plain sight, the good news is there are efforts to fight this \nscourge of human trafficking throughout the Nation. Earlier this week \nSenator Cornyn and I had the opportunity to visit the Letot Center in \nDallas, Texas, where we saw firsthand what can happen when government, \nlaw enforcement, nonprofits, concerned citizens, and religious groups \njoin together in a community to restore the lives of human trafficking \nvictims.\n  We were joined by advocates from the nonprofit New Friends New Life, \nan organization that provides job training, financial assistance, life \nskills coaching, and special programs to address the challenges of \nsurvivors and their families. With the addition of a brand-new all-\nfemale facility, the Letot Center and groups like New Friends New Life \nnot only provide a safe home for trafficking victims, but help arm them \nwith the resources to rebuild their lives.\n  One remarkable young lady that we met--I will call her Amanda because \nthat is her name--became a victim of human trafficking after she was \nkidnapped in Dallas at the age of 15. For 9 years she lived in slavery, \nin terror, as she was repeatedly sold every day for sex.\n  Through New Friends New Life's approach, one that addresses the \nphysical, mental, and spiritual needs of victims, Amanda was rescued, \nand she and her daughter are now living proof that there is hope for \ntrafficking survivors fighting abuse, addiction, and poverty. After \ntalking to her and hearing her story and she making her story public, \nMr. Speaker, she is a remarkable person--a survivor, a fighter against \nthe scourge of slavery.\n  As a former judge, as you are, Mr. Speaker, I strongly believe in not \nonly punishing people who commit crimes, but also helping victims \nrebuild their lives. As a father of 4, grandfather of 11, I call upon \nall other fathers in the United States to refuse to sit back while \nAmerica's children are being sold in the marketplace of sex. We have a \nresponsibility, not just as Members of the House or the Senate, but as \nfathers, to fight this scourge that is taking place in our country.\n  That is why, in the Senate, Senator Cornyn and, in the House, Carolyn \nMaloney and I authored the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act: to \nprovide law enforcement with new tools to apprehend those who commit \nthese crimes and to provide resources for restoration for the \nsurvivors.\n  It is very encouraging that the House of Representatives and the \nUnited States Senate recently passed the Victims of Trafficking Act. It \npassed the Senate 99-0. It passed the House overwhelmingly, with only \nthree voting against it. That very seldom happens in my experience in \nCongress, where one piece of legislation is so overwhelmingly supported \nby both sides of the aisle and in both the Senate and the House. This \nbipartisan bill has been signed into law by the President now.\n  Under this legislation, a special fund will be created to help these \nvictims like Amanda get the shelter and services they need and provide \nthem a fresh start. The law also ensures those who have been sold into \nslavery are treated as victims and not treated as criminals. Moreover, \nthe legislation will strengthen law enforcement to give them tools to \ntake down all human traffickers and organized criminal networks \nsupporting them. Finally, the law targets the buyers, those predators \nwho purchase children in the marketplace.

Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, \nPresident Obama admitted that he does not have a complete strategy to \nfight ISIL, which he belittled as junior varsity, putting American \nfamilies at risk. The President should change course to prevent more \nfailed foreign policies.\n  Under his watch, the victory he cited in Iraq has evolved into the \nbeheading of Americans and mass murder of Muslims by ISIL/Daesh. Safe \nhavens exist to murder Americans worldwide.\n  Under his watch, Syria crossed his red line when it used chemical \nweapons to kill opposition yet faced no consequences. Iran continues \nwith nuclear weapons development, building intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles to achieve their goal of death to Israel, death to America.\n  Under his watch, Putin's regime invaded Ukraine, leaving over 7,000 \ndead, and extremists threaten American allies from the Baltics to \ncentral and southeastern Europe.\n  Under his watch, murder and kidnappings have swept Libya, Nigeria, \nYemen, and Kenya, which the President should address with peace through \nstrength.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President by his \nactions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4170-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HIGHWAY TRUST FUND DEADLINE\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY.

Tyler and Megan both used their \nanalytical skills that they learned in their investments class at \nWayzata High School, taught by their teacher, Candy Lee.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Financial and Economic Literacy \nCaucus, I believe our youth need more opportunities to learn how to \neffectively manage money in order to plan and achieve their financial \ngoals.

I represent the Port of Los Angeles, \nand I understand the potential benefits of a good trade deal. But I am \nalso pro-worker, pro-environment, pro-immigration reform, pro-human \nrights and pro-food safety.\n  These goals, I believe, would be undermined by this fast-track \nlegislation that limits our President's ability to negotiate those \ncritical issues. Moreover, if the President gets fast-track authority, \nthen our only role as Members of Congress would be an up-or-down vote \non the final deal, limited debate, no amendments.\n  We cannot afford another bad trade deal.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 800th \nanniversary of one of the world's most important documents, the Magna \nCarta.\n  On June 15, 1215, King John added his seal to the Magna Carta after \nit was drafted by barons in England who were tired of continued attacks \non their freedoms and rights by a tyrannical king.\n  The Magna Carta, which is Latin for ``the great charter,'' \nestablished the rule of law in England and served as an inspiration for \nthe American revolution and the basis for the Declaration of \nIndependence and our Bill of Rights.\n  As Thomas Paine said in 1776: ``In free countries, the law ought to \nbe king; and there ought to be no other.''\n  Mr. Speaker, it seems that far too often our problem is we don't \nfully understand our history, and that is why we stray from it.\n  We are currently dealing with a President who has shown a willingness \nto change the laws through executive fiat. I believe it is vitally \nimportant that we remember the Magna Carta, which is based on the idea \nthat no person, regardless of their position, will ever be above the \nlaw.\n  People from all over the world have fought for centuries in order to \npreserve and defend this basic principle, and that fight can never end. \nSo on this 800th anniversary, I call on this body to remember the Magna \nCarta and work every day to carry forward the torch of freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4170-7", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4170-H4171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HELPING CONSUMERS ACHIEVE CAR OWNERSHIP\n\n  (Mr. GUINTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of cutting the \nbureaucratic red tape strangling our Nation's small businesses.\n  In 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau implemented \nguidance that would prevent families and individuals from obtaining \nauto financing discounts. The CFPB issued this guidance without a \npublic comment period for consumers, small businesses, or stakeholders.\n\n[[Page H4171]]\n\n  This guidance not only affects the American auto industry and the \nhundreds of hard-working auto dealers in the Granite State; but it also \naffects Granite State families and individuals, for example, the young \ncouple in Manchester struggling to afford a new minivan to accommodate \ntheir growing family or the startup logistics company in Conway wishing \nto add another truck to their fleet to grow their business.\n  The detrimental aspects of this onerous regulation are felt \nthroughout our State and our Nation. That is why I introduced H.R. \n1737, a bipartisan bill to rein in the CFPB's overreach and merely \nbring more transparency, accountability, and clarity to the formal \nrulemaking process. It will reverse the CFPB's indirect auto financing \nguidance and allow the public's voice to be heard.\n  This bill has 49 Republican cosponsors and 40 Democrat cosponsors. I \nlook forward to working with all those interested in continuing to \nreverse this rule.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4171-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TWO BROTHERS, ONE JOURNEY\n\n  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. WALBERG.

However, without knowing him well, you \nwould never guess the rest of his life story.\n  Born in Dickinson, New York, in 1923, Ed joined the Army at the age \nof 17.

Res. 56.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4172-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PERMISSION TO MODIFY ORDER OF HOUSE OF JUNE 10, 2015, REGARDING \n  CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1295, IRS BUREAUCRACY REDUCTION AND JUDICIAL \n                               REVIEW ACT\n\n  Mr. BYRNE.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since its enactment, the African Growth and Opportunity \n     Act has been the centerpiece of trade relations between the \n     United States and sub-Saharan Africa and has enhanced trade, \n     investment, job creation, and democratic institutions \n     throughout Africa.\n       (2) Trade and investment, as facilitated by the African \n     Growth and Opportunity Act, promote economic growth, \n     development, poverty reduction, democracy, the rule of law, \n     and stability in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (3) Trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa \n     has more than tripled since the enactment of the African \n     Growth and Opportunity Act in 2000, and United States direct \n     investment in sub-Saharan Africa has grown almost six-fold.\n       (4) It is in the interest of the United States to engage \n     and compete in emerging markets in sub-Saharan African \n     countries, to boost trade and investment between the United \n     States and sub-Saharan African countries, and to renew and \n     strengthen the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n       (5) The long-term economic security of the United States is \n     enhanced by strong economic and political ties with the \n     fastest-growing economies in the world, many of which are in \n     sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (6) It is a goal of the United States to further integrate \n     sub-Saharan African countries into the global economy, \n     stimulate economic development in Africa, and diversify \n     sources of growth in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (7) To that end, implementation of the Agreement on Trade \n     Facilitation of the World Trade Organization would strengthen \n     regional integration efforts in sub-Saharan Africa and \n     contribute to economic growth in the region.\n       (8) The elimination of barriers to trade and investment in \n     sub-Saharan Africa, including high tariffs, forced \n     localization requirements, restrictions on investment, and \n     customs barriers, will create opportunities for workers, \n     businesses, farmers, and ranchers in the United States and \n     sub-Saharan African countries.\n       (9) The elimination of such barriers will improve \n     utilization of the African Growth and Opportunity Act and \n     strengthen regional and global integration, accelerate \n     economic growth in\n\n[[Page H4173]]\n\n     sub-Saharan Africa, and enhance the trade relationship \n     between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n     SEC. 103.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since its enactment, the African Growth and Opportunity \n     Act has been the centerpiece of trade relations between the \n     United States and sub-Saharan Africa and has enhanced trade, \n     investment, job creation, and democratic institutions \n     throughout Africa.\n       (2) Trade and investment, as facilitated by the African \n     Growth and Opportunity Act, promote economic growth, \n     development, poverty reduction, democracy, the rule of law, \n     and stability in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (3) Trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa \n     has more than tripled since the enactment of the African \n     Growth and Opportunity Act in 2000, and United States direct \n     investment in sub-Saharan Africa has grown almost six-fold.\n       (4) It is in the interest of the United States to engage \n     and compete in emerging markets in sub-Saharan African \n     countries, to boost trade and investment between the United \n     States and sub-Saharan African countries, and to renew and \n     strengthen the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n       (5) The long-term economic security of the United States is \n     enhanced by strong economic and political ties with the \n     fastest-growing economies in the world, many of which are in \n     sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (6) It is a goal of the United States to further integrate \n     sub-Saharan African countries into the global economy, \n     stimulate economic development in Africa, and diversify \n     sources of growth in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (7) To that end, implementation of the Agreement on Trade \n     Facilitation of the World Trade Organization would strengthen \n     regional integration efforts in sub-Saharan Africa and \n     contribute to economic growth in the region.\n       (8) The elimination of barriers to trade and investment in \n     sub-Saharan Africa, including high tariffs, forced \n     localization requirements, restrictions on investment, and \n     customs barriers, will create opportunities for workers, \n     businesses, farmers, and ranchers in the United States and \n     sub-Saharan African countries.\n       (9) The elimination of such barriers will improve \n     utilization of the African Growth and Opportunity Act and \n     strengthen regional and global integration, accelerate \n     economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, and enhance the trade \n     relationship between the United States and sub-Saharan \n     Africa.\n\n     SEC. 103.

Pursuant to the order of the House of \nWednesday, June 10, 2015, as modified by the order of the House of \ntoday, the motion shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and \ncontrolled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on \nWays and Means.\n  The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Rangel) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n\n[[Page H4211]]\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1295, the Trade \nPreferences Extension Act of 2015, currently under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of the Trade Preferences Extension \nAct. This bill will strengthen America by promoting free enterprise all \naround the world. First, we extend the African Growth and Opportunity \nAct for 10 years. AGOA allows African countries to sell their goods in \nAmerica duty free. This program is a very essential program. It \nstrengthens ties between our countries because when America grows, they \ngrow too.\n  I also want to thank Congressman Rangel for his work on this. He is \nthe champion of AGOA. He is one of the primary authors of AGOA, and he \nis the person who has done so much work throughout his career--having \nbeen chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, a leader in the \ncommittee--to help forge better ties between the nations of Africa and \nour country and to help the rising tide lift all of the boats, so I \nwant to thank him for his leadership on this issue.\n  Second, we renew the Generalized System of Preferences through \nDecember 2017. GSP lowers duties on thousands of products around the \ndeveloping world. We make a few changes in the bill, and I want to \narticulate those changes.\n  We make eligible for GSP things like purses, briefcases, and \nbackpacks, but only after they receive extensive review and only if \nthey are found to be nonimport sensitive. This is a trade bill, so \nthere are lots of things like this in trade bills.\n  The purpose of all of this is to give American consumers access to \nbetter products at better prices, to help grow the economies of America \nand the countries we are trading with in the developing world.\n  We create a new tariff line for recreational performance outerwear, \nouterwear that is not made here, but that we buy that is needlessly \nmore expensive for consumers. We lower duties on things like hiking and \nrunning shoes.\n  I also want to thank Congressman Blumenauer and Congressman Reichert \nfor their work on performance outerwear and footwear. I also want to \nthank Congressman Smith and Congressman Crenshaw from Florida for their \nwork on luggage. All of these programs have strong bipartisan support \nand say to the developing world: free enterprise, free enterprise is \nthe way to go. That is the key to success. That is the key to upward \nmobility.\n  Third, we extend the HOPE and the HELP programs for products in Haiti \nfor 10 years. These programs build up Haiti through trade and \ninvestment. That is the best kind of foreign aid and support you can \nhave: more economic growth, more trade, more investment. They can \ncreate more opportunity and bring our countries closer together. That \nis why it is critical that we continue these programs.\n  Finally, I would like to say a word about the offsets in this bill. \nThis bill will eliminate the Medicare sequester extension that was in \nthe TAA bill, and in exchange it will set up stronger tax compliance \nlaws. We have reached a bipartisan compromise here. This fixes the \nconcerns that Members on both sides of the aisle, particularly on the \nRepublican side, the Doctors Caucus as we call it, had about the \nMedicare sequester, and it removes the Medicare sequester.\n  These are commonsense programs that are fully paid for. I urge all of \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the legislation. It \npassed with a huge bipartisan margin over in the Senate, and I hope and \nexpect that it will do so, as well, here.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RANGEL. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, this is more than just a trade bill. I want \nto thank Chairman Ryan for making certain that this did not come \nanywhere near the controversies that surround us in the trade area, \nwhich he could have done; but he made certain that this extension of \nAGOA, the support for Haiti, and also the GSP would not be surrounded \nwith controversy but would move seamlessly.\n  I want to thank, also, Ed Royce of the Committee on Foreign Affairs \nfor being so cooperative in each stage of the way. It is a moving \nperiod for me because there hasn't been this type of cooperation \nbetween the House and the Senate or Republicans and Democrats in a long \ntime, and it feels extremely good. I want to thank you for this and to \nrealize that it is not just African countries, it is expansion of what \nI think our great country is all about, that it is not really just to \nexercise the economic power that we have, but to explore the potential \nthat other countries have, especially in Africa that has been bypassed \nfor so many, many decades.\n  I want to thank Jim McDermott, who was one of the original authors; \nPhil Crane, who was the chairman of the committee; and, of course, \nthen-Speaker Gingrich, who was the first witness that we had for this \nbill. With roots like that, it probably carried over so that we can \nhave this extension so that investors and importers of Africa and the \nAfrican people themselves will be able to have a better idea of not \nwhere they are today, but where they can go with the cooperation of \ndeveloping countries so that we will have the true meaning of peace, \nand that is through prosperity.\n  As far as Haiti is concerned, again, we have found throughout the \nworld a general compassion for all of the things that we would want for \nother people that we enjoy ourselves, and by extending this through \n2025, it gives them a better handle on what they can do in the future.\n  GSP has been with us since the 1970s, and we hope that developing \ncountries can graduate into being full-fledged partners.\n  Again, as I said earlier, there has been no one like Dr. Jim \nMcDermott, who brought his experiences from the Peace Corps, having \nserved in these countries and feeling in the marrow of his bones what \nwe had to do. I have already given my appreciation, but he just walked \nin at the right time, as he usually does, and I would like to thank him \npublicly once again.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Senate AGOA Extension and \nEnhancement Act of 2015.\n  Today is a proud day for those of us who are deeply concerned about \ndoing what we can to promote growth in developing countries. We are \npreparing to vote on a bipartisan bill that would extend preferences \nnot only for African countries, but for Haiti, and developing countries \nmore generally. I want to thank Chairman Ryan for working so closely \nwith us on this bill, which has been a high priority for me this \nCongress.\n\n\n                                  AGOA\n\n  Let me talk about AGOA first. There is widespread enthusiasm about \nAfrica these days. We know it's a continent that's poised for explosive \ngrowth. I am hopeful that growth will materialize. And that our \nprogram, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, will help fuel that \ngrowth.\n  In this country, our philosophy of trade and development has been to \ngive poor countries a leg up on access to our market. That creates an \nincentive for importers to source from those countries, and it also \nbuilds relationships among our countries.\n  Some advanced economies have taken a different approach. They've \nforced developing countries, especially in Africa, to agree to \nsubstandard trade agreements instead of one-way preferences. One of the \nparticipants in the AGOA Forum last summer told us privately how much \nhe appreciates the fact that the United States doesn't take that \napproach--that we don't view Africa as a continent full of natural \nresources to be exploited, but rather that it's our responsibility as a \nwealthy nation to provide a path for poor countries to develop.\n  We have seen countries participate in our preference programs, and \nthen come to us asking to do free trade agreements. That's what \nhappened with CAFTA/DR a decade ago. We are more than willing to do \nthat--When they're ready and willing. And I think in the next 10 years, \nwe're going to see quite a few countries in sub-Saharan Africa decide \nthat entering into a two-way trade agreement with the United States is \nsomething they want to do, something they think will benefit them as \nwell as us. The bill we're considering today pushes USTR to figure out \na way to make that happen, without forcing anybody into doing a deal \nwith us.\n\n[[Page H4212]]\n\n  I'm excited to see where sub-Saharan Africa is headed, and for our \ncountry to do its part to help move those countries up the path of \ndevelopment.\n  But we should be clear--I we also benefit from this program, even if \nthe preferences don't go both ways. Our businesses are able to source \ninputs from African countries without paying duty, and that in turn \nmakes us more competitive, whether it's selling the finished product \ndomestically, or exporting it to a third country.\n  I want to thank Congresswoman Karen Bass for her tireless work to \nmake this renewal happen. She is an advocate not just for Africa, but \nfor policies that will promote real change in Africa. I know in the \ncoming months we will be looking at ways to improve trade capacity \nbuilding in Africa, and I am committed to working with her and our \ncolleagues on Foreign Affairs to find a way to get that done.\n\n\n                                 HAITI\n\n  We're also extending the Haiti programs through 2025. Some provisions \nin the Haiti program begin to expire this year. We know from our own \nconversations with the Administration that the Haitians, perhaps more \nthan any other country, need a long-term extension of the program in \norder to attract investment. We hear that some factories in Haiti are \nat capacity--which is wonderful--but that for Haitian-owned businesses \nto be able to attract the capital to expand, the preferences have to be \nextended across a longer horizon so that investors will feel satisfied \nthat they can recoup their investment. By extending preferences through \n2025, we do that. We must recognize my friend, Senator Bill Nelson, who \nhas been a champion for the people of Haiti and has been instrumental \nin crafting these provisions and getting them done.\n\n\n                                  GSP\n\n  Finally, we renew the Generalized System of Preferences, which \nexpired almost two years ago. GSP has been the foundation of our trade \nand development program since 1975. This program provides preferences \nto a wide range of countries, across the development spectrum.\n  We've been fortunate to see countries become more and more developed, \nto the point where we are able to graduate them from the program and \nlet them compete without needing the duty-free preference. I think it's \nunfortunate that we can't extend the program for a longer period of \ntime, but the fact is, the program is so successful that finding \noffsets to pay for it has been a challenge. But it is my hope that GSP \ndoes not lapse again, and that next time, we're able to renew it ahead \nof time.\n  One thing I need to mention is the Senate inclusion of a provision \nthat authorizes the President to review whether some goods should be \nmade eligible for duty-free treatment under GSP. This is known as ``GSP \nUpdate.'' We know that some domestic groups feel that some of those \nitems are sensitive and should not be designated duty-free. So while we \nare supporting the inclusion of GSP Update in this bill, if and when \nthe time comes to consider these goods for GSP, we urge the President \nto take into account the concerns that have been raised. I'll provide \nthe clerk with a list of the items that domestic groups have flagged, \nso that it can be entered into the record.\n\n\n                              OUTDOOR Act\n\n  We are also including provisions that will allow us to keep track of \nimports of recreational clothing. These aren't preferences, but the \nSenate included them, and we have House Members who support the \nprovision.\n  My colleagues who have advocated for this bill have noted that we \nneed to do more to promote enjoyment of the great outdoors, and their \ngoal is, eventually, to see if it's possible to remove duties on at \nleast some of these goods.\n  But to enjoy the great outdoors, there must be great outdoors to \nenjoy, not just here, but around the world. My friend Mr. Doggett has \nfor many years advocated including a criterion in GSP that would \nrequire beneficiaries to take steps to protect the environment. If \nthere is an effort to make any of these goods duty-free at some point \nin the future, it would be my hope that those efforts would be paired \nwith the kind of GSP criterion Mr. Doggett has advocated.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  Looking at the bigger picture, there is so much support for these \nprograms that a similar bill passed almost unanimously in the Senate \nlast month. And I imagine the same will happen here today. I look \nforward to a time when we won't need preference packages at all, when \nthe poorest of nations will have reached a level of development and \nproductive capacity that they can compete with any other country. We \nare not there, but programs like the ones we're extending today will \nhelp them get there.\n\n Supplemental Rangel Statement on HR 1295--Potentially Sensitive Items \n             for GSP, by Harmonized Tariff Schedule Number\n\n       4202.12.40\n       4202.12.60\n       4202.12.80\n       4202.22.40\n       4202.22.45\n       4202.22.60\n       4202.22.80\n       4202.32.40\n       4202.32.80\n       4202.32.95\n       4202.92.08\n       4202.92.15\n       4202.92.20\n       4202.92.30\n       4202.92.90\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I will just add a couple responses before I \nyield to the chairman of the Trade Subcommittee.\n  I appreciate the gentleman's kind words. This is a bipartisan bill, \nand there is a time sensitivity here. It is very important, \nparticularly for African nations in AGOA, that this gets done very \nquickly so that the proper signals are sent to the investors, to the \nfactories, to the employers so that people can keep their jobs. That is \none of the many reasons why we wanted to honor the commitment with the \ngentlewoman from California, with the gentleman from New York, to keep \nthis distinct and separate and to get it moving through. So it is our \nintention that this gets moved through here, and then it is off and \ndone.\n  I just want to thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for \ntheir indulgence. This is one of those kind of rare, these days, \nmoments of bipartisan support where this is good, and this is something \nthat we should all be pleased that we are seeing done. It elevates our \nprinciples. It forges our ties with other countries. And in the time \nsensitive nature of this, I am glad that we could come together and get \nthis done like we are.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi), the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Trade of the Committee on Ways and \nMeans.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to add my congratulations to \nthe chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, Mr. Ryan, for the \nbipartisan nature of the work on this bill. Without his leadership, it \nwouldn't have happened. I also appreciate the leadership of the ranking \nmember of the Trade Subcommittee, Mr. Rangel, who has been an advocate \nfor this for a long, long time; Ranking Member Levin; the gentleman \nfrom Washington State, as it has been pointed out, and his leadership \nas well; the gentlewoman from California; Chairman Royce from \nCalifornia; as well as Mr. Young of Indiana, who has been a strong \nadvocate of getting this done, and getting this done quickly, as the \nchairman said. The entire process of developing a long-term extension \nand enhancement of AGOA reflects the strong bipartisan commitment that \nhas always surrounded this issue and the bipartisan commitment of our \nchairman.\n  AGOA has been a clear success of economic development and in national \nsecurity terms as well. In the last 15 years since it was enacted, it \nhas become the cornerstone of our relationship with Africa. Since AGOA \nwas enacted, trade has tripled and investment has grown almost sixfold. \nBy one estimate, AGOA supports well over a million direct and indirect \njobs in sub-Saharan Africa and about 100,000 jobs in the United States \nof America. We know the countries that participate in AGOA have higher \naverage incomes per person and higher good governance scores, including \non the rule of law and political stability criteria, than sub-Saharan \nAfrican countries that do not participate in the program.\n  The bill we are considering today will extend AGOA for 10 years, the \nlongest extension that Congress has ever considered for this program. \nIt also strengthens the program by simplifying certain rules of origin, \nencouraging greater regional integration, building additional \nflexibility, improving certainty and predictability, and expanding \ntransparency and participation in the AGOA review process.\n  For all its successes, we have also heard concerns about conditions \nin sub-Saharan Africa, including very significant concerns in South \nAfrica, on issues that affect the agriculture industry, like in my \nState, poultry and pork. We have worked to correct that. The bill \nprovides new mechanisms for addressing these concerns, including a \npetition process and an out-of-cycle review.\n  The bill also renews the General System of Preferences program \nthrough\n\n[[Page H4213]]\n\n2017 and provides retroactive relief to eligible products that were \nimported during the GSP's lapse. GSP promotes economic development by \nproviding duty-free treatment for approximately 5,000 nonsensitive \nproducts from 126 developing countries. Employers in my district use \nthis so they can grow their business and create more American jobs.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the bill ensures that Haiti will continue to \nbenefit from the HELP and HOPE programs by extending those preferences \nthrough 2025. This will encourage continued investment in Haiti and \nsupport its economic development and recovery efforts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. McDermott), one of the authors of the original AGOA, \nand the people in South Africa as well as the United States are deeply \nindebted.\n  (Mr. McDERMOTT asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nhis remarks.)\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be here today and to \ncongratulate Charlie.\n  Most people don't remember 1995. That is when we did a bill called \nNAFTA, and tucked away in NAFTA was the beginning, the seeds of this \nparticular bill. It didn't pass until 2000 when Newt Gingrich was \nSpeaker. Newt Gingrich ought to get at least a little bit of an \nacknowledgment for his part in all of this.\n  Our goal then was to set up a proposal in trade that would allow for \nsustainable development in Africa. The last 15 years we have really \nachieved that goal, and that is why we are reauthorizing it today. This \n10-year extension gives businesses an opportunity to actually plan.\n  What we have done over the last few years have been very short \nextensions, which has been very hard for the business community to make \nplans when they don't know whether it is going to be here at the next \nsession.\n  One company in particular came in and told me that they want to \ncreate a vertically integrated process for producing clothing in \nAfrica, everything from growing the seeds to spinning the yarn to \nproducing the fabric. Now, this will require a major investment on \ntheir part. This long-term renewal of AGOA will provide that business \nwith the certainty needed to make investments. When they go to the \nbank, the question is: How long is this actually going to last? They \nnow can say ``10 years'' when they go to get the money to do this.\n  Once again, I am very proud and pleased to have been a part of this, \nand I think it shows that we can work together on things like trade.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNebraska (Mr. Smith), a distinguished Member of the Committee on Ways \nand Means.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. I thank the Chairman for yielding and for \nworking to bring these issues to the floor.\n  This bill includes a number of critical reauthorizations, including \nAGOA, the Generalized System of Preferences, and trade with Haiti. It \nis an important first step as we address trade today and tomorrow.\n  I also want to thank the chairman for working with me and a number of \nother Members to ensure the inclusion of provisions in this bill to \nmodernize the treatment of travel goods, performance outerwear, and \nfootwear.\n  The GSP UPDATE Act, included in this bill, would allow the \nInternational Trade Commission to consider whether travel goods such as \nsuitcases and backpacks are import sensitive. If, and only if, the ITC \ndetermines they are not, they would become eligible for duty-free \ntreatment under the Generalized System of Preferences.\n  Such a determination would be constructive for us, as well as our \ntrade partners. This would mean increasing stability and economic \ngrowth in the developing world. It would also mean greater \nopportunities for retailers and consumers here in our country as we \nexpand the availability of products.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for this provision's inclusion, and I \nurge passage.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, after 45 years in the House, I would be less \nthan honest to say that there is certain legislation that I have \nconcern with in terms of what happens after I leave this Congress, but \nI am so pleased to say that the gentlewoman from California has taken \nthis little baby and nursed it to make certain that she would be the \nmother of the extension and that it will continue to grow.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass).\n  Ms. BASS. I rise today in support of H.R. 1891, the AGOA Extension \nand Enhancement Act of 2015.\n  I am delighted to be here to speak in favor of an extraordinarily \nimportant bill, of which AGOA is part, and to be joined by my \ndistinguished colleague, Ranking Member Rangel. I do have to say that \nit is quite appropriate that we are voting on this bill today, as it is \nMr. Rangel's birthday. As one of the original authors of AGOA, we \nextend this birthday present to him because I know that it will pass \nwith bipartisan support.\n  I also want to acknowledge the work of one of the other original \nauthors, Mr. McDermott, for the longtime support of the nations in \nAfrica and to acknowledge several Ambassadors that are here in the \ngallery from Lesotho, South Africa; Niger; and Gabon.\n  I also want to thank the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, \nMr. Ryan. I appreciate his timing. He made a commitment as soon as he \ntook over as chair. He received numerous delegations from the \ncontinent. He made that commitment. He followed through on it, in \nparticular, the timing, because it was so important that the chair and \nranking member and chair of the subcommittee, Mr. Tiberi, that we did \nthis soon so that we didn't wait until AGOA was near expiration.\n  We did that a couple of years ago with third-country fabric, and we \nfound that many jobs on the continent were lost. I want to thank him \nfor his leadership and following through.\n  The importance of reauthorizing AGOA--and by doing so, strengthening \ntrade and investment between the United States and the nations of \nAfrica--is clear. Since its enactment in 2001, AGOA has helped to \nsignificantly increase African exports to the United States and led to \njobs both on the African Continent and here at home.\n  AGOA has generated approximately 100,000 jobs in the U.S. and 350,000 \ndirect jobs and 1 million indirect jobs in Sub-Saharan Africa. A \nbyproduct of this trade is the increase of U.S. exports.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. RANGEL. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. BASS. Over the past decade, numerous countries on the continent \nof Africa have consistently been cited by international financial \ninstitutions as the fastest growing economies in the world.\n  Without question, I am pleased to have been part of this important \nprocess. I also look forward to continuing my work with my fellow \nMembers of Congress and the administration in strengthening trade and \ninvestment relations between our country and home to the world's \nfastest growing economies and newest and most dynamic trade and \ninvestment frontier, Africa.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), one of our newer Members who has \ntaken a particular interest in the issue of trade. It matters greatly \nto the jobs in his district in Minnesota.\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support of the \nlegislation that I am holding in my hand right now, the trade promotion \nauthority bill.\n  Tomorrow, the House will be voting on the passage of TPA, which is a \nvital step in ensuring America's future success as a nation. Whenever I \nget asked why--Why is it important? Why is American trade important?--I \nsay it is not just important to Minnesota, it is important to the \nentire country, but I will use my State as the starter.\n  The State of Minnesota is still home to 18 Fortune 500 companies, and \nthe two main drivers of our private economy--our success--are \nagriculture and manufacturing.\n  American trade is important. It is important to ensure that our \nsuperior workforce, our quality companies and products, have full and \nfair access to other markets around the world.\n  Let me be clear, TPA is not a trade deal in itself; rather, TPA is \nlegislation\n\n[[Page H4214]]\n\nthat authorizes the President to enter into an agreement only after \nCongress and the American people have given their approval.\n  It contains 150 objectives that Congress mandates the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative must adhere to during negotiations. It has a provision \nthat allows the House to withdraw TPA at any time during its 6-year \nauthorization, effectively stopping any bad agreement in its tracks. It \nrequires that any deal must be public for a minimum of 60 days before \nany vote or considerations taken by Congress.\n  I want to thank Chairmen Ryan and Tiberi for their work on this \nimportant legislation. It is time for America to lead again, which is \nwhy I urge my colleagues to support the passage of trade promotion \nauthority.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Crenshaw), chairman of the Appropriations \nsubcommittee that brought this matter of luggage to our attention in \nthe first place.\n  Mr. CRENSHAW. I rise in support of passage of H.R. 1295, the Trade \nPreferences Extension Act, and I want to thank Chairman Ryan and \nChairman Tiberi for their hard work and dedication in getting this \nimportant piece of legislation to the floor.\n  This bill contains many beneficial trade programs that have furthered \nour Nation's foreign policy and national security goals. Specifically, \nthis bill renews the Generalized System of Preferences program and \nincludes legislation that I authored, along with Mr. Smith of Nebraska, \non a commonsense and helpful update to the GSP program.\n  The GSP program helps many designated beneficiary developing \ncountries around the world. Stable countries with employed and \nproductive citizens lead to a safe global environment that deters wars, \nterrorist groups, and violent uprisings and further allows our allies \nto develop their own economies, health care, and educational systems.\n  The GSP UPDATE, which would add travel goods to the list of items \neligible for review, would specifically benefit our ally the \nPhilippines, which has suffered multiple devastating weather events. It \nwill also help Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in the world.\n  Goods are not eligible for the GSP program if they are ``import \nsensitive'' or compete with U.S. goods. This is decided by the \nInternational Trade Commission. Therefore, having travel and luggage \nitems placed on the GSP-eligible list does not automatically give them \npreferential trade status.\n  The overall GSP program is a win-win for the U.S. and our allies \naround the world. Through this program, we are able to help countries \ndevelop their economies with little cost to the United States \nGovernment.\n  I want to thank Chairman Ryan for all of his hard work. I urge \npassage of this bill, the Trade Preferences Extension Act.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Kind), one of the House's most active supporters of free \ntrade and fair trade and who has made an outstanding contribution to \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. KIND. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. It is a \nbill that came out of the Senate 99-1, with wide bipartisan support; \nand why not? It has worked well for us in the past. It will work well \nfor us in the future.\n  This is our opportunity to meaningfully engage the African nations \nwhen it comes to trade preferences to make sure that we maintain a \nhealthy and strong relationship with a vibrant and growing area of the \nworld, along with some other developing nations, and Haiti, for \ninstance, that Mr. Rangel has been particularly focused on, too. I \nwould encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  This also fixes a problem that we have had in regard to the trade \nagenda that we are trying to move forward on this week. There was some \nconcern about how the Trade Adjustment Assistance bill was going to be \npaid for, what offsets were being used. That now is being fixed in this \nbill as well through a bipartisan agreement.\n  I commend the chair of the Ways and Means committee and the \nRepublican leadership for their willingness to compromise on this \nissue, to make sure that this does not become a hurdle or a roadblock \nto advancing our trade agenda as a nation. So that is in the bill. I \nthink Members of Congress need confidence that that offset has been \nfixed and paid for.\n  It is my understanding that the Senate plans on moving quickly, \nexpeditiously, in order to take up this amended version and pass it on \ntheir side, so no Member should be under any illusion that there is a \nproblem for the pay-for right now with Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n  Overall, the basis of this bill is something that has worked and \nbenefited us in the past. It is the reason why there was overwhelming \nbipartisan support in the Senate. We should have overwhelming \nbipartisan support on the floor of the House today.\n  I commend the leadership of the committee, Ranking Member Rangel and \nthe work that he has put in, and I encourage a ``yes'' vote on this \nunderlying legislation.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to take this time to thank the chairman for changing the pay-\nfor for the TAA. I just wondered, after that very difficult and complex \nnegotiation, why in the world they would tie that up with TPA. That \nmeans that those votes now, it is my understanding, procedurally, it \nwould be one vote, and you won't have a chance to vote for TPA and TAA \nseparately.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Could you rephrase the question? I didn't \ncatch it all.\n  Mr. RANGEL. It is my understanding that the TAA complex pay-for has \nbeen taken care of under your leadership under the bill that is before \nus. My question was: Why in the world would you tie that up with TPA?\n  When you accomplish one problem, it seems like you complicated that \nby not allowing the House to have two separate votes on two entirely \nseparate issues.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. RANGEL. I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. The bills came over from the other body \ntogether--both policies, TAA and TPA, in the same bill; that is why \nthese are not separate bills, but they are separate votes.\n  As the gentleman knows from his years of experience here, we can \nalways choose to divide the question on a particular bill. We have \nchosen to divide the question on that forthcoming bill between TPA and \nTAA.\n  The issue before us right here is not just preferences, which is \nimportant for all the reasons we specified, but it also fixes the pay-\nfor problem that, on both sides of the aisle, Members had concerns \nwith.\n  The bill coming over from the Senate has both issues together. We are \nsimply dividing the question and having votes on each policy \nseparately.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Reclaiming my time, I am glad to hear that.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), and \nI thank him publicly for the great work that he has put into this \nissue, as well as all the important issues.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy and his \nleadership. It was my intention to engage in a colloquy with the \nchairman in a few minutes, but I wanted to make a couple of \nobservations, if I could, about the subject at hand.\n  As Mr. Rangel knows from his years of effort, one of our \nresponsibilities in terms of promoting free and fair trade is to be \nable to focus attention on some of the poorest countries around the \nworld.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  I appreciate your work, what the committee is doing--in the past and \nmoving forward--to be able to deal with some of the anomalies where \nsome of the worst, heaviest tariff burdens are on some of the poorest \nof countries, and our being able to extend to less-developed countries \nopportunities to earn their own way, to have some modicum\n\n[[Page H4215]]\n\nof tariff relief, to be able to promote their indigenous activities.\n  Trade is cheaper than aid, and it helps them strengthen their \neconomies, strengthen their societies, and I really appreciate tireless \nefforts to extend those opportunities to others.\n  I think we have got a long way to go in terms of being able to deal \nwith some of the poorest of countries. We have got trade promotion \nauthority we may be talking about with a dozen countries. But there are \nother poor countries around the world that we need to work with to be \nable to pull into opportunities for them to grow their economies, for \nthem to be able to trade with us, to be able to strengthen civil \nsociety, and partnerships.\n  So I wanted to thank you for your years of effort in this. I wanted \nto express my appreciation for the underlying bill.\n  I look forward to chatting a little further with the chairman when \none of our partners surfaces.\n  Mr. RANGEL. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nMeeks), my friend and distinguished member of the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, one of the most knowledgeable persons in the House on the \nissue of trade.\n  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Rangel.\n  I stand in support of this bipartisan legislation, which passed the \nSenate by a vote of 99-1. It includes preferences that are critical to \nso many economies in the developing world: the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act, or AGOA, a core of close economic partnerships between \nthe United States and a host of African nations; the Generalized System \nof Preferences, tariff preferences which help developing countries \ncompete and build their economies worldwide; the Haiti HOPE and HELP \nprograms, which provide duty-free treatment for certain Haitians to \nhelp Haitians build a 21st century economy.\n  And I know that my constituents have been calling for the passage of \nthese provisions for many, many months.\n  As I have traveled to many affected nations, they too have \nexperienced and expressed the serious and dire consequences that they \ncould suffer without these benefits.\n  This is not just about helping other nations. The fact is, right here \nin the United States, exports grow as a result of increased trade with \nthese nations that results from extending preferences in trade and \ninvestment flows--critical to my district and districts all across the \nUnited States. It is critically important.\n  And I compliment, also, Chairman Ryan, for putting this together in a \nway that we can pass it in a bipartisan way, because this is an \nimportant aspect of also making sure that we are secure because, as we \nhelp these nations on their feet and put them in part of the global \neconomy, we are making sure that we are giving hope and opportunity to \nall.\n  So I heartily support, and ask everyone to support this bipartisan \nbill, which passed, again, 99-1 in the Senate. Collectively, we are \ngoing to make this place a better place.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I want to thank Mr. Meeks, the gentleman who just left. He has been a \ngreat leader on this issue, on trade.\n  Let me explain to those who are watching who aren't steeped in the \nintricacies of the trade law: what this bill is, the bill with respect \nto Haiti, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, GSP, it is trade, not \naid. It is combining the need in America for high-quality, lower-cost \ngoods that are not made in America with the need for economic growth \nand jobs in developing countries. It is a win-win.\n  Take Africa, for example. People are getting opportunity. People are \ngetting jobs. People are getting out of poverty, and they are making \nproducts that Americans need, that Americans don't make right here. And \nwe are getting high-quality, lower-priced products as a result of it.\n  So that means, for the hard-working taxpayer in Wisconsin, for the \nhard-working taxpayer in New York and throughout America, they are \nstretching their dollar more. That means their paycheck goes farther. \nThat means that they are buying shoes for their kids or blankets at \nhome or towels, or luggage. They can buy more of it. It doesn't cost as \nmuch.\n  That means their take-home pay can go to that and even more things \nbecause it gives them more take-home pay. That is why it is good for \nus.\n  And why it is good for people in the developing world is it is \nhelping them build an economy. It is helping them attract manufacturers \nand exporters who create jobs and opportunity.\n  So, as a component of our foreign policy, it is so important. You \nhave heard it a million times: we believe in trade, not aid. You teach \na man how to fish instead of feeding him a fish. We all know the \nparables we can get into. That is what this is.\n  This says, let's work together to grow your economy, to be \nindependent, to be self-sufficient, to help people get more opportunity \nto pull themselves out of poverty. That is in the interest of the human \nperson involved, but it is also in the interest of our countries, so \nthat we can help the developing world get into the First World, so that \nwe can help the developing world raise their living standards.\n  And by the way, just from a brass tacks, material standpoint, having \nthe developing world grow, having people enter the middle class in \nother countries means more customers for our products. It means more \ntrade for us.\n  But, from an international standpoint, from a foreign policy \nstandpoint, it means these countries are more secure. They are more \nsafe. They are more prosperous. And they enter the world from a \ndeveloping nation to the developed world. That is good for everybody. \nThat is good for all.\n  That is why this is one of the more important components of our \nforeign policy as a country and our economic policy, in general.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Graves of Louisiana). The gentleman from \nNew York has 13\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Wisconsin \nhas 13\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo).\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for \nyielding. And I just want to take a moment to recognize the chairman, \nthe ranking member, the subcommittee chairman and ranking member, for \ntheir work on this critical legislation.\n\n  South Florida, where I hail from, is home to thousands of Haitian \nAmericans, and I know that they will soon be expressing their gratitude \nto this House, to this Congress, for passing this important bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  This legislation is going to provide opportunity, hope for the people \nof the continent of Africa, but also for the people of Haiti. And in \nsouth Florida, we have a very special bond with Haiti. We know how much \nthat country needs American involvement, opportunity.\n  And the relatives of so many Haitians who live in south Florida will \nbe beaming with pride and gratitude when they get the news that this \nHouse has passed this critical legislation.\n  As Chairman Ryan says, this is not just trade legislation. This is \nforeign policy. This is foreign aid, but the aid that really helps \npeople prosper, the aid that allows companies, governments to provide \nopportunity for their citizens.\n  This will also provide opportunity for our citizens. The more markets \nthat we help create for our products, American businesses and American \nfamilies will thrive.\n  For a long time, people have been complaining that the economic \nrecovery has been weak; that it has left the people at the bottom \nbehind. This is our opportunity to change that, to create more markets \nfor American exports, to give people hope and opportunity, so that the \nUnited States can continue being that country, Mr. Speaker, where \nanyone who comes and wants to succeed and wants to work hard will have \nthat opportunity. This is how we do it, and we also do it by working \ntogether.\n  All of us in this House want to strengthen Medicare, and today we \nhave taken another important step toward strengthening Medicare. How? \nBy working together. This is exactly what the American people sent us \nhere to do.\n\n[[Page H4216]]\n\n  For too long, Members of this House have refused to cooperate, have \nrefused to find common ground. Well, we are doing that today, and I am \nso proud to be able to come to the floor of the House to congratulate \nour leaders for their fine work, and to offer my strong support of this \nimportant bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany), a senior member of the Ways \nand Means Committee and the chairman of the Human Resources \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time.\n  This is a really important bipartisan bill. I want to thank Mr. \nRangel for his work and, of course, Chairman Ryan.\n  This bill is important because it is part of our soft power. This is \nabout how America exerts soft power in these regions. It is about \nhelping to build trade capacity in the long run to get us to expanded \ncommercial relations in areas of need.\n  This bill encourages the adoption and implementation of WTO \nagreements, including the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, which \neliminates red tape at the border, something that we have worked very \nhard to do and something that will benefit American companies in the \nlong run, as well as our trading partners.\n  This encourages the development by AGOA beneficiaries of utilizing \nstrategies to improve the effectiveness and use of the program to make \nthis program more effective. It commits the United States to working \nwith AGOA beneficiaries to develop and implement these kinds of \nstrategies. It outlines a path for deepening and expanding trade and \ninvestment ties, all good for American national security, good for the \nAmerican economy, good for job creation.\n  The Generalized System of Preferences program--extends this program \nuntil December 31, 2017. It provides retroactive relief to eligible \nproducts that were imported during the lapse of the program, and it \nimplements U.S.-WTO commitments by making duty-free certain cotton \narticles eligible from least-developed beneficiary developing \ncountries. All good policy.\n  With regard to Haiti--and my colleague spoke earlier about this--this \nextends the HOPE and HELP programs for products from Haiti until \nSeptember 30, 2025; encourages foreign investment and job creation by \nextending trade preferences to reinvigorate the apparel industry and \nattract new and expanded foreign direct investment; and reaffirms U.S. \nforeign policy and national security interests by promoting trade and \nlong-term investments in Haiti, as it does with the other countries in \nAfrica through the AGOA program.\n  We also correct the program that we had earlier dealing with the \nMedicare sequester, supplementing the entire package with a different \npay-for. I think that is more acceptable.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. So this is really about achieving America's goals. This \nis about improving our economy. It is about growing jobs. It is about \neconomic connectedness. It is about helping countries that have \nstruggled and building newer relations and stronger commercial \nrelationships with those countries.\n  This, ultimately, is about doing what America does best and extending \nour values worldwide.\n  I urge the support of this bill. It is a good bill. A lot of thought \nwent into it on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for the purposes \nof a colloquy.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the chairman's courtesy, as I have \nappreciated the opportunity to be working with you on the package that \nis coming forward. I know we are not quite there yet. I look forward to \ncontinuing this effort.\n  But I would like to engage in an issue that is critical to Mr. \nReichert, my colleague from the Northwest, to our consumers, and to \nimportant jobs in our district.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, the innovative footwear industry must face an \nunreasonable reality at our borders. Two identical looking running \nshoes are imported. One must pay a significantly higher tariff for a \nsingle reason: it contains a waterproof liner. Waterproof means a lot \nin the Pacific Northwest, for Mr. Reichert and I.\n  This bill puts an end to an outmoded tariff code that charges \nextremely high tariffs for no good reason.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  I appreciate the chairman and the staff working with my team, with \nMr. Reichert to try to get this right for tariff relief for outdoor \nenthusiasts and business around the country, but there is another issue \nat work here.\n  Mr. Reichert and I have been lead sponsors of the U.S. OUTDOOR Act \nthat defines and creates tariff classification unique and specific to \nrecreational performance outerwear and eliminates import duties on \nthose apparel products. The Preference bill achieves one of these goals \nof the OUTDOOR Act by creating new definitions and tariff \nclassifications for recreational performance outerwear.\n  Again, I appreciate your efforts, Mr. Chairman, and those of your \nstaff to include the provision. It provides recognition that these are \ndistinct, unique products that will help the industry better track the \nimports of recreational performance outerwear and sets the stage for \ntariff relief.\n  However, due to a drafting error, I understand that the duty rates \nassigned are incorrect and, in most cases, will raise the tariffs on \nthose products and, as a result, on small- and medium-sized outdoor \nbusinesses, if they are not corrected. In addition, I understand the \nagreed-to language on the definitions of recreational performance \nouterwear and the list of tariff lines should be included.\n  Mr. Chairman, I understand that there is a commitment from you and \nyour staff to apply the correct duty rates and make the necessary \nchanges to the definition in the conference report on the Customs \nreauthorization bill. I further understand that there is a very tight \nwindow here that we both know to get this done. The new classifications \nwill come into effect in 15 days, after the Preference bill is signed \ninto law.\n  I would appreciate your acknowledgement that I understand the \ncommitment correctly and that we will be able to get it done within \nthis timeframe.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Reclaiming my time, first, I wanted to just \nnote for the record that the footwear provision lowers duty on outdoor \nactivity shoes, athletic footwear, such as gym shoes, just to make sure \nwe can clarify that.\n  I thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) and also the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Reichert), who is involved in this \nissue, for their leadership on recreational performance outerwear and \nfootwear.\n  The provisions we included in this bill will lower costs for American \nconsumers. It will expand opportunities for U.S. businesses in these \nkey product areas. I share both your interest in ensuring that the \nrecreational performance outerwear provisions in this bill do, in fact, \nachieve their intended results in a revenue-neutral fashion. We have \nalready been working with you on these provisions, and we commit to \ncontinue to do so in the conference discussions on the Customs Trade \nFacilitation and Enforcement Act. So I want to commit to you to making \na good-faith effort to work through these highly technical provisions \nand to do it in a very quick timeframe.\n  We anticipate a very quick and relatively brief conference so that we \ncan get these issues resolved in a very quick and timely fashion.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate that very much. And I hope that there is \none area that we might be able to engage in some activity in the \nfuture.\n  According to a 2007 report by the ITC, there is no commercially \nviable production of recreational performance outerwear in the United \nStates, yet these products still face tariffs averaging 14 percent, and \nsome go up to almost 30 percent. So I look forward to\n\n[[Page H4217]]\n\ncontinuing to work with you to achieve the next goal of the OUTDOOR \nAct, which would be duty elimination.\n  As was discussed before, there is no viable domestic production, very \nhigh rates. There are not many opportunities to pursue tariff relief \nanymore because we have been moving in that direction, and I think that \nis important. But I look forward to working with you to find the \nappropriate offset, to deal with revenue neutrality, and enact tariff \nrelief on those products as soon as we can.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for his interest. I \nshare his interest, and I appreciate his indulgence.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, once again, I want to thank Chairman Ryan. \nHe epitomizes what can happen when we find a cause that is good for our \ncountry and good for the rest of the world.\n  I thank Speaker Boehner, who allowed this meaningful leadership \nagreement to move forward; Congressman Nunes, who enthusiastically \nsupported the extension of AGOA; my dear and long-time friend from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, who managed to keep the bill as clean as possible \nduring this journey with the other house; Senator Bill Nelson, who is a \nlongtime friend and supporter of the extension of the trade agreement \nthat we have with Haiti; and also the African Diplomatic Corps. They \ncertainly did gain the confidence of Republicans and Democrats as they \nshared their problems and their ability to overcome some of the \nobjections that Members had.\n  But most of all, and I know that Chairman Ryan joins me in thanking \nthe staff on both sides of the aisle. We can come up with the great \nideas, as we normally do, but it takes the staff to put them in the \nposition and put the legislation in place so that we can move forward \nwith it. So on behalf of the chairman and all of the Members that have \nplayed a part in the historic extension of this legislation, I want to \nthank the staff members that made it possible to bring us to this point \nthat we can pass this important piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on my side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Wisconsin has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank the gentleman from New York. This is an issue that he has \nbeen passionate about for a long time that he, along with other leaders \nhere, championed.\n  I, too, want to thank the staff for working very well with each other \non this issue. We know that this is a win-win.\n  To our colleagues who haven't been paying attention to this, this \nbill makes a big difference. It makes a big difference. It makes a big \ndifference for our constituents, for consumers at home, and it makes a \nbig difference for people who are aspiring to live a dream, who are \naspiring to get themselves out of poverty, who are aspiring to make a \ngood life for themselves and their children.\n  This is something that we should all be proud of, and I am very \npleased that we have the kind of bipartisan coalition that we have on \nthis issue. So that is why I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I am also pleased we were able to fix the other issues, such as \nsequester, in this bill. And I think, for all of those reasons, we \nshould vote ``yes'' on this.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the order of the House of Wednesday, June 10, 2015, the \nprevious question is ordered.\n  The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin \n(Mr. Ryan).\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. RANGEL.

Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now \nrise and report the bill back to the House with sundry amendments, with \nthe recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, \nas amended, do pass.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nWoodall) having assumed the chair, Mr. Collins of Georgia, Acting Chair \nof the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported \nthat that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. \n2685) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes, and, \npursuant to House Resolution 303, directed him to report the bill back \nto the House with sundry amendments adopted in the Committee of the \nWhole, with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and \nthat the bill, as amended, do pass.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the \nCommittee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros.\n  The amendments were agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. MOULTON. I am opposed in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Moulton moves to recommit the bill H.R. 2685 to the \n     Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report the \n     same back to the House forthwith with the following \n     amendment:\n       In the ``Operation and Maintenance, Army'' account, on page \n     7, line 22, after the dollar amount, insert ``(increased by \n     $2,000,000)''.\n       In the ``Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide'' account, \n     on page 9, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $9,000,000) (increased by $2,000,000)''.\n       In the ``Defense Health Program'' account, on page 36, line \n     1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(increased by \n     $5,000,000)''.\n       In the ``Defense Health Program'' account, on page 36, line \n     9, after the dollar amount relating to research, development, \n     test and evaluation, insert ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.\n       In the ``Defense Health Program'' account, on page 36, line \n     20, after the dollar amount relating to the U.S. Army Medical \n     Research and Materiel Command, insert ``(increased by \n     $5,000,000)''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthe bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, this amendment is simple. First, it will add $2 million \nto the Army Threat Integration Center to protect our troops and their \nfamilies from terrorist attacks.\n\n[[Page H4226]]\n\n  ISIS, al Qaeda, and other terrorist groups are directly threatening \nAmericans, our troops, and our allies abroad every single day. In fact, \na group related to ISIS recently posted the photos and addresses of \nabout 100 hundred U.S. troops online so that, in their words, ``our \nbrothers residing in America can deal with you.''\n  Our military families have also been threatened with attacks. We \ncan't stand idly by; we must act, and this additional funding will \nhelp.\n  The amendment also adds $2 million for the Yellow Ribbon \nreintegration program to help Active Duty and National Guard troops. As \na veteran myself, I know just how difficult the reintegration process \ncan be. In fact, I am in regular contact with many of the marines from \nmy platoon, and we talk about this every day.\n  These men and women have put their lives on the line for our country \nand our freedom. We owe it to them to provide them with the resources \nthey need both on and off the battlefield.\n  Lastly, this amendment adds $5 million for Joint Warfighter Medical \nResearch, which provides the latest cutting-edge techniques to save \ninjured troops on the battlefield.\n  The men and women who fight on our behalf should know that we have \ntheir backs at the most difficult times.\n  These initiatives are fully paid for with a reasonable and \ncommonsense reduction in funding for Defense Media Activity, which \nprovides magazines and movies for our military.\n  I ask my colleagues: Is it more important to fund the fight against \nISIS or to fund government-sponsored Scooby Doo? After all, if the \ntroops really want to watch it, they can get their cartoons on their \nsmartphones anyway.\n  Rarely in this Chamber do we have a choice that is so clear. Let's \ntake a small step to improve this bill for our military families and \nfor our troops.\n  I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on this motion to recommit, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Before speaking on the motion to recommit, Mr. \nVisclosky and I would like to thank our consummate professional staff \nthat put this bill together for all of us, headed up by our clerk, Rob \nBlair; Tim Prince; Paul Terry; Walter Hearne; B.G. Wright; Brooke \nBoyer; Adrienne Ramsey; Megan Milam; Collin Lee; Cornell Teague; and \nSherry Young; of my staff, Nancy Fox, Steve Wilson, and Katie Hazlett; \nminority clerks Becky Leggieri and Taunja Berquam; and from Mr. \nVisclosky's staff, Joe DeVooght.\n  Mr. Chairman, over the years, Members of Congress have agreed that \nthe Defense Appropriations bill is no place for partisan politics. Our \nnational security is far too important.\n  This week, the leadership of the other party has decided to throw \nthat tradition out the window, and their timing couldn't be more \nunfortunate.\n  As we gather here this afternoon, over 200,000 men and women in \nuniform do the hard work of freedom across the globe--in Afghanistan, \nIraq, the Sinai, Eastern Europe, along the DMZ, and other faraway \nplaces. These members of our Armed Forces and their comrades who serve \nhere at home and their families all deserve our admiration and untiring \ngratitude.\n  This bipartisan bill before you delivers for them. I urge a ``no'' \nvote on the motion to recommit and ``yes'' on final passage of this \nbipartisan bill that recognizes and honors their service.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I \ncall up House Resolution 305 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 305\n\n         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall \n     be in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. \n     1314) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \n     for a right to an administrative appeal relating to adverse \n     determinations of tax-exempt status of certain organizations, \n     with the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the \n     House, without intervention of any point of order, a motion \n     offered by the chair of the Committee on Ways and Means or \n     his designee that the House concur in the Senate amendment. \n     The Senate amendment and the motion shall be considered as \n     read.

The previous \n     question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its \n     adoption without intervening motion. The\n\n[[Page H4228]]\n\n     question of adoption of the motion shall be divided as \n     follows: first, concurring in section 212 of the Senate \n     amendment; second, concurring in the matter comprising the \n     remainder of title II of the Senate amendment; and third, \n     concurring in the matter preceding title II of the Senate \n     amendment. The portion of the divided question on concurring \n     in section 212 of the Senate amendment shall be considered as \n     adopted. The Chair shall first put the question on the \n     portion of the divided question on concurring in the matter \n     comprising the remainder of title II of the Senate amendment. \n     If any portion of the divided question fails of adoption, \n     then the House shall be considered to have made no \n     disposition of the Senate amendment.\n         Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in \n     order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 644) to \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently extend \n     and expand the charitable deduction for contributions of food \n     inventory, with the Senate amendments thereto, and to \n     consider in the House, without intervention of any point of \n     order, a single motion offered by the chair of the Committee \n     on Ways and Means or his designee that the House: (1) concur \n     in the Senate amendment to the title; and (2) concur in the \n     Senate amendment to the text with the amendment printed in \n     part A of the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying \n     this resolution modified by the amendment printed in part B \n     of that report.

The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 \nhour.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield \nthe customary 30 minutes to my very dear friend, the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Ms. Slaughter), the ranking member of the Rules Committee, \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of Ronald Reagan \nRepublican free trade principles and in support of trade promotion \nauthority, which is known as TPA.\n  Since the days of President Ronald Reagan, Republicans have supported \nfree trade because we know that when America competes, America wins. \nTPA is a vital piece of our free trade agenda because it creates the \nprocess that we need to secure trade agreements that grow our economy, \ncreate good-paying jobs, and lower prices for American consumers.\n  For America to continue to determine the rules of the global economy, \nwe need to lead by crafting free trade agreements, and thus, the House \nis here today to provide to the President the parameters under which he \nor she should negotiate a trade promotion authority.\n  Free trade means more good-paying American jobs. Free trade means \nthat American workers make American products at American businesses to \nbe sold all across the globe. More than 38 million American jobs are \ntied to trade, and these jobs pay well. In fact, trade-related jobs, on \naverage, pay 18 percent more than jobs that are not trade related.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Republican Party is here today with Ronald Reagan \nwatching from Heaven down on us, to say that we are continuing what he \nreally began, and that is a process of American exceptionalism around \nthe world.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nand thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary time.\n  Mr. Speaker, shortly after midnight Tuesday night, the Rules \nCommittee learned we would consider the Senate's package of three \nsweeping trade bills. We convened mere hours later and considered \nhundreds of pages of new text rewriting our trade laws and the rules of \nthe House.\n  Part of that package includes what is called fast track, a procedure \nthat has outlived its purpose and circumvents congressional authority \nbecause it does not allow for committee debate or for the Members to be \nable to amend it or change it, just to vote up or down--at least that \nis what happened over here in the House.\n  It silences the debates of the Members of the Chamber, and by doing \nthat, the Americans who send us here don't have a voice. We are being \nasked to push this Trans-Pacific Partnership through by using fast \ntrack, and what is more, we are being asked to push fast track through \nwith a closed rule.\n  Now, we have been very concerned about what is in this fast track. As \nyou know, we really aren't allowed to know. We are only allowed to vote \nup or down on the trade bill itself, once fast track is passed.\n  I realized how awful it was for us here; if we wanted to go see it, \nwe had to take someone with us with a security clearance, but we would \nnot be allowed to talk about it.\n  I learned of something this morning that is even worse, an article of \nThe New York Times about the Australian Government and the members of \nParliament there who say that, if they go down and read the trade bill, \nthey have to sign an oath that they will not speak of it for 4 years.\n  Now, that asks the question: Who runs these democracies, the \nRepresentatives of the people of the United States or the corporate \ngiants who write the trade bills that we are not able to see?\n  It is pretty clear who runs it here because, from what we have heard, \nthat was leaked out through WikiLeaks, is that major parts of this bill \nhave been negotiated by Big Pharma, the pharmaceutical industries of \nAmerica, and the financial system. Neither one of those have shown any \naptitude to try to put the members of the public first.\n  Australia is so concerned about the fact that pharma is asking for 12 \nmore years' extension on their patents that they are very much afraid \nit will destroy their healthcare system.\n  More and more people are finding out simply by the leaks of what is \nin this bill, and so far, according to the polls, nobody much likes it.\n  Instead of the weeks that we could have had a transparent debate \nabout a bill we had seen and a bill that we know, all we do is roll \nwhat happened in the Rules Committee yesterday. Yesterday, no Member of \nthe Rules Committee or any Member of the House who came before it was \nallowed to have amendments approved.\n  Now, the Senate did; the Senate allowed amendments to change the \nbills considerably, but not us. Amendments were offered in the Rules \nCommittee to provide for transparency so that we will know what these \nthings are all about.\n  To change the investor's state, what we need to really bear down on--\nand the Australians are also aware of--is that disputes from any of the \n12 countries in this trade agreement, if they do not approve of or \nbelieve they are losing money because of our Clean Air Act or our Clean \nWater Act, they can go to the three-person tribunal of corporate \nlawyers and act against us.\n  We know that that is a concern in this Congress because just \nyesterday, they voted away the country of origin labeling because they \nwere concerned about the WTO.\n  As I pointed out, we had those amendments. We also had one amendment \non currency manipulation, which is a major concern. We lose lots of \njobs and lots of money because of currency manipulation, and we simply \nallow it to happen.\n  We will not do anything--everybody says, if that should be in this \nbill at all, that the President would veto it--so the American public, \nonce again, those of us standing here trying to take care of them, are \nnot going to be able to do it because we only know by word of mouth or \nwhat we have been able to read in the newspapers what is in there.\n  Let me tell you what is in the rule. That is a very important piece. \nMost of the discussion in the House has been around what we call the \npay-for part of the trade bill, which is called trade adjustment \nallowance. That is supposed to take care of all the people who are laid \noff, who lose their jobs. The fact\n\n[[Page H4229]]\n\nthat we have asked for such a large number indicates to me that they \nexpect an awful lot of jobs lost in this country.\n  So how the TAA was paid for, as it came from the Senate, was with a \n$700 million cut in Medicare. Nancy Pelosi has driven mightily, along \nwith John Boehner, to change those cuts that will be paid for with the \nTAA.\n  I need to make it very clear, and I want everybody to understand that \nthe bill we voted on this morning, the African growth bill, which \ncontains the new pay-fors other than Medicare, are not valid until \nafter the Senate acts on that bill. If tomorrow on the floor, the trade \nadjustment allowance and the fast track authority pass, they will go to \nthe Senate, with the pay-fors coming from Medicare.\n  I think it is very important that we make that point because many of \nthe people that serve with us here are confused about exactly where \nthat is coming from.\n  Let me repeat that. The pay-fors that substitute from the use of \nMedicare to pay for trade adjustment allowance will not be valid until \nafter there is Senate action, if or when that takes place.\n  We were told that the Speaker said over in the Senate that he would \ndo this under unanimous consent, but we have also been told that \nunanimous consent will not be given.\n  Anyway, Mr. Speaker, the advocates of the fast track and TPP are \ntelling us that this is going to be a wonderful trade deal.\n  We know that it is not going to create jobs because none of them \nhave. Those of us in upstate New York, after NAFTA, we were told we \nwere going to get at least 250,000 new jobs; instead, as the Speaker \nprobably knows, we lost a great deal.\n  If we, as Members of Congress, wanted to view the deal, we could not \ntalk about it; and that, by itself, should be enough to have us not do \nit.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  In a seminal sociological and political discussion of our early \nAmerican democracy, ``Democracy in America,'' Alexis de Tocqueville \nsaid of our Nation in 1835: ``The surface of American society is \ncovered with a layer of democratic paint. But from time to time, one \ncan see the old aristocratic colors breaking through.''\n  This is one of those times, Mr. Speaker, because this bill, this \ntrade bill that affects every person in the United States--and will for \nmaybe a generation to come--is not being written by the Members of the \nHouse of Representatives or of the Senate, but in a closed, backroom \ndeal and, as we are told, by major corporations in the United States to \nbenefit themselves. That certainly appears to be what we are going to \nget.\n  By giving away the role of Congress in setting the trade policies, we \ngive away our ability to safeguard America's jobs and, most importantly \nagain, as I pointed out, the American laws meant to protect the \ncitizens we represent, such as the Clean Water Act. I have never seen \nin my years of Congress a trade bill come out of this Congress that \nbenefited either the American manufacturer or the American worker. This \none is the same.\n  Any lawmaker thinking about voting for another job-killing trade \nagreement should take a serious look at NAFTA and at our growing trade \ndeficit with South Korea and think about whether they want to be \nresponsible for shipping their constituents' jobs overseas.\n  Now, we know this bill has been modeled after the failed policies \nthat have shuttered store windows and closed factories all across the \nNation. That is the legacy, ladies and gentlemen, of free trade. What \nwe ought to demand in our trading bills is fair trade. America should \nnot be the supplier of jobs to bolster the rest of world and improve \ntheir economies at the cost of ours.\n  From food safety, clean air, and labor standards to environmental \nprotections, this trade deal would impact every facet of our daily \nlives. Ninety percent of the seafood now that is consumed by Americans \nis imported. Less than 3 percent of it is inspected. Tons of it have \nbeen sent back just from that small amount being inspected.\n  We will not be able to interfere with them coming in here under the \ninvestor-state dispute settlement or under this free trade act.\n  I urge my colleague to vote ``no'' on the rule and carefully, \ncarefully consider the trade package before us.\n  I reserve the balance of my time\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman originally, I believe, is \nfrom Kentucky, and she will recognize when I tell this awesome story \nabout how important a free trade agreement is.\n  A couple of years ago, we did a free trade agreement with the country \nof Korea. Within a year, Mr. Speaker, as a result of that trade \nagreement, the number one selling car in Korea came from Georgetown, \nKentucky. It is a Toyota Camry made in the United States. The Koreans \nlove it, a Kentucky-made product.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we didn't have a free trade agreement with Korea, the \npeople in Georgetown, Kentucky, couldn't claim to be the number one car \nin Korea.\n  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 2 minutes to the young gentleman \nfrom Auburn, Washington (Mr. Reichert), a member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I am rising today in support of today's \nrule, which will allow us to proceed in consideration of trade \npromotion authority, trade adjustment assistance, and customs \nlegislation.\n  Passage of trade promotion authority is absolutely critical to our \neconomic growth and global leadership. Without TPA, we will not be able \nto bring home the benefits of a high-standard trade agreement.\n  Now, what are the benefits of high-standard trade agreements? Job \ncreation, selling American products across this globe to 96 percent of \nthe market, which exists outside of this country. Selling American, \nthat is what we want to do.\n  And, by the way, we not only create jobs, but we create jobs that are \nhigher paid wages, which we are all trying to struggle with across this \ncountry in raising the minimum wage. We can do that in this trade \nadjustment and trade promotion authority.\n  This is counter to exactly what communities across the Nation need \nright now: more opportunities, more good paying jobs; and that leads to \na promising future for our families, for our children, to better-\npaying, high-tech jobs and manufacturing jobs across this country.\n  I am proud to be the House sponsor of legislation to renew trade \nadjustment assistance because I understand the necessity of TAA.\n  Now, not only is this a great trade initiative here, but we are also \ntaking into consideration, as we move ahead in this global economy, \nthat there may be people who do have opportunities to look at other \njobs; and this TAA bill provides training and education for people to \nhave and gain better jobs, higher paying jobs. So I would encourage my \ncolleagues to vote for this rule in support of TPA, TAA, and the \ncustoms legislation.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute because I do so \nappreciate my friend, Mr. Sessions, giving us a good Kentucky story. I \nneed to change that story just a little bit. That factory has been in \nGeorgetown for at least three decades. It is Toyota, which is Japanese.\n  All of South Korea has only 26 car dealers in the country that will \nsell an American car. Of course, we buy Japanese cars that are made \nhere, but they don't buy ours in Japan. I think about 2 years ago we \nhad only sold 8,000 American cars in Japan for that entire year, and I \nwould imagine we sell that many Japanese cars in the United States on a \ndaily basis.\n  So I appreciate the story. Georgetown, I know, would love to be \nmentioned, but we have got to get it right.\n  Now I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule because \nAmerica's middle class and our workers have been under economic attack. \nI rise to voice my opposition to the very restrictive process being \nused to shove these job outsourcing trade deals through Congress.\n  The Republican leadership has denied our House any amendment, even on \ncurrency manipulation, on legislation that is sure to impact every \nsingle American, turning our oversight role into little more than a \nrubberstamp. This makes a mockery of the House's\n\n[[Page H4230]]\n\nclear, constitutional authority on trade and commerce.\n  Worse still, this limitation is being pursued because Republican \nleaders simply do not want to go to conference with the Senate. This \nbelies every American, every Member their right to be represented and \nhave a voice in this process.\n  Hundreds, however, of multinational corporations and lobbyists, the 1 \npercent, helped to write, amend, and draft the TPP, the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, line by line.\n  But today, years into the process and with negotiation in the final \nstages, Members of Congress were only recently given our first access. \nTo read it, you have to go to a secure room, deep in the Visitor \nCenter. We are supervised. Any notes we take are confiscated, and we \ncan't discuss what we find with anyone unless they have top secret \nclearance.\n\n  The trade deal is a secret deal because they want to fast-track it \nthrough Congress, hoping Congress really won't understand what is in \nit. And I find it hard to imagine a more dangerous or irresponsible \napproach than fast-tracking another trade deal through Congress.\n  TPA, the authority to fast track, is a gateway to the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. Both will further harm workers and communities to a faster \nglobal race to the bottom, with more outsourcing of jobs, more lower \nwages, more dropping benefits, more lower standards for worker safety, \ncompensation, and environment. We have seen that since NAFTA passed 30 \nyears ago.\n  For decades, I have fought against destructive trade deals that were \nbrought down on our Nation's workers and communities.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Over this period of time, every time one of these so-\ncalled free trade deals is signed, America moves into deeper and deeper \ntrade deficit, deeper and deeper red ink, as more of our jobs get \nshipped abroad.\n  I remember standing at the corner of Ohio and Michigan Avenues in \nMatamoros, Mexico, and looking at the TRICO windshield factory that was \nmoved from the State of New York down there, and Parker Seals. It \nalmost seemed like a movie set but for one thing, it was real.\n  Last year alone, our trade deficit cost us 20 percent of our GDP. Is \nanybody here paying attention or are we all a part of the 1 percent and \nforget about the 99 percent who have had to bear the brunt of this \nterrible, terrible outsourcing of jobs?\n  Average American wages across my region have dropped by $7,000. This \ntrade deficit didn't happen by accident. Some people got filthy rich \noff of it.\n  This is a time for America to say, ``No more. No more. We are going \nto do it right. We are going to create trade deals that create jobs in \nour country, create a stronger middle class, raise wages, improve the \nenvironment, here and abroad. No more taking it out of the hide of \nAmerica's workers.''\n  We are here because we stand on their shoulders. Vote ``no'' on this \nrule and ``no'' on TAA and ``no'' on TPP.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, you know, I love the fervency of our \ncolleagues who come down here and argue Japan is the problem. You can't \ntalk about the trade agreement that we have with Korea where it works--\nJapan, Japan, Japan.\n  Well, good gosh, this is about getting a trade deal with what is \ncalled TPP, of which Japan would be included. This is a deal where my \ncolleagues come down and don't like our trade deficits, but the bottom \nline is that the United States has a trade surplus with its 20 free \ntrade partners.\n  So we are trying to take people from nontrade agreement, where we run \na deficit and they close their market, to a trade deal where we run a \nsurplus where people want to buy American-made products. If they will \nlisten, we have got a good deal for them today. And one of those good \ndeals, Mr. Speaker, is agriculture, so that our men and women engaged \nin agriculture can sell their products around the world.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Midland, Texas (Mr. Conaway), \nthe chairman of the Agriculture Committee.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule, and I \nespecially want to commend Chairman Ryan and his colleagues on Ways and \nMeans for their hard work in bringing us the underlying legislation.\n  Everyone in the room knows that America's farmers and ranchers are \nthe most productive in the world. They have continuously proven their \nability to meet rapidly growing and ever-changing demands here at home, \nand their reach stretches well beyond the shores of America. In fact, \nexports now account for almost one-third of total U.S. farm income. In \nthe case of commodities like cotton, tree nuts, rice, and wheat, over \none-half the total production is exported.\n  In 2014 alone, U.S. agricultural exports set a record $152.5 billion, \nhighlighting the growing demand for quality food and fiber around the \nworld. As was noted in a recent hearing before the House Agriculture \nCommittee, the United States exported almost as much beef, pork, and \npoultry to the 20 nations with which we have trade agreements as they \ndid the other 170-plus nations in the world.\n  Beyond the obvious benefits to producers, trade also helps support \nalmost 1 million American jobs in production agriculture and in related \nsectors like food processing and transportation. As a result, it is \ncrucial not only to American agriculture, but to the U.S. economy as a \nwhole, to maintain and increase access to the world's 7 billion \nconsumers, 95 percent of whom live outside the shores of the United \nStates. To obtain that access, it is imperative that we work to reduce \nand eliminate international barriers to trade so that our farmers and \nranchers can compete on a level playing field in the global market.\n  With negotiations in the World Trade Organization languishing for the \nlast 14 years, regional free trade agreements represent our best \nopportunity for expanding trade opportunities for U.S. agricultural. \nHistory has shown that trade promotion authority in one form or another \nhas been vital in completing and implementing past agreements. In fact, \nCongress has granted TPA to every President since 1974, and the 114th \nCongress should be no exception.\n  TPA will provide our negotiators with the credibility necessary to \nconclude the most effective trade agreements possible by making it \nclear to the rest of the world that Congress and this administration \nare serious about this endeavor.\n  The legislation before us today empowers Congress to move the \naggressive trade agenda. It includes the strongest measures, to date, \nfor ensuring that this President sticks to the negotiating objectives \nlaid down by Congress, including the unicameral ability to turn TPA off \non an individual agreement. At the end of the day, it is Congress that \nwill decide the fate of each agreement.\n  In conclusion, I am a strong proponent of free trade and the benefits \nit provides our Nation's producers and consumers. However, if we are \nnot going to continue to expand American markets, other countries, \noften with lower standards, will step up to the plate and fill that \ndemand. Markets are not won or regained easily after they have been \nlost, and billions around the globe still want America's quality food \nand fiber.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  We can win over new markets, boost our economy, and meet these global \ndemands first and foremost by showing that we are, in fact, a strong \nand reliable trading partner. We can make that happen by passing this \nrule and the underlying TPA agreement.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding \nand for her tremendous leadership on so many issues.\n  I rise today in strong opposition to this rule. Our country has \nalready lost too many good-paying American jobs because of past trade \ndeals. We should be clear about what this rule would do. This rule is \nreally a vote to extended Medicare sequestration and provides for no \namendments in the fast track bill, Trade Adjustment Assistance, and the \ncustoms bill.\n  We have seen what happens when bad trade deals are passed without \ncongressional oversight: American jobs shift\n\n[[Page H4231]]\n\noverseas--many come from communities of color; dangerous food makes its \nway to our meals; human rights are violated; labor standards are \nignored; and the effects of climate change get worse.\n  The American people do deserve better. The American people deserve a \ntrade policy that creates American jobs and an open process for passing \ntrade deals that gives them a strong voice.\n  Passing this rule and passing fast track does neither. This is a bad \ndeal for American workers. It is bad for American jobs. It needs to go \nback to the drawing board, a drawing board that is public and that \ngives the American people a voice in trade policy, not just big \ncorporations and hedge fund managers.\n  Between 2001 and 2011, the growing trade deficit with China cost more \nthan 2.7 million jobs. Nearly 1 million of these jobs, mind you, came \nfrom communities of color. After these workers lost their jobs, their \nsituation went from bad to worse.\n  These workers saw their wages fall nearly 30 percent--or more than \n$10,000 a year. The total economic cost of this job loss to these \ncommunities is more than $10 billion. Now, that is $10 billion each and \nevery year.\n  We cannot allow another bad trade deal to shift millions more of \nAmerican jobs overseas. We cannot allow another bad trade deal to strip \nbillions from struggling communities. We cannot allow this rule or a \nflawed TAA or fast track to pass.\n  Make no mistake, I support trade. I have the honor of representing \nthe Port of Oakland, and I understand the critical role that trade \nplays in the economy in my district in California and also in our \ncountry.\n  However, let me just say, trade only grows our economy. This bill is \nnot fair; it is not open, and it is not transparent.\n  I have the honor of representing the Port of Oakland and I understand \nthe critical role that trade plays in the economy of my district, \nCalifornia and our country.\n  However, trade only grows our economy when it's fair, open, \ntransparent and creates jobs.\n  This bill--Fast Track--is not fair.\n  It's not open--\n  And it's not transparent.\n  So once again, I urge a ``NO'' vote on this Rule, a ``NO'' on the \nflawed TAA, and a ``NO'' on Fast Track.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Good gosh, Mr. Speaker, I was afraid she was in reference to \nObamaCare, which is why we are losing American jobs all across this \ncountry.\n  The bottom line is that, where there is trade with other countries \nand we have a trade deal, America wins, and we get more jobs. As an \nexample, 3 million jobs in the Lone Star State of Texas are related to \ntrade, and jobs are growing nearly twice as fast as nontrade jobs. This \nis what is happening. It is the vibrancy of America.\n  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nHarrison Township, Michigan (Mrs. Miller), chairman of the House \nAdministration Committee.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of this rule.\n  I come from southeast Michigan, which, of course, is the heart of \nAmerican manufacturing. Michigan manufacturers, especially the Big \nThree domestic auto companies, have all had concerns for years about \nthe unfair competitive disadvantage that they face by nations that \nmanipulate their currency such as Japan, South Korea, and China.\n  It was very important to me that, as Congress moves forward with \nlegislation to give trade promotion authority to this President and \nothers, that the package must also include strong, new tools allowing \nAmerica to fight back against those nations that unfairly manipulate \ntheir currency and those that harm American manufacturers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very, very thankful that Chairman Ryan and House \nleadership agreed to work with us to craft an approach which I believe \nis a strong step forward. For decades, administrations of both parties \nhave refused to identify foreign currency manipulators or to take any \naction to stop it.\n  The manager's amendment, put forward by Chairman Ryan, that we worked \nwith him to develop, gets very, very tough on currency manipulators. \nFor the first time ever, Mr. Speaker, it puts in place a three-part \ntest to define currency manipulation with specific guidance requiring \nnations that manipulate their currency to be named publicly.\n  Also, for the first time, the focus will be shifted from reporting \nand monitoring to actionable items and to steps that will show the \nimpact of currency manipulation on the American economy, as well, Mr. \nSpeaker, as requiring remedial action to be taken.\n  These tough steps will impact every Nation that we trade with, not \njust those that might be included in the TPP, but every Nation that we \ntrade with, including South Korea and China, as I mentioned, Japan.\n  Certainly, while these are steps in the right direction, more needs \nto be done; absolutely, more needs to be done. Here in Congress, every \nMember of Congress continues to reserve the right to oppose any TPP \nagreement that does not meet the needs of the American economy and the \nAmerican manufacturing industry.\n  With these changes that I have outlined here that are going to be in \nthe manager's amendment, I support--and I am proud to support--this \ntrade package that will provide an opportunity to drive our economy \nforward.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, prior to coming to Congress, I worked for a while as an \nironworker at the Quincy shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. I was a \nwelder.\n  Unfortunately, because of bad trade policy, that shipyard closed \ndown, and thousands of workers were laid off. Later on, I also worked \nat the General Motors facility in Framingham, Massachusetts, and the \ncompany decided to close that plant down, while they opened three new \nones in Mexico. I have seen what lousy trade policy can do.\n  The fundamental problem with our trade policy is that it is \nnegotiated in secret by multinational corporations who are basically \nhiring foreign labor at very low wages, move the jobs overseas, and \nthen export the products back into the United States.\n  If you look at some of the minimum wages for the countries that we \nare dealing with in this trade agreement for Malaysia and Vietnam, it \nis less than $1 an hour for the minimum wage in those countries, and \nthey maintain those low wages so that they can attract business. It is \na race to the bottom.\n  I do want to say that, as part of my job with the Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee, I have had a chance to go to South Korea \nand Japan to see how our trade agreements have been working out there.\n  I was in South Korea for several days, and just on my own, with my \nstaff, I looked for an American car for several days. We were in \ntraffic a lot. South Korea is a booming industrial country, major \nhighways. I saw hundreds of thousands of cars.\n  I saw two--two--United States cars. One was the one I was driving in \nfrom the Embassy, and the second car was my security detail behind me. \nThose were the only two U.S. cars, only two U.S. cars.\n  Our trade with Japan--I was in Japan as well. You need a detective to \nfind a U.S. car in Japan. That is the plain and simple fact. They \nimport $1 billion worth of U.S.-manufactured products in auto and the \nair industry; we import $25 billion.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts just to ask one simple question: What was that trade deal \nthat you were talking about?\n  Mr. LYNCH. The Korea-U.S. trade agreement.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Two years ago?\n  Mr. LYNCH. Two years ago.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thought you said you lost your job?\n  Mr. LYNCH. What is that? No, no, no. The job I lost--you were talking \nto people--the job I lost, 2,700 workers lost at the GM plant, those \nplants were reopened in Mexico.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. When was that? What trade deal?\n\n[[Page H4232]]\n\n  Mr. LYNCH. That was right after NAFTA. That was another bad trade \nagreement.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, we gave you a good job, and you came to Congress.\n  I think the gentleman makes a point that I would like to make, and \nthat is we need a trade deal with Japan to level the playing field, and \nthat is exactly what we are going to do.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks \nto the Chair.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Holding), who sits on the Ways and \nMeans Committee.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairmen Ryan, \nSessions, and Tiberi for their tireless effort to move us closer to \nrealizing trade deals that will unlock new markets and bolster our \nnational security.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of both the rule in front of us today \nand the trade promotion authority legislation we will consider \ntomorrow.\n  The benefits of increased free and fair trade are well established \nand undeniable. For companies in my State, the pending trade deals \nwould remove tariff barriers and unlock doors for businesses such as \nMorris & Associates, who export the world's best poultry chilling \nequipment; or a company like Cummins Engine in my State to export U.S.-\nmade engines; and to allow countless farms in my district and State to \nexport hogs, chickens, tobacco, and sweet potatoes all across the \nglobe. This means increased productivity, which means better wages and \nmore jobs.\n  More importantly, Mr. Speaker, TPA is about empowering Congress, \nmaking sure that this body and the people's elected representatives \nkeep tight reins on this President.\n  Now, I am certainly no supporter of the President's laundry list of \nunconstitutional actions from immigration, to his administration's \nunilateral attempts to salvage the sinking ship that is ObamaCare, \nwhich is why TPA is needed.\n  The President is going to negotiate trade deals whether or not we \npass TPA. Why wouldn't we want to make this President's negotiators \nmore accountable, the deals themselves more transparent, and make our \noversight more effective?\n  Now, here is how it works. If the President disregards the parameters \nCongress sets out or fails to consult Members at every step, Congress \ncan turn off TPA. If the President comes back with a bad trade deal, \nCongress can vote it down.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need TPA to not only get the best deals possible, but \nalso need this authority to check the President.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the rule and support TPA.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from the land of cars, Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, the rule we are considering today \nrepresents everything for me that is wrong with politics. We are \ncurrently debating the most important package of trade legislation in a \ngeneration; yet, despite how critical this issue is to American jobs, \nthis rule does not allow any amendments.\n  Currency manipulation, the mother of all trade barriers, has cost \nthis country as many as 5 million jobs. A bipartisan group of 20 \nMembers--10 Republicans, 10 Democrats--proposed an amendment to address \nthis, and it is vital that Congress debate and vote on how to address \ncurrency manipulation as we set U.S. trade policy for the next decade.\n  With nothing but the deepest of respect for the chair of the Rules \nCommittee, I want to give you the facts about the Korean free trade \nagreement. The reality is that after it passed, we increased exports to \nKorea from 14,000 to 34,000.\n  By comparison, Korea exported 800,000 to the U.S. before the trade \nagreement and now exports 1.3 million. We increased our exports to \nKorea by 20,000, and they have increased their exports to this country \nby 461,000.\n  Toyota made more money last year in currency manipulation in this \ncountry than Ford Motor Company did in its worldwide operations.\n  The American people deserve a full and open debate on trade policy, \nnot procedural gimmicks and political games that shut out amendments \nand avoid the tough questions.\n  Let's defeat this rule and have a real debate on the issues that the \nworking men and women of this country have sent us here to consider and \nthat are so critical to the livelihood and the backbone of this \nAmerican economy. American jobs are at stake.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nSunnyside, Washington (Mr. Newhouse), a farmer and a rancher and a \nfreshman Member on the Rules Committee.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I thank the chairman for yielding his time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the rule and the underlying \ntrade promotion authority granted by H.R. 1314.\n  As a member of the Rules Committee, I can affirm that the committee \nheard and seriously considered many amendments and concerns from both \nDemocratic and Republican Members late into the night. This rule has \nbeen very fair, deliberative, and interested parties have been given \nample opportunity to weigh in on it and on the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, as you just heard, I come from the State of Washington, \nwhich is the most trade-benefited State in the country. If my \ncolleagues want to see the benefit trade brings and the jobs it \ncreates, they only have to look at my State. We export coffee, \naircraft, footwear, software--you name it. We also have an enormous \nagriculture industry. In Washington, we export fully 30 percent of the \napples we grow, more than 85 percent of the wheat, 75 percent of the \nhops. Right now, consumers around the world are enjoying a brand new \ncrop of fresh Washington State cherries, but the trade success story I \nwant to share with you today is about potatoes.\n  Prior to the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement that the Congress passed \nand the President signed in 2011, we shipped $53 million worth of \nfrench fries to South Korea. After that agreement was passed, that \nvalue rose to $83 million--a 57 percent increase in just 2 years--\nlargely attributed to the trade barriers that were lowered. For the \nrecord, that potato industry supports fully 24,000 jobs in my State. \nThose are good-paying jobs which are all supported by trade.\n  Trade promotion authority is about creating a fair playing field for \nAmerican producers so we can create more jobs here at home. Most people \nmay not know this, but, right now, American wines face 50 percent \ntariffs in Japan. Chilean and Argentinean wines face no tariffs at all. \nOur beef faces a 38 percent tariff--our oranges, a 16 percent tariff. \nTPA will instruct our negotiators to work on lowering these barriers to \nU.S. products.\n  Mr. Speaker, Americans produce some of the finest products in the \nworld, and if given the chance to compete fairly, I believe they can. I \nhave no doubt that we can outperform almost any competitor in the \nworld, but we can't continue to allow other countries to stack the deck \nagainst us, which is happening right now. By granting the President the \npower to negotiate a treaty and by Congress telling him what priorities \nmust be negotiated, we can create a fair playing field and create those \njobs we need here at home.\n  I understand there are concerns about the privacy surrounding the TPP \ndeal. I share those concerns, which is why I have personally gone and \nreviewed the text of this deal three times now.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. The reason this vote on TPA is so important is that it \nwill make the deal public. It will give the American people at least 2 \nmonths and as much as 5 months to review any negotiated deal. That is \nmonths to tell their Members of Congress whether they should support \nthe deal or not. Without voting on TPA, there is no review period. The \ndeal can stay a secret.\n  Mr. Speaker, this rule and the underlying bill are critical to our \neconomy. Without TPA, our country will be left disadvantaged against \nother countries, and we will be left to trade with one arm tied behind \nour back. With it, we\n\n[[Page H4233]]\n\ncan open new opportunities for our businesses. They can grow and create \nmore jobs, and we can ensure that the American economy remains the most \ncompetitive, strongest economy in the world for decades to come.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today is filled with \nplenty of procedural gimmicks but with no opportunities to actually \nimprove the underlying bills.\n  These bills fail to have enforceable environmental negotiating \nobjectives; they fail to address currency manipulation adequately; and \nthey fail to recognize climate change and its connection to trade. I \nhad proposed amendments to address these issues, which were, \nunfortunately, not made in order.\n  Since NAFTA and other subsequent deals, millions of United States \nmanufacturing jobs--one in four, in fact--have been lost, and when \nmanufacturing workers lose their jobs due to trade, the story doesn't \nget much better: three in five of them take cuts if they find a new \njob. This is a bad deal for those who lose their jobs due to trade, of \ncourse, but it is also bad for all Americans, and it is one reason \nwages have stagnated for the last two decades. We cannot afford to \nfast-track another NAFTA on steroids.\n  On top of that, according to the Department of Labor, four TPP \nnegotiating partners are using forced labor or child labor in violation \nof international standards. Are these the types of countries to which \nwe want to give fast-tracked trade privileges? Plenty of multinational \ncorporations will benefit from TPP, from increased drug prices to \naccess to cheaper labor, when American jobs are offshored. That much is \nclear. Yet it is not clear how the average American worker--the people \nof New York's Capital Region that I represent and the people who sent \nall of us to be their voices in Washington--would benefit.\n  Let's end this foolishness and take up bills that actually help our \nworking families by passing a minimum wage, by requiring paid family \nleave, by investing in STEM education and research, and by rebuilding \nour infrastructure.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this rule, to defeat this inadequate \ntrade adjustment assistance and to defeat fast track. My message: Hands \noff the American worker. Hands off the American worker's children. \nHands off the American Dream.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Boustany), a very savvy member of our trade team and a \ngentleman from the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank the chairman for yielding time.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are hundreds of trade agreements being carried out \nall over the world today, and the United States--our country--is \nsitting on the sidelines. Ninety-five percent of the market is closed \noff in many respects because we don't have trade agreements; we don't \nhave the market opening. We are an open economy. They are sending stuff \nhere, but we don't have the opportunity to sell there. That is a \nproblem.\n  Let's talk about what trade promotion authority really is. At a very \nbasic level, it is the catalyst for American economic engagement around \nthe world. It is the catalyst for American leadership. I, for one--and, \nI think, for most of my friends here on this side of the aisle--am not \nready to just step back and relinquish American leadership to others. \nThat is just unacceptable. Trade promotion authority gets us started.\n\n  We are on the verge of negotiating two very important trade \nagreements with growing areas around the world--the Asia-Pacific region \nand the European Union. This represents the lion's share of gross \ndomestic product growth around the world. Why would we want to lock \nourselves out of these markets? It is absolutely ridiculous. It is \nabsurd. We want the American worker to have access to those markets. I \nwant mothers around the world to buy goods off the shelves that read, \n``Made in America.'' Those markets are closed. Let's open them. Let's \nget trade promotion authority in place.\n  What is it?\n  It is not the trade agreement, itself. It is the process by which we \nget the strongest and highest quality trade agreement for American \nworkers that would be most beneficial to our country. It is the whole \nway we are going to achieve growth in this economy. We can't do it to \nthe extent we need to without this. It puts Congress in the driver's \nseat, providing over 150 negotiating priorities that we set, not the \nadministration. We set these as we negotiate with foreign countries. If \nwe fail to pass this, the President negotiates on his own priorities, \nnot on the priorities of the American people.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Trade promotion authority gives more transparency to \nthe whole process. Right now, we don't have the kind of transparency \nthat is necessary. TPA, trade promotion authority, is public. That is \npublic. That is the process. It is very public. Go to congress.gov. \nAnybody can read the legislation. It is public. Plus, passing TPA will \nrequire that the final trade agreement--those negotiations aren't done \nyet, but once they are concluded, the President has to make it public \nfor 60 days in order for anybody and everybody to read it. That is \ntransparency.\n  If we fail to pass this, we are giving up American leadership. We are \nbasically throwing the American worker under the bus. We need growth. \nWe need American leadership, and trade promotion authority is the \ncatalyst for providing that leadership. Trade promotion authority is \nnecessary for Congress to provide the proper checks and balances on the \nadministration. I don't want the administration negotiating without our \nhaving a robust consultative role in this, and that is what TPA does.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the rule and to support this \nunderlying legislation.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Doggett).\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, the only way to get better trade agreements \nis to reject this fast-track bill and develop a better alternative that \nreflects our values and the realities of the 21st century.\n  As one who has supported legislation for more trade with most of the \ncountries that are TPP agreement countries, I would like to support \nmore trade today, but, as happened in the Ways and Means Committee, \nthis rule shuts out every single attempt of Democrats to strengthen and \nimprove this bill.\n  These Fast Trackers--they say they want free trade. Well how about \ntrade that is free of secrecy and connivance? How about trade that is \nfree of deals that jeopardize our the health and safety such as the \nfood that we eat as American families? How about trade that is free of \ncorporate panels that will be able to award taxpayer dollars to foreign \ncorporations with more rights than American businesses, instead of \nrelying on our system of justice?\n  I think we have to look at the trade agreements we have had in the \npast--the free trade agreements--and realize that, for too many \nAmerican workers, they haven't been free. They have come at a \ntremendous cost. This trade agreement has been shrouded in secrecy in \norder to assure there is not a full and fair debate or a discussion of \nthe failures of the USTR.\n  The USTR, as of right now, has not shared with this Congress a single \ndocument to show how Vietnam, instead of being the great human rights \nabuser it is today, will begin to show even the slightest measure of \ndecency to its workers. The USTR has ignored the record of sex \ntrafficking and human trafficking in Malaysia. One of the worst and in \na category by itself with North Korea--and a handful of others--in \nhuman trafficking. And they are being rewarded in this deal.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Too often, the USTR simply does not believe in law \nenforcement. It wouldn't enforce the law in Guatemala and Honduras \nunder prior labor agreements. In Peru, it ignored the audit \nresponsibility that it had.\n  We can do better than this. We can do better than some kind of \nChristmas\n\n[[Page H4234]]\n\nwish list of multiple objectives that this President doesn't have to \nfollow. And indeed, this Christmas wish list is being proposed for the \nnext President, who has not even been elected--an open-ended ability to \nhave more trade agreements that come at the cost of too many families. \nWe can do better.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I just love our friends who come up to the \npodium and talk about jobs; yet it is this administration and the \nDemocrat policies that have taken American jobs, including ObamaCare, \nclimate change, and all of the other rules and regulations--175,000 \npages of rules and regulations--and have inhibited growth and job \ndevelopment in the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Butler, \nPennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), one of the most exciting new, young Members \nof Congress.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of \nthis. We have a duty here to legislate based on truth and not on \nfiction. Let's establish the facts. First of all, if you want really \nstrong trade agreements, then you have to be in a position to negotiate \nthose because, I will tell you, my friends, if we are not at the table, \nwe are on the menu.\n  As we talk about growing the economy and growing jobs and making sure \nthat America is secure going into the future, and if you are worried \nabout having an agreement that doesn't meet the demands that the \nAmerican people are asking for, trade promotion authority is the only \nthing that gives us the ability to drive strong trade agreements to \nmake sure that every single American is taken care of.\n  Now, this TPA does not give President Obama any new power, none \nwhatsoever. For those of us who don't trust the President's judgment, \nthen TPA is absolutely necessary. It is not an option. We look at \nthings and we talk about the people's House and what the responsibility \nof the people's House is and how would the people's House move forward.\n  This puts us in the driver's seat. This allows this Congress, the \npeople's House, to set the parameters of any future trade agreements. \nIt does not negate them; it enforces them. So if you are worried about \na strong trade agreement, then make sure that we give ourselves the \npower to actually set the parameters of the way a trade agreement \nshould look.\n  It is time to get rid of all this bogeyman talk about what is going \non. I have got to tell you, if you want the United States of America to \ndominate a global economy and not just participate in a global economy, \nthen you have to have trade promotion authority. My lifetime has been \nspent negotiating. When you sit down at the table to actually negotiate \nsomething, the question that always came up to me: Was there anybody \nelse other than yourself that would be responsible for making the \ndecision? Without that decision, without that clarity, we can't draw on \nstrong trade agreements. TPA is the only thing that gives us that. If \nyou want to strengthen our country, if you want to grow our economy, if \nyou want to create new jobs for America, then we need strong trade \nagreements.\n  Now, fast track, anything but fast track. Smart track, safe track, \nsure track, and something that gets America's economy back on track--\nabsolutely. Vote for TPA. Vote for American jobs. Vote for the United \nStates of America to drive the global economy and continue to write the \nrules and not China.\n  If you really are concerned about American jobs, and if you are \nreally concerned about America's role in the world, then don't put us \nbehind; put us in front. Let America, with the strongest economy, drive \nthe trade agreements. TPA gives us that, gives us the ability to grow \nan American economy, grow American jobs, and make America more safe and \nsecure. And it gives our partners around the world the certainty that \nAmerica has not walked away from the table; America will continue to be \nyour strongest partner and your strongest ally to build a stronger and \nmore safe world.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Levin), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee \non Ways and Means.\n  (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, this rule covers three bills. It covers TAA \nand TPA. I asked Rules to place in order a substitute bill on TPA that \nwould have helped a full discussion of this vital issue affecting 40 \npercent of global GDP. Under the rule before us, if a majority does not \nvote for TAA, there will not be a vote on TPA tomorrow. This will give \nthe House another opportunity to improve TPA and TAA, of which I am an \nauthor. TAA should not be a bargaining chip for a flawed TPA bill.\n  The third bill, Customs, weakens the TPA bill on human trafficking, \nprohibits any provision in TPP relating to climate, likewise as to \nimmigration, and strikes out the Schumer provision on currency \nmanipulation. The manager's amendment on currency is more rhetorical \nlanguage without any teeth.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGenoa Township, Ohio (Mr. Tiberi). He is one of our three captains that \nhas driven this entire thing in addition to Chairman Paul Ryan and \nmyself. He has done an outstanding job.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership. \nTexas is lucky to have him.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, today and tomorrow, we are not voting on a \ntrade agreement. We are not voting on a trade agreement. In fact, we \nare voting on a bill called TPA, which is this. It is public. We can \nall read it. Our constituents can read it. We are not voting on \nanything today or tomorrow that we can't read, that is secret.\n  A lot of confusion out there. Here is what TPA is, and you have heard \nit before. It is a process. It is a process where Congress inserts \nitself to what the executive branch already can do, which is negotiate \na trade agreement. But it is a process that, quite frankly, empowers \nthe Congress. It tells the President, as the lead negotiator, this is \nwhat we would like him to do, and we are going to hold our authority, \nand we are going to say whatever the President negotiates, we are going \nto either approve it or not.\n  But you know what? By passing TPA, we are going to require that, \nwhatever is negotiated, the public is given 60 days to review, which \ndoesn't have to be done unless TPA is passed.\n  Mr. Chairman, I didn't have 6 hours to review ObamaCare--not 6 hours. \nMy constituents will have 60 days before the President can sign any \ndeal he negotiates. That is what TPA does. It inserts Congress. It \ninserts the American people into any trade agreement the President--\nthis one or the next--negotiates. It empowers the people to review that \nprocess, to review that agreement--no secrecy.\n  This is what we are voting on tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen, TPA. \nPlease go to congress.gov to look at it. Another day, maybe tomorrow, \nwe will talk a little bit about what trade has done, not done, what it \nhas done for American consumers and American employees and American \nbusinesses.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hill). The gentlewoman from New York has \n5 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Let me take 30 seconds and say, that is really great, \ngo ahead and read the TPA, but it is the bill we are worried about, the \nTPP. We have to have an armed guard, practically, to go look at that.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  Mr. ELLISON. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, there really is quite a lot on the line here, despite \nwhat some speakers would submit, which is, oh, you know, this is just \nthe TPA; it is not a big thing. No, this is a huge thing.\n  As a matter of fact, this particular rule we are voting on right now \ndoes three important things. One is that it has the pay-for for the \ntrade adjustment assistance that includes cuts to Medicare. No matter \nhow you slice it, if you vote for this rule, you are voting to cut \nMedicare. Then what it does, it sets up a vote for the trade adjustment \nassistance and trade promotion authority.\n\n  The fact is, if you go home and you try to explain to Americans, \n``Oh, I\n\n[[Page H4235]]\n\ndidn't vote to cut Medicare,'' the fact is you will not be able to \nhonestly say that. You might be able to say, ``Well, I did, but then \nthey fixed it.'' You might be able to say, ``Well, yeah, I cut \nMedicare, but then later on we passed a thing and maybe Mitch McConnell \nwon't try to change it later.'' You can say anything you want, but the \nmaneuverings on this floor and in this body to get us to where we are \nhave not changed one solid fact, which is that we are voting to cut \nMedicare.\n  Now, there are all kinds of cute procedural maneuverings and \ndifferent kinds of rules we are invoking, but you cannot escape the \nessential fact: the cut to Medicare is not going to be cut and excised \nout of this. If you vote for the rule, you voted to cut Medicare. Our \nseniors have taken enough on the chin. Do not put their livelihood at \nrisk.\n  Now, let me also say that this TAA is not supported by the AFL-CIO. \nTrade adjustment assistance is to help workers who are displaced by bad \ntrade deals. Wouldn't you think that the president of the AFL-CIO would \nsay, ``Yeah, well, we definitely would want TAA''? And he usually \nalmost always does, but not this time because he knows what all of us \nshould know, which is this trade adjustment authority is cutting \nMedicare.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. ELLISON. This trade adjustment authority is paid for by Medicare. \nIt continues to be underfunded. Trade adjustment authority is \nunderfunded. It is like if you kick somebody off their job because of a \nbad trade deal and then you tell them, ``We are going to help you \nadjust to it.'' Well, you know what? At least we should fund it \nproperly. Given the billions of dollars that will be made by this trade \ndeal by multinational corporations, doesn't it make sense that we \nshould at least try to fully fund trade adjustment authority, trade \nadjustment assistance? But we don't.\n  Then the fact is that it excludes public sector workers. Public \nsector workers are negatively impacted by bad trade deals, just like \nall other workers. Why wouldn't we include them in it? They are not \nincluded in it.\n  So this TAA, this trade adjustment assistance, package is \ninsufficient. We must vote it down. I urge a ``no'' vote. I just want \nto let Members know, when you walk into that senior center and Mrs. \nMcGillicuddy asks you, ``Did you vote to cut Medicare?'' I hope you can \nanswer truthfully you did not vote to cut Medicare. Vote ``no'' on this \nrule.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.\n  I reserve the balance of my time to close.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, the Nation's bad trade bills have gutted \nour manufacturing economy, transformed our stature on the global stage, \nand taken millions of jobs from American workers. Heavens to Betsy, \nlet's not do it again. We need to demand a trade deal that will let us \nsell American-made goods to every customer in the world, and we need a \ntrade bill that is negotiated through a transparent and open process \nthat doesn't mortgage our patents, our innovation, and our future.\n  Let me echo what Congressman Ellison just said. This rule, this vote \nright now that we are about to take, codifies, it ensures, that this \nmoney for the trade adjustment assistance will come from Medicare. That \nis what will go to the President. If you vote for this, you are voting \nfor Medicare to be used in that way.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule and on the underlying \nbills.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I support TPA because it provides an unprecedented level of \ntransparency. Let me be clear. A vote for TPA is a vote for jobs. It is \na vote so that we can grow our economy. It is not a vote for a secret \ndocument. It is a vote to set up a process that ensures the American \npeople understand exactly what any trade deal is before Congress votes \non it. We will have 60 days to do that. TPA requires that the President \nmake public the text of a complicated trade agreement for at least 60 \ndays, and we are going to do just that.\n  Over the last few months, I have worked with Chairman Paul Ryan and \nChairman Pat Tiberi and other Members of Congress to strengthen TPA so \nthat the President cannot hijack free trade agreements. I think it is \nobvious here: no one in this body really trusts the President of the \nUnited States to go and negotiate something that we would be in favor \nof. That is why we are making this trade TPA, so that we are following \nour agenda, one that we know that we have heard of. We have heard the \nconcerns of the American people regarding immigration, climate change, \ncurrency, American sovereignty, and I think we have addressed all of \nthese.\n  My constituents are just like me. They want to know that we are going \nto support jobs. But we do not trust the President, and that is why we \nare doing this deal today. This grants no new authority to the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Just the other day, I began working further after the Senate passed \ntheir TPA bill, and I worked with Congressman Steve King of Iowa to \nensure that the trade agreements do not require changes to U.S. \nimmigration laws or to obligate the United States to gain access or to \nextend access to visas.\n  We had an excellent idea, also, that we took from Senator Ted Cruz \nfrom Texas. We just strengthened it and made it more straightforward, \nand it is in this deal that we do.\n  This trade package also includes language that would prohibit the \nadministration from attaching any climate change commitments to a \ntrading agreement.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  We have also worked to guarantee that American sovereignty is upheld. \nTPA reflects what the Constitution requires, and that is that Congress \nmaintain authority over any changes to U.S. law and our constitutional \nrights to approve any trade agreement.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this rule. I look forward to the \ndebate that will follow. I urge my colleagues to listen to every single \nbit of this, and they will understand why a vote for TPA and this rule \nis the right thing to do.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the \nrule to consider the Senate amendment to H.R. 644, Trade Facilitation \nand Trade Enforcement Act of 2015.\n  I strongly support legislation to update the Homeland Security Act of \n2002 to authorize U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as it exists \ntoday. That said, I must voice my great dismay with the inclusion of \nH.R. 878, the ``United States Customs and Border Protection \nAuthorization Act,'' in a vehicle that circumvents regular order and is \nunder threat of veto.\n  Enactment of CBP authorization legislation could help clarify and \nenhance Congressional intent for this critical agency as well as the \noversight of its activities. In the previous Congress, the Committee on \nHomeland Security marked up and reported such legislation, which was \nsubsequently considered and passed by the House. Because authorizing \nsuch a large and important agency requires a thoughtful and thorough \napproach, H.R. 878 should have gone through regular order this \nCongress.\n  There are 10 new Members of Congress serving on the Committee on \nHomeland Security this Congress. Upending regular order, as the House \nLeadership is doing, effectively prevents my Committee and its newest \nmembers from applying the knowledge we acquired through oversight about \nCBP programs and activities to improving the legislation before us \ntoday.\n  Moreover, the text of the legislation in which these important \nprovisions are included was just made available at midnight on \nWednesday, and we are now considering it under a rule that does not \nallow for amendments. By limiting the ability of my Members to weigh in \non the CBP Authorization provisions, even if only on the House floor, \nwe are denied the opportunity to address changes that the Ways and \nMeans Committee made to the text.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I support authorizing U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection but am deeply disappointed that the fate of this non-\ncontroversial legislation, which was overwhelmingly approved by the \n113th Congress on suspension, is now tied to controversial measures \nthat the President may well veto. This, Mr. Speaker, is no way to \nlegislate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the resolution.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.\n\n[[Page H4236]]\n\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15-\nminute vote on adoption of the resolution will be followed by a 5-\nminute vote on the question on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of \nthe Journal, if ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 217, \nnays 212, not voting 5, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 359]\n\n                               YEAS--217\n\n     Abraham\n     Aderholt\n     Allen\n     Babin\n     Barletta\n     Barr\n     Barton\n     Benishek\n     Bilirakis\n     Bishop (MI)\n     Bishop (UT)\n     Black\n     Blackburn\n     Blumenauer\n     Boehner\n     Bost\n     Boustany\n     Brady (TX)\n     Brooks (IN)\n     Buchanan\n     Bucshon\n     Burgess\n     Byrne\n     Calvert\n     Carter (GA)\n     Carter (TX)\n     Chabot\n     Chaffetz\n     Coffman\n     Cole\n     Collins (GA)\n     Collins (NY)\n     Comstock\n     Conaway\n     Connolly\n     Cook\n     Cooper\n     Costello (PA)\n     Cramer\n     Crawford\n     Crenshaw\n     Cuellar\n     Culberson\n     Curbelo (FL)\n     Davis, Rodney\n     Delaney\n     Denham\n     Dent\n     DeSantis\n     DesJarlais\n     Diaz-Balart\n     Dold\n     Donovan\n     Duffy\n     Duncan (TN)\n     Ellmers (NC)\n     Emmer (MN)\n     Farenthold\n     Fincher\n     Fitzpatrick\n     Fleischmann\n     Flores\n     Forbes\n     Fortenberry\n     Foxx\n     Frelinghuysen\n     Gibbs\n     Goodlatte\n     Granger\n     Graves (GA)\n     Graves (LA)\n     Graves (MO)\n     Grothman\n     Guinta\n     Guthrie\n     Hanna\n     Hardy\n     Harper\n     Hartzler\n     Heck (NV)\n     Hensarling\n     Herrera Beutler\n     Hill\n     Holding\n     Hudson\n     Huelskamp\n     Huizenga (MI)\n     Hultgren\n     Hunter\n     Hurd (TX)\n     Hurt (VA)\n     Issa\n     Jenkins (KS)\n     Jenkins (WV)\n     Johnson (OH)\n     Johnson, E.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support \nof the newly announced partnership with Florida International \nUniversity, a nationally respected institution of higher learning in my \ndistrict, and Florida Power and Light.\n  FIU and FPL are working toward providing cleaner energy solutions to \nsouth Florida, something I wholeheartedly support. The project involves \nthe installation of more than 5,700 solar panels on 23 canopy-like \nstructures that will be constructed over the next few months in FIU's \nengineering center parking lot. Engineering students at FIU will \ndirectly monitor the amount of energy generated from these solar panels \nand the effects they have on the electricity grid that provides power \nfor south Florida.\n  It was recently announced that FPL, which already is the largest \ngenerator of solar energy in Florida, is expected to triple its \npresence in the business by 2016. Such an undertaking is only possible \nwith talented and capable students, and I am glad to see FPL is helping \nto train a new generation of engineers that will create fresh solutions \nfor our energy needs.\n  So with that, Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate FIU and FPL on \ntheir partnership and wish them success. I look forward to visiting the \ncampus soon and seeing the progress being made.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4237-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS\n\n  (Ms. DUCKWORTH asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. Speaker, this year's Defense Appropriations bill \nrelies on adding an additional $38 billion into the overseas \ncontingency operations account, the OCO account. This budgeting gimmick \nis an end around to sequestration. It avoids the hard work that is \nrequired to reach a budget agreement and repeal sequestration once and \nfor all. OCO funds are supposed to be used for war operations, and \ntheir use in the legislation misleads the American people.\n  The sequester cuts continue to have devastating impact on our \nschools, our Nation's infrastructure, and our investments in scientific \nresearch. Now is the time to fix this sequester, not deceive the \nAmerican people about defense spending.\n  Our servicemembers and their families deserve to know their future \nmore than just 1 year at a time. As a nation, we need to base our \nmilitary strategy on an appropriate, long-term defense spending plan, \nnot a budgetary gimmick.\n  Mr. Speaker, I voted for this legislation because we cannot leave our \ntroops who are currently in harm's way without funding. As the \nappropriations process moves forward, I urge my colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle to provide our military with the long-term support \nit needs and the American people with the transparency that they \ndeserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4237-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF LOWELL ROBINSON\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise in fond memory of a friend \nfrom Nevada County, Lowell Robinson, who is a community icon who passed \naway just recently at age 86.\n  Born in Nevada City in April 1929, his entrepreneurial career started \nin 1949 when he designed equipment for a local sawmill. A few years \nlater, he began the logging business known as Robinson & Sons. In 1971, \nhe helped establish Robinson Enterprises, which includes gold mining, \nroad construction, logging, and petroleum distribution and sales.\n  Mr. Robinson was an active supporter, in many ways, of the Nevada \nCounty community. Indeed, he was a very kind gentlemen, liked by \neverybody, and his legacy will be felt for many, many years in the work \nhe did for helping United Way, FFA, 4-H, Boy Scouts. Just about \nanything worth doing, he was involved with in Nevada County, including \nmy own personal travels.\n  This little old Indian Springs school still stands where he attended \nand his family owns. I hope some day they can renovate it in his honor.\n  So I join the community of Nevada County in mourning this loss, a \ngreat friend, a personal friend of mine who was always a kindhearted \nperson whom you just got along great with. Our condolences go out to \nWanda and his whole family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4237-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4237-H4238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      ADMINISTRATION'S FOREIGN POLICY IS A SERIOUS MISCALCULATION\n\n  (Mr. McDERMOTT asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I have generally admired President \nObama's bold foreign policy decisions. However, the administration's \nlatest announcement to send an additional 450 U.S. military advisers to \nIraq and to arm the Sunni tribes, the Shia forces, and the Kurdish \nPeshmerga, alike, is a grave misjudgment.\n  Arming the Sunni tribes could undermine Iraqi Prime Minister Abadi \nand the central government the U.S. is trying desperately to prop up. \nSunni assistance may, in turn, push Iran to\n\n[[Page H4238]]\n\nmore aggressively arm their Shia militias in Iraq.\n  Worse still, arming the Shia fighters will further inflame Iraq's \ndeep sectarian divide, which ISIS has exploited so skillfully. The \nKurdish Peshmerga is perhaps the only reliable and ready force \ndeserving of U.S. military assistance, but no amount of heavy weaponry \nwill defeat ISIS without a concerted political settlement both in \nBaghdad and Damascus.\n  All of this comes just days after President Obama has said, yet \nagain, we do not have a complete strategy to defeat ISIS in Iraq or \nSyria.\n  The U.S. has few palpable options when it comes to untangling the \nregion's current chaos. However, the administration's current strategy \n``to arm everyone and let God sort them out'' is a serious \nmiscalculation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4238-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4238-H4239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               FAST TRACK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bost). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman) \nis recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am going to address the issues that we \nwill be voting on tomorrow: trade adjustment assistance and the trade \npromotion authority, or fast track.\n  I know that a number of my colleagues are within the sound of my \nvoice, and I hope that if they share my views on these issues they will \ncome down to the floor and invite me to yield them time. Until then, I \nam going to first focus on the trade adjustment assistance bill that \nwill be before us tomorrow.\n  There are so many reasons to vote against trade adjustment assistance \nin this form, even if it was a freestanding bill. First, it is \ninadequate. It has got roughly $450 million, and there is no assurance \nthat that money will be available next year or the year after that.\n  We know that the majority of this House is actually opposed to \nfunding this program at all. They are doing it in an effort to pass \nfast track. Once fast track is passed, every effort will be made on \nthis floor to cut this program to zero. Bait and switch, you have been \nwarned.\n  Second, this amount of money, who is supposed to be eligible? The \nproponents of fast track have said, well, we have expanded those who \nare eligible, not just those who lose their jobs because of the Trans-\nPacific Partnership trade deal we are planning, not just those who lost \ntheir job because of NAFTA, but everybody who has lost their job \nbecause of globalization in any of its forms. Well, that is also a bait \nand switch.\n  They are able to tell tens of millions of Americans you are going to \nbe eligible for this program, but the program has only $450 million in \nit nationwide. So it is like you win because we give you a lottery \nticket, and then we determine whether you will be one of the very small \npercentage of those who have lost their job due to globalization who \nbenefit from the program.\n  This program is inadequate. It also explicitly contains language \nexcluding any public sector employee from a benefit. Imagine that great \nunfairness. If you are at a public university and somehow grading of \ntests is offshored, you can't benefit. But if you are at a private \nuniversity, same job, same offshoring, whether it be a call center or \nany of the other services that can be offshored in today's modern age, \nyou could possibly--you are probably not going to get anything--but you \ncan, at least, apply for a benefit.\n  The exclusion of the public sector may have made sense 40 or 50 years \nago when only manufacturing jobs were subject to foreign competition. \nToday, anything that is done on the Internet, anything that is done on \nthe phone, anything that is part of the information economy is a job \nthat can be taken offshore. It is going to be very difficult for \nMembers of this House to explain that they voted for a program that \nslapped in the face those who lose their jobs because it is a public \nsector job.\n  The biggest problem with TAA is that it cuts Medicare two different \nways. One way we are told is an acceptable way to cut Medicare, and the \nother we are told isn't going to really happen. It is actually two cuts \nto Medicare.\n  The first that they say they have ironed out is the $700 million cut \nto Medicare that will, under the rule just passed in this House by a \nsmall majority, graft itself onto the Trade Adjustment Assistance bill \nif that bill unfortunately passes. So you will be in a position to \nexplain why you voted for a bill, knowing full well that as soon as it \npassed, a $700 million cut to Medicare was grafted on it and that the \nPresident would have on his desk and intended to sign a bill that cut \nMedicare by $700 million.\n  Now, you can present a complicated chart showing how you voted for \nTrade Adjustment Assistance but you didn't vote for the rule, and the \ncut for Medicare was supposed to be undone by the other bill that you \nvoted for before you voted against it. And if you are able to make that \nexplanation, more power to you.\n  But if you are a Democrat, you will be in a particularly weak \nposition to make that explanation, because the AFL-CIO issued a letter \ntoday that said a vote for Trade Adjustment Assistance in this form \nwith this rule in this ``here you see it, now you don't; we will take \nit away, don't worry about it'' Medicare cut is a cut to Medicare. So \nyou are going to be explaining why your opponent's attack on you is \nunfair when you are a Democrat and you say it is unfair, but the AFL-\nCIO says it is not only fair, it is absolutely true. A special problem \nfor Democrats. Republicans will not have the difficulty in explaining \nwhy they disagree with the AFL-CIO.\n  Then there is a Medicare cut that is supposed to become law. This is \nthe dialysis cut, and here is the thinking: Medicare will be more \nefficient in dealing with dialysis. We pass a statute that allows them \nto make use of clinics instead of hospitals. So through new procedures \nand new technology, Medicare will save roughly $250 million.\n  Okay. Does Medicare keep that savings? No. It is used to buy votes \nfor fast track.\n  Now, how is Medicare going to be sustained if every time new \ntechnology allows Medicare to save money, we take the savings and use \nit for something else, but every time new technology creates new \nmedical costs, new things for Medicare to pay for, well, Medicare has \nto pay for them?\n  If we establish a principle that every new technology that saves \nMedicare money is money to be spent on something else and every change \nin medical technology that increases Medicare's cost has to come out of \nMedicare, Medicare will be bankrupt and will go bankrupt more quickly \nas we change medicine.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  That cut is supposed to become law if you vote for TAA, but TAA is on \nthis floor for only one reason. It is a way to put a bandaid on a giant \ndecapitation of the American middle class, a tiny program designed to \nfacilitate the passage of a trade bill which will govern 40 percent of \nthe world's GDP.\n  Don't be in enabler. Do not go back home and say you opposed fast \ntrack, but that you voted for the bill that will enable fast track. If \nyou are against fast track, then you have got to vote ``no'' on TAA.\n  Well, what about fast track? What about this new Asia deal that is \nbeing negotiated? In the past, the proponents of these trade deals have \ncome forward and said that they were going to reduce our trade deficit \nand create more jobs than will be lost.\n  For this deal, they don't even make that assertion. Their bait and \nswitch is to say it will create some jobs in exports, but they are so \narithmetically challenged, they don't then subtract out the jobs that \nwill be lost to imports.\n  The fact is that time and again the proponents of our current trade \npolicy have wildly misestimated the job effect of each action. For \nexample, on this floor, we were told that the trade agreement with \nSouth Korea would reduce our trade deficit. That deficit has \nskyrocketed. We were told that permanent most favored nation status for \nChina would increase our trade deficit by only $1 billion. The \nproponents were off by 30,000 percent.\n  Now, they don't even say that we are going to get more jobs than we \nwill lose; they simply say the jobs we lose don't count because that \ninvolves subtraction. The fact is that this is bad for\n\n[[Page H4239]]\n\nthe American middle class, as has our policy over the years.\n  Since NAFTA, we have hollowed out the middle class; we have hollowed \nout American manufacturing. Since NAFTA, we have had a stagnation of \nwages in this country. Now, as we begin to recover from the catastrophe \nof 2008, now, as there begins to be the possibility that employers are \ngoing to have to pay more in wages to compete for employees, we have a \ngiant trade deal that guarantees that wages will decline or stagnate \nfor another decade or longer.\n  The economics are against the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the fast \ntrack that is designed to carry it, so there is a shift. The argument \nnow is, well, it may be bad for our economy, but it is a great anti-\nChina alliance, great geopolitics, disguised as a bad trade deal.\n  I have been on the Foreign Affairs Committee for 19 years. I am the \nranking member on the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee. I am here to \ntell you this deal is not only bad economic policy; it is bad \ngeopolitics as well.\n  Let's look at how China benefits from this deal. First and foremost, \nwe are told that this deal is going to set the terms of trade in Asia. \nThen you go to the basement, and you look at this deal, and, as \nreported in the press, there is a statement that there will not be \nanything in this trade deal about currency manipulation.\n  China, if this deal goes forward, wins without even having to sign \nit. China gets a new approach to world trade, which is currency \nmanipulation, go to it, it will be applauded, it will not be counted; \nbut China gets something even more. Go deeper into the basement and \nlook at the rule of origin provisions. Now, what are these rules of \norigin provisions?\n  You would think that under this deal, goods made in Vietnam, goods \nmade in Japan, goods made in the other countries that are part of the \ndeal come into our country duty free, that this deal benefits goods \nmade in Japan, Vietnam, et cetera, but only to the countries that sign \nthe deal.\n  Then you get down to the details, and you see that goods that are 50 \nor 60 percent made outside the countries that are parties to this deal, \ngoods that are 50 or 60 percent made in China, are eligible to be fast-\ntracked into the United States with no tariffs and no limits, and goods \nwhere the manufacturer admits that it is 50 or 60 percent made in China \nmay actually be 70 or 80 percent made in China.\n  Goods that are chiefly Chinese-made get the benefit of this \nagreement, with China not even having to sign it. Our trade deficit \nwill balloon not only from goods that are really made in Japan and \nreally made in Vietnam--and those are the two countries added to the \nfree trade regime by this agreement; we already have free trade \nagreements with the others that are part of these Trans-Pacific \nPartnership; those are the two main countries--not only goods made in \nthose countries, but goods that are just kind of polished in Vietnam, \nfinished in Japan, but made in China.\n  We are told that this is part of some clever system to contain China \nwhen in reality, we established the international principle, the \ncurrency manipulation, the number one tactic of China to run up the \nlargest trade deficit in history. We have the largest trade deficit; \nthey have the largest trade surplus in history. That becomes the norm.\n  Then second, goods chiefly made in China, finished in Japan, get duty \nfree into the United States.\n  But finally, think of what an insult it is to our men and women in \nuniform to be told that our allies in Asia are so disdainful of our \nhelp as they fight China over the islets that are in question, that we \nhave to give away our jobs and enter into a bad trade deal just to have \nthe honor of deploying our troops and our Navy to defend the islets \nclaimed by Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.\n  You would think that the willingness of America to put its blood and \ntreasure on the line to defend not only our allies, but even Vietnam, \nwould be enough, not that we would be told that in order to have that \nhonor, we have to enter into this trade agreement.\n  Finally--and, Mr. Speaker, I will end with this, there is the issue \nof admitting Vietnam into this deal. We are told that the purpose of \nthis deal, the upside, is that we get free access to Vietnam's markets, \nfree access to their markets. The only problem is Vietnam doesn't have \nfreedom and it does not have markets.\n  This deal is great for Nike. They can manufacture shoes in Vietnam \nand pay 30-40 cents an hour. They can then add a few jobs in Oregon as \nthey hire the marketing skill necessary to push off the shelves the \nlast remnant of American-made shoes.\n  They can add some jobs in Oregon where they can find the tax lawyers \nto make sure that they don't pay any U.S. taxes on the enormous profit \nthat you can get by making a shoe for 40 cents an hour and selling it \nfor $140. A few jobs, which will lead to pushing off the shelves all \nthe American-made shoes. That is what we get on the import side.\n  The jobs we get are tax lawyers making sure that the importers don't \npay any taxes. By the way, it has already been revealed that Nike will \nsave several hundred million dollars in taxes on this, chiefly tariffs.\n  What access do we get for our exporters? Well, right now, Vietnam \ndoes have some tariffs. The tariffs go to the government. The entity \npaying the tariff is whoever is doing the exporting. Those importers \nare all owned and controlled--or at least controlled--by the \ngovernment.\n  Right now, if Vietnam imports anything from the United States, the \nVietnamese Government pays itself a tariff. If this deal goes forward, \nthat tariff will be lower, so they will pay themselves less. Paying \nthemselves money is an irrelevancy.\n\n  We don't have access to the Vietnamese market just because Vietnamese \nGovernment-controlled or Vietnamese Government-owned enterprises will \nbe paying a smaller tariff to the Vietnamese Government of which they \nare part to begin with.\n  Tariffs are not the limit on what we export to Vietnam. Vietnam makes \na political decision, a nationwide economic planning decision which \nproducts to import to the United States. They are importing what they \nchoose to import; they are not importing what they choose not to \nimport, and they are going to keep doing it.\n  To assume that just because lowering tariffs means you sell more \ngoods in the United States, means lowering tariffs, means you sell more \ngoods in Vietnam, we are required to imagine that the Vietnamese \neconomy, a communist economy, is just like ours. That is an absurd \nassumption.\n  The Vietnamese centrally planned economy will or will not import from \nthe United States whatever they choose to. Their published tariffs are \nan irrelevancy. Their promise to change those tariffs is a promise to \nchange an irrelevancy. We are a nation of free markets. When we change \nour public tariffs, that opens up our markets to all the tennis shoes \nthat can be made for 40 cents an hour.\n  This is a terrible deal for the American people. It is part of a \ncontinued policy of what they call free trade. What America needs is \nfair trade. What America needs is to say that those who want access to \nthe U.S. market must be willing to buy U.S. goods and services. What \nAmerica needs is an understanding that we need results-oriented trade \nagreements.\n  We are in the deepest hole ever. We are the largest debtor nation in \nthe world. We have the largest trade deficit in the world. We would \nexpect that the dollar will crash not this decade, but next decade. The \nfirst thing you do when you are in a hole that deep is to stop digging.\n  The first step is to stop this fast track. Then the next step is to \ndeploy our trade negotiators with the power to say--the issue isn't \nwhether we are going to lower our tariffs; we are a sovereign nation; \nwe can increase our tariffs--if you want access to the U.S. market, \neverything is on the table, and a fair, balanced trade result is the \nrequirement, if you want access to the one thing that the entire world \nwants, and that is access to the U.S. market.\n  I see no one seeking time, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4239-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4239-H4240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Clawson of Florida (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on \naccount of a family emergency.\n\n[[Page H4240]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/house-section/article/H4240-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY MATERIAL\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 2015.\n\n\n  REVISIONS TO THE ALLOCATIONS AND AGGREGATES OF THE FISCAL YEAR 2016 \n             BUDGET RESOLUTION RELATED TO TRADE LEGISLATION\n\n       Mr. Tom Price of Georgia.
