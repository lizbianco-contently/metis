The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, two Stanford students were biking one \nnight when they noticed a half naked woman lying motionless behind a \ndumpster with a male student on top of her. When they confronted the \nattacker, the man took off in the darkness of the night. The Good \nSamaritans were able to catch the coward and knock him to the ground. \nThe woman, just 22 years of age at the time, was being raped, and the \nrapist was caught in the act.\n  When the victim regained consciousness, she was on a gurney, covered \nwith pine needles, and was bleeding. Her assailant was Brock Turner, a \nscholarship swimmer at Stanford. Brock was found guilty of sexual \nassault on three counts. His sentence? A mere 6 months in prison and 3 \nyears probation. Because the judge said ``a prison sentence would have \na severe impact on him.'' Well, isn't that the point?\n  Mr. Speaker, the punishment for rape should be longer than a semester \nin college. The defendant's dad called it a ``steep price to pay for 20 \nminutes of action.'' Clearly, Brock is a chip off the old block and \ndaddy will never be named father of the year.\n  For many victims, Mr. Speaker, rape is a fate worse than death. Here \nis why. Because rape victims say that after being raped, they die \nemotionally many times; and with homicide, one dies only once.\n  After the sentencing, the brave victim read, Mr. Speaker, a 7,200-\nword statement to her attacker, the rapist. She said in part:\n  ``I tried to push it out of my mind, but it was so heavy I didn't \ntalk, I didn't eat, I didn't sleep, I didn't interact with anyone. I \nbecame isolated from the ones I loved the most. After I learned about \nthe graphic details of my own sexual assault, the news article listed \nhis swimming times, saying `by the way, he's really good at swimming.'\n  ``I was the wounded antelope of the herd, completely alone and \nvulnerable, physically unable to fend for myself, and he chose me. \nDuring the investigation, I was pummeled with narrowed, pointed \nquestions that dissected my personal life, love life, past life, family \nlife, inane questions, accumulating trivial details to try and find an \nexcuse for this guy who had me half naked before even bothering to ask \nfor my name.\n  ``My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me. You took away \nmy worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my \nconfidence, my own voice.\n  ``While you worry about your shattered reputation, I can't sleep \nalone at night without having a light on, like a 5-year-old, because I \nhave nightmares of being touched where I cannot wake up. I did this \nthing where I waited until the sun came up and I felt safe enough to \nsleep.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I was a prosecutor and a criminal court judge in Texas \nfor over 30 years. I met a lot of rape victims and learned how these \nattacks sometimes devastate their lives.\n  This judge got it wrong. There is an archaic philosophy in some \ncourts ``that sin ain't sin as long as good folk do it.'' In this case, \nthe court and the defendant's father wanted a pass for the rapist \nbecause he was a big-shot swimmer. The judge should be removed.\n  The rapist should do more time for the dastardly deed that he did \nthat night. This arrogant defendant has appealed the sentence. I hope \nthe appeals court does grant the appeal and make it right and overturn \nthe pathetic sentence and give him the punishment he deserves.\n  As a country, Mr. Speaker, we must change our mentality and make sure \nthat people recognize sexual assault and rape for the horrible crimes \nthat they are. As a grandfather of 11, I want to know that my \ngranddaughters are growing up in a society that has zero tolerance for \nthis criminal conduct. No means no. A woman who is unconscious does not \neven have the ability to consent or fight back.\n  Victims, like this remarkable woman, must know that society and the \njustice system are on their side. Too often the focus is on defending, \nprotecting, and excusing sex offenders like Brock Turner. The \nentitlement mentality, being a good college athlete, and self-\nrighteousness do not trump justice.\n  In 6 months, when Brock Turner is out of prison, he will return to \nhis life, but the life of the victim may never be the same. The \ncriminal has given her a life sentence of mental pain, anguish, and \nturmoil. Mr. Speaker, when rape occurs, the criminal is trying to steal \nthe very soul of the victim.\n  Justice demands the judge be removed. The defendant should receive \nmore time in prison. We, the people,\n\n[[Page H3568]]\n\nthe community, must support and assist the victim in all possible ways \nbecause, Mr. Speaker, rape is never the fault of the victim.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the statement of the victim in \nthis case.\n\n This Is a Partial Excerpt of a 7,200 Word Statement From the Stanford \n                              Rape Victim\n\n       ``Your Honor, if it is all right, for the majority of this \n     statement I would like to address the defendant directly. You \n     don't know me, but you've been inside me, and that's why \n     we're here today.\n       On January 17th, 2015, it was a quiet Saturday night at \n     home. My dad made some dinner and I sat at the table with my \n     younger sister who was visiting for the weekend. I was \n     working full time and it was approaching my bed time. I \n     planned to stay at home by myself, watch some TV and read, \n     while she went to a party with her friends. Then, I decided \n     it was my only night with her, I had nothing better to do, so \n     why not, there's a dumb party ten minutes from my house, I \n     would go, dance like a fool, and embarrass my younger sister. \n     On the way there, I joked that undergrad guys would have \n     braces. My sister teased me for wearing a beige cardigan to a \n     frat party like a librarian. I called myself `big mama', \n     because I knew I'd be the oldest one there. I made silly \n     faces, let my guard down, and drank liquor too fast not \n     factoring in that my tolerance had significantly lowered \n     since college. The next thing I remember I was in a gurney in \n     a hallway. I had dried blood and bandages on the backs of my \n     hands and elbow. I thought maybe I had fallen and was in an \n     admin office on campus. I was very calm and wondering where \n     my sister was. A deputy explained I had been assaulted. I \n     still remained calm, assured he was speaking to the wrong \n     person. I knew no one at this party. When I was finally \n     allowed to use the restroom, I pulled down the hospital pants \n     they had given me, went to pull down my underwear, and felt \n     nothing. I still remember the feeling of my hands touching my \n     skin and grabbing nothing. I looked down and there was \n     nothing. The thin piece of fabric, the only thing between my \n     vagina and anything else, was missing and everything inside \n     me was silenced. I still don't have words for that feeling. \n     In order to keep breathing, I thought maybe the policemen \n     used scissors to cut them off for evidence. . . .\n       On that morning, all that I was told was that I had been \n     found behind a dumpster, potentially penetrated by a \n     stranger, and that I should get retested for HIV because \n     results don't always show up immediately. But for now, I \n     should go home and get back to my normal life. Imagine \n     stepping back into the world with only that information. They \n     gave me huge hugs and I walked out of the hospital into the \n     parking lot wearing the new sweatshirt and sweatpants they \n     provided me, as they had only allowed me to keep my necklace \n     and shoes. . . . My sister picked me up, face wet from tears \n     and contorted in anguish. Instinctively and immediately, I \n     wanted to take away her pain. I smiled at her, I told her to \n     look at me, I'm right here, I'm okay, everything's okay, I'm \n     right here. My hair is washed and clean, they gave me the \n     strangest shampoo, calm down, and look at me. Look at these \n     funny new sweatpants and sweatshirt, I look like a P.E. \n     teacher, let's go home, let's eat something. She did not know \n     that beneath my sweatsuit, I had scratches and bandages on my \n     skin, my vagina was sore and had become a strange, dark color \n     from all the prodding, my underwear was missing, and I felt \n     too empty to continue to speak. That I was also afraid, that \n     I was also devastated. That day we drove home and for hours \n     in silence my younger sister held me. My boyfriend did not \n     know what happened, but called that day and said, `I was \n     really worried about you last night, you scared me, did you \n     make it home okay?' I was horrified. That's when I learned I \n     had called him that night in my blackout, left an \n     incomprehensible voicemail, that we had also spoken on the \n     phone, but I was slurring so heavily he was scared for me, \n     that he repeatedly told me to go find [my sister]. Again, he \n     asked me, `What happened last night? Did you make it home \n     okay?' I said yes, and hung up to cry.\n       You said, Being drunk I just couldn't make the best \n     decisions and neither could she.\n       Alcohol is not an excuse. Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol \n     was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head \n     dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked. \n     Having too much to drink was an amateur mistake that I admit \n     to, but it is not criminal. Everyone in this room has had a \n     night where they have regretted drinking too much, or knows \n     someone close to them who has had a night where they have \n     regretted drinking too much. Regretting drinking is not the \n     same as regretting sexual assault. We were both drunk, the \n     difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, \n     touch you inappropriately, and run away. That's the \n     difference.\n       You said, If I wanted to get to know her, I should have \n     asked for her number, rather than asking her to go back to my \n     room.\n       I'm not mad because you didn't ask for my number. Even if \n     you did know me, I would not want to be in this situation. My \n     own boyfriend knows me, but if he asked to finger me behind a \n     dumpster, I would slap him. No girl wants to be in this \n     situation. Nobody. I don't care if you know their phone \n     number or not.\n       My independence, natural joy, gentleness, and steady \n     lifestyle I had been enjoying became distorted beyond \n     recognition. I became closed off, angry, self deprecating, \n     tired, irritable, empty. The isolation at times was \n     unbearable. You cannot give me back the life I had before \n     that night either. While you worry about your shattered \n     reputation, I refrigerated spoons every night so when I woke \n     up, and my eyes were puffy from crying, I would hold the \n     spoons to my eyes to lessen the swelling so that I could see. \n     I showed up an hour late to work every morning, excused \n     myself to cry in the stairwells, I can tell you all the best \n     places in that building to cry where no one can hear you. The \n     pain became so bad that I had to explain the private details \n     to my boss to let her know why I was leaving. I needed time \n     because continuing day to day was not possible. I used my \n     savings to go as far away as I could possibly be. I did not \n     return to work full time as I knew I'd have to take weeks off \n     in the future for the hearing and trial, that were constantly \n     being rescheduled. My life was put on hold for over a year, \n     my structure had collapsed.\n       I can't sleep alone at night without having a light on, \n     like a five year old, because I have nightmares of being \n     touched where I cannot wake up, I did this thing where I \n     waited until the sun came up and I felt safe enough to sleep. \n     For three months, I went to bed at six o'clock in the \n     morning.\n       You cannot give me back my sleepless nights. The way I have \n     broken down sobbing uncontrollably if I'm watching a movie \n     and a woman is harmed, to say it lightly, this experience has \n     expanded my empathy for other victims. I have lost weight \n     from stress, when people would comment I told them I've been \n     running a lot lately. There are times I did not want to be \n     touched. I have to relearn that I am not fragile, I am \n     capable, I am wholesome, not just livid and weak.\n       He is a lifetime sex registrant. That doesn't expire. Just \n     like what he did to me doesn't expire, doesn't just go away \n     after a set number of years. It stays with me, it's part of \n     my identity, it has forever changed the way I carry myself, \n     the way I live the rest of my life.\n       To conclude, I want to say thank you. To everyone from the \n     intern who made me oatmeal when I woke up at the hospital \n     that morning, to the deputy who waited beside me, to the \n     nurses who calmed me, to the detective who listened to me and \n     never judged me, to my advocates who stood unwaveringly \n     beside me, to my therapist who taught me to find courage in \n     vulnerability, to my boss for being kind and understanding, \n     to my incredible parents who teach me how to turn pain into \n     strength, to my grandma who snuck chocolate into the \n     courtroom throughout this to give to me, my friends who \n     remind me how to be happy, to my boyfriend who is patient and \n     loving, to my unconquerable sister who is the other half of \n     my heart, to Alaleh, my idol, who fought tirelessly and never \n     doubted me. Thank you to everyone involved in the trial for \n     their time and attention. Thank you to girls across the \n     nation that wrote cards to my DA to give to me, so many \n     strangers who cared for me.\n       Most importantly, thank you to the two men who saved me, \n     who I have yet to meet. I sleep with two bicycles that I drew \n     taped above my bed to remind myself there are heroes in this \n     story. That we are looking out for one another. To have known \n     all of these people, to have felt their protection and love, \n     is something I will never forget.\n       And finally, to girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights \n     when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or \n     dismiss you, I am with you. I fought every day for you. So \n     never stop fighting, I believe you. As the author Anne Lamott \n     once wrote, `Lighthouses don't go running all over an island \n     looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining.' \n     Although I can't save every boat, I hope that by speaking \n     today, you absorbed a small amount of light, a small knowing \n     that you can't be silenced, a small satisfaction that justice \n     was served, a small assurance that we are getting somewhere, \n     and a big, big knowing that you are important, \n     unquestionably, you are untouchable, you are beautiful, you \n     are to be valued, respected, undeniably, every minute of \n     every day, you are powerful and nobody can take that away \n     from you. To girls everywhere, I am with you. Thank you.'\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3568-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3568-H3569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CARBON TAX AND OIL TAX\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Newhouse). The Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments from my friend \nfrom Texas. They are important to consider.\n  I am going to shift gears for a moment. I have another issue to talk \nabout today. To a certain extent, I have great sympathy for my \nRepublican colleagues. They have been stuck with a standard-bearer for \ntheir party, who is a bigot, a bully, a liar, a misogynist, with no \ndiscernible qualifications for the high office that he seeks. But they \nare not helping themselves by trying to shift the subject of debate \nhere on the floor of the House.\n\n[[Page H3569]]\n\n  Tomorrow, we are going to be taking a stand against a couple of what \nthey think are unpopular ideas. It is too bad that the proposals we \nwill be debating on were never considered by our Ways and Means \nCommittee. One, a sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be bad for \nthe economy. And the other, opposition to the President's proposal for \na $10 a barrel fee on oil.\n  The carbon tax ironically is something that most of the economists \nwho have studied it--whether they are conservative, liberal, Republican \nor Democrat--agree would be a good policy for this country. A carbon \ntax is the most efficient way to deal with the serious problems of \ncarbon pollution that is already harming the economy.\n  Look at the disruption of the fishing industry and the widespread \nflooding we have seen that has been unprecedented. We are about to go \ninto another egregious forest fire season with huge costs economically, \nas well as to forest health. We have wildly unpredictable weather--\nunprecedented heat. In Portland, Oregon, last weekend, it was 100 \ndegrees for both days.\n  A carbon tax would harness market forces to be able to change that \ndirection more effectively than other initiatives. A carbon tax \nactually can be designed to cushion impacts on low- to moderate-income \npeople. In fact, it actually could be designed to help low- to \nmoderate-income people. A blanket dismissal of what economists think is \nour best economic environmental protection is shortsighted. It is too \nbad that we didn't debate it in committee.\n  The other resolution, the opposition to the President's barrel tax, \nmisses the point entirely. It suggests that that is somehow going to be \ndetrimental. Wait a minute. The barrel fee would be used to rebuild and \nrenew America. We have been in a desperate situation. We haven't raised \nthe gas tax since 1993. It has made it almost impossible to move \nforward with a robust transportation bill to deal with the problem. \nAmerica is falling apart while we are falling behind. That is why seven \nred Republican States last year raised the gas tax. We couldn't even \ntalk about it here in Congress.\n  Using a barrel fee of $10 per barrel will enable us to make \nsignificant investments in rebuilding and renewing America. The \nStandard & Poor 500 research report of a couple of years ago pointed \nout that investment in infrastructure has a significant impact on the \neconomy. $1.2 billion creates almost 30,000 jobs, creates $2 billion \nworth of economic activity, reduces the Federal deficit $200 million, \nand we get the benefit of improved infrastructure.\n  That is why every major interest group supported raising revenues for \ntransportation. When I introduced the gas tax increase, it was \nsupported by the American Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, by \ntruckers, AAA, engineers, and contractors. Virtually everybody who \nbuilds, uses, maintains, or owns American infrastructure said, Raise \nthis fee, help us rebuild and renew America.\n  I think the only thing wrong with the President's proposal is that it \nis several years too late. We should have been debating this from the \noutset, particularly when petroleum prices have fallen precipitously, \nand when America's infrastructure continues to deteriorate. It is sad \nthat we didn't have a robust debate in committee. We will have a little \nbit of discussion tomorrow. But it is too little and too late.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind Members to refrain \nfrom engaging in personalities toward presumptive nominees for the \nOffice of President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3569-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING GENERAL GORDON SULLIVAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Gibson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor retired General Gordon \nSullivan for his accomplishments in over 54 years of total service to \nthe soldiers, veterans, family members, the civilians of the United \nStates Army, and this great Nation.\n  General Sullivan, raised in Quincy, Massachusetts, was commissioned a \nsecond lieutenant of armor in 1959. After a distinguished career \nspanning 36 years in uniform and serving in command level throughout \nthe Army, his career culminated as the 32nd chief of staff of the \nUnited States Army.\n  On the occasion of his retirement from the Army, former Senator Bob \nDole spoke of General Sullivan's caring leadership, sage counsel, and \ncommonsense approach as he navigated the Army through a challenging \nperiod of significant downsizing and restructuring.\n  Senator Dole stated, ``Our Army will sorely miss General Sullivan, \nbut it is stronger and better for his service. The legacy he leaves--a \nready Army, a future force that will be unmatched, and the deep love \nand devotion of his soldiers--is fitting of this great man.''\n  After serving in uniform for almost four decades, General Sullivan \ncontinued to advocate on behalf of the Army as president of the \nAssociation of the United States Army for the past 18 years. His \ntireless efforts, ensuring our soldiers and their families had the best \ntraining and resources and that our veterans returning from combat \nreceived the best care, have been unmatched and are a true testament to \nthis great man of character and conviction.\n  Under General Sullivan's executive leadership, the Association of the \nUnited States Army broadly expanded support and outreach to the Army \nfamilies, the Army National Guard and Army Reserve, and the Department \nof Army Civilians by the promotion, establishment, and support of \ncountless programs and events at the national and local levels.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Additionally, the Association of the United States Army generously \ncontributed millions of dollars to veteran and soldier support \nprograms, such as the Fisher House Foundation, the Center for the \nIntrepid, and the Army Emergency Relief.\n  Mr. Speaker, I first met General Sullivan 18 years ago, which was the \nweek he started as the president of AUSA, when I served as an escort \nofficer for the Senior Conference at the United States Military Academy \nat West Point. I was serving on the faculty at that time. I was struck \nby General Sullivan's graciousness, his humility, and the way he lived \nhis life by conviction and integrity. I remain a huge fan to this day.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of a grateful Nation to thank General \nGordon Sullivan and his family for their over five decades of service \nto our Army. His leadership has directly enhanced the readiness of the \nUnited States Army. I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting him and \nin wishing him well in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3569-2", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3569-H3570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Butterfield) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, it is utterly disappointing that Donald \nJ. Trump chose to use the court of public opinion in his attempt to \ndefend against a civil fraud claim involving Trump University.\n  Last week, Donald Trump made disparaging statements about the trial \njudge. He suggested that the trial judge is incapable of objectively \njudging the case because of his Mexican heritage. He went on to say \nthat the judge was a hater of Donald Trump's. The footage is being \nplayed over and over on television, and many of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, to their credit, have found these statements to be \nunacceptable.\n  In my humble opinion, Mr. Speaker, these statements rise to the level \nof contempt of court. They are racially based, and the litigant should \nbe sanctioned. The Trump statements are perceived by millions of people \nto be race based and a discredit to the judiciary. It must be \naddressed.\n  Based on my years as a lawyer and as a judge, it is clear that, if a \nlitigant feels that the judge cannot be fair and impartial in a case, \nthe litigant has a duty to inform his counsel. Counsel then has an \nobligation to file motions of recusal that set out, with particularity, \nthe grounds for the motion. This was not done, and I suspect it was not \ndone because no evidence of bias even exists. If the attorneys chose to \nmake such a reckless claim, the attorneys would be subject to \ndiscipline.\n\n[[Page H3570]]\n\n  What would motivate a litigant in a class action civil fraud case to \nannounce to millions of people that the judge is incapable of \nobjectively judging his case because of his Mexican heritage?\n  It is bizarre. It is suspicious behavior.\n  One explanation is that the litigant, unable to convince his attorney \nto address these issues in court, wants to intimidate the judge and \neventually force the judge off the case, which would slow the \nadministration of justice and would postpone the trial for months, even \nyears. The court system, Mr. Speaker, does not work that way.\n  These statements have put the attorneys in an ethical dilemma of \nwhether they should repudiate the statement or not. Codes of \nProfessional Conduct require an attorney to address client misconduct, \nto address it with the bar, to address it with the court, and to seek \nguidance on further representation.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is an egregious violation of litigant misconduct. \nThe court and the attorneys bear responsibility for protecting the \nintegrity of the judiciary and the judicial system. Donald Trump's \nlawyers must avow or disavow their client's misconduct. The integrity \nof an independent judiciary is clearly impacted by these inappropriate \nstatements.\n\n\n                  Release Wildin Acosta from Detention\n\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Riverside High School in \nDurham, North Carolina, held its graduation ceremony. Among the pomp \nand circumstance, one student who should have graduated with his class \nwas, sadly, absent.\n  Wildin Acosta is a Honduran national who fled his country after the \nviolence and threats to his life became so great that he risked \neverything to embark on a harrowing 17-day journey to the United \nStates, all at the tender age of 17. He was classified as an \nUnaccompanied Minor and was eventually reunited with his parents in \nDurham, where he planted deep roots in the community and thrived at \nRiverside High School.\n  Instead of graduating yesterday with his classmates, he sits in an \nICE detention facility in Georgia after being arrested by ICE agents \nwhile he was on his way to school. Led by his classmates, the Durham \ncommunity has been unanimous in calling for the end of recent ICE raids \nthat have spread fear throughout our community and schools.\n  Mr. Speaker, I, too, stand in support of Wildin, and I continue to \nfight for his release. I encourage my colleagues to fight with me and \nto implore the ICE Director and the Department of Homeland Security \nSecretary to use their discretion to release Wildin and others like him \nfrom detention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3570-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING CAPTAIN JEFFREY KUSS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the life of Marine \nCorps Captain Jeffrey Kuss, a pilot with the Navy's elite Blue Angels \nflying squadron, who tragically lost his life in a fatal crash just \nover 1 week ago.\n  This week is the first-ever Navy Week in Syracuse, New York, in my \ndistrict, which is marked by a series of local outreach efforts that \nare focused on translating the mission of the U.S. Navy to our \ncommunity.\n  The week was expected to culminate with a performance of the Blue \nAngels at the Syracuse Hancock International Airport Airshow. \nTragically, Marine Corps Captain Jeff Kuss, a married father of two \nyoung children, was killed when his jet crashed 2 miles from a runway \nnear Nashville, Tennessee.\n  Captain Kuss, a native of Durango, Colorado, devoted his life to \nserving our country as a U.S. marine--joining the Blue Angels in \nSeptember of 2014. At 32 years old, he had accumulated more than 1,400 \nflight hours and 175 carrier-arrested landings. His decorations include \nthe Strike/Flight Air Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement \nMedal, and various personal and unit awards.\n  While the Syracuse Airshow will go on without the Blue Angels this \nweekend, our community is deeply saddened by the loss of this fallen \npilot, and the show will celebrate and pay tribute to his life.\n  As Captain Kuss' family and the Blue Angels team grieve this \ntremendous loss, this weekend, central New York will remember and honor \nhis life and service to our great Nation.\n  Semper Fi Marine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3570-2", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MUHAMMAD ALI--THE GREATEST\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, Muhammad Ali was, \nindeed, the greatest, and he spent considerable time in Chicago. \nTherefore, I got the opportunity to meet and know him. On occasion, I \nwould visit with my friends Frank Lipscomb, Wallace Davis, Jr., and \nRalph Metcalf, Jr., and we would visit with him in his Kenwood home and \nat meetings. Although Muhammad Ali was born and raised in Louisville, \nKentucky, those of us who lived in Chicago embraced Ali as a fellow \nChicagoan because of his relationship to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, \nwho was with the Nation of Islam, and because of his involvement and \nengagement with the larger community. Muhammad Ali was not only the \nbest boxer in the world, but during his heyday, he was a genuine hero \nto everyday people who felt that he was a part of them.\n  In 1966, 2 years after winning the heavyweight title, he refused to \nbe conscripted into the military, citing his religious beliefs and \nopposition to the American involvement in the Vietnam war. He was \neventually arrested, found guilty of draft evasion, and stripped of his \nboxing titles. He successfully appealed in the U.S. Supreme Court, \nwhich overturned his conviction in 1971. By that time, he had not \nfought for nearly 4 years and lost a period of peak performance as an \nathlete. Ali's actions as a conscientious objector to the war made him \nan icon for those who opposed the war.\n  With a record of 61 total fights, 56 wins--37 by knockouts--and just \nfive losses, Muhammad Ali was, obviously, a superb athlete, but he was \nso much more. He was a humanitarian, a principled man. He was proud of \nhis heritage, proud of his abilities, and proud of his accomplishments.\n  Muhammad Ali, a soldier in the people's army. I salute you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3570-3", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3570-H3571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IMPROVING HEALTH CARE FOR AMERICA'S SENIORS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Zeldin) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the importance of \nimproving health care for America's seniors.\n  Living out one's golden years to the max can come with its share of \nchallenges, especially as it relates to health care, which is why \nfighting for our seniors and improving their quality of care must \nalways be a top priority. Whether at meetings in my Long Island office, \nmy mobile office hours, or at various other events in my district in \nSuffolk County, New York, I have met with seniors who are struggling \nwith balancing health challenges while being on fixed incomes.\n  Many cite a lack of healthcare options and a difficulty in gaining \naccess to quality and affordable health care as a result of ObamaCare. \nThere are also serious concerns over the solvency of Social Security \nand Medicare, which many seniors rely on for both financial and \nhealthcare security.\n  As health challenges arise and seniors budgeting based on a fixed \nincome, we should do everything we can to ensure that those who need \nmedical care and attention are able to access quality care at an \naffordable price without having to jump through hoops. They also should \nbe assured that the programs and benefits they rely on will always be \nthere for them. ObamaCare has significantly impacted our seniors and \ntheir access to quality and affordable health care. I frequently hear \nconcerns about lost doctors, canceled policies, and higher premiums and \ndeductibles.\n  Earlier this year, Congress passed the Restoring Americans' \nHealthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, which would repeal many of the \nflawed major provisions under ObamaCare over a period of 2 years--\nspecifically, many of the\n\n[[Page H3571]]\n\nharmful mandates and taxes--so that we can increase seniors' access \nwithout compromising quality of care or efficiency. It is important to \nimprove the quality of health care in our country for our Nation's \nseniors.\n  Congress has also taken action to improve Medicare. Over the past \nyear, the House has passed a number of bills, including the Protecting \nSeniors' Access to Medicare Act, the Medicare Beneficiary Preservation \nof Choice Act, and the Medicare Advantage enrollment bill--all \nproposals that would protect and preserve Medicare for our seniors who \nrely on it as well as to restore and expand the Medicare open \nenrollment period.\n  The House also took action and made significant reforms to Social \nSecurity and Medicare, saving millions of seniors from significantly \nincreased healthcare costs. By working in a bipartisan fashion, \nCongress was able to stave off a massive premium hike for seniors who \nutilize Medicare part B. Without this action, approximately 8 million \nseniors across our country would have been subjected to a 52 percent \npremium hike for Medicare part B. In this bipartisan effort, action was \ntaken to prevent a 20 percent across-the-board cut to Social Security \ndisability benefits.\n  Moreover, in working across the aisle with my colleagues in the \nHouse, we were able to repeal the sustainable growth rate formula, also \nknown as the doc fix, to prevent there being a 20 percent cut to \nMedicare. This action alone has been seen as the most significant \nMedicare reform that has taken place in years. Without this \nlegislation, which is now law, many doctors would have simply stopped \naccepting new Medicare patients or would have even ceased in accepting \nMedicare altogether.\n  Congress has also been committed to passing legislation and securing \nfunding to expand seniors' access to the most innovative technologies \nand treatments so that we can diagnose and treat diseases as early as \npossible.\n  Last year, the House passed the 21st Century Cures Act, bipartisan \nlegislation I cosponsored in Congress to improve and modernize our \nNation's health care. This legislation would accelerate the process for \nscientific advancement while providing desperately needed research \nfunding so that we can provide the next generation of cures. It is our \nduty as Americans to always protect and improve the quality of life and \ncare for our Nation's seniors.\n  If anyone in the First Congressional District of New York ever needs \nassistance or has questions about Social Security and Medicare or a \nFederal issue in general, I encourage you to contact my Long Island \noffice at area code (631) 289-1097.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3571-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1030\n                   STANFORD RAPE CASE AND SENTENCING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Speier) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, these are the facts: Brock Turner was found \non top of an unconscious woman whose clothing he had removed. He tried \nto run away. The woman later found pine needles and dirt in her \ngenitalia.\n  This is also a fact: Brock Turner was sentenced to a mere 6 months in \ncounty jail for committing the violent crime of rape, of which Turner \nwill probably serve 3 months. Why? Because the judge said a longer \nsentence would have a ``severe impact'' on Turner. A severe impact? \nWhat a travesty.\n  All I could think of was Proverbs, which says: ``A righteous man \nfalling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain and a corrupt \nspring.''\n  Our justice system must become better than this. Our educational \nsystem must become better than this. People must understand that rape \nis one of the most violent crimes a person can commit and not as Mr. \nTurner's father said, ``20 minutes of action.''\n  I am working on several pieces of legislation to help survivors of \nsexual assault and harassment, including the HALT Act to strengthen \nprevention and enforcement efforts on campuses. But today I want to \nhonor the courage of the woman who survived Brock Turner's violent \nassault. Her bravery inspires me, as I hope it will inspire you. I only \nhave time to read an excerpt, but I encourage you to read the entire \nstatement, all 7,000 words.\n  ``You don't know me, but you've been inside me, and that's why we're \nhere today.''\n  ``I was found unconscious, with my hair dishevelled, long necklace \nwrapped around my neck, bra pulled out of my dress, dress pulled off \nover my shoulders and pulled up above my waist, that I was butt naked \nall the way down to my boots, legs spread apart, and had been \npenetrated by a foreign object by someone I did not recognise.''\n  ``You are guilty. Twelve jurors convicted you guilty of three felony \ncounts beyond reasonable doubt, that's twelve votes per count, thirty \nsix yeses confirming guilt, that's one hundred percent, unanimous \nguilt.''\n  ``Alcohol is not an excuse . . . alcohol was not the one who stripped \nme, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me \nalmost fully naked.''\n  ``Regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault. \nWe were both drunk, the difference is I did not take off your pants and \nunderwear, touch you inappropriately, and run away. That's the \ndifference.''\n  ``How fast Brock swims does not lessen the severity of what happened \nto me, and should not lessen the severity of his punishment. If a \nfirst-time offender from an underprivileged background was accused of \nthree felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other \nthan drinking, what would his sentence be?\n  ``The fact that Brock was an athlete at a private university should \nnot be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to \nsend a message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of \nsocial class.''\n  ``. . . to girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights when you feel \nalone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with \nyou. I fought everyday for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you. \nAs the author Anne Lamott once wrote, `+Lighthouses don't go running \nall over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there \nshining.'\n  ``Although I can't save every boat, I hope that by speaking today, \nyou absorbed a small amount of light, a small knowing that . . . \njustice was served, a small assurance that we are getting somewhere, \nand a big, big knowing that you are important, unquestionably, you are \nuntouchable, you are beautiful, you are to be valued, respected, \nundeniably, every minute of every day, you are powerful and nobody can \ntake that away from you.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3571-2", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3571-H3572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      VOLUNTEERING THE MIDWEST WAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate \nMinnesota-based company Sign-Zone for receiving a Manufacturers \nAlliance Manufacturer of the Year award for midsize businesses. Sign-\nZone is highly deserving of this award, as it is one of\n\n[[Page H3572]]\n\nthe fastest growing companies in the country as well as the Nation's \nleading provider in visual communication products and solutions.\n  Manufacturing is an incredibly important industry in the State of \nMinnesota. Our State is not only home to nearly 300,000 manufacturing \njobs, but the industry brings billions of dollars to our economy every \nyear, making it a key pillar of Minnesota's economy.\n  I commend Sign-Zone for bringing great business and excellent \nproducts to our community, but I also thank them for contributing to an \nindustry that is so critically vital to our State.\n  Congratulations, Sign-Zone, and thank you for what you contribute to \nthe great State of Minnesota.\n\n\n                  Minnesota's Own Presidential Scholar\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one of \nMinnesota's best and brightest, Sartell High School senior Gopi \nRamanathan, who was recently named a 2016 Presidential Scholar.\n  Every year, up to 161 students can be named Presidential Scholars, \nmaking it one of the highest awards a high school student can receive. \nIt is safe to say this achievement has gone to an incredibly deserving \nscholar.\n  Gopi Ramanathan has had an exceptionally successful high school \ncareer, and his resume includes a very long list of accolades and \nachievements. He is a two-time champion of the Minnesota State \nGeography Bee, and he was captain of the United States team that took \nfirst place at the 2013 National Geographic World Geography Bee.\n  Additionally, he is a member of the National Honor Society, a Big \nBrother mentor, a member of the student council, the president of the \nMinnesota Association of Student Councils, and a member of the Sartell \nsoccer team.\n  Perhaps most notably, Gopi earned a perfect score of 36 on his ACTs, \nan accomplishment that puts him in the top one-tenth of 1 percent of \nstudents across this country.\n  It is an honor to recognize a student of such distinction here today, \nand I can say with absolute certainty that we will see more great \nthings to come from this young man in the future.\n\n\n               Anoka Educator Honored at the White House\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate \nAnoka High School math teacher Paul Kelley for recently being honored \nat the White House in a ceremony for exceptional educators.\n  In addition to teaching math at Anoka High School for the past 29 \nyears, Mr. Kelley serves on the board of directors for the National \nCouncil of Teachers of Mathematics. Along with four other teachers from \naround the country, Mr. Kelley was nominated for this recognition by \nthe staff at the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics \nheadquarters.\n  During the ceremony at the White House, Paul had the chance to meet \nhundreds of other extraordinary teachers as well as the Secretary of \nEducation, John B. King, and Deputy Assistant to the President for \nEducation, Roberto Rodriguez. Mr. Kelley also heard from President \nObama, thanking the educators for their roles in educating today's \nyouth.\n  A good teacher molds minds, sparks creativity, and gives students \nkeys that can open all of life's doors.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Maxine Waters) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, today I rise once again \nto discuss the harsh realities of homelessness in America and to call \nattention to the Republicans' so-called poverty agenda that simply \nignores the fact that men, women, and children are sleeping on the \nstreets of America, eating out of garbage cans, and using our sidewalks \nand streets for restrooms.\n  Homelessness is one of the most tragic and disappointing reminders of \nthe overwhelming poverty in this country. According to the latest \nestimates, almost 600,000 Americans are homeless. It is a problem in \nvirtually every district, and it affects people from very different \nwalks of life: 37 percent of the homeless population are represented in \nfamilies, 15 percent are chronically homeless, 8 percent are veterans, \nand 6.5 percent are children.\n  While there is a claim that some progress has been made to decrease \nhomelessness in some communities, a lot more needs to be done, \nespecially in some of our largest cities where homelessness is, sadly, \nincreasing exponentially: in my hometown of Los Angeles, homelessness \nincreased 20 percent between 2014 and 2015; in New York City, \nhomelessness increased 11 percent between 2014 and 2015; and in \nChicago, there was an 8 percent increase in that timeframe.\n  As public policymakers and Members of Congress, we have a \nresponsibility to deal with problems and circumstances that undermine \nand harm our way of life. We are a people who cherish religion. In \nevery religion, there is a reference to feeding the hungry, housing the \nhomeless, and clothing the naked.\n  Where are the Republican Members who regularly hold prayer meetings, \nwho attend church on Sunday in their districts, but yet they are \nsupporting this fake poverty agenda that does not even mention \nhomelessness? Where are the Members who claim to honor our veterans, \nyet walk past them on the sidewalk in their tents and sleeping under \nour bridges?\n  We know that we can functionally end homelessness and alleviate \npoverty in this country. We know that Federal resources and the social \nsafety nets are incredibly effective at lifting up struggling families. \nWe know that if we properly support the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and other Federal agencies that we could create the \nnecessary housing units and provide the social services that our \nneighbors need to get off the streets.\n  What we need is, simply, the political will to get it done. \nUnfortunately, we do not have the support from Republicans whose sham \nof a poverty agenda released this week would only exacerbate \nhomelessness and punish the poor.\n  Take the Republican approach to housing assistance, for example. For \nyears, they have cut funding for HUD programs, leaving more than 75 \npercent of eligible families without any housing help at all. And their \nlatest poverty plan recycles some of the most harmful changes \nRepublicans have sought for our housing programs. They refuse to \nacknowledge the realities of unaffordable rents that require families \nto earn almost triple the minimum wage to be able to afford a modest \ntwo-bedroom apartment.\n  And they want to impose these so-called work requirements that simply \ndon't work if you ignore the already high unemployment rates in certain \nareas as well as the need to invest in job training, education, child \ncare, and other social services to make it possible for individuals to \nobtain stable employment. What the Republicans have put forth is truly \nthe wrong way forward.\n  Fortunately, Democrats know what it takes; and when we talk about \nissues of homelessness in particular, there is a very simple solution \nto this very real problem. That is why I have introduced H.R. 4888, the \nEnding Homelessness Act of 2016.\n  Now, a lot of people will say: Oh, my goodness, did you see how much \nmoney is in that bill? This bill would devote over $13 billion over 5 \nyears to housing assistance programs and create the housing units and \nservices that we so desperately need to get people off the streets.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  So while others will point to this bill and talk about the cost of \nit, the fact of the matter is, this is the richest country in the \nworld, and we spend money on so many other things that are not as \nimportant as taking care of our most vulnerable population.\n  So, yes, this is a $13 billion bill. We have to stop playing with \nthis issue and thinking it is going to go away simply because we don't \nwant to acknowledge it. We have to pay for the possibility of ending \nthis homelessness. I cannot bear the thought of children sleeping in \ntheir cars every night and getting up and going to school the next day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3572-2", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3572-H3573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ADDRESSING THE NATIONAL DEBT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Curbelo) for 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H3573]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss one of \nthe most serious issues facing the United States: the staggering \nnational debt of over $19 trillion. This equates to $59,409 for every \nperson living in our country.\n  While the national debt has grown almost $9 trillion since President \nObama was sworn in, here in Congress, we must work together to debate \nsolutions that will address our country's debt and get our fiscal house \nback in order. Every day, families in south Florida sit around the \ndinner table and make tough decisions on how they will spend their \nmoney. They stick to their budgets, and their government should be no \ndifferent.\n  Last October, I was proud to support a 2-year bipartisan budget \nagreement that implemented new caps on discretionary spending for both \nfiscal years 2016 and 2017. Too often, enormous sums are wasted due to \nunpredictable budget cycles and government shutdown threats. With the \nadoption of this 2-year budget, Congress was able to reduce wasteful \ngovernment spending by providing certainty to agencies as they plan for \nthe future.\n  The budget also contains reforms to entitlement programs. It is \nimportant that we protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--the \ninvaluable safety net for those who need the help--while working to \nimplement reforms to make these programs solvent for future \ngenerations.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to advance solutions that will rein in our national debt. \nIt is our duty as elected officials to leave our children and \ngrandchildren the same economic opportunities as previous generations \nhad. That is my highest priority in Congress.\n\n\n                       Recognizing Joseph Gebara\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Joseph \nGebara as he retires from his post as president of the Miami-Dade \nCounty Council PTA/PTSA. Mr. Gebara has been integral to the \norganization's mission of unlocking the potential present in every \nchild.\n  Mr. Gebara, who held his post since 2014, has always maintained an \nunwavering focus on his goals, and has used his position to effectively \nserve our community. For years he has been at the helm of a movement \nwhich seeks to engage with south Florida families and provide them with \nthe tools necessary to empower their children and set them on a path \ntowards success.\n  Mr. Gebara has been firmly rooted in the south Florida community, \nwhich is evident through his service as board member of The Children's \nTrust as well as chairman of the Miami-Dade Public Schools Title I \nDistrict Advisory Council. In those roles, Mr. Gebara worked tirelessly \nto facilitate collaboration between educators and families as well as \nincreasing inclusivity so that every voice was heard, respected, and \ntaken into consideration.\n  I commend Mr. Joe Gebara for his service to the south Florida \ncommunity, and congratulate him on a job well done. Mr. Speaker, I can \npersonally attest to the fact that he is the most passionate advocate \nfor children and families in our schools that I know.\n\n\n                       Homestead Veterans Clinic\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my strong \nsupport for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in allocating funds \nto create a new VA medical clinic in Homestead, Florida. As it \ncurrently stands, the Homestead Veterans Affairs Community Based \nOutpatient Clinic rents a medical office that does not meet the needs \nof military members and veterans in our south Florida community. With \nthe establishment of a new clinic, Homestead would be able to serve \nmore than 10,000 military personnel, veterans, and eligible family \nmembers in Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties, which would be a substantial \nimprovement from its current capabilities.\n  Though this new clinic would be a step forward, there is still \nsignificant work that must be done to help our veterans and \nservicemembers living in the Florida Keys. They do not have a local \nclinic and must travel up to 4 hours to reach the nearest VA facility. \nThese brave men and women deserve more easily accessible options, and I \nwill continue fighting for them.\n  Supporting our troops and veterans is essential to paying our \nprofound debt of gratitude to the very people who have put their lives \nin danger to defend our freedoms. It is because of brave people like \nour veterans that America continues to have the strongest military in \nthe world, and we must always honor them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3573-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3573-H3574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CREATING A BETTER NATION FOR MY NEW GRANDCHILD AND FUTURE GENERATIONS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Cardenas) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, Norma and I became \ngrandparents. Our daughter, Vanessa--with our son-in-law, Brian, \npresent--delivered a healthy baby boy, full of life and full of \npossibilities. His name is Joaquin Cruz de la Rosa.\n  From the moment I first learned I would soon be a grandfather, I was \nexcited to welcome our grandson into this great world. I am grateful \nthat Joaquin was born in the greatest nation in the history of time, \nthese United States of America, a country that strives to live the \nprinciples of hard work, persistence, and equality. He was born to a \nnation of native Americans and immigrants whose foundation and future \nrelies on the grit and determination of millions of people who will \npersist so their family can achieve that American Dream.\n  We were elected to the House of Representatives to serve all of our \nconstituents and put our country first. Joaquin's arrival has \nencouraged me to reflect on what we do here. He has made me think about \nhow Congress' words, actions, and obstructions are affecting the \nlivelihood of all Americans.\n  I want Joaquin to live in a nation where his right to love whomever \nhe chooses and to marry the person he falls in love with, regardless of \ngender, is respected. I am grateful that he was born healthy and in a \nsafe, clean hospital full of skilled doctors, nurses, and technicians.\n  I am also grateful Vanessa and Joaquin Cruz received top notch health \ncare, care that until recently was out of reach for many families. The \nAffordable Care Act has allowed countless pregnant women and newborn \ninfants to see a doctor without risking bankruptcy. This sets them on \nthe path of a healthy, productive life here in America. Now that 20 \nmillion more Americans have true access to health care, Congress must \nstop the efforts to repeal the healthcare law. Instead, we must come \ntogether to make sure we expand access, ensure the marketplace is \nworking, and keep health care affordable for all Americans in this \ngreat country.\n  Every Member of Congress has a responsibility to the next generation \nand the one after that. We are responsible for their future. We face a \nshort 12-week session in this 114th Congress.\n  What will we accomplish during this time? Will we vote on partisan \nbills that will go nowhere? Or will we face the challenges affecting \nour Nation and the world? Or will we, once and for all, think of the \nchildren and ensure future generations inherit a nation that remains \nthe global leader, full of opportunities?\n  We hold the power to make things better for our kids and grandkids. \nFor my grandson, and all grandchildren, I will fight for a future where \na quality education doesn't put students and families into 6-figure \ndebt. Every child deserves a world-class education that provides them \nwith the knowledge and skills to achieve their dreams and uphold our \nplace as a global leader in innovation.\n  For my grandson and grandchildren of his generation, I will continue \nto be a vocal advocate on the need to create a just and equal criminal \nand juvenile justice system that is worthy of our Nation. We spend \n$12,000 to educate a child in America, but we are willing to spend more \nthan $150,000 to imprison that child for 1 year. And yet every year \nfunding for education ends up on the chopping block.\n  How can we justify that?\n  My grandson was born into a great country, but sometimes, Mr. \nSpeaker, this Congress does not live up to the potential that this \nNation deserves. A child in the United States is less likely to die \nfrom a disease than from a gunshot. We are better than that, Mr. \nSpeaker. It is our responsibility to address this reality.\n\n[[Page H3574]]\n\n  We must work together for my grandson and all the children of his \ngeneration to make sure our parks are greener, our air is cleaner, to \ncure the sickness that is taking our climate, to make sure that a \nfather or mother, no matter what their economic circumstances, does not \nhave to worry that their child's bathwater is poisoned. This is our \njob.\n  It is our job to be leaders, and I will work with my colleagues every \nday to live up to what our grandchildren deserve. Far too often I hear \nelected officials spew the same line: ``We are mortgaging our \nchildren's future.'' Our parents and grandparents invested in our \nNation, and we have reaped those benefits. It is time that we do the \nsame for future generations.\n  That is what has made us the greatest economy in the world: investing \nin our roads and bridges, investing in schools and hospitals, in \nforward-thinking legislation that will serve others for generations to \ncome. Now more than ever, I understand just how important it is that we \nwork together and create solutions so that our children will live a \nbetter life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3574-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           YOUTH PROMISE ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Webster of Florida). The Chair \nrecognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to an \nincredibly important piece of legislation that will provide essential \nfunding for programs which will go miles toward helping every young \nperson in America who has maybe had a misstep reach their potential and \nachieve their American Dream.\n  As I travel my district, I am so impressed as I meet some of the most \nincredible young people in north central Florida. These young Americans \nhave the capability of literally changing the world and the capability \nof bettering their communities and setting a positive example for the \nyouth that will follow in their footsteps.\n  Unfortunately, too many will fall victim to the circumstances in \nwhich they were born. Too many will become familiar with the inside of \na juvenile detention facility, as the image of the classroom fades from \nmemory, and the all-too-often reality of life behind bars begins to \nmaterialize. I want to stress that if this happens to even just one \nchild, that is one child too many.\n  We live in the greatest nation on Earth. We tell our children they \ncan be whatever they want to be when they grow up, yet we know the \nreality for some is that as these very words are spoken, there is no \ntruth to them. These are the youth who fall subject to the cradle-to-\nprison pipeline, and it is unacceptable.\n  These are the children in our communities, children who go to school \nwith our own kids and, yes, in some cases even our own children. We \nhave the ability to change their reality. H.R. 2197, the Youth PROMISE \nAct, will do just that. The Youth PROMISE Act establishes a PROMISE \nAdvisory Panel of State representatives as well as local PROMISE \nCoordinating Councils, which will develop and implement evidence-based \nlocally controlled--not Washington-controlled--youth violence \nprevention and intervention practices and mentorship opportunities.\n  These practices will occur on a community level, working with \nfamilies, working with schools, nonprofits, juvenile justice advocates, \nand law enforcement officers to intervene early in a child's life to \nprevent them from starting down a path that can easily define the \nremainder of their lives.\n  Last Congress, the Youth PROMISE Act garnered the bipartisan support \nof over 130 Members of this body in Congress, yet it sat in committee \nfor nearly 2 years. This Congress, the Youth PROMISE Act has sat in the \nHouse Committee on Education and the Workforce for over 400 days \nwithout action.\n  Our youth cannot continue to wait. There are many issues that \nCongress deals with which Republicans, Democrats, and Independents \ncannot agree upon, but this is not one of them. If they have not \nalready, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this vital piece of \nlegislation. I urge leadership in the House and the Senate to bring up \nthis bill for a vote, a vote for our challenged youth so that they may \ncontinue the great posterity of this Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3574-2", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3574-H3575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1100\n                HONORING THE LIFE OF MARIA L. GUTIERREZ\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a good \nfriend and community leader, Maria L. Gutierrez.\n  Maria led her life with purpose. She wanted to make a positive \ndifference, and there is no doubt that she did that. She served as the \ngeneral manager of Univision in Fresno, California, and led the \ntelevision station to be one of the highest-ranking stations not only \nin the San Joaquin Valley, but in the Nation.\n  She was a strong advocate for immigration reform, equal rights for \nwomen, and worked hard to bring more water to the Valley. She cared, \nshe had a big heart, and she was a role model for all who knew her.\n  We miss Maria dearly, especially that big smile that she always had \non her face.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me and Maria's family and \nfriends in paying tribute to her life. May she rest in peace.\n\n\n                        Immigrant Heritage Month\n\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize June as Immigrant \nHeritage Month.\n  We are a Nation of Native Americans and of immigrants past and \nimmigrants present. That is America. For over 250 years, since the \nformation of the United States, immigrants have helped make our country \nwhat it is today. They add energy and value with each generation of \nAmericans.\n  California's San Joaquin Valley, which I proudly represent, is home \nto people whose families come from all over the world. Their story is \nour story. It is one of achieving the American Dream, which is my \nfamily's story.\n  I am fortunate to represent and live in an area with some of the \nhardest working people you will ever meet in your life who have made \nlasting contributions to the San Joaquin Valley's agriculture economy, \nbusinesses, education, and healthcare systems. Their contributions have \nhad positive impacts not only in California, but throughout the Nation.\n  Hispanic, Armenian, Italian, Portuguese, Sikh, and Hmong immigrants \nare among the many who have come from Asia, the Americas, Africa, and \nEurope to call America their home.\n  These immigrant families, for generations, have been and always will \nbe a cornerstone of a place that we call the United States of America. \nThey are living out the American Dream, and their children and \ngrandchildren continue to add value and make a positive difference in \nour valley and the Nation.\n  Degrading immigrant communities is not an American value. Name-\ncalling is not a virtue and never should be condoned. Insinuating that \nsomeone is not qualified based on their ethnicity and heritage is \ncompletely unacceptable, especially coming from someone who wants to be \nleader of the free world.\n  The sad reality is that some individuals are going to use hateful \nrhetoric to tear us apart. It is wrong. But we must always remember \nthat the bonds we share as Americans are far, far stronger than \nwhatever differences we may have.\n  Wrongly questioning a judge's objectivity because of his ethnic \nbackground is pure and simple racism. It is not the American way. We \nare better than that. And, Mr. Trump, you should apologize for your \nhurtful statements.\n  Instead of talking about a wall to keep people out, our next \nPresident must focus on efforts to pass comprehensive immigration \nreform so that we can fix our Nation's broken immigration system. As I \nsaid, we are a Nation of immigrants. And that is one of the reasons why \nthe United States is the greatest Nation in the world, period.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues and all Americans to join in \ncelebrating immigrant communities throughout our great Nation by \nrecognizing June as Immigrant Heritage Month.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Phoenixville \nstudents installed a ``bioswale'' to help absorb runoff and reduce \npollution in Pickering Creek to keep their communities beautiful and \nhealthy.\n  For their efforts, the Schuylkill Action Network presented the \nSchuylkill Scholastic Drinking Water Award to these hardworking club \nmembers from both schools.\n  Let me also recognize the Schuylkill Action Network and many \nwatershed organizations across my district that do a great job \nprotecting our watersheds.\n  I want to congratulate these students for their ingenuity to keep the \nwater in our congressional district clean and safe for our community.\n\n\n                Sarah Pennington/Mental Health Awareness\n\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank \nSarah Pennington for her courageous leadership on mental health.\n  Sarah is a courageous, dynamic, hardworking high school student at \nPottsgrove High School, and the reigning Miss Freedom Forge's \nOutstanding Teen. She visited my office yesterday to bring attention to \nmental health issues and to discuss relevant policy reforms.\n  Sarah has not graduated high school yet, of course, but she has \nalready founded a nonprofit, Show Your Hero, with the goal of raising \nmental health awareness.\n  I want to thank Sarah for her advocacy. I also have some exciting \nnews. Sarah will be participating in Miss PA's Outstanding Teen pageant \nfrom June 22 to June 24 in Pittsburgh. I want to wish her the very best \nin that pursuit.\n\n\n             First Responders in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania\n\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \nacknowledge the work of Phoenixville first responders.\n  Recently, West End Ambulance and the Phoenixville Fire and Police \nDepartments responded to a call for help. These devoted crews assisted \nan individual who went into cardiac arrest. Through their swift efforts \nto administer CPR, the responders were able to save a life.\n  The Chester County EMS Council recognized the responders for their \nexpertise on May 28, coinciding with National Emergency Medical \nServices Week, which honors those serving on our communities' front \nlines every day.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend and thank these and all firefighters, \nofficers, EMTs, and paramedics for their service.\n\n\n              State Outreach for Local Veterans Employment\n\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak \nabout a bill I introduced in the House called the SOLVE Act, short for \nthe State Outreach for Local Veterans Employment Act.\n  The SOLVE Act will provide Pennsylvania, and all States, with \ncritical flexibility to utilize existing grant funds in the way that \nbest serves the needs of each State's unique veteran population.\n  The American Legion, Paralyzed Veterans of America and National Guard \nAssociation of the United States, have all endorsed this commonsense \nbill.\n  I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this bill as well.\n\n\n               Recognizing Wilson Southern Middle School\n\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Wilson \nSouthern Middle School as one of six exemplary middle schools in \nPennsylvania recognized as a school to watch. I also thank the \nteachers, administrators, parents, faculty, and students for their hard \nwork in making Wilson Southern Middle School such an exceptional middle \nschool. We are very proud of you.\n\n\n           Bringing Postpartum Depression Out of the Shadows\n\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in \nsupport of Bringing Postpartum Depression Out of the Shadows Act.\n  Every year, one in seven new mothers experiences perinatal \ndepression, impacting babies and families for years to come.\n  This bipartisan legislation, which I have cosponsored with \nCongresswoman Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, would help those \nsuffering receive the treatment they need. States would receive Federal \nfunding to establish, expand, or maintain programs for screening and \ntreatment of maternal depression.\n  Thanks to the tireless efforts of mental health advocates, we have \nreached over 65 bipartisan cosponsors in the House. I am respectfully \nencouraging other Members and their staffs to look at this bill and \njoin as cosponsors. It is the right thing to do as we seek to \nproactively address issues of postpartum depression in communities \nacross this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3575-2", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3575-H3576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am a Member of the United States \nCongress and a very--I hate to use the term proud, but I am proud to \nhave been a member of the Judiciary Committee for the number of years \nthat I have served in this august place.\n  As I serve, I am well aware of the importance of the Constitution and \nthe very sacred responsibility that we have in protecting it. So I \nthought that, as a lawyer who has practiced and one who has served as \nan associate municipal court judge in my hometown of Houston, Texas, it \nwould be important to remind Members of the established three branches \nof government and the responsibilities that each hold, but focus in \nparticular on the executive--the President of the United States.\n  In Article II, the Constitution, says: ``The executive Power shall be \nvested in a President of the United States of America.'' It uses the \nterm that ``he should hold,'' and, in particular, it acknowledges that \nhe or she should take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n  Article III establishes our judicial power. In particular, with \nrespect to Federal courts: ``all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising \nunder this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties \nmade, under their Authority.''\n  All of these cases have jurisdiction under our Federal court system. \nSo, the Federal courts and jurists are of keen importance.\n  One would wonder how we establish the need for the rule of law and \nseparation of powers. It came first from 1215, King John's Magna Carta, \nwhich indicated that no one should be imprisoned, dispossessed, \noutlawed, exiled, or in any way destroyed, except by lawful judgment of \nhis peers and the law of the land.\n  I know that when I sat as a member of the bench, I would look at \npetitioners and I would hope that even though my history was that of a \nformer slave, being an African American--when I say a former slave, \ndescendants of such; the history of African Americans is such--and I \nwould hope that my background would not have countered the fairness \nthat I would have rendered to anyone who came before me.\n  Judicial independence is something that we hold dear. The Founders \nunderstood that judges who are able to apply the law freely and fairly \nare essential to the rule of law.\n  The Constitution guarantees our rights on paper, but this would mean \nnothing without independent courts to protect them. That means our \njudges in the Federal system should not be intimidated or influenced or \nprotected\n\n[[Page H3576]]\n\nfrom the influence of the other branches, as well as shifting popular \nopinion.\n  This insulation is referred to as judicial independence. It allows \nour Federal judges to make decisions based on what is right under the \nlaw, without facing politics, such as not getting reelected; or, \npersonal, such as getting fired or having their salary lowered.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have often joined with the \nlate Henry Hyde, then the chairman, who wanted to raise the salaries of \nour Federal judges.\n  So I think it is imperative to come before this body, my colleagues, \nto raise great angst when someone's ethnicity is called out as a reason \nthat they cannot be fair.\n  I am appalled that we have come to this in 2016, where, if I were to \nsymbolically ascend to a Federal bench, or maybe the colleagues who \nmany of us and the Senate have supported and the President has \nnominated--the diverse bench that represents Asians, Hispanics, African \nAmericans, and women and men, Anglos, Caucasians--anyone would raise a \nquestion.\n  I have been before a court and not welcomed the decision. There have \nbeen many reasons why I was not pleased with that decision. But I could \nnot raise the question of race.\n  And so I think it is worth condemning that we would have this kind of \npublic discourse where the race of a Federal judge is raised. Remember \nwhat I said: judicial independence warrants that we, in fact, cannot \nintimidate the bench and not, in fact, deny the freedom of the court to \ndecide cases based on facts and the law, not based on public opinion, \nthe views of special interests groups, or even a judge's own personal \nbelief.\n  The right of every citizen to a fair trial is a cornerstone of our \ndemocracy. Why should anyone be diminished, and why should the \npetitioner independently attempt to intimidate based on race? It is \nappalling. It is absurd.\n  So I ask all of my colleagues, as protectors of the Constitution and \npeople who are here making laws, to independently go out to the \nhighways and byways of life and condemn those words. Need I say who it \nis? Condemn those words and condemn this kind of discourse.\n  I would offer to say that anyone who has said those words and who \npretends to put themselves forward to uphold this Constitution is \ndisqualified and unfit.\n  I would hope that we will have an independent executive under the \nConstitution, an independent legislative branch, and, of course, an \nindependent judiciary--one of which I respect with the highest of \nauthority.\n  I will close by simply saying I have won cases; I have saved a \nhospital. I have lost cases. I have been affected by cases in my \nredistricting and denied the rights of the Voting Rights Act. But I \nwill never undermine and diminish the Constitution for right cases and \nwrong cases, ever.\n  I ask my colleagues to condemn those actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3576-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1115\n                   CONGRATULATING ARMANDO VALLADARES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my dear \nfriend and a true patriot, Ambassador Armando Valladares, for being \nawarded the Canterbury Medal, the highest honor bestowed by The Becket \nFund for Religious Liberty.\n  Armando Valladares spent 22 years in Castro's gulags. He endured \nunconscionable torture while in prison. Why, Mr. Speaker? Because \nArmando refused to put a sign on his desk saying that he supported \nFidel Castro.\n  No matter how much abuse he endured in prison, Armando fought his \njailers every day. He protected his conscience from the constant and \nongoing attacks of the brutal Communist dictatorship.\n  In 1988, President Ronald Reagan installed Armando Valladares as our \nU.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Council.\n  Earlier this year, Ambassador Valladares wrote about President \nObama's misguided and dangerous overtures to the Castro regime--one-\nsided negotiations. In a recent op-ed that Armando Valladares wrote, he \nsaid: ``In agreeing to meet with Raul Castro, Obama rewards a regime \nthat rules with brutal force and systematically violates human \nrights.''\n  Ambassador Valladares, thank you for your courage. Thank you for your \nprincipled stand against the Castro regime. Godspeed, my friend.\n\n\n            Commemorating Deering Estate's 100th Anniversary\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of one of south Florida's most notable cultural, \nhistorical, environmental, and archaeological treasures, the Charles \nDeering Estate, located in my beautiful congressional district.\n  Charles Deering, the first chairman of the board of International \nHarvester, bought the property in the year 1916. Now, as a jewel of the \nMiami-Dade County Parks, Recreation and Open Spaces system, the 444-\nacre Deering Estate serves as a center of community life in the very \ngroovy village of Palmetto Bay.\n  It also conserves globally endangered native plant communities and is \na focal point for the ongoing Biscayne Bay coastal wetlands restoration \nthat aims to re-create more natural freshwater flows and to slow \nsaltwater intrusion into our drinking water sources as sea levels rise. \nAnd the sea levels are, indeed, rising due to global climate change.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Deering Estate's future will be just as important as \nits past to all of south Florida.

This bill \nhas serious implications to every taxpayer in the country.\n  PROMESA applies a form of chapter 9 bankruptcy to the general \nobligation bonds of Puerto Rico that are guaranteed by the \nCommonwealth's constitution.\n  Article VI, section 8 of Puerto Rico's constitution explicitly \nprovides that ``interest on the public debt and amortization thereof \nshall first be paid.''\n  Well, this bill ignores the Puerto Rican constitution and breaks that \npromise, and here is why this is so important to the rest of the \ncountry:\n  Every State government has similar constitutional provisions that \nguarantee its general obligation bonds. This is what allows States to \nborrow at extremely low interest rates: because their debt is \nconstitutionally guaranteed and, therefore, the risk of default is \nextremely low.\n  If Congress is willing to undermine a territory's constitutionally \nguaranteed bonds today, there is every reason to believe it would be \nwilling to undermine a State's guarantee tomorrow. This, in turn, \ninvites credit markets to question such guarantees as being no longer \nsecured on constitutional bedrock but, rather, dependent upon the \nshifting whims of Congress. This, in turn, means the value of these \nbonds is devalued, and interest rates paid by taxpayers on that debt \nwill increase.\n  The Governors of six States have already raised this warning, and the \nU.S. Virgin Islands, whose credit is directly undermined by PROMESA, \nwants out of the bill for the same reason.\n  Now, PROMESA could have respected the $18 billion of constitutionally \nguaranteed debt and focused instead on restructuring the $54 billion of \nPuerto Rican municipal debt that is not constitutionally guaranteed. \nAfter all, there is no reason to treat San Juan's municipal debt any \ndifferently than San Jose's. But constitutionally issued debt is \nfundamentally different, and its reliability must be maintained. \nTellingly, supporters of this bill voted down just such an amendment in \ncommittee.\n  Supporters have said they have addressed this concern by inserting \ninstructions to the control board to ``respect the relative lawful \npriorities in the constitution, other laws or agreements.'' But \nironically, one of those\n\n[[Page H3577]]\n\n``other laws'' the control board is instructed to respect is the \ngovernment's repudiation of that debt.\n  Furthermore, the same section instructs the control board to provide \n``adequate funding for public pension systems'' and includes other \ncontradictory instructions. The only possible interpretation of these \nprovisions is that the sanctity of the sovereign debt is subject to \nbalancing and, therefore, subordination to junior claims by the control \nboard.\n  Just last week, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and the White House \nadmitted that this was both the intent and effect of the bill.\n  Meanwhile, another provision of PROMESA prevents lawful bondholders \nfrom enforcing their claims in court for a period of 6 months but \ndoesn't prevent the government from paying out junior claims during \nthis period. Indeed, in anticipation of this bill, the new budget for \nPuerto Rico increases general fund spending, while it radically reduces \nits debt service payments.\n  Honoring the rule of law and maintaining the Commonwealth's full \nfaith and credit guarantee would be a powerful signal to bond markets \nthat the United States stands by its promises, even when it is \ninconvenient.\n  Under current law, it is in the interest of both sides, debtor and \ncreditor, to work out terms that both can live with to restructure and \nrepay this debt. Indeed, until the prospect of a congressional rescue \narose, Puerto Rico was negotiating terms of a debt restructuring with \nthe mutual consent of its creditors.\n  It is also in the interest of the people of Puerto Rico to uphold the \nfull faith and credit clause of their constitution, which will be \nvitally important for them to reenter the credit market once their \naffairs are put back in order.\n  Puerto Rico faces both crisis and opportunity: a crisis born of \nslavish devotion to failed leftist economic policies, and an \nopportunity to replace those policies with proven free market solutions \nthat can create a fresh start for the people of Puerto Rico and shine \nas a beacon of hope for other similarly afflicted States.\n  I fear the net result of this legislation will be to spread the \ncrisis to other States with heavy debts by increasing their debt \nservice costs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3577-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PAYING TRIBUTE TO J. RANDY JACKSON\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Westmoreland) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my \nfriend, a friend of Georgia's Third Congressional District, and a \nfriend of all Georgia, J. Randy Jackson, chief administrative officer \nfor Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia, who tragically passed away on the \nafternoon of May 20, 2016.\n  Randy was the first American employee hired for Kia's plant in \nGeorgia. He not only became the public face for Kia Motors in Georgia, \nbut an advocate for the continued creation and development of \nemployment opportunities for Georgians.\n  When he came to Kia, and when Kia came to West Point, Georgia, West \nPoint was a struggling city affected by the textile plant closings. But \nunder Randy's leadership ability to bring people together for the good \nof all, both Kia and West Point have thrived. Today, Kia is responsible \nfor 15,000 jobs at the plant and in the surrounding community.\n  Mr. Jackson played a key role in hiring thousands of those employees. \nA passionate worker, his enthusiasm for Kia and creating jobs \ncultivated a workplace that both blended corporate business and human \nneeds.\n  Randy had an almost unique way about him. Somehow, he was able to be \ncomfortable and at ease while projecting that he had full control over \nevery situation that might arise. Randy's way was a remarkable blend of \npersonality, caring, and expertise.\n  Randy's presence was felt beyond the walls of Kia--and will be for \nmany years to come. He was, for example, involved in the THINC Academy, \nwhich strives to support the education of future generations of good \nemployees.\n  While Randy Jackson was a dedicated company man, he was also a \ndevoted family man. He is survived by his wife of 35 years, Deborah \nJackson. He was the proud father of two children, James Randall \nJackson, Jr., of Kentucky, and Jennifer Caley Jackson of Milner, \nGeorgia. His parents, James Edward and Pauline Greer Jackson of Macon, \nGeorgia, and a sister, Delbra Jackson Hayes, of Perry, Georgia, also \nsurvive him. Mr. Jackson was a very loving and doting grandparent to \nhis granddaughter, Scarlett Anne. Mr. Jackson also had softness in his \nheart for his beloved Rat Terrier, Rambo Brodie.\n  Randy lived a life of hard work and love. He inspired those around \nhim ``to make every day better than yesterday.'' His loss will be long \nfelt at Kia and in the entire community. He made both better from his \npresence.\n  At the plant, they talk about the Kia Way, emphasizing teamwork and \nproblem solving to make progress. We all know that Randy's way was the \nKia Way. The community and the plant will go on; the plant he helped to \nmake sure that it would, but it won't be quite the same without him.\n  Thanks, Randy, and until we meet again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3577-2", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HONORING PORT ALLEGANY, PENNSYLVANIA, ON ITS 200TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to observe \nthe 200th anniversary of the community of Port Allegany, McKean County, \nin Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District.\n  Port Allegany was founded in 1816 as Canoe Place, located just 30 \nmiles from the headwaters of the Allegheny River. True to its name--\nPort Allegany, which was bestowed in 1838--the settlement served as a \nport along the river for Native Americans and pioneers who would stop \nto build or repair canoes before traveling along the river.\n  Later in its history, Port Allegany became known for its glass \nmanufacturing.\n  The first plant of the Pittsburgh Corning Corporation was constructed \nthere in 1937, and glass block used in construction all over America \nare still built there.\n  Today you can still find people enjoying the outdoors in the \nsettlement first known as Canoe Place. Tourism is a big part of the \ntown's economy, with visitors enjoying canoeing, kayaking, and fishing.\n  The celebration of Port Allegany's anniversary will kick off Sunday \nand run through June 18 with plenty of activities, including an ice \ncream social, Pioneers Day picnic, a car cruise, and wagon rides.\n\n\n        Honoring Former Oil City Police Officer Stanley Fedorek\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of \nStanley Fedorek, a former police officer in Oil City, located in \nVenango County in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District. Mr. \nFedorek was recognized just this week as the oldest member of the \nFraternal Order of Police in Pennsylvania at the age of 98.\n  Fedorek has been a member of the Fraternal Order of Police for 68 \nyears and received a certificate of appreciation and a commemorative \nletter from the organization.\n  Mr. Speaker, Stanley Fedorek is also a veteran, serving as a first \nsergeant in the United States Army in Italy during World War II. He \njoined the Oil City Police Department following his discharge and \nserved as an officer up until 1968. He later worked security at Mellon \nBank.\n  Mr. Fedorek has only missed two meetings in his time as a member of \nthe Fraternal Order of Police, and he was still driving himself to \nthose meetings at 95 years of age.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Fedorek for his service to the Oil City \ncommunity and to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3577-3", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3577-H3578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, years of drought have left a terrible toll \non the forests of the Sierra Nevada in California. The Forest Service \nestimates that there are at least 40 million trees that have died in \nCalifornia alone. The scope of this challenge is almost unbelievable, \nand the danger it presents is nearly unavoidable. However, there are \nsteps that we can take to address it.\n  While it is refreshing that the Forest Service is finally using the \ncategorical exclusions that have been authorized under the recent farm \nbill to speed forest management projects, it won't be enough to prevent \nforest fires of devastating sizes and scopes. The Forest Service should \nrapidly increase the numbers of public-private partnerships it engages \nin and allow the private sector to remove the dead trees that are just \nwaiting for a spark.\n  The Senate should act immediately to pass H.R. 2647 and allow forest \nfires\n\n[[Page H3579]]\n\nto be funded like earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters \nso as to end the diversion of forest management funding that limits \npreemptive fuel reduction work.\n  We also need to incentivize technologies like the usage of biomass, \nwhich can make productive use of damaged trees and brush, et cetera, \nand can generate long-term renewable power--base-load, reliable power.\n  Congress should act to extend the same tax incentives that wind and \nsolar power receive to biomass plants, which don't just create power \nbut do so more reliably and which have the additional benefit of \nconsuming wood and slash that would otherwise burn in our forests, \ncausing pollution. This would also bring jobs back, which are much \nneeded in the rural part of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3579-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MUHAMMAD ALI\n\n  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, last week, the world lost a champion. Muhammad \nAli was a gold medalist boxer and a three-time heavyweight champ, but \nwhat truly made him ``The Greatest'' was what he did outside of the \nring.\n  He had quick reflexes but a quicker wit. He was introduced to the \nworld as a fighter, but he chose to hang up his gloves to stand up \nagainst the war. At a time when racism pushed so many people down, \nMuhammad Ali had the audacity to speak up--and people listened.\n  I was lucky to have met Muhammad Ali several times. He spent much of \nhis time in Los Angeles, and he became close with my dad, L.A. County \nSupervisor Kenneth Hahn. They were allies in the fight for civil rights \nand for struggling families.\n  I have a Muhammad Ali story.\n  In 1987, my dad suffered a debilitating stroke that left him \npartially paralyzed shortly before he was up for reelection to his 10th \nterm. Muhammad Ali actually showed up at my parents' home in South Los \nAngeles one day, and he told my father that he would personally push \nhim door-to-door in his wheelchair if that is what it took to get him \nreelected.\n  You can imagine what that meant to my dad, to me, and to all of the \nneighborhood kids who actually saw Muhammad Ali do that with my dad. I \nwill never forget that moment, and the world will never forget Muhammad \nAli.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3579-2", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING CAPTAIN BRADLEY LONG\n\n  (Mr. McHENRY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. McHENRY.

In fact, he started volunteering as a junior firefighter \nwhen he was just 14 years old at the Sherrills Ford-Terrell Fire and \nRescue.

They are \nafraid that, if their parents find out, they may be tossed out of the \nhouse, that their classmates will taunt them, and there are still \npoliticians who say that they are not equal.\n  For years, these young people didn't believe they had any options, \nbut, today, because of the work of the LGBT community and because of \nleaders like Harvey Milk, they have hope. They can run for public \noffice; they can serve in our military; they can marry whom they love. \nThey have hope for a better future, but there is still work to be done.\n  Across the country, including in Florida, LGBT Americans can still be \ndiscriminated against. That is why Congress must pass the Equality Act. \nWe must pass it because it is the right thing to do. We must pass it \nfor the young person who is still scared and struggling. We must pass \nit to give them hope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3579-4", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMEMORATING SOUTH CAROLINA STATE GUARD WEEK\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.

They respond quickly to work to \nhelp families recover after natural disasters. The South Carolina State \nGuard was crucial during the flooding last October. This 1,000-year \nflood devastated many neighborhoods. Members from all three brigades of \nthe State Guard worked around the clock in filling sandbags and in \nassisting engineers and law enforcement.\n  I was grateful to visit disaster relief centers firsthand, which was \ncoordinated with the State Guard, and I was accompanied by \nRepresentatives Kirkman Finlay and Chip Huggins.\n  Our citizens really appreciate the command staff of the South \nCarolina State Guard for leading and inspiring these members: Major \nGeneral Thomas Mullikin, Brigadier General Richard Leonard, Brigadier \nGeneral Leon Lott, and Command Sergeant Major Mark Freeman.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n  Our sympathy to the people of Tel Aviv as the latest victims of \nIslamic terrorists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3579-5", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                     HONORING OFFICER VERDELL SMITH\n\n  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. COHEN.

You know what, we are better than that.\n  We know that the diversity of our Nation makes us greater. So \nwhenever racism rears its ugly head, all of us, Democrats and \nRepublicans, have an obligation to reject it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have been very disturbed to see so many of my \nRepublican colleagues trying to tiptoe around the offensive behavior of \nthe new leader of their party, Donald Trump.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to do the right thing and reject racist \npolicies without any ifs, ands, or buts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3580-2", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING ILLINOIS' 18TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT SERVICE ACADEMY \n                               APPOINTEES\n\n  (Mr. LaHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. LaHOOD.

These cadets and midshipmen are not only at the \ntop of their class in academic achievements, but they also excel in \nextracurricular activities. We have a State wrestling champion, a \nhockey player who will be playing for the Air Force Academy, and a \ncompetitive golfer who will be playing at the Naval Academy.\n  Most importantly, I was struck by their earnest commitment to serving \nour country.

They \nstruggle to save for a home. They struggle to live the American Dream \nthat we all yearn for, and that is unacceptable.\n  That is why I support expanding programs, which I believe help and \nprovide a social safety net.

Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA \nhas used the National Ambient Air Quality Standards to impose costly \nand burdensome regulations on American manufacturers and the American \npeople.\n  By the EPA choosing to lower the NAAQ Standards further, many \nbusinesses will suffer while still struggling to meet the original \nstandard. American businesses have already spent billions of dollars \nand years of planning to meet the 75 parts per billion original\n\n[[Page H3581]]\n\nstandard and will now find themselves unable to meet the new \nrequirements. We can't and shouldn't change the rules in the middle of \nthe game.\n  Businesses across America and in Georgia 12, like many paper mills \nand manufacturing plants that are economic drivers in our area, have \nalready spent billions to make our air cleaner.\n  H.R. 4775 ensures that States and counties have the needed \nflexibility and time to comply with these standards while keeping our \nair clean and safe.\n  I am proud to support this bill and commend my colleagues in the \nHouse for passing it this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3581-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HATEFUL RHETORIC\n\n  (Mr. CROWLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, if I were to stand here today and read an \nagenda on attacks on immigrants, Muslims, women, and families living in \npoverty and even the judicial system, you might think it was the \ncampaign platform for the Republican candidate for President. But every \none of those hasn't just come from ``Con Man Don.''\n  They have been embraced, affirmed, and in many cases even inspired by \nthis Republican Congress. So you could be forgiven for being confused \nbecause the truth is they are all one and the same.\n  We are used to this hateful rhetoric coming from the other side of \nthe aisle. Sometimes it is masked in legislation; sometimes not so \nmuch.\n  But when the leader of their party, their standard-bearer, ``Con Man \nDon'' makes racist and discriminatory remarks as easily as if he were \nreciting the alphabet, it begs the question: ``What do Republicans \nstand for?''\n  You only have to look at all they have in common with ``Con Man \nDon,'' a candidate they have even admitted has made racist statements. \nIt is clear they stand with ``Con Man Don,'' but it is also clear who \nthey don't stand with and, that is, the American people.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House \n     on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the \n     bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made \n     in order as original text. The previous question shall be \n     considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to \n     final passage without intervening motion except one motion to \n     recommit with or without instructions.\n       Sec. 2.  Upon passage of H.R. 5278 the House shall be \n     considered to have: (1) stricken all after the enacting \n     clause of S. 2328 and inserted in lieu thereof the provisions \n     of H.R. 5278, as passed by the House; and (2) passed the \n     Senate bill as so amended.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The gentleman from \nAlabama is recognized for 1 hour.\n\n[[Page H3582]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Alabama?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 770 provides for \nconsideration of H.R. 5278, the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and \nEconomic Stability Act, or PROMESA. The resolution provides for a \nstructured rule and makes in order eight amendments.\n  This bill addresses a very serious issue as it relates to the \nfinancial situation in Puerto Rico. The Government of Puerto Rico has \nracked up over $118 billion in debt. They have already defaulted on \nportions of their debt in May, and they face another deadline on July \n1. The territory has reached a point where they can no longer meet the \nbasic demands of their citizens.\n  The Constitution makes clear that Congress has the authority over \nterritories. Article IV, section 3, clause 2 of the Constitution \nstates: ``The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all \nneedful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other \nProperty belonging to the United States . . . ''\n  After hearing calls for greater autonomy, in 1950 Congress recognized \nPuerto Rico's authority over internal matters through passage of the \nFederal Relations Act. Congress also approved Puerto Rico's \nconstitution in 1952.\n  So we gave them the control they demanded, and with that, they \nattempted to become a liberal paradise by raising taxes, expanding \ngovernment programs, and spending at unsustainable rates. To help pay \nfor these policies, Puerto Rico issued billions of dollars in bonded \ndebt that they can no longer pay back. Now they are demanding help, \nwhich puts Congress in a very difficult position.\n  The fact that we have reached this point is a direct result of the \nPresident and the Treasury Department being asleep at the switch. They \neither were not paying attention to the financial situation in Puerto \nRico or they were paying attention and chose to do nothing.\n  I want to highlight a few important things about this bill. First, \nthis bill is not a bailout. The American taxpayers did not create this \nproblem, and we shouldn't send their money to something they did not \ncause.\n  What really worries me is that if Congress doesn't act on this \nlegislation, then we will find ourselves in a position at some point \nfacing serious pressure to vote on a true actual bailout of Puerto \nRico. That would be a grave mistake.\n  As the president of Americans for Tax Reform noted in an op-ed for \nthe National Review, ``Congress needs to step in now; otherwise, a huge \ntaxpayer bailout is the likely outcome. PROMESA is the best, most \nfiscally responsible way to prevent a bailout from occurring.''\n  This bill does not include a single penny in taxpayer money. In fact, \nthe Congressional Budget Office found that this bill would have ``no \nsignificant net effect on the Federal deficit.'' So let's try and get \nthis problem resolved in a fiscally responsible way that does not use \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  Second, the policies in Puerto Rico have led to this problem, so it \nis important that the legislation address some of these policies and \nrequire greater accountability. The bill does this through the creation \nof a seven-person financial oversight board which is responsible for \nthe development of budgets and fiscal plans for Puerto Rico.\n  The bill also includes some commonsense policy changes that will \nhopefully ease the burdens on the Puerto Rican Government by \nprohibiting the costly new overtime rule from taking effect and giving \nthem flexibility with minimum wage requirements for young workers.\n  Through better oversight and regulatory reforms, it is my belief the \nPuerto Rican economy can grow and the country can get back on a more \nstable financial footing.\n  I want to make one thing very clear. I and every Member of this House \nhave great empathy and appreciation for the Puerto Rican people because \nthey did not cause this problem. I have had the honor of traveling to \nPuerto Rico and visiting this beautiful place. I enjoyed meeting the \npeople and really appreciated their hospitality. I believe it is \nimportant we do what we can in a responsible manner to support the \nPuerto Rican people.\n  Ultimately, I wish this legislation wasn't necessary, but the reality \nof the situation demands action. So I call on my colleagues to support \nthis rule, support the underlying bill, and let's address this problem \nin a responsible way without a bailout.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Alabama, for \nyielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.\n  The people of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico face an urgent fiscal \ncrisis, and this institution's delay in addressing this crisis has left \nthe United States citizens on that island in dire straits.\n  In June of 2015, Puerto Rico's Governor stated that the Commonwealth \nwould not be able to pay its debts. Now Puerto Rico faces a $2 billion \ninterest and principal payment on July 1. It is unlikely the \nCommonwealth will be able to make this payment. So I am pleased that, \nfinally, after a full year, this body has decided that the citizens in \nthe Commonwealth deserve relief from this growing humanitarian \ndisaster.\n  However, now that legislation has been brought forward to deal with \nthis issue, I fear that the solution to this problem presented here \nwill hobble the workers of Puerto Rico for some time to come. While the \nbill accomplishes much by way of addressing the debt crisis in Puerto \nRico, it also hamstrings workers by expanding the subminimum wage on \nthe island.\n  This legislation expands the application of the Federal subminimum \nwage to those under 25 years old and extends the application of this \nsubminimum wage to those workers from 90 days to up to 4 years. Just \nfor reference, the subminimum wage that will now be subjected to \nworkers 25 years old and younger and for up to 4 years is $4.25 an \nhour--$4.25 an hour--a full $3 per hour less than the workers in the \nStates make when, indeed, the workers in the United States ought be \nmaking $15 an hour.\n  The bill would also delay implementation of the Department of Labor's \nrule on overtime pay until the GAO completes a study, which could take \nup to 2 years. This means that under the provisions of this bill, the \nyoung people of Puerto Rico will be paid a subminimum wage, and the \nrest of the workers on the island will not be eligible for the new \novertime rules, losing out on hard-earned money for working long hours.\n\n  While some legislative solution is necessary in order to responsibly \naddress Puerto Rico's debt crisis, these provisions are unconscionable. \nIt is long past time that we start treating our fellow citizens in the \nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico--as well as the District of Columbia and \nthe Virgin Islands and American Samoa and Guam and the Marianas--with \ndignity and respect, not with provisions to limit their ability to earn \nthe same amount of money for their hard work as any other American. It \nis all right for them to go to war and die--and they do in sometimes \ndisproportionate numbers--but we don't want to see to it that they \nreceive an appropriate wage.\n  Also disconcerting to me is what is not found in the bill, which is \nany money to address the Zika virus on the island. Make no mistake, the \nfiscal situation and the response to this virus are linked. I know that \nthere will be some that will argue that the House passed $633 million, \nthe Senate passed $1.2 billion, and they will go to conference, but I \nam talking specifically about this financial crisis and Puerto Rico's \nproblem.\n  Given the financial situation on the island, there are grave concerns \nabout the Commonwealth's ability to handle an outbreak of the virus. \nAlready there\n\n[[Page H3583]]\n\nare over 1,000 local cases of Zika in Puerto Rico. To put that in \nperspective, there are today just over 600 cases in the continental \nUnited States, and nearly all of those are travel-related.\n  As we move further into the summer and into the mosquito season, I \nfear that what is already a fiscal crisis could turn into a growing \nhealth crisis as the economically stressed island will be left with \nlittle resources to deal with the virus and a Congress that is \nunwilling to adequately fund a response.\n  These wage and overtime provisions will do nothing but increase \npoverty and force more Puerto Ricans to leave the island. This bill may \ntake steps to right the Puerto Rican economy, which is currently in \nshambles, but at what cost? Treating the young and the workers of \nPuerto Rico as second and third class citizens?\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), my colleague on the \nCommittee on Rules, brings up two very important issues. Indeed, \nnothing in this bill would require people to pay the subminimum wage. \nIt simply allows it. It provides it as an alternative.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  I think this is a situation where Puerto Rico is going to need all \nthe alternatives it can possibly have at its disposal to deal with what \nis truly a devastating fiscal problem and a devastating economic \nproblem, which gets to a second point he brought up.\n  When you have a breakdown in the economy, as you have got, and a \nbreakdown in the government's financing, as we have got in Puerto Rico, \nit has dramatic effects in other parts of society. We are already \nseeing a breakdown in their hospitals and their ability to deliver \nhealth care. And education, for that matter.\n  So the best way we can address healthcare problems, whether it is \nZika or something else or the other myriad of problems that result from \nthis, is to get this bill passed and get Puerto Rico quickly on the \nroad to recovery, both fiscally and economically.\n  I heard my friend's comments. I understand them. But the best way to \nget where we are trying to go is to give Puerto Rican people the most \noptions we can to deal with this problem and also get them on the road \nas quickly as we can. And that is what the bill is designed to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nPuerto Rico (Mr. Pierluisi) who really knows Puerto Rico, in light of \nthe fact that he is the Congressman representing Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. PIERLUISI. Mr. Speaker, in the last year and a half, this \nCongress has held nine hearings on Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, home \nto 3.4 million American citizens. These hearings confirmed that Puerto \nRico is in jeopardy right now. Not next year. Now.\n  Island residents are relocating to the States in unprecedented \nnumbers. The Puerto Rican Government is on the brink of collapse, a \nvictim of decades of inequality at the Federal level and mismanagement \nat the local level.\n  The government and its instrumentalities have $70 billion in bonded \ndebt, three public entities on the island have already defaulted on \npayments to creditors, and larger defaults appear imminent. Puerto \nRico's three main pension systems are severely underfunded, placing at \nrisk the retirement security of over 330,000 individuals. The \ngovernment of Puerto Rico has lost access to the credit markets, so it \ncannot borrow money to meet current obligations.\n  All objective observers, including virtually every major editorial \nboard in the Nation, understand that the government of Puerto Rico must \nrestructure its debts--ideally, through voluntary agreements with \ncreditors, but through a court-supervised process, if necessary. It is \nregrettable that we have reached this point, but it is reality. We must \nconfront this challenge with courage and candor.\n  PROMESA gives Puerto Rico the critical tool it lacks; namely, a legal \nmechanism to restructure its debts in an orderly way, ensuring the \nsacrifice will be shared in a fair and equitable manner.\n  Without PROMESA, the Puerto Rican Government is likely to collapse, \nparticipants in pension plans will be terribly damaged, and most \nbondholders could lose their investments. Absent this bill, almost \nnobody wins and nearly everybody loses.\n  Now, PROMESA pairs debt restructuring authority with the creation of \nan independent oversight board to help the Puerto Rican Government \nbetter manage its public finances, balance its budgets, become more \nefficient and transparent, and regain access to the credit markets.\n  There are some Puerto Rican politicians who seek broad debt \nrestructuring authority from Congress, but oppose an oversight board. \nThis is not a realistic option, and would result in Puerto Rico \nreceiving nothing.\n  I fully understand the importance of democracy and dignity. As a \nlifelong advocate for statehood for Puerto Rico, I want full democratic \nrights for the island on both the national and local level, not fewer \ndemocratic rights.\n  My test from day one has been that the board should have the \nauthority to oversee, but not to command and control, the Government of \nPuerto Rico. PROMESA meets this test.\n  After intensive negotiations, the bill establishes a reasonable board \nwith powers far less potent than the powers that Congress gave the \nboard it established for the District of Columbia in 1995. If the \nPuerto Rican Government does its job well, the board will have a \nlimited role and will cease to operate within a few years.\n  PROMESA, like any product of bipartisan compromise, is not perfect. \nFor instance, the minimum wage provision is deeply misguided, and I \nsupport Mrs. Torres' amendment to remove it from the bill.\n  I will explain it in plain language. It makes no sense to apply a \ndifferent Federal minimum wage to Puerto Rico, because it simply \nencourages Puerto Ricans to migrate to the States or otherwise not to \nseek a job and rely on government assistance.\n  Nevertheless, I should say that there is almost zero chance this \nprovision will affect a single worker in Puerto Rico, since the \ngovernment will retain the ability to prevent its use.\n  This bill is the best chance we have to solve the immediate fiscal \ncrisis in Puerto Rico and to place the island on the path to a brighter \nfuture. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate the remarks of the gentleman from Puerto Rico. I hope he \nwas in the Chamber and he heard words that I said. Everybody in this \nHouse stands with the people of Puerto Rico. Our hearts go out for \nthem. This is a very difficult situation.\n  He used a very strong phrase. He said that they are on the brink of \ncollapse. And I agree with my friend from Florida: no one would know \nbetter than the gentleman from Puerto Rico. We want to keep them from \ncollapsing.\n  There are many of us on this side that would rather do nothing, but \nwe understand that there has to be some responsibility here. And so \nthis is an effort to exercise responsibility in a fiscally sound way, \nand I believe that is what this does.\n  So I appreciate the gentleman's remarks. This is an urgent time for \nhim and his people, and it is time for us to act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, when I came to Congress in 1993, among the \nfirst people that I met and got to know and have been fast friends with \nsince, is the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez), my good friend \nwho also has not only great wisdom on the subject of immigration and \nsocial policies in this country, but certainly his understanding of \nPuerto Rico.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez).\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and to \nthe underlying bill.\n  I submitted 10 amendments for consideration, and not one of them was \nruled in order to be debated today by my colleagues.\n  But I don't oppose the bill because I didn't get an amendment in \nhere. The fact that my amendments were deemed unsuitable for debate by \nthe Congress of the United States is an indication of the underlying \nproblems with the bill.\n\n[[Page H3584]]\n\n  If you can't debate the future of Puerto Rico here in the Congress of \nthe United States, imagine when you give it to seven people unelected \nby anyone in Puerto Rico or in the United States that can meet in \nsecret. They can meet in secret without informing us of any one of \ntheir decisions. If we can't have a debate about Puerto Rico, if it is \nso important, why not take time to have a debate about the amendments \nthat are offered by people here.\n  We are engaged today in a wholly undemocratic activity in the world's \ngreatest democracy. We are debating how we will take power from people \nwho are virtually powerless already.\n  As I have said throughout this debate, Puerto Rico, by virtue of \ncourt cases and the Territorial Clause of the Constitution, ``belongs \nto, but is not a part of the United States.''\n  I say to all of my colleagues: treat them with dignity, with respect. \nDo not put blinders on as though they do not exist.\n  Yes, the Territorial Clause of the Constitution of the United States \nsays that they are a territory and that, therefore, they are property \nof the United States of America. But I submit to each and every one of \nyou that they are live human beings with hearts, with souls, and they \nshould demand and receive the respect of any other human. Don't treat \nthem like a piece of trash. Don't treat them like an inanimate object \nthat has no right to dignity and to respect, which is what we are doing \nhere today. I cannot vote for this.\n  President Obama referred to the special place that Kenya owns in his \nheart because, he says: It will always be a special place because that \nis the place of the birth of my father.\n  Let me submit to you that Puerto Rico is the place of the birth of my \nfather. And I cannot come here and turn my back on the place of the \nbirth of my father with this outrageously undemocratic and this \noutrageously unfair proposal to the people of Puerto Rico.\n  Think about it. You are imposing a junta, because that is what they \nare calling it. There will be no difference between this junta and the \njunta of Pinochet in Chile, as far as the international community is \nconcerned. And why? Because yesterday--and the Speaker of the House of \nPuerto Rico is in the gallery--they approved a resolution rejecting \nthis junta. Elected by the people of Puerto Rico. And what does the \nCongress of the United States, the democracy of the world, say? We \ndon't care.\n  Today, as we speak, the Senate in Puerto Rico has a resolution \nrejecting it. And just this past Sunday, every candidate for Governor \nin Puerto Rico, every last candidate for Governor of Puerto Rico that \nwas successful had in their platform a rejection of PROMESA.\n  How many times do the people of Puerto Rico have to reject this \nproposal so that the Congress of the United States treats them with \nsome respect and some dignity?\n  And I just want to say: Control board? Where was the last control \nboard we know so much about? Flint, Michigan. And what did the control \nboard do? They poisoned the people--American citizens--in Flint.\n  Let me suggest to you that if you give power to a control board \nunelected and unsupervised by anyone here, be careful. Be careful. \nRemember Flint. Remember the poisoning of the people and what the \ncontrol board did there. That is exactly what we should suspect will \nhappen.\n  People say: Luis, what is your alternative? Our alternative is quite \nsimple: have a conversation. Not a conversation that begins: we will \nnot spend a penny on the people of Puerto Rico. That is the way our \nconversation went. We will not. You have to show me a solution in which \nwe do not spend a penny.\n  Well, let me tell you, we spend money. The Jones Act imposed on the \npeople of Puerto Rico the most expensive merchant marine in the world. \nIt costs $500 million a year. Why don't we lift that from them? We \nbelieve in democracy, we believe they should be free. Why don't we lift \nthat from them?\n  Medicaid and Medicare. Have you seen the reimbursement schedules to \nPuerto Rico? They pay the same in FICA taxes, but don't receive the \nsame in terms of reimbursements.\n  In 2006, the wisdom of this Congress was to say to the people of \nPuerto Rico: we don't care that you are going to lose hundreds of \nthousands of jobs. We are eliminating section 936 of the Internal \nRevenue Code that created jobs.\n  The people of Puerto Rico want jobs. They want jobs and they want the \ndignity and the respect of being American citizens of this Nation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. And they demand the dignity and the respect that \ncomes. They don't come here on their knees. They are a proud people. \nThey are a people who want to use their creativity and their energy.\n  This Congress of the United States has said they are a colony. I \ndidn't say that. The Committee on Natural Resources says: we have \nplenary powers over the people of Puerto Rico. I didn't say that. You \nsaid that. If you have plenary powers over the people of Puerto Rico, \nthen assume your responsibility that comes with those plenary powers \nover the people of Puerto Rico.\n  Please don't tell me you are going to put Puerto Ricans on the board. \nI lived in Puerto Rico. I remember when the sugarcane cutters would cut \nthe sugarcane. Let me assure you there were Puerto Ricans in charge of \nexploiting those workers in the sugarcane field. There have been many \ntimes in history when the very same people who have been put in charge \nexploit their own.\n  Give us dignity. Give us transparency. Do it at least in the Spanish \nlanguage so the people can know what is going on. At least King George, \nwhen he would come with his decrees--before he burned this building \ndown--would write his decrees in English so that we would understand \nwhat he was doing.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded and requested not to \nrefer to occupant of the gallery.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner).\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speaker, I visited Puerto Rico, and believe me \nwhen I say the fiscal crisis the island is facing is, in every way, a \ncrisis. Hospitals can't pay their bills. They have closed wings of the \nhospital. One hospital is $4 million in debt because they haven't paid \nan electric bill.\n  Some people will point out that this is largely a crisis of Puerto \nRico's own making. They are right; the gentleman from Illinois is \nwrong.\n  Puerto Rico has had internal self-government for over 50 years. It \nwasn't the Congress that forced Puerto Rico to pile up debt after debt \nafter debt after debt; and it wasn't the Congress that tapped Puerto \nRico on the shoulder until now and said: You can't sustain this debt.\n  There already have been two defaults. There is a $2 billion default \ncoming on the 1st of July because they don't have the money to even do \ntheir debt service; and despite this dire situation, the Puerto Rican \nGovernment has increased its spending on everything except, ironically, \ndebt service.\n  I see what is happening in Puerto Rico as a cautionary tale for us \nhere in Washington and here in the Congress of the United States.\n  Now, PROMESA is not rewarding bad behavior. If we wanted to reward \nbad behavior, we would pay billions of dollars in a taxpayer-financed \nbailout to finance all of this irresponsible borrowing that has been \ngoing on in Puerto Rico.\n  Significantly, this bill does not commit one penny of taxpayer funds \nto bail out Puerto Rico. The fiscal oversight board is designed to help \nPuerto Ricans set their finances in order when they have failed to do \nso by themselves.\n  Now, let me say something. I heard the gentleman from Illinois talk \nabout us treating Puerto Rico as a colony. That has not been the case \nsince Mr. Munoz Marin, the legendary Governor of Puerto Rico, persuaded \nthis Congress to give Puerto Rico internal self-government. What has \nhappened here is internal self-government has failed, and that is why \nwe are talking about this today.\n  I don't think many of my constituents in Wisconsin or Mr. Duffy's \nconstituents or Chairman Bishop's constituents really were concerned \nabout\n\n[[Page H3585]]\n\nPuerto Rico, but we were; and we stepped up to the plate and offered a \nsolution that has attracted bipartisan support and the support of the \nadministration.\n  What do we hear from the opponents of this piece of legislation, one \nof whom just spoke very eloquently? It is wrong. It is bad. We \nshouldn't do that. We are ignoring the people of Puerto Rico.\n  Well, we are not doing that. We are making sure in this bill that the \npain is shared. If this bill doesn't pass, there is no plan B, and \nPuerto Rico is going to collapse into an economic morass. There is no \nplan B.\n  I haven't heard anything from those who are opposed to this bill on \nwhat their alternative is. They have had a year to come up with their \nalternative, and all they do is make fiery speeches against what has \nbeen a very long and patient negotiated process. They are not a part of \nthe solution. They are trying to engender more opposition, and they are \na part of the problem.\n  Pass this rule. Pass this bill. Let's get Puerto Rico back on track, \nand this is a way to do it with some help from the oversight board.\n  Puerto Ricans are going to have to do this themselves. They haven't \nbeen able to do it without a tap on the shoulder. Too bad there is an \noversight board, but that is the only game in town.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, through you, I will advise my friend from \nAlabama that I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close \nwhenever he is.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to another gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the sponsor of this bill.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Alabama for \nyielding.\n  It is a fascinating debate, where two sides of the political aisle \nhave come together, at the start, from very different vantage points on \nhow to help Puerto Rico but have consistently worked together to find a \ncompromise that all of us think is going to leave Puerto Rico better \noff than it is today.\n  I heard the gentleman from Illinois, in his fiery remarks, talking \nabout dignity and respect for the people of Puerto Rico. He was saying \nthat people in Puerto Rico are being treated like trash.\n  The economic stats are staggering of what is happening in Puerto \nRico: the unemployment rate, it is double that of the mainland; the \nlabor participation rate is 20 points lower than the national average; \nand thousands of people every month are leaving the island because \nthere is not enough economic opportunity.\n  If you want to talk about dignity and respect, look at the poverty on \nthe island. Look at the despair on the island. I mean, you have \nfamilies that are being separated because they have no jobs. They can't \nlive in their neighborhoods, in their communities with their families \nbecause they can't find an opportunity, so they have to go somewhere \nelse. That is not dignity. That is not respect.\n  So this Congress has come together with a unified voice to come up \nwith a package that can actually get Puerto Rico on an economic path to \nprosperity.\n  Listen, I would love if we can say to the Puerto Rican Government: \nYou guys have to do a better job of managing your debt.\n  Guess what. It has been a failure, with $73 billion in debt. They \ncan't get their hands around it. The people have lost trust in the \ngovernment, and so they are saying: If you look at the polls, we want \nCongress to act. We want Congress to do something. We can't get saved \nat home. Would the U.S. Congress please step in? Would you please help \nus out?\n  They aren't opposed to an oversight board to help manage the finances \nof the island. They are not opposed to a system to restructure Puerto \nRican debt, a system that, by the way, makes sure that the bondholders \nof Puerto Rican debt will bear the loss, not the American taxpayer, \nbecause I think this institution believes that we should have the \nbondholders bear that loss instead of the American taxpayer.\n  We don't believe in capitalism on the way up, where you get all the \nrewards of your investment and bonds, but socialism on the way down, \nso, if you lose in an investment, the taxpayer will bail you out. That \nis not what we believe in.\n  So I guess when I hear opponents who talk about their fathers being \nborn in Puerto Rico and them wanting to die in Puerto Rico, I love the \npassion, I love the fire, but you have to have a heart and look at what \nis happening on the island and look at a commonsense, bipartisan \nsolution where you have the President of the United States, the \nTreasury, the gentleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. Pierluisi), who has been \nmasterful in helping make sure that we stay on target, we understand \nwhat is going on on the island, that we understand what will work and \nwhat won't work, that we have come together, two different parties, \nactually, the Speaker of the Puerto Rican House engaging with us on how \nwe are going to fix the island.\n\n  One quick last point. This is about debt restructuring. This is about \ngetting the finances in order. But this also has to be about economic \ngrowth. You won't have a recovery until you have economic growth. We \nincent investment on the island.\n  Though we haven't done enough--there is still more to do--both sides \nhave committed to making sure we come up with a strategy and a plan to \nmake sure we have investment in Puerto Rico, so there is more \nopportunity, more jobs, more tax revenue, and more prosperity for the \nPuerto Rican people.\n  I am proud of the work that this House has done on this bill, the \ndifferent sides, different views, different opinions that have come \ntogether to make this bill happen. I would encourage everyone to \nsupport the rule and, later today, support this bill.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  There is no doubt that the people of Puerto Rico find themselves in a \ndire situation, and there is no doubt that this situation has been made \nworse by the snail's pace with which the majority has seen fit to \naddress the problems facing the people of Puerto Rico.\n  Though the restructuring of Puerto Rico's debt is certainly needed, I \nworry that the burdens placed upon the residents of the island, through \nthis bill, really only amount to punting on important issues that we \nwill, nonetheless, have to address somewhere down the road while making \nthese important issues all the more complicated when we do get to the \nbusiness of actually helping the people of Puerto Rico.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, Mr. Speaker.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I appreciate the remarks of my friend from Florida. This is a tough \nissue, there is no question about it. There are many of us that don't \nreally understand how we got to this point. I have been trying to do \nsome digging about that.\n  The truth of the matter is that the people in the Federal Government \nwho were supposed to be looking over this and watching Puerto Rico and \nmaking sure that, if things needed to be done, they were done \nappropriately, under the law, were the President of the United States \nand the Treasury Department, and they failed.\n  Now, they failed in watching the situation and raising the alarm for \nthe rest of us. Let's make no mistake about it. The people of Puerto \nRico elected governments, and those governments that have home rule \nauthority made decisions that have put this island, as we just heard, \non the brink of collapse because they spent money they didn't have, and \nthey racked up debt they can't pay back.\n  Now, let's just stop and think for a minute. Where are we going in \nthe United States of America? We are spending money we don't have, and \nwe are racking up debt that there may come a day, for our country, as \nit is for Puerto Rico, that we won't be able to pay back; and then we, \nas the United States of America, will be on the brink of collapse. So \nperhaps we should learn a lesson here, that the decisions we make in \nthis House about the future of the United States of America, those \ndecisions could lead to the very same result for our country that we \nsee for Puerto Rico.\n  My heart goes out to the people of Puerto Rico. They are suffering, \nand the suffering will get worse if we do not act.\n\n[[Page H3586]]\n\n  The sponsor of the bill used two phrases with regard to this \nlegislation that really struck me. He said it is ``common sense'' and \n``bipartisan.'' Isn't it a good thing that we have commonsense \nlegislation that is bipartisan? Isn't that what the people of the \nUnited States of America send us here to do?\n  Let's come together, as one House, with one voice, help the people of \nPuerto Rico, and then, together, sit down and learn the lesson of what \nhas happened here so that we don't repeat those mistakes for our \ncountry and end up with the United States of America on the brink of \ncollapse.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to discuss H. \nRes. 770, the Rule providing for consideration of H.R. 5278--Puerto \nRico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA).\n  Our consideration of PROMESA must be a very thoughtful analysis of an \noutcome where the people of Puerto Rico will be empowered and be on a \npath towards progress where working families, their children and \npensioners can be on a pathway towards a better future.\n  PROEMSA is a bipartisan measure and effort to assist the Commonwealth \nof Puerto Rico in restructuring $70 billion in currently unpayable \ndebt, an amount that exceeds the size of its entire economy.\n  There are a total of 3.548 million people living on the island of \nPuerto Rico.\n  Since 2006, Puerto Rico's economy has shrunk by more than 10 percent \nand shed more than 250,000 jobs.\n  More than 45 percent of the Commonwealth's residents live in \npoverty--the highest poverty rate of any state or territory.\n  Furthermore, its 11.6 percent unemployment rate is more than twice \nthe national level.\n  The challenges facing the people of Puerto Rico have ignited the \nlargest wave of outmigration since the 1950's, and the pace continues \nto accelerate.\n  More than 300,000 people have left Puerto Rico in the past decade \nwith a record of 84,000 people leaving in 2014.\n  Puerto Ricans suffer from high rates of forced migration due to the \nbetter opportunities offered in the United States compared to in the \ncommonwealth.\n  The gap between emigrants and immigrants has been continuously \nwidening.\n  Indeed, this increase in emigrants caused a population decline, the \nfirst in its history, and the stateside Puerto Rican population grew \nquickly.\n  The median age of male Puerto Ricans is of working age from the ages \nof 25-49 and similarly for women from the ages of 25-59.\n  Most of the homes are family-led.\n  There are about 1,133,600 people in the civilian labor force but only \n43 percent of them are employed.\n  In addition, most of those working work in minimum wage jobs.\n  Over 27 percent of the people in the Commonwealth are on welfare.\n  The median income in Puerto Rico is only half that of the poorest \nU.S. state, Mississippi, but welfare benefits are about the same in \nPuerto Rico as in Mississippi.\n  Swift action is needed in order to alleviate the pain and suffering \nof the people of Puerto Rico.\n  There is no time to waste.\n  H.R. 5278 appears to be an emergency default for Puerto Rico, an \nAmerican territory where 3.5 million American citizens reside and \ncontinue to live in fear for their finances, their families and their \nfuture.\n  On July 1, Puerto Rico will face nearly $2 billion worth of bond \npayments.\n  Already, businesses have closed, public worker benefits are in \njeopardy, hospital care is restricted and basic governmental functions \nare at risk.\n  Should the Puerto Rican government default in early July, it faces \ncertain litigation by its creditors, further erosion of its economy, \nand an inability to provide basic services to its people.\n  This measure creates a process for the Commonwealth to restructure \ntheir bond debts, avoiding a default that could lead to a humanitarian \ncatastrophe and instead allowing Puerto Rico to return to economic \ngrowth and fiscal balance.\n  It would allow for the creation of a seven-member Financial Oversight \nand Management board which will approve annual budgets and fiscal \nplans.\n  This fiscal plan must be designed in a way that provides adequate \nfunding for pension obligations.\n  Also, I have serious concerns about the minimum wage provision of the \nmeasure.\n  Specifically, regarding minimum wage and overtime, H.R. 5278 would \nextend the application of the existing federal subminimum wage of $4.25 \nan hour to those under the age of 25 in Puerto Rico for as long as four \nyears, while all other federal jurisdictions pay the subminimum wage to \nthose under the age of 20 for only up to the first ninety days of \nemployment.\n  We need to continue to work on ways to improve this measure to \nascertain that American citizens in Puerto Rico are not languishing in \npoverty.\n  Indeed, the measure contains a provision that provides for a delay on \nthe new Department of Labor overtime pay regulation until a Government \nAccountability Office (GAO) study is completed and the Department of \nLabor determines whether the rule could negatively impact the economy \nof Puerto Rico.\n  Additionally, the measure would create a ``Revitalization \nCoordinator'' that works closely with the Oversight Board to determine \nwhich energy and other infrastructure projects will be able to bypass \nlocal environmental, public health, and consumer protection laws.\n  Let me underscore again that I have serious concerns about the \nprovisions in this measure, not the least of which is the expansion of \nthe subminimum wage, the exemption from the new overtime Rule, and the \nexclusion of protections for pension benefits.\n  I commend my Democratic colleagues in their efforts of protecting the \nenvironment and wildlife refuge in the Commonwealth.\n  I look forward to working with my Democratic colleagues and our \nRepublican colleagues across the aisle in continuing to improve the \nprovisions of the measure for the betterment of fellow American \ncitizens in Puerto Rico.\n  Let me conclude by highlighting that H.R. 5278 is not perfect but so \nlong as we continue to work on a bipartisan basis in good faith, we can \nwork towards our efforts of ensuring that Puerto Rico does not become a \nhumanitarian crisis.\n  We must continue to work together to be our brother's and sister's \nkeepers.\n  It is essential that we stand with the people of Puerto Rico and take \naction.\n  It is essential that we continue to work towards an orderly process \nthat promotes the livelihood of U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico and \nalleviates the crisis.\n  Mr. BYRNE.

Mr. Speaker, I raise a point of order against \nHouse Resolution 771 because the resolution violates section 426(a) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act.\n  The resolution, in waiving all points of order against consideration \nof the bill, waives section 425 of the Congressional Budget Act, \nthereby causing a violation of section 426(a).\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas makes a point of \norder that the resolution violates section 426(a) of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974.\n  The gentleman has met the threshold burden under the rule, and the \ngentleman from Texas and a Member opposed each will control 10 minutes \nof debate on the question of consideration. Following debate, the Chair \nwill put the question of consideration as the statutory means of \ndisposing of the point of order.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this year's appropriations process \nhas been rocky to say the least. That trend is poised to continue this \nevening and tomorrow as the House considers the fiscal year '17 \nLegislative appropriations bill.\n  Buried in this bill's committee report is controversial language that \nforces the Library of Congress to continue using the derogatory term \n``illegal alien'' in its subject headings. Mr. Speaker, I will explain \nthe background on this issue.\n  Last month, the Library of Congress announced proposed changes to its \nsubject headings that would replace the term ``aliens'' with \n``noncitizens'' and replace the term ``illegal aliens'' with \n``noncitizens'' and ``unauthorized immigration.''\n  It is not unusual for the Library of Congress to make changes to its \nsubject headings. In fact, each year it makes thousands of such \nchanges. In 2015 alone, there were 4,934 new subject headings that were \nadded. An example of one such change that the Library has made in the \npast was to replace the word ``Negro'' with a less offensive word.\n  This sort of evolution of the Library's subject headings is not \nunprecedented by any stretch of the imagination. However, what is \nunprecedented is Congress' weighing in on these changes. In fact, the \nLibrary has confirmed that this is the first time that Congress will \nhave legislated on any of its subject headings in the history of the \nLibrary of Congress. So never before in history has Congress so much as \ncommunicated with the Library of Congress about its subject headings, \nlet alone introduced legislation concerning them.\n  With this bill, that is all about to change. House Republicans are \npoised to make history by--for the first time ever--interfering in the \nLibrary of Congress' subject headings process to preserve a prejudicial \nterm.\n  Now, I am not going to lump everybody on the other side of the aisle \ntogether on this issue. When this bill was marked up in the \nAppropriations Committee, Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz introduced \nan amendment that would remove the ``alien''-related language from the \nlegislation's committee report. In fact, four Republicans in the \ncommittee joined Democrats to vote in favor of that measure, and the \namendment only failed by one vote.\n  So there is bipartisan consensus on this matter, and it deserves \ndebate and a vote in the full House of Representatives so that all of \nus can take a vote where, for the first time--again, this is the first \ntime in its history--where the Congress is legislating on a subject \nheading of the Library of Congress, and it is to force the Library of \nCongress to continue using the word ``illegal alien'' rather than \nallowing them to do their job and, as they were considering doing, \nretiring that term.\n  Yesterday, three amendments were presented to the Rules Committee \nthat would allow this to occur. Astoundingly, the Rules Committee \nrejected all three of those amendments. In other words, they would have \nallowed us to debate this and take a vote on it, but the Rules \nCommittee rejected all three of these amendments, preventing a vote on \nthis issue on the House floor.\n  As I mentioned before, Mr. Speaker, the language in the committee \nreport that has sparked this debate refers to a portion of U.S. Code \nthat contains the term ``alien.'' I have introduced legislation that \nwould remove ``alien'' from U.S. Code in instances where it refers to \nimmigrants to this Nation. My bill, which is H.R. 3785, the CHANGE Act, \nwould replace the terms ``alien'' and ``illegal alien'' in Federal law \nwith the terms ``foreign national'' and ``undocumented foreign \nnational.''\n  Let me be clear about why I am doing that. First, these folks may not \nbe American citizens, but they are human beings. They are not people \nfrom outer space. When we think of the term ``alien,'' we don't think \nof human beings; we think of people that are from somewhere else.\n  The word ``illegal alien'' has also been used oftentimes--although \nnot by everyone--in a pejorative way, in a way that is meant to be \npejorative and offensive. It stigmatizes immigrants in this Nation and \ndiminishes the quality of discussion around immigration issues in the \nUnited States. When ugly, belittling names are used to describe groups \nof people, those terms can make discrimination seem okay.\n  There is precedent for changing language in our laws as words' \nmeanings evolve over time. For example, our Federal code previously \nused the terms ``lunatic'' and ``mentally retarded.'' Those words have \nsince been taken out.\n  Just last month, President Obama signed into law a bill that I \nbelieve we can all be proud of, which was introduced by my colleague, \nCongresswoman Grace Meng of New York, that removes the terms \n``Oriental'' and ``Negro'' from Federal code. It is also time for \n``alien'' to be added to the list of words we remove from Federal code.\n  So I urge my colleagues, both Republican and Democrat, to stand up \nfor the dignity of all people who call America home and vote in favor \nof the CHANGE Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I understand that my friend has great \npassion on this issue. What I love about this Chamber is that it allows \npeople to come and express their passions.\n  But I serve on the Rules Committee. The Rules Committee has original \njurisdiction of the unfunded mandate point of order, and it is designed \nto prevent Congress from imposing unfunded mandates--rules that we are \nnot going to pay for--on outside institutions: State governments, local \ngovernments, and tribal governments.\n  By definition, this is the legislative branch appropriations bill. It \nfunds the Library of Congress. We are absolutely funding what this bill \nis asked to do. To debate the merits of the underlying language is \nabsolutely legitimate debate. But to use this point of order, which is \nalmost a textbook definition of what this point of order does not apply \nto, is a dilatory tactic, Mr. Speaker.\n  I would ask that we vote to dispense with that, oppose this point of \norder, and get on to the underlying legislation.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, can I inquire how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would make two points. The first \nis that this is an unfunded mandate because the Library of Congress was \nalready well on its way to changing this term. Now, Congress is \ninstructing it that it cannot do that. There is no way that money is \nnot spent in following the instruction of Congress. So I disagree with \nthe gentleman. This is an unfunded mandate.\n  To the issue itself, there was no argument from the other side that \nthese words are pejorative, that this word is an anachronism. And, by \nthe way, Mr. Speaker, this word is used in Federal code and applies to \npeople who are here who are undocumented and also people who are here \nlegally who are residents. So this is not only an issue of the \nundocumented. This is an issue of immigrants generally.\n\n[[Page H3588]]\n\n  I know that, over the years, ours has been a very devout nation, a \nnation of faith, and that includes many of the people in this body. I, \nfor example, have had an opportunity to visit with the faith study \ngroup that meets once a week that talks about the issues of their own \npersonal faith, their own journeys, and the work that they do for their \nconstituents.\n  As I think about my own district, which is 64 percent Hispanic in San \nAntonio, it is a town whose creativity, entrepreneurism, and spirit has \nbeen infused by the immigrant spirit. These are hardworking, often \nhumble people who don't ask for much from their government, who work \nhard to provide for their families and who hardly ever will be heard to \ncomplain. Most of them, obviously, are documented; some are not.\n  But those people who are not and those who are considered resident \naliens are human beings, and I believe that our faith would tell us \nthat God considers those folks human beings, not illegals. I don't \nimagine that God thinks of those people as illegal. They are \nfundamentally human beings, and they should be respected.\n  They are not American citizens. We understand that, and there has \nbeen much debate over the last few years about passing comprehensive \nimmigration reform or at least considering it here on the House floor. \nThat hasn't happened yet. But I do think that each of us can at least \nextend some modicum of respect to these people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to join me in voting for the \nCHANGE Act.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, I applaud my friend for coming down here and \nspeaking on the underlying bill. I think it is very important that we \nhave the conversations that we will have on the underlying bill. But it \nis also important, in the name of good government, to use these points \nof order for the purpose these points of order were intended to be \nused.\n  The Library of Congress cannot spend one penny except for those \ndollars provided in the underlying legislation. Yes, the underlying \nlegislation has mandates for the Library of Congress, but those \nmandates are funded because that is the only way the Library of \nCongress can be funded.\n  This is an incredibly important point of order, Mr. Speaker. The \npower that we have in this body to dictate to State, local, and tribal \ngovernments what they must do and then refuse to pay the bill is a \ndangerous practice that this institution recognized when it created \nthis point of order to avoid.\n  I hope my friends on both side of the aisle will continue to bring up \nunfunded mandates points of order when they are applicable. But I \nimplore my colleagues: Do not take a vote to suggest that a point of \norder designed to prevent us from putting unfunded costs on local \ngovernments should apply when we are funding the responsibilities of \nthe Federal Government. That perverts the intent, and it undermines our \nability to use this point of order effectively in the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge us to allow the House to continue our business \nfor the day.

The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for \n1 hour.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, the buzz you hear around this Chamber, I \nsuspect, is enthusiasm for the underlying bill. This is the legislative \nbranch appropriations bill for FY 2017, and it is the single piece of \nlegislation that enables all of the constituent services that go on \nfrom this institution. I want to say that again. Not one act of \nconstituent service would go on anywhere in this country but for this \nunderlying text. It is the Legislative Branch Subcommittee, led by my \nfriend and colleague from Georgia, cardinal Tom Graves.\n  They do great work on the Legislative Branch Subcommittee, Mr. \nSpeaker. It is no surprise to my colleagues in this Chamber that the \nHouse Appropriations Committee has been hard at work in producing those \n12 appropriations bills that we are required to pass every year. Our \nsuccess record in getting that done as a body has been spotty, but the \nsuccess record of our committee in getting that done has been historic.\n  Even more, unlike many bills that come to this floor, the \nAppropriations Committee has said: Do you know what? We did the very \nbest that we could do, but we welcome the input and counsel from our \ncolleagues because we all have different experiences; we all come from \ndifferent parts of the country; and we all have something to add.\n  So this bill, Mr. Speaker, makes in order 13 different amendments--\nseven offered by Republicans, six offered by Democrats--so that we can \nimprove this bill and discuss this bill even more.\n  Among the top line items in the bill is the funding for our Capitol \nPolice. No more so than this year have folks had the Capitol Police on \ntheir minds. The service that those men and women provide is \nindispensable in this Chamber, and I would argue, more than it is \nvaluable to us and more than it is valuable to our constituents who \nvisit this Chamber every day throughout the year, it is valuable to the \nfamilies of those who send their loved ones to work here each and every \nday.\n  This bill funds the Architect of the Capitol. We talk so much about \nspending reductions and trying to be responsible. I am so proud of the \nspending record in terms of those reductions on inefficient programs \nthat this Chamber has generated, but we have priceless American \ntreasures right here in this building. I recall when you could see the \nwater running down from the Capitol dome as it destroyed those precious \nAmerican, historical treasures. So this bill funds the Architect of the \nCapitol so that we are not a penny-wise and pound-foolish in terms of \nour obligation to tend to America's treasures.\n  This bill funds the Government Accountability Office. I dare say \nthere is not a Member of Congress in this institution who hasn't had a \nconstituent ask about a GAO report, who hasn't had occasion on his own \nto ask our auditing agency--our accounting office--to do a study of the \nbest ways to use our resources, to make use of the limited resources \nthat we have. They provide an incredibly valuable, nonpartisan service \nso that we can do the very best for our constituents back home.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is funded at a level that is lower than the \nlevel was when I arrived in this Chamber. It is lower than the level \nwas in 2009 and in 2010. I think that is important, because I think \nthrift really does begin at home. Throughout every year that I have \nbeen in this institution--I am now in year 5--we have absolutely gone \nafter inefficient programs elsewhere in the government. We have \nabsolutely tried to make a difference in curbing that tidal wave of \ndebt that threatens the next generation, but we have started here in \neach and every bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, folks don't know it. The newspapers always carry the \nstories of excess on Capitol Hill. I don't know where they find those \nexcess stories. I will tell you that the allotment for the spending of \nmy office--for all of the constituent service that we do--is less than \nwas allotted 10 years ago. Inflation corrodes it, and the job market \nerodes it. Time and time again, every dollar buys less, as every \nAmerican family knows. We have committed ourselves as an institution to \ndo more with less--thrift beginning at home.\n  There is a modest increase in this bill from the last cycle to deal \nwith those issues, like our Capitol Police, like the Library of \nCongress, like the preservation of the Capitol. I support all of those \nunderlying measures, and I support the rule by which we are bringing \nthis measure here again. Thirteen amendments are made available by this \nrule. If we pass the rule, we will then move to the underlying bill, \nvote on those 13 amendments, and move to final passage.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support both the rule and the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank my friend, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall), for \nyielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.\n  This legislation, as he indicated, provides $3.48 billion for the \nHouse of Representatives and joint operations of Congress. That is a \n$73 million increase over the current year's levels, but more than $150 \nmillion below the President's request.\n  This legislation funds the salaries and expenses for the House of \nRepresentatives, the Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget Office, \nthe Architect of the Capitol, Government Accountability Office, and the \nLibrary of Congress.\n  Today is June 9. Nearly 2 months have passed since my friends in the \nmajority sailed past the statutory deadline for passing a budget \nwithout even looking back. Nearly 1 month has passed since House \nRepublicans began considering appropriations bills without first \nagreeing to top-line spending levels.\n  Republicans made passing a budget a top priority this year. They \ninsisted that we would return to regular order. I really wish the \nAmerican public understood the ``regular order'' concept. Yet here we \nare working without a roadmap and, instead, passing new rules to stifle \ndebate on the House floor on controversial issues like equal rights.\n  But I will get to that in a bit, Mr. Speaker. For now, I will just \nsay it is disappointing because, instead of considering appropriations \nbills funding critical investments for American families and \ncommunities, the House majority has again chosen to take care of \nitself. The partisan mishmash we are discussing today is no different.\n  Here is an example: This legislation forces the Library of Congress \nto continue to use the pejorative term ``illegal alien'' in its subject \nheadings. Mr. Speaker, in another life, as a member of the judiciary, I \nrefused to use that term when discussing persons that were before me. I \ncan't help but laugh at the absurdity of this.\n  We--and I mean Congress--can't have a conversation about \ncomprehensive immigration reform, yet we are forcing the Library of \nCongress to readopt politically charged rhetoric. For what? How is this \na priority? The Legislative Branch Appropriations bill is certainly not \nthe appropriate place for a political debate on immigration.\n  This legislation continues to fund the Energy and Commerce select \npanel to target Planned Parenthood, which, thus far, has conducted a \ncompletely partisan, political witch hunt and come up empty.\n  This legislation continues to fund the Select Committee on the Events \nSurrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi, which has already \nspent $7 million on just four hearings over the\n\n[[Page H3590]]\n\npast 2 years in order to smear Secretary Clinton. And what has it \nproduced? Nothing.\n  I will note that the Select Committee on the Events Surrounding the \n2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi has overlapped a number of previous \ninvestigations that also found nothing. You want to cut wasteful \nspending, Mr. Speaker? Look no further. Defund the Benghazi hearings.\n  I am happy to say that the bill provides $563 million for Members' \nrepresentational allowances for the coming fiscal year. This is 1.5 \npercent increase over the current level. But when we consider the fact \nthat the MRAs have been cut by nearly 17 percent since 2011--that adds \nup to $312,000--a mere 1.5 percent increase is clearly inadequate. I \ncan make the argument that, because of that, we are unable to pay young \npeople that come here and keep them with their institutional memory, \nand in addition we are unable to provide efficient services for our \nconstituents; yet we cut that $312,000 out of the budget, and now we \nare going to add back a little bit and claim that we are being \nefficient.\n  I won't even go into the salary and the cost-of-living adjustment but \nto say that people find it surprising that we are entering this \nlegislation in 2017, year 9, without a cost-of-living increase for \nMembers of Congress. I wonder if that is causing some of them to live \nin their offices. I wonder if it is causing them to breach tax \nconsiderations when they do that and, perhaps, even ethical \nconsiderations. But I won't go into that.\n  Furthermore, an amendment has been offered that will require a 1 \npercent cut across the board to the bill's spending levels. Such a cut \nwould essentially wipe out this already diminutive increase. Members \nshould vote this amendment down.\n  With salaries frozen where they are, I just got through saying we \ncan't retain the best talent. We continue to lose staff. I have three \nstaffers that were perfect for their jobs that had to leave because \nthey couldn't afford to live on the salary that we were paying them.\n  Side note here, Mr. Speaker: the median rent for a one-bedroom \napartment in Washington, D.C., was $2,160 per month last December; and \nI will remind the Members of this body that many staffers start here at \n$30,000 or less, annually. Do the math. We need to take better care of \nour people.\n  Mr. Speaker, before I yield back, I feel compelled to mention Speaker \nRyan's new rules governing the appropriations process on the House \nfloor. Three weeks ago, something particularly shameful took place in \nthis room as we debated the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \nand Related Agencies Appropriations Act.\n  An amendment by our colleague and friend, Sean Patrick Maloney, \nreached the vote threshold needed to pass. Republican leadership, \napparently caught off guard, held open the vote for nearly 8 minutes in \norder to make Republican Members change their vote. They allowed this \nto happen in the back of the room, and the amendment failed.\n  And what contentious subject was the amendment focused on? I will \ntell you. Prohibiting Federal contractors from discriminating against \nLGBTQ employees. This episode demonstrated just how little courage some \nMembers of the Republican Party have.\n  A week later, Representative Sean Patrick Maloney offered his \namendment again, this time to the Energy and Water Development and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act, and it caused such a hubbub that \nthe legislation collapsed on the floor. I will say that again. A \nprovision ensuring that LGBTQ contractors can't be fired solely because \nthey are LGBTQ proved so contentious to Republicans that they defeated \ntheir own appropriations bill--I might add, a good bill--to prevent it \nfrom taking effect.\n  As a result, beginning this month, House Republican leadership is \nclosing down the process and requiring all Members to submit amendments \nfor appropriations measures to the Rules Committee in advance and has \nannounced regular order is being suspended in order to make sure \nRepublicans aren't caught off guard by ``embarrassing'' amendments, for \ninstance, ensuring basic civil rights to American citizens.\n  Remember Speaker Ryan's pledge to return to regular order? Where is \nthat commitment now? Perhaps my friends should consider that the reason \nthese amendments are embarrassing to them is because their position is, \nin and of itself, embarrassing.\n\n  I will note that Representative Sean Patrick Maloney offered his \namendment again for the current legislation, but this time Republicans \nwon't even allow it on the floor for a vote.\n  So, Mr. Maloney, offer it again and again so we can continue to point \nout how ridiculous this is.\n  This entire process is quickly turning into a joke. Enough already. \nWhy don't we fold the tent, wait until after the conventions and the \nNovember election, and start all over again, because we are doing \nnothing here.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is not widely known, but I have believed, in the 5 \nyears that I have been in this institution, that if you were to lock \nthe gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings) and myself in a room \ntogether, we could solve most of the issues that ail this Nation, that \nthere really is more common ground in this institution than folks are \nwilling to let on. But I find myself in the very uncomfortable position \ntoday of disagreeing with almost every conclusion that he reached, \nwhile I agree with so many of the fundamental issues that he believes \nbrought us to this point; for example, regular order is bringing these \nappropriations bills to the floor.\n  The 1974 Budget Act lays out this process clearly. It lays out the \nprocess for passing a budget, and it lays out the process, if the \ndisagreements over that budget become too great, how we can proceed \nwith the appropriations bills. It is exactly what is happening here \ntoday and exactly the way we envisioned it in 1974 when they passed the \nfirst Congressional Budget Act. It continues to roll on that way today. \nThis is a success; it is not a failure\n  My friend is absolutely right; it has been 9 years since Congress \nlast received a pay raise. I will say to my friend that I go down to \ntownhall meetings and I say: One day, I am going to come down here and \ntell you that I have so satisfied you and your needs that I think I \ndeserve a pay raise, too.\n  I listened to my friend, and my friend talks about how the process is \nbroken and we can't pass budgets. My friend talks about particularly \nshameful episodes that go on here on the floor of the House. My friend \ntalks about failure to do the right thing and shenanigans that go on \nfrom leadership.\n  I will tell you, I failed to find anything in those few minutes that \nI thought my constituents would find worthy of a pay raise, and I \nregret that, Mr. Speaker. Because these men and women that I have the \ngreat pleasure of surrounding myself with here, these Representatives \nthat come from 343 other very different districts across the country, \nthey work hard, and they are honorable men and women fighting the \nhardest for their constituents who often disagree with me and mine.\n  We did have a very important vote 2 weeks ago, Mr. Speaker. You \nremember it well. I heard my colleagues trumpeting victories for \nequality, trumpeting historic votes in favor of equal opportunity when \nthey passed an amendment, and not 20 minutes later, they voted against \nsending that bill to the Senate so that that amendment could become \nlaw.\n  Hear me again. We have big debates in this Chamber about serious \nissues that matter; and at some point, it has to be incumbent upon each \nand every one of us, if we get what we want in the amendment process, \nwe need to support the final bill and get it moving to the President. I \ndon't need to be right about policy; I need to make a difference on \npolicy.\n  Like it or not, there are only two ways to change the law of this \nland from this Chamber. One is sending a bill to the President's desk \nand winning his signature; and the second is sending a bill to the \nPresident's desk, receiving his veto, and overriding it right back here \nin this Chamber. Neither of those processes for change, Mr. Speaker, \neven begin if we don't send the legislation from this floor.\n  I say to the gentleman from Florida, I am not scared of tough votes. \nTo our colleagues who want to be protected from tough votes, I say you \nneed to get another job than running for Congress. I am sure there are \nother folks who\n\n[[Page H3591]]\n\nwill have you. If you don't want to take votes, don't become a United \nStates Congressman. The toughest votes are the best votes we take in \nthis institution. They tell us who we are as a people.\n  But the issues on which we are voting are too important to reduce to \na bumper sticker tagline that goes on a campaign commercial that is \ngoing to be useful for 6 months or less. Let's have the big debates; \nlet's do the big things; and then let's send those bills to the \nPresident's desk so that it becomes the law of the land.\n  We can talk and we can talk and we can talk, and so much of that talk \ncenters around bringing change to America. Whether it is restoring a \nvalue of old or bringing a new value, it relates to bringing change to \nAmerica. But that change cannot start until we change a little bit \nabout ourselves.\n  Vote for the amendments; vote for your conscience; send those bills \nto the White House so we can get this process going.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to address very briefly my friend--and he is my friend--\nthat I agree with much of what he said. He said fundamentally much of \nwhat I said he did not agree with, but he pointed to the fact that the \nMaloney amendment passed and then we turned around and voted against \nthe bill.\n  There were other measures in that bill that some of us didn't care \nfor that caused us to vote against it as well, and among them was one \nthat was particularly offensive to me since I represent one of our \nnational parks, and that was carrying guns in national parks.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  I could go on. There were at least seven other riders that were put \non by the majority that caused me angst. I am not sure about everybody \nelse.\n  Additionally, I agree with my good friend that he and I could solve \nmany of these problems, but one thing that I know that he favors, and I \nknow that he agrees with me, and that is that as often as possible that \nwe have open rules in this body; where we are headed is, in many \nrespects, not in that direction.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lofgren), my good friend.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, this bill picks a fight with the \nlibrarians. In the bill, we seek to compel the Library of Congress to \nuse an outdated and dehumanizing term to reference people who aren't \ncitizens of the country.\n  Although the term ``alien'' is used in our statutes, it is outdated \nand deeply insulting to people born abroad who have worked hard to \ncontribute to our economy and communities. In fact, this fall, the \nRepublican Party in California itself decided not to use the term \n``illegal alien'' in its platform. In this bill, the Republicans in the \nHouse look like they are doubling down on vilifying immigrant \ncommunities.\n  Now, as part of a longstanding, often-used process for reviewing and \nupdating subject headings, the Library of Congress apolitically decided \nto use the term ``noncitizens'' and ``unauthorized immigration'' \ninstead of the pejorative term ``illegal aliens.'' The Library makes \nthese types of changes all the time. It is one of 90 such modifications \nproposed en masse by the Library this last March.\n  When a subject heading is changed, references to previous headings \nare retained so researchers can use them, but mandating the term \n``illegal alien,'' which is what Republicans are doing in this \nappropriations bill, is entirely political.\n  The rider countermands the Library's professional judgment. Now, it \nis noteworthy that the Library didn't choose the term ``undocumented \nimmigrant'' favored by many because they didn't want to be political. \nThey just wanted to be fair.\n  Applying these standards in the past, the Library of Congress changed \nthe subject classification ``Negroes'' to ``African Americans,'' the \nway we discuss African Americans today. The catalog used to say \n``cripples.'' That makes me cringe. That was changed over time, first \nto ``handicapped'' and later to ``people with disabilities.'' But in \nthis political season, it seems there is no limit to the racial \ninvective that is being hurled around, and this bill plays into that.\n  Now, to my knowledge, Congress has never before told the Library of \nCongress what the heading in their card catalog has to be, and that we \nwould do it in this case to promote a term that is so offensive to \npeople is a darn shame.\n  Now, in the past, we have used the appropriations process to shut \ndown the government. Republicans have done that repeatedly. I would \nhope that the Republicans in the House would not want to go down that \npath with this. It is true, this term is used in the statute. Our \ncolleague, Representative Castro, has a bill to correct it. I would \nurge that bill be taken up and this unwarranted measure be rejected.\n  I include in the Record a letter from the American Library \nAssociation.\n         American Library Association and Association for Library \n           Collections & Technical Services,\n                                                   April 28, 2016.\n     Re: Request to Remove ``Library of Congress Classification'' \n         Amendment from Legislative Branch Appropriations \n         Legislation.\n\n     Committee on Appropriations,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member Lowey and Members of \n     the Committee: We write today on behalf of the more than \n     58,000 members of the American Library Association and of the \n     Association for Library Collections & Technical Services \n     (ALCTS): the division of ALA members expert in cataloging and \n     classification. We do so to respectfully urge the House \n     Appropriations Committee to strike language in legislation \n     just adopted by its Legislative Branch Subcommittee that \n     would bar the Library of Congress (Library) from implementing \n     an appropriate and thoroughly researched change in its \n     subject heading classifications announced in late March of \n     this year.\n       Specifically, the Library proposes to replace the terms \n     ``Aliens'' with ``Noncitizens,'' and ``Illegal aliens'' with \n     two headings: ``Noncitizens'' and/or ``Unauthorized \n     immigration.'' While some see politics in this decision, Mr. \n     Chairman, as library professionals viewing the work of our \n     colleagues we see only attention to historical detail, \n     intellectual honesty, procedural transparency, and \n     faithfulness to long-standing precepts and practices of \n     librarianship. These have been the hallmarks of cataloging \n     for all of ALCTS' nearly 60 years and of almost 130 years of \n     library science. Stripped of polemic and sensationalism, \n     these are the facts underpinning the Library of Congress' \n     frankly routine and professional determination:\n       The Library of Congress has a long-established, often used \n     process for reviewing and updating outdated subject headings \n     and establishing new ones as needed that preserves all prior \n     versions of updated headings. Such updates may be proposed \n     from outside or within the Library of Congress, but the \n     Library makes the final decision on all changes to subject \n     headings. The Library reviews each change proposal \n     individually and typically adopts over a thousand each year.\n       Indeed, the heading change now before the Committee was one \n     of 90 such modifications proposed en masse by the Library in \n     March. When a subject heading is changed, references to \n     previous headings are effectively retained indefinitely so \n     that researchers who perform a search for a former heading \n     are certain to be directed to all relevant materials. No \n     document in the Library of Congress' (or any library's) \n     collection itself is ever substantively edited, modified, \n     annotated or ``corrected'' in any way as the result of a \n     subject heading update like the one interdicted by the \n     Subcommittee's recent action. Only its catalog ``label''is \n     altered.\n       The Library's process in this case was rigorous, \n     transparent, and consistent with the highest standards of \n     professional cataloging practice. The Library was first asked \n     18 months ago, quite publicly, to review its use of the \n     cataloging term ``illegal aliens'' by one of the nation's \n     preeminent colleges. That request, with modifications, \n     subsequently was echoed by the American Library Association \n     upon debate and approval of a formal Resolution by its more \n     than 180-member Council in January of 2016. A \n     ``stakeholders'' meeting with all appropriate expert sections \n     from within the Library then was convened just over two \n     months ago at which both outside requests, and the broader \n     issues they raised, were reviewed in detail. It is a measure \n     of the Library's professionalism and independence that, in \n     fact, neither external proposal as submitted actually was \n     accepted. Rather, upon review of the totality of the facts \n     and consistent with venerable cataloging practice, the \n     Library apolitically crafted the proposed policy described \n     above and now before the Committee.\n       Decisions to update a subject heading are based on many \n     considerations, including ``literary warrant'': the frequency \n     with which a term is or is not used in print and other \n     dynamic resources that, by their nature, change with and \n     reflect current social structures and norms. For subject \n     headings that refer to groups of people, special attention is \n     paid to: popular usage; terms used by members of the group to \n     self-identify; and avoiding terms that are widely considered\n\n[[Page H3592]]\n\n     pejorative toward the group being described. Applying these \n     same standards in the past, for example, the Library of \n     Congress uneventfully changed the subject classification \n     ``Negroes'' to ``Afro-Americans'' and again to ``African \n     Americans'' over a period of years. The catalog term \n     ``Cripples'' similarly morphed over time, first to \n     ``Handicapped'' and later to ``People with disabilities.'' \n     Congress made no move to countermand those expert cataloging \n     determinations.\n       The Library reasonably and properly concluded in this \n     instance that, when used in reference to people, the long-\n     used terms ``illegal'' and ``alien'' have in recent decades \n     acquired derogatory connotations, become pejorative, and been \n     associated with nativist and racist sentiments. As the \n     Library has noted: the heading ``Aliens'' has been in use by \n     the Library since 1910; ``Aliens, illegal'' came into \n     official use more than 35 years ago; and ``Illegal aliens'' \n     has been in service for almost a quarter-century. Over that \n     long span of time, and particularly in recent years, \n     referring to undocumented persons (as opposed to forms of \n     conduct) as ``illegal'' increasingly has been widely \n     acknowledged as dehumanizing, offensive, inflammatory, and \n     even a racial slur.\n       This shift has been plain and pronounced, as the Library \n     observed, in precisely the kind of dynamic materials that \n     cataloging standards require any Library to assess in \n     evaluating the suitability of a subject heading in use and \n     its prospective modification. Indeed, in recent years many \n     national news organizations (including the Associated Press, \n     USA Today, ABC, Chicago Tribune, and Los Angeles Times) \n     categorically have stopped using the word ``illegal'' to \n     describe human beings as a matter of editorial policy.\n       Moreover, the Pew Research Center has documented that their \n     actions were not merely anecdotal or aberrant in any way. To \n     the contrary, Pew compared use of the term ``illegal aliens'' \n     in U.S. newspapers during the same two-week period in 1996, \n     2002, 2007 and 2013 (all times when immigration matters were \n     much in the news). It found that use of that phrase declined \n     precipitously over the most recent 6-year period surveyed, \n     appearing in 21% of news reports in 2007 but just 5% in 2013: \n     a 76% reduction in use and all-time low.\n       We understand, Mr. Chairman, why some have chosen to \n     politicize the Library's proposed subject heading changes \n     discussed above. In light of the foregoing, however, it is \n     the view of our Associations that, at minimum, the Library of \n     Congress' recent proposed reclassifications discussed above \n     are fully consistent with accepted professional cataloging \n     standards and practices. Indeed, we believe that a compelling \n     case can be made that the proposed changes are required by \n     them. We hope that the foregoing description of the standards \n     and practices of our profession, rigorously adhered to and \n     unimpeachably applied by the Library of Congress in this \n     case, will assist the Committee to accept the Library's \n     independent professional cataloging determinations.\n       Specifically, we urge you and all Members of the Committee \n     to strike all language from any piece of appropriations \n     legislation that would countermand or modify the Library's \n     recent determinations pertaining to the terms ``Aliens'' and/\n     or ``Illegal aliens,'' and to oppose any other legislation \n     that would have similar effect.\n       Thank you for this opportunity to provide the Committee \n     with a factual context in which to consider its upcoming \n     actions. Please contact us should you or your staff have any \n     questions, or require any additional information.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Sari Feldman,\n       President, American Library Association.\n     Norm Medeiros,\n       President, Association for Library Collections & Technical \n     Services.\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  My friend from Florida made reference to regular order earlier and, \nagain, he and I see very much eye-to-eye on that issue. The gentlewoman \nwho just spoke is one of my great friends on the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  I would like to read the offending language that folks are referring \nto. It says this in its entirety:\n\n       To the extent practicable, the committee instructs the \n     Library to maintain certain subject headings that reflect \n     terminology used in title VIII United States Code. To the \n     extent practicable, the Congress directs the Library of \n     Congress to use the laws passed by Congress.\n\n  That is the offending language.\n  My friend serves on the Committee on the Judiciary. If the Committee \non the Judiciary did as she is suggesting and changed the law tomorrow, \nthis language would reflect those changes passed by the Committee on \nthe Judiciary tomorrow. This isn't the Committee on Appropriations' \njurisdiction. We can, as an open appropriations process allows, make \nevery political point that we want to make on every topic under the \nSun, but longstanding policy is not changed in an annual appropriations \nbill. It is changed by authorizers like my friends on the Committee on \nthe Judiciary, and I urge them to get to work on it.\n  There is no question, all of the examples the gentlewoman cited, I am \nwith her 100 percent. We have made those changes, and we are the better \nfor it, but let's not suggest--again, to my friend from Florida's \npoint, why don't folks think Congress is deserving of a pay raise? I \nlistened to my friend describe the motivations that folks had for \nincluding this language. They were not described as motivations in \nfriendly or admiring terms. The language that says from Congress to the \nLibrary of Congress, use the laws passed by Congress.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. WOODALL. I yield to the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. I would just like to note and put into the Record the \nfact sheet from the American Library Association indicating that it is \nthe Library of Congress' belief that it will need to change its policy \nalready underway on this, so if the gentleman is saying that the \nlanguage in the bill doesn't require a change on the Library's part, I \nthink that would be news to the Library.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Reclaiming my time, I am not suggesting anything of the \nkind. I am suggesting that the language that folks are describing as \noffensive says from the Congress to the Library of Congress, use the \nlaws passed by Congress.\n  If we don't like the laws of the land, we have a process to change \nthem, and for better or for worse, that process begins in the committee \non which the gentlewoman serves.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time so that I can continue \nmy discussion with my friend from Florida.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California \n(Ms. Lofgren) for a unanimous consent request.\n  (Ms. LOFGREN asked and was given permission to revise and extend her \nremarks.)\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the missive from \nthe American Library Association entitled ``Support Library of Congress \nAutonomy in Subject Heading Determinations.''\n\n Support Library of Congress Autonomy in Subject Heading Determinations\n\n  [From the American Library Association and Association for Library \n                   Collections & Technical Services]\n\n       In late March of this year, after an extensive process \n     consistent with long-standing library principles and \n     practice, the Library of Congress proposed to replace the \n     subject heading classification ``Aliens'' with \n     ``Noncitizens,'' and ``Illegal aliens'' with two headings: \n     ``Noncitizens'' and/or ``Unauthorized immigration.'' Similar, \n     but not identical, changes previously had been requested by \n     Dartmouth College and endorsed by the American Library \n     Association.\n       In mid-April, the Legislative Branch Subcommittee of the \n     House Appropriations Committee adopted language that would, \n     in effect, countermand the Library's professional judgments \n     and reverse the proposed reclassifications noted above. (The \n     Report adopted by the Subcommittee states: ``To the extent \n     practicable, the Committee instructs the Library to maintain \n     certain subject headings that reflect terminology used in \n     title 8, United States Code.'') The full House Appropriations \n     Committee will meet in mid-May and has the power to undo the \n     Subcommittee's action.\n       On April 28, the Presidents of ALA and ALCTS (ALA's \n     division of members expert in cataloging and classification) \n     wrote the attached letter to the Committee's leaders and \n     members on April 28 asking that they do so. Its principal \n     points and specific requests follow on the reverse.\n\n\nKEY POINTS: ``LIBRARY LETTER'' TO HOUSE APPROPRIATORS BACKING PROPOSED \n                 LIBRARY OF CONGRESS RECLASSIFICATIONS\n\n       The Library of Congress has a long-established, often used \n     process for reviewing and updating outdated subject headings \n     and establishing new ones as needed that preserves all prior \n     versions of updated headings.\n       The Library's process in this case was rigorous, \n     transparent, and consistent with the highest standards of \n     professional cataloging practice.\n       Decisions to update a subject heading are based on many \n     considerations, including ``literary warrant:'' the frequency \n     with which a term is or is not used in print and other \n     dynamic resources that, by their nature, change with and \n     reflect current social structures and norms.

Indeed, a \n     compelling case can be made that the proposed changes are \n     required by them.\n       ALA and ALCTS, its division of experts in cataloging, urge \n     the Committee to accept the Library's apolitical subject \n     heading judgment and, thus, to strike language from any piece \n     of appropriations legislation that would modify or \n     countermand the Library's recent determinations pertaining to \n     the terms ``Aliens'' and/or ``Illegal aliens,'' and to oppose \n     any other legislation that would have similar effect.\n\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Linda T. Sanchez of California), my friend and the \nranking member of the Committee on Ethics in this body.\n  Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition \nto the consideration of H.R. 5325, a deceitful effort by House \nRepublicans to yet again dehumanize an entire group of people. It pains \nme to even say the phrase ``illegal alien'' out loud because it is \npejorative, it is offensive, and has no place in our modern discourse. \nThe Library of Congress is correct to leave this phrase in the pages of \nhistory and never to have it uttered again.\n  The importance of the Library of Congress' decision to discontinue \nand remove the outdated phrase cannot be emphasized enough. Libraries \nnationwide and around the world look to the Library of Congress' \nsubject headings and other standards to publish information. As \nlawmakers representing a country of immigrants, Congress should not \nassist in the dissemination of information that perpetuates racism and \npromotes hate.\n  Of course, I am not at all surprised that congressional Republicans \nwould resort to inserting themselves into bibliographic decisions that \nare normally reserved for librarians, not appropriators or politicians. \nRepublicans hypocritically claim to want to keep government out of \npeople's lives, but want government to intrude and dictate standards \nonly when it benefits their bigoted views.\n  Sadly, today's effort and other past maneuvers to block President \nObama's executive actions on immigration falls in line with the \nconcerted effort to move our country backward. We are better than that. \nInstead of promoting antiquated and deplorable language, we should be \ntackling any number of important issues--affordable education, tax \nreform, and promoting job growth--not telling librarians and educators \nhow to do their jobs.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Going back to my friend from Florida's case that we have hardworking \nmen and women here who haven't had a pay raise in 9 years, if we are a \npart of a body that perpetuates racism and hate, I don't want a single \none of us to get a penny. I don't want a single one of us to get a \npenny. My experience is that is not at all who we are. That is not who \nwe are at all.\n  My quick text search of the U.S. Code--and I am a lawyer, but I \nhaven't read the Code cover to cover--tells me that ``illegal alien'' \nis referenced 32 times, even in a single title. Let's go change it. If \nyou want to get rid of it, let's go in and get rid of it. Don't act \nlike this is beyond our control and if only we can fix the Library of \nCongress, suddenly we can solve all that ails us.\n  This is the United States Code. If you don't like the Code, change \nthe Code. Tell me that we are ineffective and we can't get that done? \nWe are talking about a title change here, one that we have already \ndone, already this Congress. We eliminated the last reference to \n``Oriental'' in the United States Code. We do these things together, \nbut we don't do them by accusing one another of promoting racism and \nhate. We do those things by talking to one another.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. WOODALL. I yield to the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. The Library of Congress has made 90 subject head \nchanges. Why this one? Why does it have to stick and can't be changed? \nI thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Reclaiming my time, I confess that I had no idea the \nLibrary of Congress was even in the subject change heading business. It \nwasn't until I read a press release from somebody talking about this \nissue that I even knew this issue existed. But now that I know it \nexists, I know that it doesn't exist in subject titles at the Library \nof Congress. It exists in the United States Code that is the law of the \nland for the greatest free nation this world has ever known.\n  You want to talk about shame on us? Shame on us for letting the \nlibrarians decide when the debate begins and when the debate ends. It \nis the United States Code and the responsibility falls to one body and \none body only, and that body is here.\n  I want to go back home, Mr. Speaker. I want to tell my constituents \nthey are getting every dollar's worth out of this institution and, \ncandidly, I believe they are getting more value today than they were \nyesterday and they got more value yesterday than they did a week ago or \na month ago or a year ago. I think we are getting better.\n  I will give you a small example. We talk about legislative branch \nfunding as if it is some sort of self-serving institution. That is just \nnonsense. We came here with one job and one job only, and that is to \nserve our constituents back home. This cycle we have passed the FAST \nAct, the first long-term transportation funding bill in 20 years. We \ndid it together. We couldn't do it alone. We did it together.\n  Mr. Speaker, after 17 years of kicking the can down the road on the \nsustainable growth rate, that Medicare tag line that threatened care \nfor every single senior citizen on Medicare, 17 years of kicking it \ndown the road, we came together and abolished it forever. Forever. We \ndid it together because that is the only way we could get it done. The \nVisa Waiver Program improvement.\n  Mr. Speaker, S. 139, the bill that made it easier for people with \nrare diseases to get involved in clinical trials. Can you imagine? Can \nyou imagine a government that in the name of helping people said: Oh, \nno, you can't try that new cure. It might hurt you. When your response \nis, Mr. Government, I am dying, it is my only chance of survival. We \nfixed that. One of many things about what is best about this \ninstitution, Mr. Speaker, Time and time again, we come together to \nsolve real problems that real people have asked of us. That is what \nthis funding bill is about.\n  I hope we are going to move past this bill today. I hope we are going \nto get back to regular order. It pains me that in an election year, it \nthreatens the free and open debate that this institution prides itself \non. But I think that is just fear. I think we are better than that. I \nthink we are going to get past it. But that is not the debate today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, would you be kind enough to tell both \nsides how much time remains.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 14 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Georgia has 11 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am \ngoing to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up legislation that \nwould disband the select investigative panel of the Committee on Energy \nand Commerce. Mr. Speaker, this panel is just another waste of taxpayer \nmoney. Three House committees, 12 States, and one grand jury have \nalready investigated the charges against Planned Parenthood, and none \nfound evidence of wrongdoing.\n\n[[Page H3594]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this panel is conducting a purely partisan political \nwitch hunt, and it should be disbanded.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment into the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Curbelo of Florida). Is there objection \nto the request of the gentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to \nthe gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the distinguished \nranking member of the select investigative panel, to discuss the \nproposal.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous \nquestion so that Mr. Hastings can offer H.R. 769, a resolution to shut \ndown the select panel that we call the select panel to attack women's \nhealth.\n  House Republicans created this panel based on a lie and fraudulent \nvideotapes that have been discredited by three House committees, 12 \nStates, and a Texas grand jury that actually indicted the video maker. \nThey have used this fraud as a pretext to conduct a lethally dangerous \nwitch hunt aimed at women's health clinics and scientists conducting \npromising research on diseases like Alzheimer's, MS, and the Zika \nvirus.\n  Panel Republicans are bullying witnesses and abusing congressional \nauthority in a manner not seen since the days of Senator Joe McCarthy. \nBut this time, people's lives, not just their livelihoods, are at \nstake.\n  Republicans have issued dozens of unilateral subpoenas without first \nseeking voluntary cooperation. They are demanding the names of \nresearchers, students, clinical personnel, doctors, and medical \nstudents, amassing a database that could be released publicly at any \ntime.\n  Republicans refuse to put rules in place to protect these names and \nhave reneged on public promises to do so. Instead, they have publicly \nreleased names and confidential documents.\n  They issued a press release naming a doctor who has already faced \ndecades of harassment and violence; disclosed the time, place, and \nlocation of his appearance before the panel; and fueled the flames by \ncomparing him to a convicted murderer.\n  They have repeatedly used inflammatory rhetoric, comparing \nresearchers to Nazi war criminals and echoing words of antiabortion \nactivists that were also used by the gunman who shot 12 people, killing \n3, at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs.\n  Republicans have demanded and obtained information that they have no \nright or need to know, including records of victims of rape and \npersonal financial information.\n  The Republicans are abusing power and putting people's lives in \ndanger in pursuit of their agenda to limit legal abortion and a woman's \nright to choose and to shut down fetal tissue research.\n  Fetal tissue research has historically had broad bipartisan support. \nIt is the basis for key vaccines that have saved millions of lives, \nincluding the polio vaccine.\n  The so-called investigative panel has already had a chilling effect \non research, drying up the supply of needed tissue for research on \nmultiple sclerosis and threatening other diseases, including \nAlzheimer's and diabetes.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. All I really need is the time to say this:\n  We should now be ending this dangerous and unjustifiable witch hunt. \nIt is time to say ``no'' to this panel, and it is time to say ``no'' to \nthe previous question so that we can finally have a really strong \ndebate on this House floor and finally defund this panel.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I would advise my friend from Florida that \nI do not have any speakers remaining and am prepared to close when he \nis.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee), my good friend.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished \ngentleman from Florida for his management of what is a difficult and \ntrying legislative process and my distinguished friend from Georgia, as \nwell, for his service. Both of them are on the Rules Committee.\n  It pains me to come to the floor on an appropriations bill when I \nknow that there is so much opportunity for us to be able to work \ntogether. I know my good friend from Georgia will understand the pain \nof which I speak and will also attest to the fact that, in many \ninstances in the appropriations process, we have an open rule and we \nallow our Members to express themselves on behalf of the people of \ntheir congressional districts but, more importantly, the higher goal, \nand that is, the people of the United States of America.\n  Let me first express my pain that this bill is the first bill that \nhas come to the floor, when I know that there was vigorous debate and \npossibilities for the energy and water bill--certainly, in my \ncongressional district, which has seen itself under inches and inches \nof rain, seeing people die, and losing individuals through these \nenormous rains and flooding--because we need the kind of infrastructure \nthat comes under energy and water. That bill is not being able to pass. \nSeeing the funding for access to health care, community centers, \ncommunity health clinics not yet come to the floor; seeing the funding \nfor infrastructure and transit that is so needed in our urban centers, \nlike Houston, Texas, not coming to the floor. And then, of course, the \nDepartment of Justice, which is in the middle of dealing with \ncommutation of sentencings, dealing with youth justice programs, \ndealing with a number of issues that are paining Americans; and they \nneed our relief.\n  Yet the bill that comes to the floor, I must again painfully say, is \nan appropriations bill that I will not be able to support. It is a bill \nthat really keeps the wheels going in this place. It is not a more \nimportant bill, but it keeps the wheels going so that we can do the \npeople's work.\n  Here is what is happening that I think is a dastardly reflection on \nwhat we have come to. Let me be very clear. As a senior member of the \nJudiciary Committee dealing with the mechanics of lawmaking, dealing \nwith laws that ultimately provide people civil or criminal justice \nrelief or constitutional relief, I want to tell my colleagues who wrote \nthis language that the issue dealing with the Library of Congress is an \nadministrative one.\n  The idea that noncitizens and unauthorized immigration have any \nimpact on creating a comprehensive immigration system, which I have \nintroduced legislation along with my colleagues, joining with them over \nthe years, has no import and impact of law. It is truly an \nadministrative task that the Library of Congress is attempting to \ncomport with national experts of librarians.\n  Everybody loves a librarian. They give our children knowledge. They \ngive our students knowledge. They give all of us knowledge.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an addition 1 \nminute.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. They give us their best expertise.\n  Why we would intrude in an administrative process when it goes into \nnothing that impacts the scheme of the administrative or the legal \nstructure here in the United States: it is to denigrate; it is to \ninsult.\n  We understand that the word ``illegal'' does connote that you have \nviolated a criminal act in certain instances. And there are those who \nare undocumented, noncitizens, et cetera, unauthorized, that have not \nviolated any criminal laws.\n  Let me also say to you that defunding of the foolish Planned \nParenthood investigation is warranted. Why? In my own home State of \nTexas, in Houston, the indictment did not go to Planned Parenthood, \nwhich was the attempt; but it went to the perpetrators of fraud on \nPlanned Parenthood. There is nothing to investigate.\n  If you want to investigate, then investigate the lack of access of \nmillions of women in the State of Texas who were using those clinics \nthat Planned Parenthood had.\n\n[[Page H3595]]\n\n  So my point is this is a bill we must vote against. Vote against the \nunderlying rule and the bill, because it is nothing but fraud and \nfoolishness, and that is not what we should do in this House.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 5\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rarely speak from the well of the House. I come down \nhere today because, like my good friend from Georgia and many of us in \nthis institution, those of us that have studied the institution \ngenuinely love it and recognize that it is, fundamentally, what makes \nour Nation great.\n  When we speak of Congress, we are talking about the House of \nRepresentatives and the United States Senate. For a substantial period \nof time, both in the control of Democrats and Republicans, we have \ncarried ourselves in a way that has caused us to appear dysfunctional. \nAnd, in many instances--validly--those that look at us feel that we are \nunable to get things done.\n  My younger friend from Georgia pointed out a significant number of \nthings that we did do, and he is correct about that. But he also knows \nthere are a significant number of things that we have not been able to \ndo, largely for the reason that we are not acting in a bipartisan \nmanner--in an openly transparent manner, in many instances--in order to \nprovide for all of the Members of this body to have input.\n  I came to the well because, as I near my 80th birthday, I am in a \ndifferent category than many of the younger Members in this \ninstitution. Many of the younger Members of this institution have young \nfamilies.\n  We, the 434 of us that are seated--and we will swear in the 435th a \nlittle later today--and the delegates from the territories and the \nDistrict of Columbia, are in a variety of categories, as Americans. \nSome substantial number of Members in this body are multimillionaires; \na significant number of Members of this body easily qualify to be in \nthe middle class or the upper class; and there are some Members here \nwho are in the lower class in our society.\n  Fortunately for us, in the 22 years that I have been here, I have \nseen this body grow in its diversity. More women on both sides, African \nAmericans, Latino Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans are part \nof this body from different walks of life. Some of us own our own homes \nhere in the metropolitan Virginia-Maryland area. Some rent apartments. \nSome are in basements. Some are in one room. Some are gathered together \nbecause of the expenses here.\n  Now, my friend is right. I would like to go home and be able to show \nto my constituents and to his that we did everything that we could here \nto make for more efficiency. But I can cite the glut all over our \nagencies and, at the very same time, I make no apologies to anybody for \nhow hard I work or how hard he works and the fact that we are entering \nour 9th year without a pay raise.\n  Now, I think it is wrong for Members of the House of Representatives \nto live in their offices. I think that there is an ethics provision \nthat needs to be addressed, and I think there is a tax consideration \nthat needs to be addressed.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  And the public does not understand that nearly 100 Members, including \nthe Speaker of the House of Representatives, live in their offices. \nSomething is drastically wrong with that. Most of them are there for \nthe reason that they can't afford to live in this town; and somehow or \nanother, we are deserving, as are our staffs, deserving of being paid \nappropriately.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to remind my friends of the \nimportance of the legislation we are debating today. This legislation \nallows us to run our operations here in Congress. Unfortunately, with \nthis legislation, my friends in the majority are continuing their trend \nof putting politics above policy.\n  For this reason, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule and \noppose the underlying measure.\n  And I want to make it very, very clear that the remarks that I made \nare my remarks. They are not the remarks of the Democrats in this \ninstitution. But I know this: I have had a lot of Members on both sides \nof the aisle say to me that they know that I am correct.\n  Courage, friends, courage, that is what it takes.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I love watching my friend from Florida speak. The only thing I love \nmore than watching him speak is talking to him one-on-one when the \ncameras are turned off.\n  It is not as easy as it ought to be in 2016 to come to the floor of \nthe House and speak one's mind. Folks are worried about what the \nnewspapers are going to say. Folks are worried about what the news is \ngoing to broadcast. Folks are worried about what the Twitterverse is \ngoing to do.\n  A lot of folks will tell you one thing when the cameras are on and \nanother thing when the cameras are turned off, Mr. Speaker, but Alcee \nHastings is not one of those folks. It is the same message no matter \nwho he is talking to and no matter where he is saying it because he \ncomes from a place of conviction, and I love serving with people like \nthat.\n  Truthfully, Mr. Speaker, if folks knew that it wasn't just their \nMember of Congress that was like that, but it was the one next door, \nand the one down the road, and the one across the river, and the one \nupstate, I think we would have a very different discussion about \nwhether Congress is working or whether Congress is failing.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, when I try to sort those issues out, I don't really \nhave to go back home to figure out why folks are disappointed. I don't \neven have to go back to the public record. I don't have to go any \nfurther than this one debate on this one legislative day.\n  Just in our hour together, Mr. Speaker, I have heard Members suggest \nthat this House is using tactics not seen since Joe McCarthy. I \nwouldn't pay for that. I have heard Members suggest that this House is \nperpetuating racism and hate. I wouldn't pay for that. I have heard \nthat there are dastardly things happening in the work of this \ninstitution. I am not going to pay for that. I have heard that we have \nbeen involved in activities particularly shameful.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think we have all got a great relationship with the \nmen and women who send us here to serve them. We have a special \nrelationship, and a relationship that, I think, the men and women in \nthis Chamber work exceptionally hard to make good on; but when we use \nthe credibility that we develop in that relationship to tell folks that \nwe are broken, to tell folks that we are worthless, to tell folks that \nthe greatest experiment in self-governance that the world has ever \nknown is failing, they believe us. They believe us.\n  Mr. Speaker, the discussions that we have, the differences that are \nbrought to life on this floor, those are not failures. Those are \nsuccesses. The back and the forth, the fights that we have, the \nheadlines that get made when folks just can't agree, those are not \nfailures: those are successes.\n  When the Framers put together this Constitution, Mr. Speaker, they \nmade it hard--they made it hard to change the law of the land. It was \nsupposed to be the rare thing that happened when we all came together \nand found agreement, and when we did, it was going to be in the best \ninterest of a young Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have heard my colleagues challenge us to defeat this \nbill today, as if funding the United States Congress is a self-serving \naction. I don't know who the self-serving Members of this institution \nare, Mr. Speaker, because I have not met them.\n  My friend from Texas came to the floor, and she said: If we don't get \nour work done, NIH will not be funded. And she is right. She said: If \nwe do not get our work done, justice reform will not happen. And she is \nright. She said: If we do not get our work done, families that are \nstruggling to respond to floods in her home part of the country will \nnot get the dollars. And she is right. She is right.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are talking about changing the appropriations process \nto allow a little less openness, and I regret that. We are talking \nabout it because, in the name of doing that energy\n\n[[Page H3596]]\n\nand water bill that she spoke of, in the name of passing those bills \nthat are essential to the functioning of the country, in the name of \ndoing that responsibility that the Constitution places squarely on our \nshoulders, we have folks who pass amendments to bills only to let those \nbills fail.\n  I would tell you, as someone who believes in an open process, who \nbelieves in an open process, that if we can have that festival of \ndemocracy that is an open rule on an appropriations bill, let's have \nit. Let's let the votes fall where they may, and then send that bill to \nthe Senate and on to the White House and make it the law of the land.\n  But if in the name of making a point, we prevent this institution \nfrom doing its constitutionally mandated business, if in the process of \nmaking a political point, we prevent this institution from providing \nthe money for that fundamental research, from providing the money for \nthat flood relief, from providing the money for essential justice \nreform, I tell you, we have not honored this Nation with an open \nprocess; we have failed it.\n  And the question then falls to us: Are we going to have an open \nprocess that allows every Member to speak out on behalf of their \nconstituency to fight for what may be best for this Nation that we all \nlove? Or are we going to have election-year politics, decide that being \nable to produce that press release is more important than getting our \nwork done?\n  I happen to know the answer, Mr. Speaker. I happen to know the answer \nbecause I happen to know each one of these Members on a personal level. \nThere is not one of them who wouldn't turn in their voting card \ntomorrow if they could take a vote on the biggest issue that matters to \nthem today. There is not one of them that wouldn't turn in their voting \ncard tomorrow if they could make a difference for this generation and \nthe next generation today, and I love that about them. I love it about \neach and every one of them.\n  Passing this bill lets those folks come to work and get this job \ndone. Passing this bill allows us to get to work doing those things \nthat I believe will honor the men and women who sent us here. Passing \nthis rule allows us to get to the underlying bill that will keep the \nlights on not just for constituent service back in every district in \nthis land, but the lights on in what I would argue is the greatest \ndeliberative body, the greatest embodiment of self-governance that this \nworld has ever known.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:\n\n          An Amendment to H. Res. 771 Offered by Mr. Hastings\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 3. Immediately upon the adoption of this resolution it \n     shall be in order without intervention of any point of order \n     to consider in the House the resolution (H. Res. 769) \n     Terminating a Select Investigative Panel of the Committee on \n     Energy and Commerce. The resolution shall be considered as \n     read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on \n     the resolution to adoption without intervening motion or \n     demand for division of the question except one hour of debate \n     equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking \n     minority member of the Committee on the Rules.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of House Resolution 769.\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. HASTINGS.

Mr. Speaker and Members, it is my privilege to welcome \nCongressman Warren Davidson, his wife, Lisa; and their two beautiful \nchildren, Rachel and Zach, to Washington, D.C.\n  To the Davidsons, their extended family, and their friends who are \nhere to support them, we all wish you hearty congratulations. To \nCongressman Davidson, on behalf of a grateful\n\n[[Page H3598]]\n\nNation, I want to extend our gratitude for your many years of service \nin the United States Army. Thank you for your dedication to duty, \nhonor, and country.\n  Though I am dean of Ohio's delegation, it seems just like yesterday \nwhen I was in your shoes. This moment you will never forget. You have \nworked hard to put together a winning coalition to win a hard-fought \ncampaign, and that takes a dedicated person and a very giving family to \nmake the necessary sacrifices.\n  To accomplish worthy objectives during your time in Congress, you \nwill want to find issues that you can build coalitions around and then \nenlist others on both sides of the center aisle in that cause. Perhaps \nthe best advice I can give you is to stay close to the people where you \ncame from in Troy, Ohio; in Clark, Miami, Darke, Preble, and Butler \nCounties; and as Daniel Webster's words inspire us through the ages, \ndedicate our efforts to a higher cause, developing the resources of our \nland, calling forth its powers, building up its institutions, promoting \nall its great interests, and seeing whether we also, in our day and \ngeneration, may not perform something worthy to be remembered.\n  Welcome to the United States House of Representatives to Warren, \nLisa, and your family.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Cincinnati, Ohio (Mr. \nChabot) my dear colleague. He is the dean, the longest serving member, \non the Republican side.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I \nwant to thank her for her kind words to our now-colleague, Warren \nDavidson. As the two longest serving Members from Ohio, she and I have \nworked together for many years, particularly on matters important to \nour great State of Ohio. I look forward to continuing to work with her \nin the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, Warren Davidson is an American success story. Born and \nraised in the great State of Ohio, Warren enlisted in the Army right \nafter high school. While serving in Germany, he witnessed the fall of \nthe Berlin Wall. He impressed his superior officers with his dedication \nand leadership qualities and thus earned an appointment to West Point \nwhere he continued to excel, in fact, finishing in the top 10 percent \nof his graduating class.\n  Upon his return to Active Duty, Warren's reputation as an outstanding \nofficer earned him positions in some of the Army's most distinguished \nunits: The Old Guard, the 75th Ranger Regiment, and the 101st Airborne \nDivision.\n  For many people, that would be a successful career. But Warren had \nmore to accomplish. In 2000, he returned to Ohio to help out with the \nfamily manufacturing business. To prepare himself to run the business, \nhe earned an MBA from the University of Notre Dame, where, not \nsurprisingly, he graduated with honors.\n  Warren brought the same work ethic and leadership abilities that he \nemployed as an Army officer to grow and expand the family business. \nSince taking over the business, he has transformed it from a small shop \nwith 20 employees to an enterprise now employing more than 200 people.\n  Now Warren brings the lessons that he learned and the wisdom that he \ngained, both in the military and as a small-business owner, to the \npeople's House, to Congress. Personally, I think that the House will \nbenefit tremendously from his experiences, and I look forward--and I \nknow you also will look forward--to working with him.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to welcome Warren Davidson, his \nlovely wife, Lisa, and their children, Zach and Rachel, to the United \nStates House of Representatives.\n  The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, distinguished colleagues, and honored \nguests, it is a pretty good welcome. I thank you all.\n  My new colleagues, surely you know how surreal this moment is. Not \nall of you had the same experience of a special election. It is a \nlittle different. But you have all been here and have been given the \ntrust of your districts to come represent them and serve here, so I am \nsure you understand how surreal it is having already been here.\n  I am really honored today to have a lot of folks with me. We all know \nthat politics is a team sport. I have no greater teammate than my wife, \nLisa. Our family was able to join us. Our daughter, Rachel, and my son, \nZach, have been able to come on the floor. They took a fast route to \nthe floor here. My sister, Robin, her husband, Larry, and close to 100 \nother friends and family were able to come here. So having run \ncampaigns, you all know that it takes maybe a battalion-sized element \nto put a whole campaign together. So in some way, they are \nrepresentative of all the hard work that goes on to win a campaign. I \ncould not have been here without them. So I thank you all.\n  To really have come from the background, just enlisting in the Army, \ngoing to West Point, serving in some great units, and growing small \nmanufacturing companies, doing all these things that we heard about, it \nis pretty, pretty nice. I have been focused on raising a family and \ngrowing kids. Frankly, in October, I was not planning to run for \nCongress. To come from filing 10 minutes before the deadline, jumping \ninto a very competitive race, I understand that not a ton of you guys \nwanted the Speaker's job, and you got drafted. But about 15 other \nRepublicans wanted the district Representative job, so it was very \ncompetitive. I am really thankful to have won the race and been able to \ncome here.\n  It is really an honor to be able to stand here and talk with you, my \nnew colleagues. I look forward to getting to know every one of you on \nboth sides of the aisle. I hope you will take the chance to get to know \nme. You can probably appreciate drinking from a firehose. I think I had \nabout 2 or 3 hours now, maybe 4 hours, from my first meetings, whereas \nI think a lot of you had a couple of months, from November to January. \nI really hope to get to know you all.\n  The Founders intended us to have a strong Congress, and especially \nwith the Presidential race the way it is, Congress truly has an \nopportunity to show real leadership and to be able to have the chance \nto be here and do the incredibly consequential work, face the \nchallenge, and perhaps be part of solving some great things is an \nincredible honor. So let's get around to it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3598-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER\n\n  The SPEAKER.

Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume to say that to date, this is one of the most significant bills \nthat has come to the floor in a long time, and it is going to be an \nexcellent solution to a very, very difficult problem.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the \nsponsor of the bill, for its introduction.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chair, I thank Congressman Bishop and the whole \nNatural Resources Committee for all of the hard work they put into this \nbill.\n  This has been a months-long process of working with Democrats and \nRepublicans, the administration, Treasury, Puerto Rican elected \nofficials, all coming together to negotiate, to discuss, to \nphilosophize and then eventually come up with what I think is an \nexcellent resolution to the burning crisis in Puerto Rico. I want to \ntake a moment to talk about what is actually happening on the island.\n  Puerto Rico is $73 billion in debt. That is over 100 percent of GNP. \nThey have almost $2 billion of unpaid bills to their vendors. So what \ndoes that mean? That means schools are closing down because we don't \nhave fuel for energy in the schools or for school buses. Hospital wings \nare closing. Emergency vehicles aren't being run because the island \ndoesn't have money to pay its bills. This is a true economic crisis. It \nis a true humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Puerto Rico.\n  So the question becomes: Does this institution act to help Puerto \nRico, or do we continue to negotiate and refine and tweak a bill that \nwill never come to the floor, that will never make it to the Senate, \nthat will never gain the President's signature? Do we let perfect be \nthe enemy of the good?\n  I think this is a great bill that is going to actually get Puerto \nRico on a path to prosperity, opportunity, and economic growth; that is \ngoing to help the people in Puerto Rico who have a dream of living in \nPuerto Rico stay in Puerto Rico with their families in their \ncommunities on the island that they love.\n  Right now, there is despair. We have thousands of people leaving \nPuerto Rico every month to come to the mainland because there is no \nopportunity. This is what debt does to economies. It absolutely crushes \nthem, and it crushes people.\n  So what do we do? Well, we have a two-pronged approach. Number one, \nthe elected officials in Puerto Rico have known that this issue has \nbeen coming for years, and they haven't been able to get their hands \naround it, haven't had the political will to fix the burning problem. \nSo we are going to put into effect an oversight board to actually work \nwith the island government to get its finances and its budgets under \ncontrol.\n  That oversight board is going to have an opportunity to work on debt \nrestructuring, which is the second prong of this bill. $73 billion in \ndebt, they can't pay it. People might want to wish that all the \nbondholders could be paid. They might dream about all the bondholders \nbeing paid, but the bottom line is Puerto Rico doesn't have enough \nincome to pay its bondholders. They can't pay their vendors, let alone \ntheir bondholders.\n  So we set up a system where the island and the bondholders have a \nforum in which to negotiate a settlement, a resolution to this massive \ndebt. And if they can't come up with a resolution or a solution to the \ndebt, they can access the court system, and the courts can help them \nresolve the disputes in regard to this massive debt. It is that system \nthat is going to allow for debt restructuring and an oversight board \nthat is going to bring Puerto Rico to a place of economic health. When \nyou can get to a place of economic health, you can start to have a \nconversation about economic growth; and when you have economic growth, \nyou actually help people, you help families, and you help communities.\n  Now, there are some who have said that this bill is a bailout. Let me \ntell you what. I have the definition of a bailout, and a bailout \nhappens when this institution sends taxpayer monies to somewhere else \nor to somebody else. The bottom line is this bill doesn't spend any \ntaxpayer money bailing anybody out. There is no taxpayer money that is \ninvolved.\n  What we do here is say: Hey, listen. If you invested in Puerto Rican \nbonds and you might have gotten a great upside, a great return on your \nbonds that you maybe bought at 50 or 60 cents on the dollar, you took \nthat risk; and if there is a loss, you, the bondholder, are going to \nbear the loss on that bond, but the taxpayers aren't going to bear that \nloss for you.\n  So I think this is a great compromise, a great package that is going \nto bring economic health and growth back to Puerto Rico.\n  I want to thank Mr. Pierluisi for all of the insight that he has \ngiven to both sides of the aisle on what needs to be done to make this \nwork, and the elected politicians, the Speaker of the Puerto Rican \nHouse, who has been so gracious with his insight into how we structure \na package that is going to grow Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The United States flag has flown over Puerto Rico for more than a \ncentury. Those born on the island are American citizens, and more than \n200,000 have served in the United States military, including roughly \n10,000 serving today. Millions more live on the U.S. mainland but \nconsider Puerto Rico their home.\n  Mr. Chairman, we are here today because our fellow Americans are \nsuffering, and it is our constitutional responsibility to help them. \nThey are suffering from the effects of a debt crisis more than a decade \nin the making.\n  A devastating combination of mismanagement, unfair Federal policies, \nopportunistic hedge funds, and desperate budget cuts have destroyed the \neconomy on the island. The monstrous burden of Puerto Rico's $70 \nbillion debt is swallowing the funds needed to provide health care, \neducation, transportation, and public safety for the Commonwealth's \nfamilies.\n  Almost 100,000 people have left the Commonwealth last year to look \nfor\n\n[[Page H3601]]\n\nbetter economic opportunities, which only makes the situation on the \nisland worse. About 80 percent of children in Puerto Rico live in high-\npoverty areas, compared to about 11 percent of children on the \nmainland. The island's poverty rate is about 44 percent, and \nunemployment is 13 percent.\n  If Congress fails to act, the island and its people face another \ndecade of further economic and social collapse. Our fellow citizens of \nPuerto Rico should not have to endure this coming humanitarian crisis. \nOur colleague, Nydia Velazquez, has described the status quo as a \n``recipe to lose an entire generation to forced migration to the \nmainland.''\n  After 6 months of difficult bipartisan negotiations, four hearings, \nand a series of draft bills, we are here today to consider H.R. 5278. \nH.R. 5278 will provide the tools necessary to get the economy of Puerto \nRico on a more stable footing and allow the Commonwealth to regain \naccess to credit markets.\n  The bill would allow restructuring of all outstanding debt without \nfavoring any particular creditor; require transparent audits, combined \nwith annual fiscal plans and budgets; and temporarily pause the ongoing \nflurry of litigation to allow the oversight board to begin its work and \ncreate a space for voluntary negotiations.\n  As I have said throughout this process, this is not a bill that I or \nDemocrats would have written. The oversight board is too powerful and \nis yet another infringement of the sovereignty of the people of Puerto \nRico, and they have a right to find it offensive. The provisions \nundermining minimum wage and overtime rules don't belong in the bill. \nWhat is worse, they threaten the effectiveness of the overall \nlegislation.\n  Provisions that should be included--like full pension protections, an \nearned income tax credit, equal funding for Medicaid, and a Zika \nresponse--are missing. But the reality is that this is the only bill \nthat would attract enough support from my colleagues across the aisle \nto pass in a Congress which they control. There is no other avenue \navailable to address the crisis. This compromise is the bill we can and \nshould pass.\n  When measured against a perfect bill, this legislation is inadequate. \nWhen measured against the worsening crisis in Puerto Rico, this \nlegislation is vitally necessary.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5278.\n  I would like to take a moment to clarify for the record a number of \ninaccurate and misleading statements in the Committee Report on H.R. \n5278. It appears that the Committee Report on H.R. 5278 was prepared \nbased on earlier non-public drafts of the bill--not the version \nconsidered by the Committee. Several references plainly do not reflect \nthe current language in H.R. 5278 as introduced or as voted on by the \nHouse Committee on Natural Resources during its markup hearing.\n  The following statement on page 40 of the Committee Report \noversimplifies a complex problem facing Puerto Rico and, in my view, \nmischaracterizes the nature of the territory government's action: It \nsays, ``Puerto Rico's local politicians have accelerated the crisis on \nthe island through the passage of harmful legislation, including the \nimposition of a moratorium on the payment of debt.'' Puerto Rico's \npassage of a moratorium law was a local response to attempt to address \nits fiscal and debt emergency in the absence of necessary Congressional \naction. It is misleading and unreasonable to characterize the passage \nof a local moratorium law as accelerating the crisis.\n  The Committee Report's summary of section 101 provides that: \n``[additionally, this section provides for the appointment of seven \nindividuals to the Oversight Board through a process that ensures that \na majority of its members are effectively chosen by Republican \ncongressional leaders on an expedited timeframe, while upholding the \nPresident's constitutional role in making appointments.'' Let's be very \nclear: The President appoints all seven members of this Puerto Rico \nBoard. To be sure, members of Congress may make suggestions to the \nPresident, but the power to appoint members of this territorial entity \nremains with the President.\n  The Committee Report's summary of section 201 is inaccurate in a \nnumber of respects. The report states, on page 45, that \n``[i]mportantly, Fiscal Plans ensure the protection of the lawful \npriorities and liens as guaranteed by the territorial constitution and \napplicable laws, and prevent unlawful inter-debtor transfers of \nfunds.'' This interpretation is misleading and does not reflect the \nlanguage of the bill or the evolution of the language throughout the \nlegislative process. Section 201(b)(1)(N) provides that a Fiscal Plan \ncertified by the Oversight Board must ``respect'' the relative lawful \npriorities or lawful liens under territory laws, not ``ensure the \nprotection'' of such priorities or liens. The verb ``respect'' was \nspecifically chosen by the drafters of the bill and carefully \nconsidered by the Committee. For instance, at the Committee markup, \nRepresentative Fleming twice offered amendments that would have changed \nthe ``respect'' language in section 201(b)(1)(N) to ``comply with.'' \nThe Committee twice rejected those amendments--the first time on a \nvoice vote and the second time on a roll call vote, 16 yeas to 23 nays. \nThe Committee recognized that the verb ``comply with'' was unduly \nrestrictive and that the Oversight Board needed the flexibility \nafforded by the verb ``respect,'' which is more open-ended. For that \nreason, it is inaccurate for the Committee Report to state--contrary to \nthe current legislative text and the Committee's intent--that Fiscal \nPlans ensure the protection of lawful priorities and liens.\n  In addition, the summary of section 201 explains that ``[w]hile this \nlanguage seeks to provide an adequate level of funding for pension \nsystems, it does not allow for pensions to be unduly favored over other \nindebtedness in a restructuring.'' But Section 201(b)(1)(C) has nothing \nto do with relative priorities among various creditors; the provision \nrequires the Board to provide for adequate funding of pensions, which \nrelates to the Fiscal Plan and the manner by which annual budgets \ncomply with the Fiscal Plan. Of course, any restructuring under Title \nIII must be consistent with the Fiscal Plan under Section 314 of the \nbill, but the Committee Report is inaccurate in suggesting that this \nprovision relates to relative priorities.\n  The following statement on page 48 summarizing section 303 is missing \na critical adjective: ``nor may an executive order divert funds from \none instrumentality to another or to the territory.'' Certain executive \norders that divert funds from one territorial instrumentality to \nanother or to the territory may be lawful under applicable territory \nlaws. The only types of executive orders that are preempted by section \n303(3) of this Act are ``unlawful'' executive orders, as the text of \nsection 303(3) makes abundantly clear. For instance, if an executive \norder is permitted by the territory's constitution or its laws, it is \nnot an unlawful executive order and is not preempted by section 303. \nThe drafters intended section 303(3) to make clear that PROMESA \npreempts and renders void any executive orders issued beyond the scope \nof what would have been authorized by its local laws; lawful exercises \nof executive authority are unaffected.\n  In summarizing section 314 on page 50, the report states: ``[b]y \nincorporating consistency with the Fiscal Plan into the requirements of \nconfirmation of a plan of adjustment, the Committee has ensured lawful \npriorities and liens, as provided for by the territory's constitution, \nlaws, and agreements, will be respected in any debt restructuring that \noccurs.'' This summary suffers from the same problem that the summary \nof the provisions of section 201 suffered: It refers to language that \nhas never existed in a public version of the bill; rather, it reflects \nstaff-level draft text that was ultimately rejected. Section 201 \nclarifies that Fiscal Plans must ``respect'' lawful priorities and \nlawful liens. The Committee carefully considered this language and \ntwice rejected amendments proposed to change it to ``comply with'' such \npriorities and liens.\n  The summary of section 407 on page 52 explains that: ``[t]his section \ngrants creditors the right to sue upon the conclusion of the stay, if \nthe government of Puerto Rico transfers property between \ninstrumentalities during the tenure of the Oversight Board in violation \nof any agreement, or applicable law that a creditor has or would have a \npledge of, security interest in, or lien on such property.'' Section \n407, as drafted and passed through Committee establishes a federal \nremedy for Puerto Rico's creditors in certain circumstances. But the \naddition of the language ``or would have'' in the Committee Report, \nagain, reflects staff-level text that was not ultimately included in \nthe version approved by the Committee. The current text provides a \ncause of action for creditors that--at the time of the alleged unlawful \ntransfer--in fact have ``a pledge of, security interest in, or lien \non'' the transferred property. Contrary to the suggestion of the \nCommittee Report, the provision does not permit such a cause of action \nif the plaintiff only ``would have'' in some future circumstance such \nan interest.\n  Indeed, the fact that the addition of words like ``or would have'' \nwere discussed but not ultimately included in the text is strong \nevidence that Congress did not intend for such prospective, contingent \nrights to be within the scope of this provision. It would have been \nextraordinary to provide certain creditors an argument that federal law \nestablishes for them a property interest where no such property \ninterest existed under the terms of the agreements\n\n[[Page H3602]]\n\nthey negotiated. The Committee rightly declined to do so.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to one of the \nsenior members of our committee, a senior member of his delegation, and \nsomeone who happens to be celebrating today not only his anniversary, \nbut also his birthday; and what better way of giving a birthday present \nto the Representative from Alaska than to allow him to speak on the \nfloor on the subject of Puerto Rico.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 5278.\n  May I commend Chairman Bishop for his kindness in recognizing my \nbirthday and my anniversary. I am quite proud of that. I am 83 years \nold. I want a lot of you to remember the fact I still can kick tails \nand take names, so just keep that in mind.\n  This is a bill that I do support. It has been worked together with \nthe Puerto Ricans. It has been worked together with Representatives \nGrijalva and Pierluisi. I would say most all of the people involved in \nthis recognize this is not everything we would want, but it is the \nbill, I think, that can help Puerto Rico today and now.\n  It is not a bailout. That is for some people who keep saying it is a \nbailout. It does not allow taxpayer dollars to be used for paying down \nthe Puerto Rican debt.\n  I held a hearing in February on the oversight board concept, and it \nwas clear that it was needed and it was testified in favor of. I \nunderstand some reluctance in Puerto Rico, but let's get this ship \nrighted. Once we get it righted, restaffed, and the sails full of wind, \nthen Puerto Rico will have a chance.\n  I do support the multiple-step process. The bill combats the \nimmediate crisis. It will help out Puerto Rico's ability to take and \nget credit. We need more long-term solutions, though, about the \neconomic zones in Puerto Rico and how we improve the economy there so \nthey can continue to grow.\n  I want to compliment Mr. Duffy's amendment, and I will support Mr. \nDuffy and his work on this legislation. I do believe a HUBZone is very \nnecessary in the contracting program.\n  As I mentioned, I have been worked passionately on Puerto Rican \nissues on the floor of the House. Fifteen years ago, we had a vote \nabout statehood. I passed it by one vote. I am a big supporter of \nstatehood and always have been. It didn't occur. We didn't allow it.\n  Right now, this problem has to be addressed.\n  I again do compliment Mr. Bishop, Mr. Duffy, and members on that side \nof the aisle. Let's take our American people and Puerto Rico and give \nthem the recognition that is necessary. Let's take and help them now so \nwe can go forth.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Ms. Velazquez).\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I want to take this opportunity to \nreally thank Ranking Member Grijalva for the important role that he has \nplayed throughout this process.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the bill. When I was elected to \nCongress, I understood there would be tough votes. For me, PROMESA is \none of those votes. For those of us with ties to Puerto Rico, this a \nprofoundly personal issue.\n  There is plenty of blame to go around for this situation. San Juan \nhas played a role, but Washington and Wall Street have equally \ncontributed to this crisis. It is a crisis that is already harming \nworking families that call the island home and, if left unaddressed, it \nwill grow immeasurably worse.\n  So today we stand at a fork in the road: one path--the bill before \nus--empowers Puerto Rico to restructure 100 percent of its debt; the \nonly other route sends Puerto Rico to the courthouse, where it will be \nat the mercy of creditors that will inflict further suffering on the \nisland.\n  Now, some would suggest that if we oppose this bill, somehow a third \noption will magically appear before us. That is nonsense. The stark \nreality we now face is that, other than PROMESA, there are simply no \nother politically feasible options left.\n  That does not mean that this is a perfect bill. It is not even close. \nIt makes no sense that this bill includes an attempt to pay Puerto \nRican workers less than those on the mainland. It is offensive that \nPuerto Rico must foot a $370 million price tag for an oversight board \nits residents do not want. And the bill does not address economic \ngrowth incentives and healthcare parity, issues at the core of Puerto \nRico's crisis.\n  Despite these shortcomings, I see no alternative. If we do not act, \nPuerto Rico will unravel further. Basic services are being cut, and \nthese cuts will deepen. More schools will close. More police and \nfirefighters will be terminated. And those who will pay the price are \nPuerto Rico's most vulnerable: its children, its seniors, and its \nworking families.\n  We have a profound responsibility to prevent this catastrophe from \nworsening. Those suffering on the island are my brothers and sisters, \nmy fellow Puerto Ricans.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  But, my friends, they are also your fellow citizens. 200,000 Puerto \nRicans have fought--and shed blood--in every military conflict since \nWorld War I. Now these citizens need our help. This is a responsibility \nwe cannot ignore. You see, when the United States took Puerto Rico--and \nremember we seized it by force--we did not just obtain a pretty island. \nWe also took on a responsibility to care for the people who live there.\n  Now, let me say this: Living up to that responsibility does not end \nwith this vote on this bill today. Decisions made by Washington over \ndecades have corroded Puerto Rico's economy. Addressing those problems \nwill require more work by Congress. Until we end the colonial \nconditions that have subjugated and exploited the island, there will be \nno long-term recovery.\n  So this bill alone is not enough. We must pass additional \nlegislation, in the next 6 months, addressing Puerto Rico's deep-seated \neconomic challenges and ongoing healthcare crisis. If we do not, then, \nWashington, we have failed the people of Puerto Rico once more.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is not the legislation I would have written, but \nit is the only way we can extend a lifeline to Puerto Rico right now. \nIn many ways, the easy path for me would be to vote ``no.'' Certainly, \nI have heard the case made by some in the Puerto Rican community.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chair, at the end of the day, I know that if this bill does not \npass, people I care about and love on the island I grew up on will \nsuffer greatly. At least with this legislation, Puerto Rico can begin \nrestructuring its debts and start down a new path toward a brighter \nfuture. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill. Then please \njoin me in working to address the other long-term challenges \nconfronting Puerto Rico.\n  In closing, let me thank all those who worked on this legislation, \nespecially Leader Pelosi, Speaker Ryan, and Whip Hoyer. Let me also \nthank Ranking Member Grijalva and Chairman Bishop for their efforts as \nwell as my fellow Puerto Rican Members of Congress. And, of course, our \nthanks to the staff who dedicated countless hours crafting this \ncompromise.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Curbelo). He is from the southern tip of Florida, as \nclose to Puerto Rico as you can get on the mainland.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of H.R. \n5278, the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability \nAct, or PROMESA. I want to thank Chairman Bishop and Representative \nDuffy, who have shown steadfast leadership in finding practical \nsolutions to address the fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico.\n  The situation in Puerto Rico is urgent and so is the need for a \nresponsible reform agenda. Hundreds of thousands of citizens have left \nthe island--many have come to Florida--to find better opportunities as \na result of the deteriorating economic conditions.\n  Our friends in Puerto Rico, our fellow American citizens deserve a \nbetter future, one that gives them the chance to\n\n[[Page H3603]]\n\nachieve prosperity on the island. This legislation is an important step \nforward in helping the island mitigate the existing humanitarian and \neconomic emergency in a responsible way.\n  The bill also allows the congressional task force to look at \nimpediments to economic growth and poverty reduction, including \nequitable access to Federal healthcare programs for the island's \nresidents. Serious challenges remain in the healthcare sector--like the \nimpending Medicaid cliff--that could have a detrimental impact on the \nfuture of the island.\n  I also urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment with Mr. \nJolly which will guarantee that addressing the nearly 60 percent of \nchildren living in poverty on the island is a top priority. As we work \nto achieve economic stability on the island, we must also ensure that \nthe mechanisms in this bill benefit the extremely vulnerable child \npopulation.\n  Congress has an important interest in ensuring that Puerto Rico not \nonly survives the current crisis, Mr. Chairman, but that it is able to \nbuild a better and more sustainable future. Again, I am very supportive \nof the bipartisan solutions in H.R. 5278, and I urge my colleagues to \nvote in favor of the bill and of my amendment which addresses child \npoverty on the island.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer), our whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, at the outset, rarely do we see the \npolitical courage and intellectual integrity that we have seen in the \ngentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez). I have worked with her for \nmonths now trying to get to a solution fair to Puerto Rico and fair to \nthe 3.5 million American citizens who live in Puerto Rico.\n  I also want to thank my friend Jose Serrano, also from New York, also \nPuerto Rican, also having thought about this extraordinarily \nthoughtfully, and it has been difficult. I want to congratulate both of \nthem for coming to the decision that is a terribly difficult one for \nthem that this is, at this juncture, the only alternative to the pain \nand the suffering of which Ms. Velazquez spoke.\n  I am sure the citizens of Puerto Rico are watching this debate, and \nthey understand this is not a perfect bill. It is not the bill I or Mr. \nPierluisi--who lost an election, in my view, because of his fidelity to \nwhat he believes is in the island's best interest--would have written.\n  It forces Puerto Rico to take some bitter medicine, accept an \noversight board with broad powers that is unacceptable to many living \non the island, and it does not provide additional assistance to the \nisland that is critically needed and ought to be done. Hopefully we can \naddress that.\n  It is a compromise, and it will enable the Commonwealth of Puerto \nRico to restructure its debt and prevent economic catastrophe. I can \nassure both sides of the aisle in this Chamber and in the Senate that \nit is a compromise forged out of a serious consideration of all \npossible alternatives that could result in bipartisan agreement.\n  We must not risk the cost of further inaction by this Congress, which \nshould have acted months ago; but it is not too late to do the right \nthing. Congress must act before Puerto Rico's next interest payment is \ndue on July 1.\n  According to The New York Times Editorial Board: This bill ``has \nflaws . . . ''.\n  I think both sides would agree to that.\n  The New York Times went on: `` . . . but at this late hour, it offers \nthe island its best chance of survival.''\n  It is, therefore, Mr. Chairman, my advice and urging to our Members \nthat we vote for this bill. We need to come together and pass this bill \nwithout any controversial riders.\n  Again, I want to thank Representatives Velazquez and Serrano and \nResident Commissioner Pierluisi for their leadership, their courage, \nand their integrity.\n  Mr. Chairman, we need to pass this bill for the American citizens \nliving on Puerto Rico and to meet the responsibility of which Ms. \nVelazquez spoke so eloquently.\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), one of the premier members of our \ncommittee.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5278. I \nthank the gentleman from Wisconsin, Congressman Duffy, and Chairman \nBishop for their work in crafting this bipartisan legislation.\n  H.R. 5278 is a compromise bill designed to save Puerto Rico from \neconomic calamity and prevent a taxpayer bailout. Mr. Chairman, I \nsuggest that the admission from both sides of the aisle that this bill \nisn't perfect is a testament that this bill is the best solution.\n  Puerto Rico is in a crisis. The territory has already missed payments \non its debt, and more and larger missed payments are on the near \nhorizon. The fiscal and economic conditions of Puerto Rico are \nunsustainable. Based on the constitutionally delegated power of \nCongress ``to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations \nrespecting the territory or other property belonging to the United \nStates,'' we have a responsibility to take action on this matter.\n  This unsustainable debt burden brought on by poor decisions, \nunfulfilled promises, and bad investments has crippled their economy. \nTheir unemployment rate is 12.2 percent, and since Puerto Ricans are \nAmerican citizens, thousands of young people come to the mainland each \nyear to find work. Puerto Rico is spiraling out of control, and it is \nour constitutional responsibility to put our territory on a different \npath and change the economic trajectory.\n  H.R. 5278 establishes a 7-member oversight board that will have the \nauthority to establish budgets for the territory, require the scoring \nof legislation so the people of Puerto Rico know the true costs of \ngovernment programs, and the power to veto contracts and executive \norders.\n  Once again, I would like to thank Congressman Duffy and Chairman \nBishop for their hard work in crafting a bill to get Puerto Rico on the \nright track without a taxpayer bailout. I urge my colleagues to support \nH.R. 5278 to stop Puerto Rico's economic death spiral and to lay a \nfoundation for a brighter future in Puerto Rico without spending \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Serrano).\n  Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, when we started these negotiations, with \nboth sides wanting to do something, with both leaderships in the House \nwanting to do something, I knew that at the end of the day I would be \nvoting for a bill. I knew I had to do that for a very simple reason. \nInactivity, inaction was not an option. The only option was to do a \nbill.\n  What that bill would look like was my question. What that bill would \nlook like was my challenge and my dilemma. The bill changed. The \noriginal bill had some provisions that no one could really defend on \neither side. We have made a bill now that does have some hard pills to \nswallow, but then over $70 billion in debt with no signs of being able \nto pay is even more of a bitter pill to swallow. The territory is \nhurting. The people are hurting.\n  In fact, if anything comes out of this that is positive, it is the \nfact that the U.S. Congress is paying attention to Puerto Rico in a way \nthat it hasn't in a long, long time, if at all. We are paying \nattention, and we want to do something about the situation at hand.\n  We are not supposed to direct our comments to the gallery or to the \nTV cameras, so I won't do that. But there are people watching this, and \nthey need to have faith in the fact that both parties have come \ntogether to come together with a plan that will help us, a plan that \nwill bring Puerto Rico back out of this debt situation. And, most \nimportantly, I believe there is a commitment on both sides to work on \neconomic development projects for the future to help Puerto Rico and \nits economy.\n  But I couldn't get off this podium today without addressing my most \nimportant issue, and that is that the problem with Puerto Rico \ncontinues to be the status. As long as Puerto Rico is a colony, a \nterritory of the United States, these issues will come back and other \nissues will come back.\n  I once, some months ago, either sarcastically or very profoundly, \nsaid that all we were doing if we didn't deal with the status was \nputting a Band-Aid on a bigger problem. Well, there is a bigger \nproblem, and I think it is time Congress came together with the people \nof\n\n[[Page H3604]]\n\nPuerto Rico and decided to end the colonial status. But ending the \ncolonial status does not mean tweaking the colony to make it a little \nbetter or washing the face of the colony to make it a little more \npresentable. It means getting rid of the colony and either becoming the \n51st State or an independent nation. There is no other solution.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  And for us, as the people who promote--and rightfully so--democracy \nthroughout the world, to have a colony for 118 years is wrong. And \nremember, Puerto Rico didn't do this by itself. The indifference and \ninequality created this problem, as much as everything else.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Idaho (Mr. Labrador), my good friend, who has done a whole lot of \nwork on this particular bill.\n  Mr. LABRADOR. I thank the chairman and Mr. Duffy for the work they \nand their staffs have done on this critical piece of legislation. I \nespecially want to thank my staffer, Aaron Calkins, for his work to \nmake this a better bill. We have worked countless hours to improve this \nbill, and I am proud of the work that we have done.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today as a member of the Natural Resources \nCommittee and as a Representative of Idaho's First Congressional \nDistrict to support H.R. 5278.\n  The debt crisis in Puerto Rico is a result of years of liberal \npolicies where the government carelessly borrowed and overspent, while \nsimultaneously encouraging mismanagement and inefficiency. We cannot \nview Puerto Rico's situation in a vacuum. If left unresolved, the \nfinancial crisis in Puerto Rico will impact the rest of our Nation.\n  The bill imposes fiscal reforms without spending a single dollar of \nU.S. taxpayer money to relieve Puerto Rico's debt. The bill protects \ntaxpayers from bailing out a government that spent recklessly and \navoids setting a horrible precedent that could tempt free-spending \nStates to walk away from their obligations.\n  Specifically, H.R. 5278 establishes a strong oversight board to \nrequire Puerto Rico to balance its budget and achieve fiscal \nresponsibility. The bill includes language that ensures that the fiscal \nplans and any potential restructuring must honor lawful priorities and \nliens as guaranteed by Puerto Rico's constitution and laws.\n  Every State and municipality in this country relies on bond markets \nto provide funding for government operations. H.R. 5278 creates the \nbalance that will effectively address the needs of Puerto Rico, while \nensuring access to these markets for States and municipalities \nnationwide.\n  In conclusion, as a person who was born and raised in Puerto Rico and \nsomebody who is very proud of his Puerto Rican heritage, I love the \npeople, I love the island, and I hope that this bill sets them on the \npath to fiscal responsibility and a brighter future.\n  The House must pass this bill to establish the necessary framework to \nhelp Puerto Rico put its fiscal house in order, while also protecting \nthe interests of every American.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nPuerto Rico (Mr. Pierluisi), who, at great risk politically, continued \nto push for this compromised bill we have before us; and for that, we \nare grateful.\n  Mr. PIERLUISI. Mr. Chairman, I represent Puerto Rico in Congress, and \nI rise in support of PROMESA.\n  Puerto Rico is at a crossroads. Since 1898, it has been a territory \nof the United States, subject to the broad powers of Congress under the \nTerritory Clause.\n  In 1917, Congress conferred U.S. citizenship on individuals born in \nPuerto Rico. In the 1950s, Congress authorized and approved a \nconstitution for Puerto Rico, which provides the island with a \nrepublican form of government consisting of three branches.\n  Because Puerto Rico is a territory, my constituents have never been \ntreated equally relative to their fellow U.S. citizens in the States in \nterms of either democratic rights or economic opportunities. In large \npart, to compensate for the lack of fair treatment at the Federal \nlevel, the Puerto Rican Government has spent beyond its means at the \nlocal level, leading to excessive deficits and debt.\n  This lack of discipline is regrettable but understandable, since the \nPuerto Rican Government is seeking to provide a quality of life to \nisland residents comparable to the quality of life in the States. Bear \nin mind that my constituents can hop on a plane any time, any day, and \nmove to Florida or Texas.\n  The bill we consider today, PROMESA, is a bipartisan compromise \nintended to deal with the territory's unprecedented fiscal crisis, \nwhich is severe and immediate. The bill will enable Puerto Rico to \nrestructure its public debt in a fair and orderly manner, while \nestablishing an independent and temporary oversight board to ensure \nthat Puerto Rico has a viable, long-term fiscal plan and balanced \nbudgets and that it sticks to both.\n  In an emergency, the first step is to stabilize the situation, and I \nbelieve PROMESA can accomplish this objective. Without this \nlegislation, the Puerto Rican Government is likely to collapse, \nparticipants in public pension plans will be terribly harmed, and many \nbondholders could lose their investments.\n  PROMESA is in the interest of all stakeholders, and the most likely \nalternative is chaos, litigation, a rapidly deteriorating quality of \nlife in Puerto Rico, and even greater migration to the States. However, \nlet me be plain. This bill is an essential first step, but it is not an \nenduring solution.\n  The Federal Government and, indeed, the Puerto Rican Government must \ncome to terms with a fundamental fact: so long as my constituents are \ntreated like second-class citizens, Puerto Rico will never have a \nfirst-class economy.\n  Puerto Rico must become a full and equal member of the American \nfamily as a State, which is the just and logical next step, or Puerto \nRico must join the community of nations as a sovereign country.\n  Puerto Rico deserves true democracy and true dignity--nothing less--\nyet first things come first. We have to deal with this immediate \ncrisis. We have to save the house in Puerto Rico. Vote ``yes'' on H.R. \n5278.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I, too, would like to express my \nappreciation and sincere gratitude to the Resident Commissioner of \nPuerto Rico for his hard work.\n  I may be known as the historian of this body, but the gentleman from \nOklahoma will give a historical perspective.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. \nLucas).\n  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to note that there are only a \nhandful of my colleagues on the floor or in the body who were here when \nthe precedent for this process was set in 1995.\n  Some of my colleagues on this side of the room argue that we are \nsetting a new precedent. We are not. Some of you remember 1994, when I \ncame as a new Member in a special election. Some of you remember the \neconomic chaos, the near collapse of the District of Columbia and the \ncity of Washington. Some of you remember how we were told in those days \nthat you can't go into certain parts of town because it is not safe. \nSome remember the stories about how a high percentage--if not almost \nhalf--the police cars wouldn't run at any one time.\n  I remember waking up one July night and looking out the fifth-floor \nwindow of the apartment building I was in as the firemen were hosing \ndown a spot not many paces from the corner of First and D Streets where \nsomeone had been killed, literally within hundreds of feet of the \nFederal campus. Washington, D.C., the District of Columbia, was about \nto collapse into chaos--1994.\n\n  So what did we do in 1995? We passed a bill very similar to this. We \nset up a supervisory board that took control of the finances to help \nright the ship.\n  For 2 years, there were tremendously painful decisions made here in \nWashington, D.C., at the municipal level; but after those 2 years, we \nhad 4 years of balanced budgets, and the Control Act, as it was called, \nwas suspended. It was successful. And the renaissance this town, this \ncommunity has gone through all started with that bill in 1995.\n  Now, I am voting for this piece of legislation because I believe my \nfellow American citizens who live in Puerto\n\n[[Page H3605]]\n\nRico deserve the right to have a renaissance, deserve the right to move \nforward. But we are all Members of elected bodies and we know how tough \nthese decisions and situations are.\n  Pass this bill; create the supervisory board; give the good citizens \nof Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth, our fellow Americans, a chance to \nbenefit, just as Washington, D.C., did. They deserve the chance.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez).\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this \nlegislation. The people of the enchanted island deserve better. It is \nmy duty to my heritage and to the land where I intend to return some \nday and where someday--hopefully, not soon--I intend to be buried.\n  As President Obama said so profoundly when he visited the land of his \nfather's birth, Kenya, a nation with one of the richest histories of \nthe struggle for freedom against the colonial power, I, too, Luis \nGutierrez, am deeply and profoundly connected to my father's \nbirthplace.\n  I cannot add my vote to this bill and go back to Puerto Rico or to \nthe Puerto Rican people in my congressional district in Illinois with \nmy head held high. I cannot and will not, not when I know that the \nmajority of votes that will pass this legislation if it passes today \nwill come from the Democratic Party, a party that, for all its flaws, \nis a party I expect a lot more from in times like this.\n  At a moment in American history when Latinos are quite literally \nbeing dragged through the mud by the other party and maligned for being \nLatinos and distrusted and disrespected because of where their parents \nor grandparents were born, I expect my fellow Democrats to stand up \ntall when the lives and destinies of so many citizens--the entire \nisland and its people--are held in the hands of the U.S. Congress.\n  By law, they do not have a vote here. By law, they need others to \nvote on their behalf. By law, Puerto Rico belongs to, is property of \nbut not part of, the United States. By law, this Congress owns Puerto \nRico and must treat that ownership as stewardship, as a caring and \nrespectful seat of power over the powerless.\n  And because it is the Democratic Party that will supply so many folks \nto enact this bill, I expect my colleagues to demand more. I expect us \nnot to support a sub-minimum wage. I expect us not to waive overtime \nrules that pay people for the work they do.\n  I expect my fellow Democrats to stand up for equity and equality for \nPuerto Ricans in our Tax Code, in Medicare and health care, so that \nthey don't have to flee Puerto Rico to go to Orlando, Newark, or \nChicago.\n  I expect Democrats to join me in opposing the same type of unelected \ncontrol board that has no accountability to the people that it is \ncontrolling--the type of control board focused on austerity without \nconsequences of action for the people; the kind of control board that \nmade decisions in Flint, Michigan, and that poisoned the people that \ndid not elect them, that acted slowly to remedy the situation until \nother governments and other elected leaders accountable to the people \nthey govern have to step up and begin addressing.\n  Let me say, I am going to offer a translation in Spanish.\n  (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)\n  This is not my promise. My promise is that the people of Puerto Rico \nbe respected, that we don't treat them as if they were colonized \nslaves. I reject this bill. Let me tell you that my promise is clear: \nto continue my work to defend Puerto Rico. As it is said by the Puerto \nRican people: precious, it does not matter what tyrant treats you with \nbad intentions, precious you'll be.\n  Esta no es mi promesa; mi promesa es que el pueblo de Puerto Rico se \nrespete y que no se trate como si fueran colonizados esclavos. Yo \nrechazo esta propuesta, y les digo que mi promesa es clara; de trabajar \npara defender. Porque como se dice pueblo de Puerto Rico preciosa, no \nimporta el tirano te trate con negra maldad.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Collins of Georgia). The gentleman from \nIllinois will provide the Clerk a translation of his remarks.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), one of the cosponsors of this bill.\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chairman, I went to Puerto Rico in March. I \nhave been involved in negotiating this, at the request of the Speaker, \nliterally since the first of this year.\n  This is difficult. This is something that nobody is happy with. This \nis something where everybody is going to take a haircut because the \ndepth of the problem is so bad.\n  What we heard right after this Congress began its session this year \nwas: Why don't we just give them a super chapter 9 bankruptcy? That \nwould have been bad for the future of Puerto Rico, because super \nchapter 9 would have dumped the $72 billion of debt and had it wiped \nout. And there is no way that Puerto Rico, having stiffed $72 billion \nworth of bondholders, would ever have been able to access the bond \nmarket again.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Bond market access is essential to any type of State or municipal \nfinancing.\n  So what do we have? A choice of doing nothing, and we have heard \nabout the severe consequences if we do nothing, or going with something \nthat worked in the District of Columbia, which is the oversight board.\n  Now, sure, they are unelected. One of them has to be from Puerto \nRico. But the Puerto Rican Government, which has been elected, is the \none that caused this problem to begin with. They have increased just \nabout every function of spending on the Island except debt service, and \nthey have borrowed more and more and more and more, and they don't have \nthe money, or wouldn't appropriate the money to service the debt.\n  That is why we are here today, and that is what has got to be fixed. \nIt should be fixed with an oversight board working in conjunction with \nthe Puerto Rican Government, not by a court, or simply by not doing \nanything. It can be fixed, and Puerto Rico can have a renaissance \nbecause this is about the only practical way out of the mess.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).\n  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission \nto revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong \nsupport of H.R. 5278. This bill is not a perfect bill, but it is a true \nbipartisan compromise, and it is the only option on the table to \naddress the crisis in Puerto Rico, which is the home to 3.5 million \nAmerican citizens.\n  The solution that this bill adopts is simple: It will allow Puerto \nRico to restructure its debt in an orderly, court-supervised process \nand, in exchange, a temporary, temporary Federal oversight board will \nhelp Puerto Rico make the structural reforms necessary to get its \nfinances in order and set it on the path of economic growth.\n  I would like to truly thank all parties for their hard work on this \nbill, especially Mr. Pierluisi; my good friends from New York, my \ncolleagues Representatives Velazquez and Serrano; Ranking Member \nGrijalva; Chairman Bishop; Leader Pelosi; and Antonio Weiss, at the \nTreasury Department.\n  New York City, which I represent, has some experience with control \nboards. When we faced a fiscal crisis back in the 1970s, the State \nestablished two control boards. And while that was a tough pill to \nswallow, in the long run, it made our city better and stronger.\n  I would like to emphasize that the solution to New York City's fiscal \ncrisis involved a control board, a debt restructuring, and a $2.3 \nbillion loan from the Federal Government. Puerto Rico isn't getting any \nFederal money at all, so a debt restructuring law is really the least \nwe can do to help them.\n  Finally, while some opponents of this bill claim on this floor that \ndebt restructuring is unnecessary because Congress solved D.C.'s fiscal \ncrisis in the nineties with just a control board, this is fundamentally \nuntrue.\n  The only reason the D.C. Control Board was able to balance D.C.'s \nbudget so quickly was because Treasury assumed the District's $4 \nbillion in pension obligations the year after the Control Board was \ncreated.\n\n[[Page H3606]]\n\n  So a control board by itself is not enough. We need to do more. But I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. MacArthur), who is another Member who has worked \nhard on this particular bill.\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Chairman, we all know about the crisis in Puerto \nRico involving 3\\1/2\\ million U.S. citizens, and we know the causes, \nfiscal mismanagement over decades, resulting in nearly $120 billion of \nbonds and unfunded pension liabilities. Unemployment is two times what \nit is here on the mainland, and people are fleeing Puerto Rico in \ndroves, especially young people. It is not sustainable.\n  Mr. Chairman, we decided, as a society, hundreds of years ago, that \nwe were not going to throw debtors into prison, but we were going to \nallow for the orderly reorganization of debts. And yet, Puerto Rico \ndoes not have the basic laws that allow that to take place in this \nsituation. This bill fixes that.\n  This bill puts equal pressure on bondholders, on the island of Puerto \nRico. The bill will require them to work together or there will be \nconsequences. And the bill brings an oversight board to help that \nhappen, to even require that to happen. We have to do this.\n  But, Mr. Chairman, fixing the debt crisis alone is not going to fix \nPuerto Rico's future. We need growth initiatives. This island will not \nenjoy an enduring prosperity until this Congress also thinks about how \nto help Puerto Rico grow.\n  That is why I introduced a title to this bill; it is just a sense of \nCongress, but it puts a flag in the ground saying that we have more \nwork to do on growth, and I am really pleased to see a Growth \nCommission included in the bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have spent a lifetime in business. I have had the \nprivilege of creating thousands of jobs. That doesn't happen when you \nhave uncertain conditions.\n  In 1996, we changed the Tax Code in Puerto Rico that treats the \nreturn of earnings from that island to the mainland like it is coming \nfrom a foreign country, and you can watch the growth rate of Puerto \nRico plummet ever since. Ever since 2006--my date was wrong--2006, you \ncan see the growth rate plummet over 10 years.\n  Manufacturing is still half of the island's economy and yet, it is \nreduced by half over the last 20 years. We have to do things that make \nPuerto Rico an attractive business environment.\n  We all are worried about offshoring. This is an opportunity for near-\nshoring in a U.S. territory. It is an opportunity to demonstrate pro-\ngrowth principles in action; to allow Puerto Rico, an island paradise, \nto become an economic miracle.\n  This is the opportunity that I see. I am proud of the bill. Like any \nbill, it is not perfect. But let's not let the perfect become the enemy \nof the good. It is a good bill that deserves our support. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Pelosi). Her time and commitment to the people of \nPuerto Rico and to working on a compromise in a bipartisan bill have \nbeen the primary drivers to this point on the bill that we have before \nus.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Chairman, I rise and commend the leadership of \nChairman Bishop. I thank the gentleman for bringing us here today, as \nwell as our ranking member, Mr. Grijalva, for bringing this compromise \nlegislation to the floor.\n  It is with the deepest of pride that I join my colleagues, \nCongresswoman Nydia Velazquez and Congressman Jose Serrano, in support \nof this legislation. Although we have concerns about some elements of \nit, we support it on balance.\n  I can't help but mention to my colleagues here that in April, many of \nyou were there when Congress bestowed the Congressional Gold Medal on \nthe legendary 65th Infantry Regiment, a largely Puerto Rican regiment \nthat served with valor since World War I.\n  Honor et Fidelitas, honor and fidelity, so rings the motto of this \ncourageous regiment of Americans. With honor and fidelity, the 65th \nRegiment overcame prejudice and bigotry and wrote a new chapter of \nheroism in our shared American story.\n  In the Panama Canal Zone in World War I, on the doorsteps of Nazi \nGermany, in the defining crucible of the Korean War, and beyond, the \nBorinqueneers protected freedom abroad and advanced dignity at home.\n  Their daring on the battlefield helped break down the discrimination \nfacing Puerto Rican and Latino Americans across our country. They \nenriched our Nation with the strength of their service, through the \nexcellence of their example, and the power of their bravery. Their \nvalor under fire is nothing short of legendary. The heroic service of \nthe Borinqueneers is one of the true great American stories.\n  I bring this to mind because on that day in Emancipation Hall, which \nwas crowded with people, and the presentations were led by the \nbipartisan, bicameral House and Senate, Democrat and Republican \nleadership who had representatives of our military to salute the \nbravery of these people of Puerto Rico in defense of our country.\n  Now we have nearly 100,000 veterans in Puerto Rico who will be \naffected, harmed, unless we act today. Today, more than 3 million of \nour fellow American citizens in Puerto Rico are facing a fiscal and \npublic debt emergency that threatens their economy, their communities, \nand their families. Only Congress can provide Puerto Rico with the \ntools it needs to emerge from this crisis.\n  After long bipartisan negotiations, we achieved a restructuring \nprocess that meets the test of workability. Does it work? Will it \nhappen?\n  This is not a bailout. Some people are trying to describe it as such \nfor some other purposes. I know that my colleague from Puerto Rico, \nPedro Pierluisi, has explained to us the urgency of this. I know that \nwe would have, perhaps, had a bill that didn't have some of the \nprovisions in it that are in it, and we would have preferred to add \nsome better things to the bill, but that is not the choice before us.\n  As legislators, we have to make a choice: will the bill alleviate the \nchallenge that the people of Puerto Rico are facing? Our Resident \nCommissioner, Pedro Pierluisi, thinks that this bill does achieve that, \nand I thank him for his courageous leadership on all of this.\n  Again, this can be a very passionate discussion. It is an emotional \none because it involves the lives of people that some of us know and \nare part of the families of our Members, as Jose Serrano and Nydia \nVelazquez mentioned. But we have to be dispassionate in how we make a \njudgment about how we can solve the problem, and we have that \nopportunity today.\n  The oversight board that President Obama will appoint is one that \nwill have the opportunity to implement the restructuring as described \nin this legislation. On a bipartisan basis, we will be submitting names \nto the President promptly so that he can appoint the oversight board.\n  It would be my commitment to make sure that the commitment from the \nHouse Democrats is for there to be one from Puerto Rico representing \nthe people of Puerto Rico on that board.\n  In addition to the oversight board, this legislation also contains a \ntask force, a Members' task force whose task it is to look at \nimpediments in Federal law to Puerto Rico's economic growth. I would \nhope that that task force would afford us the opportunity to see other \nways that we can help the economic growth of Puerto Rico, for the \ncitizens, our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico.\n  We can talk about parity in relationship to Medicare, Medicaid, and \nthe rest. We can talk about the earned income tax credit, which we \nenjoy in the United States, and having that be more available in Puerto \nRico. We can talk about ways to use the Tax Code to give more \nopportunity there.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the legislation. Even though it is \nnot the bill that either one side would have written, it is a \ncompromise. But it will provide the people of Puerto Rico the tools to \novercome the crisis and move forward, hundreds of millions of dollars, \nmaybe $1 billion a year. It will alleviate Puerto Rico from having to \ncommit, because of the restructuring, and will enable it to meet the \nneeds of the people of Puerto Rico as it gets back on its feet.\n  Puerto Rico's economic success is important to the United States. Our\n\n[[Page H3607]]\n\neconomic growth and job creation plans must include our fellow citizens \nin Puerto Rico. I would hope, with the task force; I would hope with \nfuture legislation, as we go forward, we will recognize how close our \nconnection is, how important it is for Puerto Rico to survive, and \nexpress our gratitude to the people of Puerto Rico for the vitality \nthey bring to the United States of America, and for the security that \nso many Puerto Ricans risk their lives to protect our country.\n  With that, I urge our colleagues to pray over it and conclude, as our \nthree colleagues, Congresswoman Velazquez, Congressman Serrano, \nCongressman Pierluisi have concluded, that, on balance, we must move \nforward for the benefit of the veterans, for the people, for their \nchildren, for the citizens of Puerto Rico.\n  I urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  I appreciate the comments that have been made so far on a bill that I \nwant to think actually has a lot of good in it.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Article 4, section 3 of the Constitution provides Congress not only \nthe power, but also the responsibility to do what is needful dealing \nwith the territories.\n  As a matter of fact, Mr. Chairman, just this morning, the Supreme \nCourt ruled on a case concerning the territory and a question of double \njeopardy. By a 6-2 decision, the Court held that Puerto Rico is not a \nseparate sovereignty because the ultimate source of its power and its \nconstitution is the United States Congress. So, indeed, this reminds us \nall here today of our duty to assist in the territorial issues.\n  Now, there are seven titles to this particular piece of legislation. \nThe first two deal with the oversight board that will bring fiscal \nplans and a budget to the island. Titles III and VI deal with \nrestructuring of the debt if certain criteria are met in the oversight \nboard's discretion that it include good-faith debt negotiations with \nits creditors.\n  Title V is something I think we sometimes overlook because it gives \nfast-track authority for vital infrastructure projects to be moved by \nthe government of Puerto Rico, especially in the area of energy \ngeneration and distribution systems. One of the problems of Puerto Rico \nis the high energy costs that have caused them to lose jobs. What we \nare attempting to do is trying to find a way of changing that problem \nand reducing Puerto Rico's reliance on diesel fuel to generate their \nelectricity. That is one of the parts of this bill that is extremely \nimportant and I think is overlooked sometimes. The final title I am \nhappy about because that has pro-growth portions and reforms in it.\n  But let it be very clear: this is a conservative bill that is rooted \nin the Constitution that does not cost the American taxpayers a dime. \nIt is not a bailout. It does not expand the size or scope of the \nFederal Government, and it does not encroach on State authority.\n  In fact, I think we have done a pretty good job in trying to solve \nsome problems in a way that can move everyone forward.\n  At this point, I also want to thank the chairmen of the Committee on \nEducation and the Workforce and the Committee on the Judiciary and \nSmall Business Committee for their help with this particular bill, so \nespecially Chairman Kline, Chairman Goodlatte, and Chairman Chabot. I \ndo appreciate their help on this particular bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Natural Resources,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2016.\n     Hon. Steve Chabot,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On May 25, 2016, the Committee on \n     Natural Resources ordered favorably reported as amended H.R. \n     5278, the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic \n     Stability Act.

Rob Bishop,\n     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bishop: I am writing with respect to H.R. \n     5278, the ``Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic \n     Stability Act,'' which was referred to the Committee on \n     Natural Resources and in addition to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary among other committees. As a result of your having \n     consulted with us on provisions in H.R. 5278 that fall within \n     the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I \n     agree to discharge our committee from further consideration \n     of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the \n     House floor for consideration.\n       The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 5278 at \n     this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject \n     matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our \n     committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as \n     this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may \n     address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our \n     committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an \n     appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate \n     conference involving this or similar legislation and asks \n     that you support any such request.\n       I appreciate your May 31, 2016, letter confirming this \n     understanding with respect to H.R. 5278 and would ask that a \n     copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in \n     your committee report and in the Congressional Record during \n     Floor consideration of H.R. 5278.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Goodlatte,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. I yield myself the balance of my time, and thank Leader \nPelosi and my colleague, Chairman Bishop, his staff, and certainly \nstaff on our side of the aisle for their hard work.\n  It is a bill that is indeed a compromise, and we shouldn't be ashamed \nof that. It is a compromise that I wish was more tilted on our side and \nthe things that we wanted. But, Mr. Chairman, those are not the \ndynamics or the numbers in this House.\n  The reality is that the urgency of Puerto Rico, the humanitarian \ndemands and needs of the island make us look at this bill not with an \neye towards perfection, but with an eye toward what is doable and what \ncan provide some immediate relief and begin the process of stability \nfor the island and for its people, and begin the process of an economic \nrenewal for the island itself.\n  I want to also acknowledge my colleagues, Mr. Pierluisi, Ms. \nVelazquez, and Mr. Serrano. I know how difficult this vote was and how \ndifficult it is to vote on a compromise that does not fully empower and \nfully acknowledge the self-governance of the Puerto Rican people. I \nknow that. But your endorsement of this bill is very meaningful in that \nit ties us to a heritage of representation by the Puerto Rican people \nin this body and to insisting and demanding that the needs of the \npeople of Puerto Rico be recognized fully by this Congress. We \nrecognize them today, as Mr. Serrano said, but there is much, much more \nto do.\n  This vote, by the way, as I close, is not about heritage. More \nimportantly, it is not about selling out one's heritage. It is about \nfuture generations and the opportunities they will have on the island. \nIt is about stability for children, families, and the elderly with a \nfiscally stable economy and an accountable fiscal system within the \nisland.\n  While I can understand the political expediency of voting ``no,'' I \nthink the demands and the urgency to deal with this question compel \nme--and I hope all my colleagues in this body--to vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I yield 4\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Graves), another member of our committee.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I first want to thank Chairman \nBishop, Ranking Member Grijalva, Congressmen Labrador, Duffy, and \nPierluisi, and many others who worked tirelessly on this legislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, the island of Puerto Rico with a population of under 4 \nmillion people has a debt of, by some measure, $100 billion. That is a \npopulation less than the State of Louisiana, but a debt of nearly $100 \nbillion.\n  We have three options: We can do nothing and continue to allow this \nisland territory to continue spiraling downward in a financial and \nhumanitarian crisis. We can provide financial oversight. We can relieve \nregulation, help to reignite the economy, and allow for a negotiation \nbetween the creditors and the debtor. Or we can pay off their debt and \nadd to the already $19 trillion irresponsible debt of the American \nGovernment today. Those are the options that are out there.\n  I will tell you, I also struggled with what the right conservative \nsolution was in this case.\n  Ultimately, there is just one right answer. Doing nothing will simply \nworsen the financial condition, will probably put more burden on us to \nactually bail out the Nation on Congress and on the White House to do \nthat. I oppose a bailout, and I oppose putting taxpayer dollars on the \nhook to pay off nearly a dozen years of irresponsible spending of the \nPuerto Rican Government.\n  So establishing a financial oversight board similar to what was done \nin Washington, D.C. and providing conditions to negotiate a solution is \nthe right answer. It is the conservative solution.\n  During committee consideration of the bill, I included an amendment \nto ensure that Federal taxpayers are not put on the hook for this \nliability.\n  Section 210 says: ``No Federal funds shall be authorized by this act \nfor the payment of any liability of the territory or territorial \ninstrumentality.''\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, this amendment makes it clear: \nas affirmed by the Supreme Court today and mentioned by the committee \nchairman, Puerto Rico is different from a State, and the Supreme Court \naffirmed that today. It is not a State. It is a territory of the U.S., \nand we have a constitutional obligation to prevent a worsening \ndisaster.\n  This bill does not set a precedent for States and municipalities. It \nrespects the priority of debt by general obligation bondholders and \nothers. It prevents higher cost of borrowing by States and \nmunicipalities by controlling the situation. Most importantly, Mr. \nChairman, it doesn't bail out Puerto Rico. It creates a path for \nfinancial stability.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge support for H.R. 5278.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Garrett).\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, I come before the House today to support \nan important piece of legislation that will allow the people of Puerto \nRico a path towards economic stability, growth, and prosperity.\n  Beholden to out-of-control tax-and-spend policies, the Puerto Rican \npeople are experiencing the harsh realities of fiscal irresponsibility \nand unaccountable government. That is why I strongly support this bill.\n\n[[Page H3609]]\n\n  We have a moral and constitutional responsibility to address this \nfiscal crisis which will only get worse if we don't act. That is why I \nsupport this bill and what we must learn from this experience.\n  Congress and Presidents of both parties have let our national debt \nreach an unsustainable $19 trillion. That is only because the U.S. \nGovernment has something that Puerto Rico doesn't have: the ability to \nprint money and borrow endlessly. So that is why I support the fiscal \nreforms in this bill which do not spend a single dollar in U.S. \ntaxpayer money to relieve Puerto Rico of its debt.\n  I have long opposed taxpayer bailouts. Fortunately, this bill \nprevents the taxpayers from bailing out a government that spent \nrecklessly and provides a conservative solution to force Puerto Rico to \nspend now responsibly. The bill also avoids setting a horrible \nprecedent that could tempt free-spending States to walk away from their \nobligations by behaving irresponsibly.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Most importantly, the bill creates a seven-member \noversight board to oversee their debt restructuring and to conduct \nfinancial audits. What would this board do? It would require \ncommonsense actions like sustainable government programs to establish \nfiscal plans to achieve needed reform and so on. This bipartisan bill \nis the first step to return Puerto Rico to solvency and stability.\n  Americans, each and every day, balance their own checkbooks and live \nwithin their own means. Politicians and government bureaucrats should \nbehave no differently. I therefore support the underlying legislation.\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis). She is the vice-chair of the \ncommittee.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, we saw a bunch of ads on TV about this \nbill and about what it would do to the bondholders. So I did some \nresearch.\n  I rise in support of this bill as one of the more conservative \nmembers of the Republican wing of this House. The reason I support it \nis the research I did showed me that it wasn't this widow that bought \nthese bonds, it was large institutional investors. It was investors who \nknew what they were buying because they read the disclosure documents. \nIt was investors who buy billions of dollars worth of bonds, and they \nare trying to diversify those portfolios, so they have some high-risk, \nhigh-return investments and some low-risk, low-return investments. They \nhave different maturity dates. They come from different jurisdictions. \nThey are trying to have a balanced portfolio. Those portfolios were \npurchased recognizing that some of these bonds might have a higher risk \nand a higher return. That higher return comes at a discounted price. So \nthey paid a discount in hopes that they would get the higher return and \nthat these bonds would hold up.\n  Quite frankly, those bondholders knew what they were getting because \nit was even disclosed in the bond documents that Congress might be here \ntoday debating this very problem of the island's inability to repay \neverything.\n  Not all general obligation bonds are created equal. The bond \npurchasers knew what they were getting. This bill is going to allow for \nthe relative-to-each-other agreement among the bondholders about how to \ntreat the bonds.\n  Mr. Chairman, I fully support the bill.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan). He also has the title of Speaker of the \nHouse.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, it is vital that we pass this \nbill. Let me tell you why. Puerto Rico is in trouble, and we need to \nact now before that trouble threatens taxpayers.\n  Let me explain why. Puerto Rico's government owes $118 billion in \nbonds and in unfunded pension liabilities. It has already defaulted on \nmuch of it. Things are only going to get worse.\n  Now the island is shutting down. You can see it in the news--closed \nschools, and hospitals are beginning to close. That is today. Tomorrow \nit could be policemen without cars. It could be blackouts at hospitals. \nThis is a humanitarian disaster in the making. What is worse, if we do \nnothing, it could be a manmade humanitarian disaster.\n  I know this goes without saying, but it is worth repeating: the \nPuerto Rican people are our fellow Americans. They pay our taxes. They \nfight in our wars. We cannot allow this to happen.\n  I should also say that if we do nothing, the contagion will simply \nspread. About 15 percent of Puerto Rico's debt is already held by \nmiddle class Americans, and if the government can't meet its \nobligations, these families will pay the price--or even worse, \ntaxpayers could be asked to bail it out.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  That is simply unacceptable. That is why we are taking action now, to \nprevent a bailout and to help the Puerto Rican people.\n  What this bill will do is allow Puerto Rico to restructure its debts \nand set up an oversight board that will oversee this process. Congress \nand the President will appoint the members of this board. It will audit \nPuerto Rico's books and make sure the restructuring is open and fair. \nIt will also make sure the restructuring honors the agreements. It will \nmake sure the government changes its ways so we don't have to do this \nagain.\n  Let me set a few things straight. Some people say this will set a bad \nprecedent. Some people say this will encourage reckless spending by the \nStates. No, absolutely not. The bill applies only to territories and \nnot to States.\n  I also want to point one other thing out. The Puerto Rican Government \nis not getting off scot-free here. Not at all. It has not served the \nPuerto Rican people well. It has spent money recklessly for decades.\n  This legislation will make sure that the government balances its \nbudget. It will make sure that they pass reforms that will grow the \nPuerto Rican economy. It gives flexibility on the youth minimum wage so \nbusinesses will hire more young people.\n  I also hear people say that this is a bailout. That is absolutely, \ncategorically, undeniably false. This bill won't add a single dollar to \nthe deficit. All you have to do is look at the Congressional Budget \nOffice. Not a single taxpayer dollar added to the deficit.\n  This bill prevents a bailout. That is the entire point. Let me tell \nyou this: if we do not pass this bill, then there is much more likely \ngoing to be a bailout because there will be no other choice. But if we \npass this bill, Puerto Rico will get a handle on its debt. Its economy \nwill begin to grow. The people in Puerto Rico will see that help is on \nthe way and there is a reason to stay because they are finally getting \ntheir act together. Taxpayers will be safe.\n  I am telling all Members right now, the best chance to get this right \nis to pass this bill. The best chance for creditors to get what they \nare owed is this bill. This is our responsibility. The Constitution is \nreally clear. The Constitution gives Congress the duty to oversee \nlegislation for all U.S. territories. Now it is time that we do our \nconstitutional duty.\n  A lot of people have spent so much time on this legislation. Here is \nwhat we are doing. If we see a problem among our fellow citizens and it \nis in a territory where we have a constitutional responsibility, we \nhave to address this problem, and we have to address this problem in a \nsmart way so that we prevent the taxpayer from getting involved, we \nhave to address this problem in a smart way so that we prevent any \ncontagion from occurring in the bond markets, and we have to address \nthis problem in a smart way so that Puerto Rico can get back on its \nfeet again, so that the future for the people in Puerto Rico is a \nbrighter future.\n  There are so many people who have poured their hearts into this. I \nwant to thank Rob Bishop from Utah, the chairman of the committee; I \nwant to thank Sean Duffy from Wisconsin; I want to thank Raul Labrador \nfrom Idaho; I want to thank Jim Sensenbrenner from Wisconsin; I want to \nthank Pedro Pierluisi from Puerto Rico; and I want to thank the Members \nfrom the other side of the aisle who put so much time into this.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. This is the best solution in a deepening \ncrisis. This\n\n[[Page H3610]]\n\nbill has my full support. I urge all of my colleagues in the House to \ngive it their full support as well.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Six months ago, our committee began the effort to try to solve this \nproblem. We had four hearings, countless stakeholder meetings, and got \ninput from expert testimony. Interested parties from all over the place \nwere able to get their input in various drafts of this bill. It was an \nexhaustive effort, but what happened is at the end of this time we had \na good bill. That is the way this process is supposed to work.\n  It is a bill that is rooted in the Constitution, it doesn't cost the \ntaxpayers, it provides Puerto Rico with the tools to impose discipline \nover its finances, and led towards an element of prosperity.\n  In Spanish, I am told that the phrase promesa means promise. This \nbill is a promise for Puerto Rico for a better life. It is the way we \ngo forward.\n  I urge everyone's adoption of a great piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chair, today I rise in support of H.R. 5278, the \n``Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act'' \n(PROMESA)--a bipartisan bill providing short-term relief to respond to \nthe humanitarian crisis facing the people of Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. Chair, Puerto Rico's faltering economy and the well-being of its \nmore than 3.4 million people are of great concern to may colleagues and \nme. The island's $70 billion debt has made it extremely difficult for \nthe Commonwealth to provide adequate health care, education and public \nsafety for the people of Puerto Rico.\n  As a result, its people are struggling to access basic public \nservices--as schools and hospitals face daily electricity and water \nshortages. I am deeply concerned that the island's health care systems \nhave been adversely affected by Puerto Rico's debt crisis, making it \nincreasingly difficult to handle a Zika outbreak or other health \ncrises.\n  As a senior member of the Financial Services Committee, I support \ngiving Puerto Rico all the tools necessary to restore its access to \ncredit markets and restructuring its outstanding debt. These critically \nimportant measures will help restore its financial footing.\n  I do not support certain provisions in the bill, including sections \nundermining a minimum wage and protections for pension benefits. \nHowever, it is my hope that this bill on balance will help Puerto Rico \nstave off catastrophe by restoring basic services, with the hope of \nputting Puerto Rico back on the path toward improving the quality of \nlife of its people.\n  In closing, Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to support H.R. 5278. This bill is not perfect, but it takes a \nstep in the right direction.\n  Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Chair, I am disappointed that two amendments I \noffered yesterday at the Rules Committee were not made in order for \ndebate on H.R. 5278, the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and \nEconomic Stability Act (PROMESA). These amendments, along with \namendments offered by Rep. Kilili Sablan of the Northern Mariana \nIslands on the Earned Income Tax Credit and Rep. Amata Radewagen of \nAmerican Samoa on the Child Tax Credit, would have addressed underlying \nissues that are experienced in all the territories and that contributed \nto Puerto Rico's debt crisis. We had a chance to address legacy policy \nissues that unduly put a significant financial strain on our local \ntreasuries, yet we were denied an opportunity to more fully debate \nthese issues and be afforded an up or down vote.\n  My first amendment would have granted the government of Guam \nflexibility to extend Social Security to all new government hires. The \nGovernment of Guam's (GovGuam) current retirement plan will leave many \nwithout sufficient means when they retire. As you know, the pension \nshortfall in Puerto Rico was a key contributor to its current fiscal \ncrisis and local leaders in Guam are working proactively to enact \nlegislation to prevent a similar situation in Guam. Part of their \nefforts is contingent on enrolling employees in Social Security, and my \namendment would give GovGuam flexibility to enroll new hires in Social \nSecurity as it works to address retirement shortfalls for its current \nworkforce. The Social Security Actuaries and the CBO have indicated \nthat the amendment would have a net positive increase on federal \nrevenues. I offered a practical, common sense solution that is \nsupported by many on Guam. It was a proactive attempt to provide \nGovGuam with the tools it needs to address this systemic issue.\n  My second amendment would have granted equitable treatment to the \nU.S. territories in carrying out the Medicaid program. The amendment \nwould have eliminated the Medicaid caps on the territories and provide \nparity with the federal medical assistance percentage in force in the \nterritories. The inequitable treatment of the territories in Medicaid \nhas caused significant financial strain on our local governments and \nhas forced us to contribute a disproportionate share of local dollars \nwhen compared to the 50 states and DC. This was a bipartisan amendment \nsupported by all representatives of the territories, and it would have \nput our constituents, who are all Americans, on equal footing with \nthose who reside in the States. The cost of providing health care in \nour jurisdictions, particularly on Guam, inhibits our economies from \ntruly developing. Further, this amendment was modeled off a request \ncontained in President Obama's Fiscal Year 2017 budget request which \nwould have eliminated the caps and put the territories on a path to \nimproving their FMAP. This budget proposal is a critical component of \nsolving the crisis we see in Puerto Rico yet we have been denied a \nchance to address this matter on the floor. We have an opportunity to \naddress this inequity, and I feel it is critical that we act with \npurpose on this matter.\n  I also want to underscore my disappointment that amendments submitted \nby my colleagues, Mr. Sablan and Ms. Radewagen were also not made in \norder. We firmly believe that Puerto Rico's debt crisis cannot be \nresolved through debt restructuring alone. This debt crisis was caused \nby underlying issues which have been impacted by the unequal treatment \nof the territories in certain federal programs. Again, like with \nMedicaid, addressing these issues for Puerto Rico and the other \nterritories would help lift a burden and allow our local governments to \nfocus more on economic development and improving infrastructure to \nsupport those new economies.\n  Together our amendments addressed disparities in Medicaid and the \napplication of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, \nand would have fixed critical issues that contributed to Puerto Rico's \ndebt crisis. We offered these amendments because while Guam's and the \nother territories' fiscal situations are nowhere near the crisis in \nPuerto Rico, we had an opportunity to be proactive and eliminate \nfederal policies and programs that are not treating the territories \nwith equity. Put more simply, we could have been proactive in \naddressing federal law to ensure our other territories are put in a \nbetter shape financially.\n  We simply do not believe that extending the authorities proposed in \nPROMESA without addressing continued systemic challenges will resolve \nPuerto Rico's problems, nor will it provide a more secure financial \nfooting in all the territories. I recognize the political challenges \nthat have been undertaken to get this bill to the point that we are at \nright now. However, we need to find the political will to address the \nsystemic challenges now, before they become crises later. We are doing \nall we can to be proactive so that what is happening to Puerto Rico \ndoes not happen to the rest of us. I hope this Congress will address \nthese issues so that we can bring parity to the millions of Americans \nliving in the territories and enable the territories' local governments \nto focus on programs that will enhance their economies.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chair, House Resolution 5278 creates a board \nof managers to address the fiscal condition of Puerto Rico.\n  However, Puerto Rican officials still have not been held accountable \nor accepted responsibility for their policies that caused the financial \ncrisis. In fact, just the opposite: the Puerto Rican government ignored \nits fiscal obligations when it recently voted to approve a moratorium \non repaying any of its debt.\n  But it is Puerto Rico and not Congress who should take the first \nsteps to adopt reform measures.\n  There is no certainty that a financial oversight board would \nimplement any economic growth measures to improve the Island's fiscal \ncondition.\n  The board has no mandate from Congress to address the bloated \ngovernment workforce, high taxes, an insolvent pension system, \nlimitations on trade under the Jones Act, and excessive welfare \nbenefits, all of which helped cause the fiscal crisis.\n  This legislation rewards bad behavior and represents a missed \nopportunity for Congress to insist on fiscally responsible reforms.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I rise today because Puerto Rico is \nconfronting a catastrophe. The spiral of recession, emigration, debt, \nand austerity has left the island in dire straits. Puerto Rico faces \nimmediate default on a large portion of its debt and the island might \nhave to halt emergency services if it cannot obtain further credit.\n  This crisis has been developing for a long time, but the problem has \ngrown increasingly unworkable over the past year while this Congress \nhas done nothing. The potential humanitarian consequences of continuing \nto do nothing have convinced me that despite my grave concerns about \nwhat I consider a mere half-measure, I must support PROMESA, the Puerto \nRico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (H.R. 5278).\n\n[[Page H3611]]\n\n  Puerto Rico's problems go beyond short-term debt service. Federal \nchanges to their unique tax structure have helped push the territory \ninto recession for a decade, which in turn has driven massive \nemigration elsewhere, which harms their ability to attract investment \nand fair financing, which has only further imperiled the Island's \nfiscal situation. It is the very definition of an austerity driven \ndestructive cycle.\n  Correcting its course is no easy task, but Puerto Rico can succeed if \nthey receive two necessary things: time and support.\n  First, an immediate stay on debt collection and payments that would \nallow time to develop a negotiated resolution, or absent that a \nbankruptcy process that treats creditors equitably. All creditors \nshould expect to shoulder some of the pain, but nobody should take \nunfair losses--least of all the pensioners who can least afford an \nunequal burden.\n  Second, an economic development plan that reflects Puerto Rico's \nunique challenges, like emigration to the mainland, which hinder the \nisland's ability to rebuild its tax base and attract new investment. \nAlternative energy programs and tax incentives should be supported to \nencourage a more self-sufficient economy. Public health efforts should \nbe directed to the island in order to evaluate growing problems that \ndisproportionately affect Puerto Rico, such as Zika.\n  PROMESA, while well intentioned, simply may not fully address the \nmagnitude of Puerto Rico's problems. Without an adequate commitment to \nimproving economic stability on the island, talented residents will \ncontinue emigrating elsewhere, industry will further wither because of \nsubstandard public services, and local fiscal problems will likely \nescalate. Further, the ridiculous riders that potentially undercut wage \nand overtime protections--as well as environmental regulations--\nrepresent a cynical effort to take advantage of the Island's desperate \nsituation. It is a shameful reminder that many in this body see Puerto \nRico as a colony unworthy of the privileges we enjoy on the mainland.\n  I am voting for PROMESA despite my serious concerns because I hope \nagainst hope that it will be improved in the Senate. A real recovery \nstrategy--one that gives residents, workers, and pensioners a viable \nfuture--is what Puerto Rico needs and deserves.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I stand before you today to discuss H.R. \n5278--Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act \n(PROMESA).\n  Our consideration of PROMESA must be a very thoughtful analysis of an \noutcome where the people of Puerto Rico will be empowered and be on a \npath towards progress where working families, their children and \npensioners can be on a pathway towards a better future.\n  PROEMSA is a bipartisan measure and effort to assist the Commonwealth \nof Puerto Rico in restructuring $70 billion in currently unpayable \ndebt, an amount that exceeds the size of its entire economy.\n  There are a total of 3.548 million people living on the island of \nPuerto Rico.\n  Since 2006, Puerto Rico's economy has shrunk by more than 10 percent \nand shed more than 250,000 jobs.\n  More than 45 percent of the Commonwealth's residents live in \npoverty--the highest poverty rate of any state or territory.\n  Furthermore, its 11.6 percent unemployment rate is more than twice \nthe national level.\n  The challenges facing the people of Puerto Rico have ignited the \nlargest wave of outmigration since the 1950's, and the pace continues \nto accelerate.\n  More than 300,000 people have left Puerto Rico in the past decade \nwith a record of 84,000 people leaving in 2014.\n  Puerto Ricans suffer from high rates of forced migration due to the \nbetter opportunities offered in the United States compared to in the \ncommonwealth.\n  The gap between emigrants and immigrants has been continuously \nwidening.\n  Indeed, this increase in emigrants caused a population decline, the \nfirst in its history, and the stateside Puerto Rican population grew \nquickly.\n  The median age of male Puerto Ricans is of working age from the ages \nof 25-49 and similarly for women from the ages of 25-59.\n  Most of the homes are family-led.\n  There are about 1,133,600 people in the civilian labor force but only \n43 percent of them are employed.\n  In addition, most of those working work in minimum wage jobs.\n  Over 27 percent of the people in the Commonwealth are on welfare.\n  The median income in Puerto Rico is only half that of the poorest \nU.S. state, Mississippi, but welfare benefits are about the same in \nPuerto Rico as in Mississippi.\n  Swift action is needed in order to alleviate the pain and suffering \nof the people of Puerto Rico.\n  There is no time to waste.\n  H.R. 5278 appears to be an emergency default for Puerto Rico, an \nAmerican territory where 3.5 million American citizens reside and \ncontinue to live in fear for their finances, their families and their \nfuture.\n  On July 1, Puerto Rico will face nearly $2 billion worth of bond \npayments.\n  Already, businesses have closed, public worker benefits are in \njeopardy, hospital care is restricted and basic governmental functions \nare at risk.\n  Should the Puerto Rican government default in early July, it faces \ncertain litigation by its creditors, further erosion of its economy, \nand an inability to provide basic services to its people.\n  This measure creates a process for the Commonwealth to restructure \ntheir bond debts, avoiding a default that could lead to a humanitarian \ncatastrophe and instead allowing Puerto Rico to return to economic \ngrowth and fiscal balance.\n  It would allow for the creation of a seven-member Financial Oversight \nand Management board which will approve annual budgets and fiscal \nplans.\n  This fiscal plan must be designed in a way that provides adequate \nfunding for pension obligations.\n  Also, I have serious concerns about the minimum wage provision of the \nmeasure.\n  Specifically, regarding minimum wage and overtime, H.R. 5278 would \nextend the application of the existing federal subminimum wage of $4.25 \nan hour to those under the age of 25 in Puerto Rico for as long as four \nyears, while all other federal jurisdictions pay the subminimum wage to \nthose under the age of 20 for only up to the first ninety days of \nemployment.\n  We need to continue to work on ways to improve this measure to \nascertain that American citizens in Puerto Rico are not languishing in \npoverty.\n  Indeed, the measure contains a provision that provides for a delay on \nthe new Department of Labor overtime pay regulation until a Government \nAccountability Office (GAO) study is completed and the Department of \nLabor determines whether the rule could negatively impact the economy \nof Puerto Rico.\n  Additionally, the measure would create a ``Revitalization \nCoordinator'' that works closely with the Oversight Board to determine \nwhich energy and other infrastructure projects will be able to bypass \nlocal environmental, public health, and consumer protection laws.\n  Let me underscore again that I have serious concerns about the \nprovisions in this measure, not the least of which is the expansion of \nthe subminimum wage, the exemption from the new overtime Rule, and the \nexclusion of protections for pension benefits.\n  I commend my Democratic colleagues in their efforts of protecting the \nenvironment and wildlife refuge in the Commonwealth.\n  I look forward to working with my Democratic colleagues and our \nRepublican colleagues across the aisle in continuing to improve the \nprovisions of the measure for the betterment of fellow American \ncitizens in Puerto Rico.\n  Let me conclude by highlighting that H.R. 5278 is not perfect but so \nlong as we continue to work on a bipartisan basis in good faith, we can \nwork towards our efforts of ensuring that Puerto Rico does not become a \nhumanitarian crisis.\n  We must continue to work together to be our brother's and sister's \nkeepers.\n  It is essential that we stand with the people of Puerto Rico and take \naction.\n  It is essential that we continue to work towards an orderly process \nthat promotes the livelihood of U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico and \nalleviates the crisis.\n

and\n       (B) if the additional information provided under \n     subparagraph (A) does not provide an explanation for the \n     inconsistency that the Oversight Board finds reasonable and \n     appropriate, advise the territorial government to correct the \n     inconsistency by implementing remedial action.\n       (2) Deadlines.--The Oversight Board shall establish the \n     deadlines by which the territorial government shall meet the \n     requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1).\n       (c) Certification.--\n       (1) Inconsistency.--If the territorial government fails to \n     provide additional information under subsection (b)(1)(A), or \n     fails to correct an inconsistency under subsection (b)(1)(B), \n     prior to the applicable deadline under subsection (b)(2), the \n     Oversight Board shall certify to the President, the House of \n     Representatives Committee on Natural Resources, the Senate \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the Governor, and \n     the Legislature that the territorial government is \n     inconsistent with the applicable certified Budget, and shall \n     describe the nature and amount of the inconsistency.\n       (2) Correction.--If the Oversight Board determines that the \n     territorial government has initiated such measures as the \n     Oversight Board considers sufficient to correct an \n     inconsistency certified under paragraph (1), the Oversight \n     Board shall certify the correction to the President, the \n     House of Representatives Committee on Natural Resources, the \n     Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the \n     Governor, and the Legislature.\n       (d) Budget Reductions by Oversight Board.--If the Oversight \n     Board determines that the Governor, in the case of any then-\n     applicable certified Instrumentality Budgets, and the \n     Governor and the Legislature, in the case of the then-\n     applicable certified Territory Budget, have failed to correct \n     an inconsistency identified by the Oversight Board under \n     subsection (c), the Oversight Board shall--\n       (1) with respect to the territorial government, other than \n     covered territorial instrumentalities, make appropriate \n     reductions in nondebt expenditures to ensure that the actual \n     quarterly revenues and expenditures for the territorial \n     government are in compliance with the applicable certified \n     Territory Budget or, in the case of the fiscal year in which \n     the Oversight Board is established, the budget adopted by the \n     Governor and the Legislature; and\n       (2) with respect to covered territorial instrumentalities \n     at the sole discretion of the Oversight Board--\n       (A) make reductions in nondebt expenditures to ensure that \n     the actual quarterly revenues and expenses for the covered \n     territorial instrumentality are in compliance with the \n     applicable certified Budget or, in the case of the fiscal \n     year in which the Oversight Board is established, the budget \n     adopted by the Governor and the Legislature or the covered \n     territorial instrumentality, as applicable; or\n       (B)(i) institute automatic hiring freezes at the covered \n     territorial instrumentality; and\n       (ii) prohibit the covered territorial instrumentality from \n     entering into any contract or engaging in any financial or \n     other transactions, unless the contract or transaction was \n     previously approved by the Oversight Board.\n       (e) Termination of Budget Reductions.--The Oversight Board \n     shall cancel the reductions, hiring freezes, or prohibition \n     on contracts and financial transactions under subsection (d) \n     if the Oversight Board determines that the territorial \n     government or covered territorial instrumentality, as \n     applicable, has initiated appropriate measures to reduce \n     expenditures or increase revenues to ensure that the \n     territorial government or covered territorial instrumentality \n     is in compliance with the applicable certified Budget or, in \n     the case of the fiscal year in which the Oversight Board is \n     established, the budget adopted by the Governor and the \n     Legislature.\n\n     SEC. 204. REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH \n                   FISCAL PLAN.\n\n       (a) Submission of Legislative Acts to Oversight Board.--\n       (1) Submission of acts.--Except to the extent that the \n     Oversight Board may provide otherwise in its bylaws, rules, \n     and procedures, not later than 7 business days after a \n     territorial government duly enacts any law during any fiscal \n     year in which the Oversight Board is in operation, the \n     Governor shall submit the law to the Oversight Board.\n       (2) Cost estimate; certification of compliance or \n     noncompliance.--The Governor shall include with each law \n     submitted to the Oversight Board under paragraph (1) the \n     following:\n       (A) A formal estimate prepared by an appropriate entity of \n     the territorial government with expertise in budgets and \n     financial management of the impact, if any, that the law will \n     have on expenditures and revenues.\n       (B) If the appropriate entity described in subparagraph (A) \n     finds that the law is not significantly inconsistent with the \n     Fiscal Plan for the fiscal year, it shall issue a \n     certification of such finding.\n       (C) If the appropriate entity described in subparagraph (A) \n     finds that the law is significantly inconsistent with the \n     Fiscal Plan for the fiscal year, it shall issue a \n     certification of such finding, together with the entity's \n     reasons for such finding.\n       (3) Notification.--The Oversight Board shall send a \n     notification to the Governor and the Legislature if--\n       (A) the Governor submits a law to the Oversight Board under \n     this subsection that is not accompanied by the estimate \n     required under paragraph (2)(A);\n       (B) the Governor submits a law to the Oversight Board under \n     this subsection that is not accompanied by either a \n     certification described in paragraph (2)(B) or (2)(C); or\n       (C) the Governor submits a law to the Oversight Board under \n     this subsection that is accompanied by a certification \n     described in paragraph (2)(C) that the law is significantly \n     inconsistent with the Fiscal Plan.\n       (4) Opportunity to respond to notification.--\n       (A) Failure to provide estimate or certification.--After \n     sending a notification to the Governor and the Legislature \n     under paragraph (3)(A) or (3)(B) with respect to a law, the \n     Oversight Board may direct the Governor to provide the \n     missing estimate or certification (as the case may be), in \n     accordance with such procedures as the Oversight Board may \n     establish.\n       (B) Submission of certification of significant \n     inconsistency with fiscal plan and budget.--In accordance \n     with such procedures as the Oversight Board may establish, \n     after sending a notification to the Governor and Legislature \n     under paragraph (3)(C) that a law is significantly \n     inconsistent with the Fiscal Plan, the Oversight Board shall \n     direct the territorial government to--\n       (i) correct the law to eliminate the inconsistency; or\n       (ii) provide an explanation for the inconsistency that the \n     Oversight Board finds reasonable and appropriate.\n       (5) Failure to comply.--If the territorial government fails \n     to comply with a direction given by the Oversight Board under \n     paragraph (4) with respect to a law, the Oversight Board may \n     take such actions as it considers necessary, consistent with \n     this Act, to ensure that the enactment or enforcement of the \n     law will not adversely affect the territorial government's \n     compliance with the Fiscal Plan, including preventing the \n     enforcement or application of the law.\n       (6) Preliminary review of proposed acts.--At the request of \n     the Legislature, the Oversight Board may conduct a \n     preliminary review of proposed legislation before the \n     Legislature to determine whether the legislation as proposed \n     would be consistent with the applicable Fiscal Plan under \n     this subtitle, except that any such preliminary review shall \n     not be binding on the Oversight Board in reviewing any law \n     subsequently submitted under this subsection.\n       (b) Effect of Approved Fiscal Plan on Contracts, Rules, and \n     Regulations.--\n       (1) Transparency in contracting.--The Oversight Board shall \n     work with a covered territory's office of the comptroller or \n     any functionally equivalent entity to promote compliance with \n     the applicable law of any covered territory that requires \n     agencies and instrumentalities of the territorial government \n     to maintain a registry of all contracts executed, including \n     amendments thereto, and to remit a copy to the office of the \n     comptroller for inclusion in a comprehensive database \n     available to the public. With respect to Puerto Rico, the \n     term ``applicable law'' refers to 2 L.P.R.A. 97, as amended.\n       (2) Authority to review certain contracts.--The Oversight \n     Board may establish policies to require prior Oversight Board \n     approval of certain contracts, including leases and contracts \n     to a governmental entity or government-owned corporations \n     rather than private enterprises that are proposed to be \n     executed by the territorial government, to ensure such \n     proposed contracts promote market competition and are not \n     inconsistent with the approved Fiscal Plan.\n       (3) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     any policies established by the Oversight Board pursuant to \n     paragraph (2) should be designed to make the government \n     contracting process more effective, to increase the public's \n     faith in this process, to make appropriate use of the \n     Oversight Board's time and resources, to make the territorial \n     government a facilitator and not a competitor to private \n     enterprise, and to avoid creating any additional bureaucratic \n     obstacles to efficient contracting.\n       (4) Authority to review certain rules, regulations, and \n     executive orders.--The provisions of this paragraph shall \n     apply with respect to a rule, regulation, or executive order \n     proposed to be issued by the Governor (or the head of any \n     department or agency of the territorial government) in the \n     same manner as such provisions apply to a contract.\n       (5) Failure to comply.--If a contract, rule, regulation, or \n     executive order fails to comply with policies established by \n     the Oversight Board under this subsection, the Oversight \n     Board may take such actions as it considers necessary to \n     ensure that such contract, rule, executive order or \n     regulation will not adversely affect the territorial \n     government's compliance with the Fiscal Plan, including by \n     preventing the execution or enforcement of the contract, \n     rule, executive order or regulation.\n\n[[Page H3618]]\n\n       (c) Restrictions on Budgetary Adjustments.--\n       (1) Submissions of requests to oversight board.--If the \n     Governor submits a request to the Legislature for the \n     reprogramming of any amounts provided in a certified Budget, \n     the Governor shall submit such request to the Oversight \n     Board, which shall analyze whether the proposed reprogramming \n     is significantly inconsistent with the Budget, and submit its \n     analysis to the Legislature as soon as practicable after \n     receiving the request.\n       (2) No action permitted until analysis received.--The \n     Legislature shall not adopt a reprogramming, and no officer \n     or employee of the territorial government may carry out any \n     reprogramming, until the Oversight Board has provided the \n     Legislature with an analysis that certifies such \n     reprogramming will not be inconsistent with the Fiscal Plan \n     and Budget.\n       (3) Prohibition on action until oversight board is \n     appointed.--During the period after a territory becomes a \n     covered territory and prior to the appointment of all members \n     and the Chair of the Oversight Board, such covered territory \n     shall not enact new laws that either permit the transfer of \n     any funds or assets outside the ordinary course of business \n     or that are inconsistent with the constitution or laws of the \n     territory as of the date of enactment of this Act, provided \n     that any executive or legislative action authorizing the \n     movement of funds or assets during this time period may be \n     subject to review and reversal by the Oversight Board upon \n     appointment of the Oversight Board's full membership.\n       (d) Implementation of Federal Programs.--In taking actions \n     under this Act, the Oversight Board shall not exercise \n     applicable authorities to impede territorial actions taken \n     to--\n       (1) comply with a court-issued consent decree or \n     injunction, or an administrative order or settlement with a \n     Federal agency, with respect to Federal programs;\n       (2) implement a federally authorized or federally delegated \n     program; or\n       (3) implement territorial laws, which are consistent with a \n     certified Fiscal Plan, that execute Federal requirements and \n     standards.\n\n     SEC. 205.

This section does not impair or affect the \n     implementation of any restructuring support agreement \n     executed by the Government of Puerto Rico to be implemented \n     pursuant to Puerto Rico law specifically enacted for that \n     purpose prior to the enactment of this Act or the obligation \n     of the Government of Puerto Rico to proceed in good faith as \n     set forth in any such agreement.\n       (l) Payments on Liabilities.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be construed to prohibit the Government of Puerto Rico from \n     making any payment on any Liability when such payment becomes \n     due during the term of the stay, and to the extent the \n     Oversight Board, in its sole discretion, determines it is \n     feasible, the Government of Puerto Rico shall make interest \n     payments on outstanding indebtedness when such payments \n     become due during the length of the stay.\n       (m) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A combination of severe economic decline, and, at \n     times, accumulated operating deficits, lack of financial \n     transparency, management inefficiencies, and excessive \n     borrowing has created a fiscal emergency in Puerto Rico.\n       (2) As a result of its fiscal emergency, the Government of \n     Puerto Rico has been unable to provide its citizens with \n     effective services.\n       (3) The current fiscal emergency has also affected the \n     long-term economic stability of Puerto Rico by contributing \n     to the accelerated outmigration of residents and businesses.\n       (4) A comprehensive approach to fiscal, management, and \n     structural problems and adjustments that exempts no part of \n     the Government of Puerto Rico is necessary, involving \n     independent oversight and a Federal statutory authority for \n     the Government of Puerto Rico to restructure debts in a fair \n     and orderly process.\n       (5) Additionally, an immediate--but temporary--stay is \n     essential to stabilize the region for the purposes of \n     resolving this territorial crisis.\n       (A) The stay advances the best interests common to all \n     stakeholders, including but not limited to a functioning \n     independent Oversight Board created pursuant to this Act to \n     determine whether to appear or intervene on behalf of the \n     Government of Puerto Rico in any litigation that may have \n     been commenced prior to the effectiveness or upon expiration \n     of the stay.\n       (B) The stay is limited in nature and narrowly tailored to \n     achieve the purposes of this Act, including to ensure all \n     creditors have a fair opportunity to consensually renegotiate \n     terms of repayment based on accurate financial information \n     that is reviewed by an independent authority or, at a \n     minimum, receive a recovery from the Government of Puerto \n     Rico equal to their best\n\n[[Page H3623]]\n\n     possible outcome absent the provisions of this Act.\n       (6) Finally, the ability of the Government of Puerto Rico \n     to obtain funds from capital markets in the future will be \n     severely diminished without congressional action to restore \n     its financial accountability and stability.\n       (n) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to--\n       (1) provide the Government of Puerto Rico with the \n     resources and the tools it needs to address an immediate \n     existing and imminent crisis;\n       (2) allow the Government of Puerto Rico a limited period of \n     time during which it can focus its resources on negotiating a \n     voluntary resolution with its creditors instead of defending \n     numerous, costly creditor lawsuits;\n       (3) provide an oversight mechanism to assist the Government \n     of Puerto Rico in reforming its fiscal governance and support \n     the implementation of potential debt restructuring;\n       (4) make available a Federal restructuring authority, if \n     necessary, to allow for an orderly adjustment of all of the \n     Government of Puerto Rico's liabilities; and\n       (5) benefit the lives of 3.5 million American citizens \n     living in Puerto Rico by encouraging the Government of Puerto \n     Rico to resolve its longstanding fiscal governance issues and \n     return to economic growth.\n       (o) Voting on Voluntary Agreements Not Stayed.--\n     Notwithstanding any provision in this section to the \n     contrary, nothing in this section shall prevent the holder of \n     a Liability Claim from voting on or consenting to a proposed \n     modification of such Liability Claim under title VI of this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 406. PURCHASES BY TERRITORY GOVERNMENTS.\n\n       The text of section 302 of the Omnibus Insular Areas Act of \n     1992 (48 U.S.C. 1469e), is amended to read as follows: ``The \n     Governments of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, \n     American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands, and the United States Virgin Islands are authorized \n     to make purchases through the General Services \n     Administration.''.\n\n     SEC. 407. PROTECTION FROM INTER-DEBTOR TRANSFERS.\n\n       (a) Protection of Creditors.--While an Oversight Board for \n     Puerto Rico is in existence, if any property of any \n     territorial instrumentality of Puerto Rico is transferred in \n     violation of applicable law under which any creditor has a \n     valid pledge of, security interest in, or lien on such \n     property, or which deprives any such territorial \n     instrumentality of property in violation of applicable law \n     assuring the transfer of such property to such territorial \n     instrumentality for the benefit of its creditors, then the \n     transferee shall be liable for the value of such property.\n       (b) Enforceability.--A creditor may enforce rights under \n     this section by bringing an action in the United States \n     District Court for the District of Puerto Rico after the \n     expiration or lifting of the stay of section 405, unless a \n     stay under title III is in effect.\n\n     SEC. 408.

All property \n     of an Issuer for which an order has been entered under \n     paragraph (1)(D) shall vest in the Issuer free and clear of \n     all claims in respect of any Bonds of any other Issuer. Such \n     Qualifying Modification will be full, final, complete, \n     binding, and conclusive as to the territorial government \n     Issuer, other territorial instrumentalities of the \n     territorial government Issuer, and any creditors of such \n     entities, and should not be subject to any collateral attack \n     or other challenge by any such entities in any court or other \n     forum.

APPLICABLE LAW.\n\n       In any judicial proceeding regarding this title, Federal, \n     State, or territorial laws of the United States, as \n     applicable, shall govern and be applied without regard or \n     reference to any law of any international or foreign \n     jurisdiction.\n\n  TITLE VII--SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PERMANENT, PRO-GROWTH FISCAL \n                                REFORMS\n\n     SEC. 701.

Mr. Chairman, this is the proverbial manager's \namendment. It does have four significant elements that I think people \nought to be aware of in this particular amendment.\n  Thanks to a lot of work from Mr. MacArthur and some others, we have \nan opt-in provision in this piece of legislation for the other \nterritories. However, if a court finding removes the opt-in provision \nand finds it to be unconstitutional, it then does have a reverse \nseverability clause that would reinstate the opt-in for other \nterritories so there would not be a constitutional issue.\n  We do have a funding mechanism in this bill to make sure that the \noversight board is up and running properly as we begin. It also has the \nability for the oversight board to give them the authority to review \nand rescind any laws passed by the territory between May 4 and the date \nof its full appointment of membership if those actions alter the \npriorities of repayment and move things around in a controversial way.\n  Finally, and probably most important, the amendment also includes a \nmoving up of the timetable for appointment to the board. This simply \nsays the President will have the appointment of the board up and \nrunning by September 15 of this year, and no later than that.\n  This, I think, has some other technical amendments that truly are \ntechnical, but those are four substantive amendments in the manager's \namendment that help make this what we intend it to be and get us up and \nrunning very quickly.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Graves of Missouri\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in House Report 114-610.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 61, line 4, strike ``or''.\n       Page 61, line 7, strike the period and insert ``; or''.\n       Page 61, after line 7, insert:\n       (4) preserve and maintain federally funded mass \n     transportation assets.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 770, the gentleman \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Graves) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my \namendment which ensures federally funded public transportation systems \nare considered an essential service as Puerto Rico works to address its \ndebt crisis.\n  Mr. Chairman, public transportation services in Puerto Rico are \nprovided by a fully automated rapid rail line known as Tren Urbano. The \nsystem serves 8.5 million customers each year, providing access to \nthree universities, the main medical center in Puerto Rico, and major \nfinancial centers in its capital.\n  Construction of Tren Urbano was funded by the United States \nGovernment through a Federal Transit Administration grant. In fact, of \nthe total $2.2 billion price tag, over $800 million came from Federal \ngrants, and another $300 million came from a TIFIA loan. These are \ntaxpayer investments we cannot let go to waste, and this amendment is \nsimply a fiscally responsible way to make sure that that doesn't \nhappen.\n  Failure to maintain Puerto Rico's mass transit system would cause \nTren Urbano to fall into disrepair. We have seen just how disruptive \nthose problems can be right here in our Nation's Capital. As the \nchairman of the House Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, I recently \nheld a hearing on the safety and reliability of the Metro system here \nin D.C. Repairs to the Metro have added to congestion problems in this \ncity, and it has caused an untold amount in lost worker productivity. \nWe do not want to see the same problems in Puerto Rico. We want to make \nsure that that doesn't happen. We don't want to see those same \nproblems, especially given the economic situation they are facing.\n  Over the last several years, the Government of Puerto Rico has \nstruggled to pay for Tren Urbano's operations. At times, outstanding \ndebt for operations has exceeded $20 million. Nevertheless, with the \naid of FTA preventive maintenance grants, revenues from passenger \nfares, and funds from the Puerto Rican Highway and Transportation \nAuthority, Tren Urbano has been able to continue serving the residents \nof Puerto Rico. It is critical we ensure Tren Urbano is treated as an \nessential service so that we can protect the hundreds of millions of \ntaxpayer dollars that are already invested in the system.\n  Mr. Chairman, this doesn't prioritize anything. It doesn't put \nanything at the top of the list. It just simply says that it is going \nto be a part of this process, so we do not lose that investment.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n\n[[Page H3629]]\n\n  I want to step up and basically add my name to this and my support \nand say it is a good amendment. It should pass.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. I yield to the gentleman from Utah.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I also want to support this \namendment. Everything is fine with me too.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Missouri (Mr. Graves).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Jolly\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in House Report 114-610.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 114, line 11, insert ``, reduce child poverty,'' \n     before ``and attract''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 770, the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Jolly) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Chairman, section 409 of this very important \nlegislation creates a congressional task force on economic growth in \nPuerto Rico. The intent of the task force is to study barriers to \neconomic growth, report back to Congress on changes in Federal law that \nwould spur long-term, sustainable economic growth, job creation, and \nalso attract investment in Puerto Rico. However, in my opinion, the \nsection could be improved by also studying the impact and recommended \nchanges on child poverty on the island of Puerto Rico.\n  Nearly 60 percent of children under 18 live below the poverty level \nin Puerto Rico, and roughly 80 percent live in high poverty areas. That \nis in comparison to only 11 percent who live in high poverty areas here \nin the continental United States.\n  This very simple amendment would add to the requirements of the \ncongressional task force that they report back on recommended changes \nto address and reduce child poverty in the territory.\n  This amendment has been endorsed by an organization of roughly 600 \nnational and local religious bodies, including the U.S. Conference of \nCatholic Bishops, the United Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church \nU.S.A., Catholic Charities, the Union for Reform Judaism.\n  Additionally, on Tuesday of this week, San Juan Archbishop Roberto \nGonzalez Nieves called on Congress to specifically address child \npoverty in this bill.\n  Much of the debate has centered around balancing the interests and \nneeds of bondholders and lenders with those of pensioners. I would ask \nthat this body also consider the impact on the least among us. We are \nall called to serve each other.\n  This is an opportunity for this body to reflect not just the vision \nof our Founders, but the calling of our Creator in doing so. These \nchildren are American citizens. Their plight deserves our explicit \nattention.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time \nin opposition to this amendment, although I am not opposed to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Arizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPuerto Rico (Mr. Pierluisi), the commissioner from Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. PIERLUISI. Mr. Chairman, I thank Congressman Grijalva.\n  I rise to support this thoughtful amendment and to thank its authors, \nCongressman Jolly and Congressman Curbelo, both from Florida.\n  Florida is home to over 1 million individuals of Puerto Rican birth \nor descent, and will soon pass New York as the State with the largest \nPuerto Rican population. Many of the Puerto Rican families in Florida \nare recent arrivals, having relocated from Puerto Rico to the Sunshine \nState in search of the equality and economic opportunity that they lack \non the island.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  I also want to thank the organization Jubilee USA, which has been a \nconstructive player in the debate over PROMESA.\n  This amendment requires the Congressional Task Force on Economic \nGrowth in Puerto Rico, created by section 409 of the bill, to report on \nrecommended changes to Federal policy that would reduce child poverty \nin Puerto Rico.\n  I do not want to prejudge the work of the task force, so I will \nsimply say this: poverty in Puerto Rico, including child poverty, is \nfar higher than in any State in the Nation, and it has been far higher \nfor as long as statistics have been available. This demonstrates that \nthe problem is structural in nature. It is rooted in the unequal \ntreatment that Puerto Rico receives under key Federal antipoverty \nprograms, which is only permissible because Puerto Rico is a territory \nrather than a State. To reduce poverty, we must end unequal treatment, \nand to end unequal treatment, Puerto Rico must discard its territory \nstatus in favor of statehood or nationhood.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Serrano).\n  Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I was not planning to speak, but when I heard \nBishop Gonzalez' name mentioned, I had to say something because he was \nmy parish priest at two different parishes in the Bronx. I know of his \nwork, and if he wants this discussed, then it is something I should \nrise to and support. He always cared about child poverty in the Bronx \nwhen he was my parish priest. Now, as I tell him he is a big shot in \nPuerto Rico, he is still doing the right thing by God's work.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, in closing, let me thank and commend the \ngentleman from Florida for this very good amendment. I think it \ndovetails with the rest of the legislation very well as the gentleman \naddresses some of the indices in Puerto Rico that require attention--\nthe challenges around poverty that the Puerto Rican people are facing. \nIt is not often in this Chamber that we talk about poverty. The \ngentleman is to be commended, and I support the amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Chair, in closing, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis very important amendment.\n  Do the right thing for the very least among us--those children on the \nisland who are facing significant challenges of poverty--so that we, as \na body, might respond better to the right policies that address their \nvery real needs. I urge the passage of this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Jolly).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Byrne\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 770, the gentleman \nfrom Alabama (Mr. Byrne) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Bishop for his leadership on \nthis issue. This has not been an easy task, but he has provided great \nleadership, and I appreciate it.\n\n[[Page H3630]]\n\n  I also thank Mr. Graves of Louisiana and Mr. Polis for their \namendment at the committee level, which requires a report from the \nGovernment Accountability Office that outlines how Puerto Rico reached \nthis point of fiscal insolvency.\n  My amendment is very straightforward. It would simply set a deadline \nfor the GAO to submit this report within 18 months of the enactment of \nthis bill. Mr. Graves and Mr. Polis are cosponsors of my amendment, and \nthey agree that setting a deadline is important.\n  We must figure out how Puerto Rico got to this point in order to \navoid another territory's finding itself in a similar position at some \npoint down the road. I believe having this report and receiving it in a \ntimely manner will, hopefully, go a long way towards preventing a \nsimilar situation in the future. This amendment is about \naccountability, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Byrne\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

REPORT ON TERRITORIAL DEBT.\n\n       (a) Report Required.--Not later than one year after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, and thereafter not less \n     than once every two years, the Comptroller General of the \n     United States shall submit to Congress a report on the public \n     debt of each territory, including--\n       (1) the historical levels of each territory's public debt, \n     current amount and composition of each territory's public \n     debt, and future projections of each territory's public debt;\n       (2) the historical levels of each territory's revenue, \n     current amount and composition of each territory's revenue, \n     and future projections of each territory's revenue;\n       (3) the drivers and composition of each territory's public \n     debt;\n       (4) the effect of Federal laws, mandates, rules, and \n     regulations on each territory's public debt; and\n       (5) the ability of each territory to repay it's public \n     debt.\n       (b) Materials.--The government of each territory shall make \n     available to the Comptroller General of the United States all \n     materials necessary to carry out this section.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 770, the gentleman \nfrom Alabama (Mr. Byrne) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chair, as we have heard over and over again today, \nthis Congress has plenary authority over our territories. Over the \ncourse of the last century, this body has rightly delegated this power \nto provide for home rule for our territories. However, it is abundantly \nclear that this delegation of power has resulted in no oversight by the \nFederal Government over the debts that our territories are running up.\n  In this particular case, out of the blue, we have been told by the \nUnited States Treasury that it is our constitutional responsibility to \ndo something to save a territory from years of its own fiscal \nirresponsibility. For years, the entire Federal Government was, \nessentially, asleep at the wheel as one of our territories ran up huge, \nunsustainable debts until the day arose when the territory could no \nlonger pay.\n  Mr. Chair, I have absolutely no interest in interfering with the home \nrule of our territories. However, delegated authority can be abused. If \nwe have a constitutional responsibility to intervene to prevent \nterritorial insolvency, we certainly should exercise at least minimal \noversight into the large debts that some of our territories are running \nup.\n  My amendment is simple. It requires a biennial report to Congress on \nthe debt of each territory, the drivers of each territory's debt, the \neffect of Federal policy on each territory's debt, and the ability of \neach territory to repay its debt. This will help us provide that \nminimal oversight.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Chair, the very agency that is coming to Congress \nand asking us to help Puerto Rico--the United States Treasury--has \nrefused to provide this report to Congress, claiming it lacks \nresources. Let's be clear. The Department of the Treasury was \nappropriated $11.9 billion for this fiscal year, and they claim a lack \nof resources to put together a simple report on five tiny territories. \nThat is astonishing. It is also irresponsible.\n  In response to the Department of the Treasury, I offered a \ncompromise. I would take one Treasury report on territorial debt if the \nTreasury would simply agree to monitor and advise us of what is going \non with these territorial governments and what we should do to prevent \ninsolvency.\n  According to the Treasury, this was even worse. It would represent an \nunprecedented expansion into the finances and solvency of a U.S. \nsubsovereign. Apparently, this administration doesn't like the \nTerritories Clause of the Constitution unless it is being used at the \nvery last minute to save Puerto Rico.\n  I don't blame Puerto Rico for this. I blame the United States \nTreasury for this. If the United States Treasury is unwilling to do its \njob, I have changed the text of my amendment to require the GAO to put \ntogether this biennial report, and I look forward to seeing its \nresults.\n  Last night, Mr. Chair, in the Rules Committee meeting, we heard \ntestimony from the representatives of two other territories, who told \nus that they are concerned that their territories are sliding in the \nsame direction as Puerto Rico's while the Treasury Department sleeps. \nSince the Treasury Department won't take responsibility and do its job, \nwe are going to do our job through the GAO.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in doing something to fix this \nproblem before another crisis is upon us. Perhaps, then, we can even \nget the Treasury and the rest of the Federal Government to wake up. If \nthey don't, I will have a lot less sympathy the next time they come \nasking for our help.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, this amendment requires the GAO to submit \nreports every 2 years to the Congress about the public debt and about \nthe ability to pay that debt of all U.S. territories. While the debt \ncrisis in Puerto Rico is, indeed, serious and real, there is no \nindication that any other territory faces a similar crisis.\n  The base bill already includes reporting requirements. Requiring more \nreporting to cover the territories is unwarranted as well as being a \nwaste of the GAO's limited time to provide more important reports to \nCongress.\n  A number of States and localities on the mainland face much more \nprecarious budget situations than do the other territories. We don't \nneed any more focus on U.S. territories when there is no reason to \nbelieve such onerous reporting is really required or justified.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah \n(Mr. Bishop).\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, there is an old line from the play \n``1776,'' when Stephen Hopkins says:\n  Mr. Chair, I have never seen, heard, or smelled an issue so dangerous \nit couldn't be talked about. Hell, yes. I am for debating anything.\n  This is one of those situations in which you have never seen, heard, \nor smelled anything that shouldn't be studied. The information could be \nvital, and it could be helpful. For that, I endorse and support this \namendment.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chair, I listened to the gentleman's comments, and I \nhave to tell you, if there is enough in this bill for the reporting, \nwhy did the Treasury not say that to us? They didn't say that to us \nbecause they know there needs to be a report done. They just don't want \nto take the responsibility for doing it.\n  I think this amendment is definitely necessary for us to make sure we \nare doing our job in exercising our constitutional responsibility.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H3631]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chair, I didn't know anything about this, and the vast \nmajority of the Members didn't know anything about this problem before \nit was thrust upon us over the last several weeks.\n  The irresponsibility of the Treasury Department in not giving this \ninformation to us months ago when they knew it was happening or when \nthey should have known it was happening underscores the need for this. \nI am putting it on the GAO in this particular amendment, but in the \nyears to come, we need to expect the Treasury to do its job, because it \nhas failed to do so in this circumstance.\n  I ask the House to adopt my amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, a recent report from the U.S. Public \nInterest Research Group Education Fund rated all 50 States on whether \nthey made transparent budget and spending information available to the \npublic. My own State of Arizona received a grade of a B, so we have \nsome work to do there. The State of Alabama, however, received the \ngrade of a D, placing it fourth from the bottom of all States.\n  From that, it seems clear, if our goal is budget and spending \ntransparency, perhaps our focus should be on our States on the mainland \nand not on the territories, because that seems to be where there is a \nverifiable problem.\n  This amendment is unwarranted, and it does not need to be included in \nthe legislation.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Duffy\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in House Report 114-610.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 116, after line 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 411. EXPANSION OF HUBZONES IN PUERTO RICO.\n\n       (a)  In General.--\n       (1) Section 3(p)(4)(A) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n     632(p)(4)(A)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(A) Qualified census tract.--\n       ``(i) In general.--The term `qualified census tract' has \n     the meaning given that term in section 42(d)(5)(B)(ii) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       ``(ii) Exception.--For any metropolitan statistical area in \n     the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the term `qualified census \n     tract' has the meaning given that term in section \n     42(d)(5)(B)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as \n     applied without regard to subclause (II) of such section, \n     except that this clause shall only apply--\n\n       ``(I) 10 years after the date that the Administrator \n     implements this clause, or\n       ``(II) the date on which the Financial Oversight and \n     Management Board for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico created \n     by the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic \n     Stability Act ceases to exist,\n\n     whichever event occurs first.''.\n       (2) Regulations.--The Administrator of the Small Business \n     Administration shall issue regulations to implement the \n     amendment made by paragraph (1) not later than 90 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Improving Oversight.--\n       (1) Guidance.--Not later than 270 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Small \n     Business Administration shall develop and implement criteria \n     and guidance on using a risk-based approach to requesting and \n     verifying information from entities applying to be designated \n     or recertified as qualified HUBZone small business concerns \n     (as defined in section 3(p)(5) of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 632(p)(5))).\n       (2) Assessment.--Not later 1 year after the date on which \n     the criteria and guidance described in paragraph (1) is \n     implemented, the Comptroller General of the United States \n     shall begin an assessment of such criteria and guidance.

Pursuant to House Resolution 770, the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chair, the Puerto Rico unemployment rate is double the \nnational average. Nearly one in every two residents lives below the \npoverty line. Economic growth is in the negative. We have heard about \nthat all day today. Now, PROMESA will stop the bleeding, but there \nisn't an easy solution to jump-start the economy. We have a down \npayment in a commission, but this is, I think, a real step in the \ndirection of trying to kick-start economic growth.\n  My amendment, with my colleague from Puerto Rico (Mr. Pierluisi), \nwill provide modest assistance to Puerto Rico by removing an impediment \nto the Small Business Administration's HUBZone program that limits the \nnumber of businesses on the island that are eligible for the program.\n  This idea was brought to me by my friend Jaime Perello, the speaker \nof the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico, and it is a good one. What \ndoes it do? The HUBZone program is a small business, Federal \ncontracting assistance program, whose primary objective is job creation \nand increasing capital investment in distressed communities.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Now, there is a 20 percent cap. So that 20 percent cap for this \nprogram might not affect Minneapolis or Chicago or Milwaukee because \nyou don't even have 20 percent of the communities that are distressed.\n  However, in Puerto Rico you have far more than 20 percent of the \ncommunities that are distressed. You have 80 percent of them that are \ndistressed. So by removing this cap, you have a larger part of the \ncommunity that qualifies to access this program.\n  This is, I think, a very good solution and downpayment on economic \ngrowth and investment in Puerto Rico. Not only that, but there have \nbeen some noted problems with the program. GAO has made some \nrecommendations. We have solidified those recommendations in this bill \nnot just for Puerto Rico, but for the Nation as a whole to make sure \nthere are better checks and balances in the HUBZone program.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I rise reluctantly in opposition to the \namendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy).\n  The House Small Business Committee that I happen to chair has \njurisdiction over the SBA's HUBZone program. Our committee has not yet \nhad the opportunity to have oversight hearings on the program during \nthis session, and I don't believe it would be prudent to adopt this \namendment until the committee has had the opportunity to perform its \ndue diligence.\n  In discussions with interested parties during the development of this \nlegislation, I suggested language that would require the GAO to issue a \nreport on Small Business Administration programs in Puerto Rico, \nincluding contract activities relating to HUBZone small businesses \nconcerns. That language is contained in the underlying text. That \nreport, coupled with committee oversight work, I believe, will ensure \nthat what Congress ultimately does will, in fact, help Puerto Rico's \nsmall businesses.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chair, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nPuerto Rico (Mr. Pierluisi).\n  Mr. PIERLUISI. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking Congressman \nDuffy for his outstanding work on this bill and on this particular\n\n[[Page H3632]]\n\namendment. I also want to thank Congressman Don Young, a steadfast \nchampion for fair treatment for Puerto Rico who is also a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  The primary purpose of this amendment is to increase small business \nactivity and promote job creation in Puerto Rico.\n  The HUBZone program supports economically distressed communities \nthroughout the Nation. If the poverty rate or median income in a census \ntract meets a certain threshold, it is designated as a qualified census \ntract. Small businesses located in a qualified census tract can compete \nfor Federal contracts with preference, assuming they meet all other \ncriteria established by law.\n  However, there is a statutory cap which prevents the combined \npopulation of the qualified census tracts within a metropolitan \nstatistical area from exceeding 20 percent of the total population of \nthat area. Although the cap applies nationwide, it has a uniquely \nnegative impact in Puerto Rico. Small firms located in over 60 \nmunicipalities in Puerto Rico cannot take advantage of the HUBZone \nprogram solely because of the cap. No other U.S. State or territory \ncomes anywhere close to being as adversely affected by the cap as \nPuerto Rico.\n  To promote economic development in Puerto Rico, which is absolutely \nessential if the territory is going to prosper, our amendment would \nremove the cap for Puerto Rico for 10 years or until the independent \noversight board established by the legislation terminates, whichever \noccurs first. Based on the best available statistics, this amendment \nensures that small firms located in over 80 percent of the census \ntracts in Puerto Rico may be eligible to compete with preference for \nFederal contracts, which should create additional employment \nopportunities on the island. The amendment will only extend the HUBZone \nprograms to those census tracts in Puerto Rico that would have \nqualified for the program in the absence of the cap. So it does not \nconstitute an unwarranted expansion of the HUBZone program.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chair, who has the right to close?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Ohio has the right to close.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the comments by Chairman Chabot, \nand I would just note that I know his committee hasn't had oversight \nhearings on this issue. The GAO has done extensive studies, and the \nSmall Business Administration has not implemented those \nrecommendations. I think the most salient recommendations made by the \nGAO have been included in this bill and go a long way to improving the \nprogram, but if we are going to fix Puerto Rico, debt restructuring is \nimperative.\n  This oversight board is key, but we need economic growth. And I think \nthis is the right downpayment to help kick-start some economic growth \non the island, that the people in Puerto Rico know that we understand \nthat. And we are taking one small step today to show that we are going \nto help them get from that 20 percent cap to allow 80 percent of the \nisland to access this HUBZone program because we care about growth, we \ncare about opportunity, and we care about jobs on the island.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Serrano\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title IV, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 411. DETERMINATION ON DEBT.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be interpreted to restrict--\n       (1) the ability of the Puerto Rico Commission for the \n     Comprehensive Audit of the Public Credit to file its reports; \n     or\n       (2) the review and consideration of the Puerto Rico \n     Commission's findings by Puerto Rico's government or an \n     Oversight Board for Puerto Rico established under section \n     101.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 770, the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Serrano) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, this amendment offered by Ms. Velazquez \nand myself would help clarify that this legislation would not impact \nthe work being done by the Puerto Rico Commission for the Comprehensive \nAudit of the Public Credit.\n  This entity, set up by Puerto Rico's Government, is in the process of \nexamining the massive debt that has been accrued by the territory. In a \npreliminary report, the commission recently found that a small portion \nof the debt may have been illegally issued by the government of Puerto \nRico, and they need to further examine the issue and its implications.\n  This amendment simply preserves the ability of this commission to \ncontinue their work and for either the government or the oversight \nboard to review and consider any findings that the commission might \nhave. The work being done by the commission could significantly assist \nboth the oversight board and the Puerto Rican Government as the island \ntries to get back on its feet.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition, even \nthough I am not opposed to this particular amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I want to make it very clear that this \nparticular amendment does not override the authority of the oversight \nboard. But because of that, I do support the amendment, and I urge its \nadoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New \nYork (Ms. Velazquez), my sister from Yabucoa, Puerto Rico.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chair, I represent New York's Seventh \nCongressional District.\n  I rise in strong support of the Serrano-Velazquez amendment. \nThroughout the course of this entire saga, it has become increasingly \nclear that Puerto Rico's debt is not fully understood. The island has \nissued 18 different classes of debt--from general obligation to COFINA, \nto GDB, to utility bonds. Various local and State laws are involved, \nand the result is a web of confusion.\n  To address this, the Puerto Rico Commission for the Comprehensive \nAudit of the Public Credit was created to examine all of the island's \ndebt, something that is very much needed. The audit will not only \ninform the people of Puerto Rico, but also, in many ways, will assist \nthe oversight board in carrying out its mission. Analyzing and \nassessing all of the island's $70 billion in debt is long overdue.\n  Recently, the commission released a preliminary report finding that a \nsmall, yet significant, amount of the debt may have violated the \nisland's constitution. Such a finding is meaningful and could have \nramifications for this legislation's implementation.\n  Our amendment ensures that the underlying bill will not prevent the \ncommission from finishing its important work while also allowing the \nlocal government and the oversight board to consider these findings if \nthey so chose.\n  In summary, this amendment would allow for much-needed sunlight to be \nshown on the island's financial situation.\n  I urge Members to support this amendment.\n  Mr. SERRANO.

The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n\n[[Page H3633]]\n\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 403 (and redesignate succeeding sections and \n     conform the table of contents accordingly).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 770, the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Mrs. Torres) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, the bill, as it is currently written, allows the \nminimum wage for workers 25 years and under to be lowered to abysmal \n$4.25 for 4 years for as long as the oversight board is in place. It \nalso fails to specify whether this reduction is limited to one 4-year \nperiod or if the request can be made over and over again, essentially \nkeeping the lower wage indefinitely.\n  My amendment would strip this provision from the bill. In today's \ndollars, American workers haven't had a minimum wage this low since the \n1940s. The young men and women of Puerto Rico are American citizens, \nand they don't deserve to be treated like second-class workers.\n  These aren't high school students with summer jobs. They are young \npeople setting off on their careers, many of them struggling to pay off \nstudent loan debt and become self-sufficient. Lowering the wage only \nadds insult to injury and sends the wrong statement about whether we \nvalue Puerto Ricans as equal Americans.\n  The island is already experiencing a mass exodus of young people. \nLowering wages will only make more young people want to leave, having a \ndetrimental impact on Puerto Rico's current and future workforce, its \ntax base, and its ability to pay off its debt, ultimately digging them \ninto a deeper hole.\n  If we want to help Puerto Rico overcome this current crisis, we need \nto make sure the island is a place where young people can see a future \nfor themselves, start a family, and work to grow a business, not a \nplace that devalues their work and their contributions.\n  The minimum wage provision in this bill is bad for these young \nworkers and is bad for Puerto Rico.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I respectfully rise in opposition to \nthe amendment by my colleague from California because this is exactly \nthe kind of thinking that led Puerto Rico into the fiscal situation in \nwhich they now find themselves.\n  As we all know, one thing that would help address Puerto Rico's \nfiscal crisis is a stronger, more vibrant local economy. That is why \nthis legislation includes a number of provisions aimed at helping local \nbusinesses expand and hire new workers. This amendment would strike an \nentire provision from the bill, a provision that is pro-growth and \naimed at revitalizing local businesses and the Puerto Rican economy as \na whole.\n  Section 403 is a provision that will make it easier for young workers \nto find jobs and start their careers. The legislation gives the \nGovernor of Puerto Rico the authority, subject to the approval of the \noversight board, to adjust the minimum wage for new workers under the \nage of 25. Current law already allows employers to offer what is known \nas a youth opportunity wage for up to 90 days. This legislation simply \nextends the time period in Puerto Rico to 4 years, an idea that was \nfirst recommended in 2012 by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, \nwhich noted then that younger workers were ``in danger of becoming \ndisconnected from the labor market.''\n  This recommended change will support economic growth and provide more \njob opportunities for the local workforce, particularly younger workers \nand workers with fewer skills. These are commonsense policies that will \nhelp address Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis by supporting a stronger, more \nprosperous local economy.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and \nsupport the underlying legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Grayson).\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, we are talking about a minimum wage of \n$4.25 an hour. That is less than $700 per month. Tell me how anybody \ncan survive anywhere on the island of Puerto Rico on less than $700 a \nmonth. It simply isn't possible. The cost of living in San Juan is no \nlower than it is in Orlando, or much of the mainland for that matter.\n  I don't know where you can even find a one-bedroom apartment for $700 \na month that would be worth living in. I don't know how you can pay for \nlunch and dinner and breakfast for $700 a month. I don't know how you \ncan find health coverage for $700 a month. I don't know how you can \nfind transportation to get to that job for $700 a month. I just don't \nget it. Any one of these things would be enough to break the budget and \nput you into bankruptcy if you are only making $700 a month, and that \nis before you even have to pay taxes.\n  What we are doing is we are taking a Spanish-speaking population, 3.5 \nmillion of them, and we are condemning them to low wages to the point \nwhere 45-year-old men will lose their jobs to 20-year-old sons because \nthe 20-year-old sons are forced to work for only $4.25.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentleman.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. This is the lesson that we are teaching those young men \nand women who we are supposedly trying to help. The lesson is this: hop \non an airplane from San Juan to my district in Orlando for $168, and \nyou can get a 70 percent increase in your wages because that is what \nthe difference is already under current law between what you are \ntalking about, a $4.25 hourly wage and $7.25 that you can earn \nlegally--it is actually more than that under State law--in Orlando. \nThat is not teaching people how to work. It is teaching people to \ndisrespect work.\n  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Chairman, someone living in Puerto Rico needs to \nmake $9.25 an hour to afford a one-bedroom apartment. If the wage is \nlowered to $4.25, not even two earners could afford to live there.\n  Mr. Chairman, there is no question that Puerto Rico will need to make \nsacrifices, but it can't do so on the backs of its young workforce, \nAmerican citizens. This provision does not fix Puerto Rico's problems, \nand in the long run, it makes them worse.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment so that Puerto Rico's \nrecovery doesn't come at the expense of young, hardworking Americans.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 196, \nnoes 225, not voting 13, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 287]\n\n                               AYES--196\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Bost\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Castro (TX)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Cleaver\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Costa\n     Costello (PA)\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeFazio\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Dold\n     Donovan\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Fattah\n     Fitzpatrick\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Gibson\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n\n[[Page H3634]]\n\n\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Gutierrez\n     Hahn\n     Hanna\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jackson Lee\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5325, and that I may \ninclude tabular material on the same.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 771 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 5325.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1828\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 5325) making appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, with Mr. \nGraves of Louisiana in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Graves) and the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  The overarching goal of the bill we are considering here today is to \nensure that we continue to preserve the beauty, enhance the security, \nand improve the institutions of the United States Capitol complex. I am \nglad to report that we have accomplished our mission, and we have done \nit in a way that respects taxpayers. By making tough choices, this bill \ndemonstrates the great work that Congress can do even during a time of \nlean budgets.\n  The American people will be proud to know that this bill continues to \nuse a zero-based budgeting approach. That means each legislative branch \nagency was required to justify its budget from scratch. This practice \ncurbs wasteful\n\n[[Page H3636]]\n\nspending and safeguards taxpayer dollars.\n  Another part of our effort to respect taxpayers was the orderly \nshutdown of the Open World Leadership Center, which is outdated, and a \nmultimillion-dollar-a-year program that no longer will exist.\n  Additionally, we continue the freeze on Members' pay. Now, this was a \nsimple decision for me. If our constituents aren't getting a raise in \nthis economy, then we shouldn't either.\n  Now, it is also worth noting that the Capitol Dome Restoration \nproject is on time and it is under budget. In fact, my office has had a \nlittle fun with this, posting pictures each day on social media of the \nprogress of the scaffolding coming off the dome, using the hashtag \n``Free the Dome.''\n  We also have a family-themed bill this year. We have worked with \nMembers on both sides of the aisle to make certain that baby-changing \nstations are available throughout all the House office buildings and in \nthe Capitol. Visiting the Capitol with a new baby can be difficult \nenough. Young mothers and fathers traveling with their children in tow \nshould have the appropriate facilities available to them, and now they \nwill.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  Additionally, with so many mothers-to-be working for the House of \nRepresentatives through their pregnancies, the committee wants to \nensure that these working moms have access to convenient parking.\n  Of course, we have also carried on the new tradition of sledding on \nCapitol Hill. Again this winter, children and adults alike living in \nthe area can sled on the west front of the Capitol--something that, \nunfortunately, was banned before we changed it last year.\n  Simply put, this bill makes the Capitol more inviting and accessible \nto young families.\n  I would, of course, like to thank the ranking member for her role \nthroughout the process of writing this bill and all the members of our \ncommittee for their hard work and their valuable contributions. In \nseeing this bill through the committee process, a good bill was made \neven better. Together, we have received and worked through more than \n200 submissions from Republicans and Democrats, appropriators and \nnonappropriators, many of which we have included in this legislation.\n  We continued conversations with Members of both the majority and the \nminority up to and through full committee markup, and saw an amendment \nprocess that incorporated proposals from both sides of the aisle, \nincluding additional resources to better serve our constituents, \nincreased savings dedicated to the Historic Buildings Revitalization \nTrust Fund, and support for efforts to enhance the security of the \nCapitol campus.\n  I would also like to thank all of the staff on both sides of the \naisle who have worked on the bill this year. In particular, I am \nappreciative of the hard work Liz Dawson, Tim Monahan and Shalanda \nYoung, and, of course, Jenny Panone who really stepped up to the plate \nafter we lost our good friend, Chuck Turner.\n  As a longtime professional staff member of this subcommittee, Chuck \nhas been missed this appropriations season. The appropriations family \njust isn't the same without him, and I want to express my continued \nsympathies to his family, his friends, and those he worked so closely \nwith all these years.\n  I would also like to thank Jason Murphy and John Donnelly in my \npersonal office, as well Sarah Arkin and Rosalyn Kumar from Ranking \nMember Wasserman Schultz's office.\n  Finally, I would like to note the important contributions that \nCongressman Sam Farr and Congressman Scott Rigell both have made to our \nsubcommittee. Their hard work and dedication has been extremely \nvaluable, and they will be dearly missed by our subcommittee and by \nthis body.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H3637]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH080616.001\n\n\n\n[[Page H3638]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH080616.002\n\n\n\n[[Page H3639]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH080616.003\n\n\n\n[[Page H3640]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH080616.004\n\n\n\n[[Page H3641]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill is a total \nof $3.481 billion--$72 million above the fiscal year 2016 enacted bill.\n  I thank our full committee chairman, Mr. Rogers of Kentucky, for \nunderstanding the challenges posed by years of cuts and providing an \nallocation to begin rebuilding the capacity of Congress to do the \npeople's work.\n  Chairman Graves funded critical investments with the additional \nallocation. He knows that if we were only discussing funding today, I \nwould be with him in protecting the good work of the subcommittee.\n  Specifically, I am pleased with the critical investments in the \nCopyright Modernization Project and the Historic Buildings \nRevitalization Trust Fund.\n  The bill provides the Copyright Modernization Project with a 17 \npercent increase. This critical funding will enable the Copyright \nOffice to hire the necessary staff to begin to make technological \nadvancements to improve the way they do business. It is unacceptable in \nthe year 2016 that copyright users have to make certain requests via \npaper in the 21st century. That is inefficient and a drag on commerce \nthat is dependent on the copyright system.\n  There is also report language included that makes it clear that the \nLibrary of Congress shall continue to defer to the Register of \nCopyrights on all copyright-related issues. While the Copyright Office \nis within the Library of Congress, it has unique functions that make it \nnecessary to have a strong leader that can answer to Congress and the \ncopyright community when issues arise. The Register of Copyrights \nshould have the freedom to make decisions and be responsive to the \ncopyright community.\n  I am also happy to see increased funding for the Historic Buildings \nRevitalization Trust Fund. This is the same fund that we used to save \nfor the downpayment on the Cannon Building Restoration.\n  This bill provides $17 million for the fund, which is $7 million \nabove fiscal year 2016 funding. I thank the chairman for working with \nme to sustain this important program.\n  We started the trust fund after the construction of the Capitol \nVisitor Center. That project was over budget by fourfold, and its \nmanagement was, frankly, an embarrassment. It was an example of \nballooning government projects that pull resources away from other \nworthy initiatives.\n  The trust fund was created to avoid the pitfalls of the CVC project \nby creating a reserve of funds that can be used for future large-scale \nprojects. We must put on our forward-thinking caps and look 10 to 20 \nyears down the road so that we save appropriately for large-scale \nprojects. This long-term thinking will ensure that our smallest \nappropriations bill--the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill--does \nnot have to absorb such large projects to the detriment of other worthy \nprograms.\n  While there are many positives in this bill, Mr. Chairman, there are \nalso issues that must be addressed as we move through the process. One \nparticularly troublesome issue is that the report accompanying this \nbill includes language seeking to influence the Library of Congress' \nprocess to change its subject headings related to immigration.\n  The Library of Congress decided in March of this year to begin using \nthe terms ``noncitizens'' and ``unauthorized immigration'' for \ncataloging purposes. They did so after being petitioned by Dartmouth \nCollege in 2014--a petition they turned down initially--and then again \nby the American Library Association earlier this year.\n  In January of this year, the American Library Association adopted a \nresolution calling on the Library of Congress to change the heading \n``illegal aliens'' to ``undocumented immigrants.''\n  Now, these are search terms. The Library of Congress uses subject \nheadings to help researchers be able to find topics based on what they \nare appropriately to be called. The Library did not adopt the term \n``undocumented immigrants'' but chose to begin to use the two phrases \n``noncitizens'' and ``unauthorized immigration.'' These new subject \nheadings are still in the process of being considered, as the public \nwill have 60 days to comment on them.\n  The fact that this project is ongoing makes the inclusion of report \nlanguage even more problematic.\n  How can the Library of Congress be expected to go through a fair and \nopen comment period with this language included in the report \naccompanying the appropriations bill?\n  My side of the aisle could have certainly pushed to have the Library \nof Congress reconsider its decision after the Dartmouth petition was \nturned down in 2014 because many Democrats and Republicans believe that \nthe term ``illegal alien'' labels a group of people based on a \nmisconception that an immigrant's presence in our Nation is a criminal \nviolation, but we allowed the process to work because the Library of \nCongress is in the business of language and nomenclature and should be \nfree to make these decisions without political interference. Congress \nshould not be setting ourselves up as the word police.\n  Let's be clear: this puts the Library of Congress front and center on \none of our Nation's most contentious and emotional political issues. \nOver the years, as ranking member, this is certainly not the first time \nI find myself in disagreement with the chairman on a particular issue. \nHowever, I have been able to work closely with the chairman of this \nsubcommittee to move the bill and the process forward.\n  And though I have been committed as always to resolving our policy \ndifferences, the politicization of the Library of Congress in order to \nperpetuate a misconception about immigrants in our country is simply an \nissue on which my principles will not allow me to bend an inch.\n  This language is not necessary, it is not appropriate, and it \njeopardizes the work of our Nation's oldest Federal cultural \ninstitution and the research arm of this body.\n  The Library of Congress makes thousands of changes to its subject \nheadings every year. At one time, ``Negro'' was a subject heading, but \nwhen it became pejorative, they changed it to ``Afro American,'' and \neventually the term used today, ``African American.''\n  The chairman and other Republican members emphasize that they are the \nLibrary of Congress--emphasis on Congress--and we should dictate to \nthem what terms they use in their subject headings.\n  Well, I ran for Congress, not word police. We should leave search \nterms for researchers to the experts and not politicize this bill that \nsimply funds the legislative branch.\n  I am also concerned that under this bill, the Capitol Police budget \nincreases by $325.3 million. This would increase funding for the \nCapitol Police by 5 percent, above the 8 percent increase they received \nin the current fiscal year.\n  We value and respect the officers on staff, but I think many Members \nwill join me in raising a skeptical eye when they realize this bill \nwould add 72 new officers and bring the total number of officers to \nclose to 1,900.\n  Just as mayors and city councils across the country have to balance \nlaw enforcement with other city services like repairing aging \ninfrastructure, so must Congress. In the near future, the congressional \nleadership and committees of jurisdiction will need to have a serious \ndiscussion about the appropriate size of the Capitol Police. The \nofficers I speak to don't complain about not having enough officers, \nbut, rather, about decisions on how the officers they do have are \ndeployed by police leadership. It is fiscally irresponsible to grow the \npolice at this rate.\n  Also, as Member and committee budgets have been cut, Congress has had \nto rely on support agencies to fill the gaps in staff expertise. One of \nthose agencies, Mr. Chairman, is the Congressional Research Service, or \nCRS.\n  CRS was funded in the bill at $107.9 million, $1 million above the \nfiscal year 2016 enacted level. At the level included in the bill, CRS \nremains $4.6 million below the fiscal year 2010 levels. According to \nCRS, recent funding levels have led to a loss of 13 percent of its \npurchasing power since 2010.\n  The $1 million increase provided by this bill will not cover \nmandatory pay for CRS' current staff. CRS' budget request sought to \nrebuild the agency. They asked for two defense policy staff,\n\n[[Page H3642]]\n\nfive health policy staff, three education policy staff, two budget and \nappropriation staff, four technology policy staff, and two data \nmanagement and analysis staff. None of those staffs will be funded \nunder the bill before us, therefore, denying Congress of an unbiased \nanalysis of these critical policy areas.\n  Before concluding, Mr. Chairman, I also want to join the chairman in \nacknowledging the loss of our beloved Chuck Turner. I had the privilege \nof working with Chuck when I was the chairman of this committee, and he \nhas served both sides of the aisle with integrity, commitment, and love \nof this institution. His loss was tremendous for the entire \nappropriations family, and he will be greatly missed on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  I also want to issue a big thanks to Liz Dawson, the majority clerk \nand her staff, Jenny Panone and Tim Monahan. Many thanks as well to \nJason Murphy with Chairman Graves' personal office. Thank you to my \nteam, Shalanda Young on the committee's minority staff who has worked \ntirelessly on those issues. Last, but certainly not least, thank you to \nmy personal staff, Rosalyn Kumar and Sarah Arkin.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the chairman of \nthe full Committee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the Legislative Branch \nAppropriations bill that is before us. This is the third of the 12 \nbills to make it to the floor. We have passed eight of the bills \nthrough the full committee, and 10 of them through the subcommittees. \nBut this bill provides the important funding that Congress needs to do \nour work on behalf of the American people.\n  From maintaining the hallowed halls of this very building, to \nproviding services for our constituents, to funding the agencies that \nkeep us informed and in check, the $3.48 billion in this bill supports \nthe largest and freest democracy the world has ever known.\n  In total, our funding is increased slightly--$73 million above \ncurrent levels. That increase is directed to essential health and \nsafety improvements to aging or damaged facilities as well as to the \nCapitol Police to protect Members, staff, and our visitors.\n  At the same time, this bill keeps the belt tight, continuing our \ntrajectory of trimming funding for the House of Representatives by 13.2 \npercent since 2011 and extending the pay freeze for Members of \nCongress. The funds provided for House operations will allow Members of \nCongress to continue serving the American people to the fullest extent \nand representing their voices in Washington, D.C.\n  For the thousands and thousands of people who enter this Capitol \ncomplex each day--be it visitors, staff, or Members themselves--safety \nis of the utmost importance.\n  As we have seen recently, the brave men and women of the Capitol \nPolice force must remain vigilant and well-equipped to secure the \nCapitol complex. The bill funds the Capitol Police at $391.3 million--\nthat is $16.3 million above current levels--to enhance security and \nmaintain public access to this complex.\n  To ensure the safety of the buildings in the Capitol complex, which, \nas we know, has historic but aging facilities, the legislation provides \n$551 million for the Architect of the Capitol. That includes ongoing \nrehab projects as well as deferred maintenance.\n  In addition, the bill provides funding for the congressional support \nagencies that we rely on each day to do our jobs. That includes $533 \nmillion for the Government Accountability Office, which provides \nCongress with accurate reporting on how tax dollars are spent, and $629 \nmillion for the Library of Congress.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill that targets funds to critical \noperations while keeping a close eye on every tax dollar spent.\n  I want to thank Chairman Graves for his hard work to ensure that \nevery dollar in this bill helps make the people's House run efficiently \nand productively. I also want to thank Ranking Member Wasserman \nSchultz, and all of the subcommittee members and staff for their \nefforts that brought this bill to the floor. Finally, I do want to \nspecify a thanks to our staff for their knowledge and expertise and \npassion for this place throughout this process.\n  As we continue our important work on the 2017 appropriations bills, I \nam proud to support good bills like this one, bills that fulfill their \nmission in a responsible, targeted way.\n  I urge all Members to support this bill as well.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to \nacknowledge the presence of Chairman Graves' lovely daughter, because \nit is always nice as a parent to have your children with you while you \nare doing your work. So welcome to the House of Representatives.\n  I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from New York \n(Mrs. Lowey), our ranking member of the full Appropriations Committee.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz. \nAnd I thank Chairman Graves and Chairman Rogers. It is a pleasure for \nme to work here with all of them.\n  However, in the fiscal year 2017 Legislative Branch Appropriations \nbill, the House majority has put its political interests first with a \nprocess that limits amendments based on a fear of another embarrassing \nfailure, like the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, which the House \nrejected 2 weeks ago.\n  The legislative branch bill contains a number of important services \nthat allow the public to safely visit the U.S. Capitol and for Members \nto respond to the needs of their constituents. The bill would provide \nmodest increases for the first time in years, including more funding \nfor the Library of Congress, Capitol Police, Architect of the Capitol, \nand the Members' Representational Allowance.\n  These increases are badly needed. The legislative branch bill has \nremained essentially flat for several years, despite the steadily \ngrowing needs of this institution, including staff shortages, enhanced \nsecurity, repairs to aging buildings and infrastructure, and \npreservation at the Library of Congress, among others.\n  Unfortunately, rather than focus on these institutions' value to the \npublic, House Republicans went out of their way to include provisions \nthat ignore these issues, and instead push a partisan agenda that \nwastes taxpayer dollars.\n  First of all, House Republicans inserted language meant to appease \nthe most extreme members of their conference by directing the Library \nof Congress to use the term ``illegal alien'' in its subject headings \nfor searches rather than the Library's preferred ``noncitizens'' or \n``unauthorized immigration.'' This unnecessary interference into the \nroutine work of the Library of Congress politicizes a change meant to \nhelp provide the most up-to-date, thorough information.\n  The inclusion of such language is sadly nothing new for the \nsubcommittee. In the past few years, the majority has spent close to $7 \nmillion on a partisan, political Benghazi investigation; $2.3 million \ndefending the Defense of Marriage Act; and is now engaging in shameful, \nunprecedented attacks on biomedical researchers and women's health.\n  Frankly, I am outraged at how the majority on the Select \nInvestigative Panel is conducting its business. The majority's witch \nhunt of researchers, including scientists, physicians, and even \ngraduate students, will have real consequences that harm medical \nadvances, and are nothing more than a political charade and waste of \ntaxpayer money. Their request for information and subpoenas without any \nassertion of wrongdoing are an abuse of authority, a violation of House \noversight practices, and a page out of the McCarthy-era bullying \ntactics that are a stain on our legislative process. The panel should \nbe disbanded immediately.\n  It is unacceptable that we cannot move appropriation bills forward in \na bipartisan manner because Republicans would rather play partisan \npolitics with taxpayer dollars than deal with the pressing challenges \nfacing this institution and this country.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Before I recognize my friend from Illinois, I have the deepest \nrespect for\n\n[[Page H3643]]\n\nthe ranking member of the full committee, Mrs. Lowey. I know that she \nrepresents what she believes very well and eloquently.\n  But I must point out for clarification, for the Record, really what \nthe report language says. I think that is important. I think words are \nimportant. I listened very intently to what was shared a minute ago \nthat this committee is directing the Library of Congress to use certain \nwords. She even used certain terms that she said we are prescribing \nthem to use, such as ``illegal alien'' or ``illegal immigrant.'' In \nfact, this is what the committee passed in subcommittee and full \ncommittee.\n  It says:\n  ``To the extent practicable, the committee instructs the Library to \nmaintain certain subject headings that reflect terminology used in \ntitle 8, United States Code.''\n  Now, I read it several times and I saw it in committee, but nowhere \nin there do I see any specific terms used. It just says can you be \nconsistent with U.S. Code.\n  I will point out that we are Congress, and they are the Library of \nCongress. We write laws, and it is important that the Library of \nCongress reference and refer to the laws that we have written.\n  I will also note that the gentlewoman is also a Member of Congress \nand has the full ability--and since the subcommittee meeting when we \nhad this first discussion, I have yet to see the bill she has \nintroduced to change any terminology in the U.S. Code. I have not seen \nit. I don't know, Mr. Chairman, if you have seen it. I have not seen \nit, and I look forward to seeing it.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I thank the gentleman.\n  Will the gentleman point out to the House of Representatives what is \nreferenced in the U.S. Code to which the report refers?\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Title 8 of the U.S. Code has a lot of \nterminology in there.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. What is the term that is referenced in that \nsection?\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. There is not one single term that is used in \nthat Code. In fact, there are multiple terms. I would ask, and maybe \nencourage, the gentlewoman to read that.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I have, and it refers specifically to the term \n``illegal alien.'' That is how it is referenced in the United States \nCode.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. In addition to other terms.\n  Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I just want to make sure that the \ncommittee understands that the report language just directs the Library \nof Congress to be consistent with the laws of this land when they have \nsubject headings. That is not too much to ask.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nRodney Davis), my good friend.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I really would like to \nthank Chairman Graves for his leadership on this issue.\n  I think the debate this evening shows us what part of the problem is \nwhen we try and follow our Forefathers' constitutional appropriations \nprocess to spend money wisely that the taxpayers send to Washington, \nD.C., to spend it wisely on their behalf.\n  It is tertiary issues that bog down the debate, instead of talking \nabout doing what is right for the upwards of 5 million families that \ntour our Capitol Grounds each and every year. It becomes a political \ndebate, rather than a debate on how to effectively use taxpayer dollars \nto ensure that one of the most popular destinations for families, \nhardworking families, to spend their money to vacation right here in \nthe Capitol, to make sure we spend that wisely so that they have better \nfacilities. That is exactly what this bill does, Mr. Chairman.\n  I want to, again, thank all of those who served on this subcommittee \nfrom both sides of the aisle, because we have to get back to the vision \nthat our Forefathers have put forth on how we should spend money in \nthis House, and how we regain the power of the purse.\n  As I said, upwards of 5 million families from across the Nation come \nsee their government at work each year. I am pleased this bill contains \nreport language that will make it easier for families with infants and \nsmall children to visit the Capitol, House and Senate office buildings \nby implementing additional changing stations and other family-friendly \nimprovements throughout this Capitol Hill complex.\n  Mr. Chairman, I say this as the father of twin boys. Trust me, \nchanging stations when they were younger were very, very important. We \nshould make it as easy as possible for families with young children to \nvisit and explore Capitol Hill and our complexes. Minor improvements \nand changes along these lines can make a huge difference in improving \nthe experience for visitors.\n  I look forward to working with the Architect of the Capitol in my \ncapacity as a member of the Committee on House Administration to \ncomplete these important changes. I will continue to look for ways to \nwork in a bipartisan manner to make our Capitol family-friendly.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of this bill.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I will point out that title 8 of the U.S. Code specifically \nreferences the term ``illegal aliens.'' The purpose of referencing it \nthat way in this legislation is specifically so that the majority can \nrequire the Library of Congress to continue to use the term ``illegal \nalien'' in their subject heading. We are being a little too cute by \nhalf here, and we are simply not going to let the majority get away \nwith it.\n  I will also point out that Congressman Joaquin Castro is the sponsor \nof legislation that would do exactly what the chairman just suggested. \nHe has legislation that would change the term ``illegal alien'' in \ntitle 8 of the U.S. Code.\n  Instead of dealing with a political issue in the midst of an \nunrelated appropriations bill, we should allow the legislative process \nto work under regular order and have that bill move through the \nprocess.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I want to follow up on that just for a moment.\n  I am glad to hear there is legislation to address their concerns. I \nthink that is the appropriate way. What better way to make that \nlegislation more applicable than to identify here in this report \nlanguage that whatever is referenced in title 8 could be used. I think \nthat is the right way to go forward.\n  But to suggest that asking the Library of Congress to use terms that \nare consistent with the laws of this land that this body has voted on, \nthat the Senate has voted on, and that the President of the United \nStates has signed into law is, in some way, pejorative; words that have \nbeen used by the Supreme Court just in recent weeks are pejorative, \ninflammatory, and dehumanizing, I would suggest to the minority that \neven some of the most liberal justices have used the term ``illegal \nalien'' or ``illegal immigrant'' just in the last couple of weeks and \nthey are not racist, they are not using negative terms, they are not \ndehumanizing any individual, they are using U.S. law terminology.\n  I can understand the disagreement with the terms, I can respect that, \nbut that is the law. I have yet to see or hear what their proper \nterminology would be for somebody who does not abide by the laws of the \nland and what that would be.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I will point out that it is not a criminal act to be in the United \nStates as an immigrant. The suggestion in the 21st century that the \nterm ``illegal alien'' is an appropriate one is similar to suggesting \nthat we continue to use the term ``Negro.''\n  We evolve in this country, and it is understandable that someone who \nwas not a member of a group of immigrants wouldn't understand that that \nterm could feel pejorative. So we, as a responsible body, should evolve \nas society evolves.\n  To continue to insist that the Library of Congress by law use a \npejorative term that they have been petitioned to change by the \nAmerican Library Association so that researchers can search for the \nappropriate term\n\n[[Page H3644]]\n\nwhen they are doing research is truly unbelievable. To be so committed \nto racist and bigoted terms that really have no place in the \nLegislative Branch Appropriations bill is outrageous.\n  That is why this language should have been deleted. I think it is \ntruly unfortunate that the majority did not have at least the courage \nto allow my amendment and Congressman Castro's amendment to be made in \norder so that we could have a proper debate on this subject on the \nfloor of the House of Representatives.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  I will point out and remind the chairman that my amendment that would \nhave done just that only was defeated in the Appropriations Committee \nby one vote. So this is not a slam dunk when it comes to your side of \nthe aisle either. It would have been nice to give your colleagues an \nopportunity to have had that discussion.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  If I heard the ranking member correctly, she said that somebody who \nis undocumented in this country, who is not from this country, is not \nhere illegally. I thought I heard that, and I hope I heard that \nincorrectly.\n  I will point out that the Immigration and Nationality Act, section \n237(a)(1)(b) reads, in fact--and this is law that was voted on by this \nbody and that was signed into law by the President of the United \nStates, who was elected by the people--that aliens who are present in \nthe U.S. in violation of immigration code are breaking the law and are \ndeportable. That is U.S. law. That is not the majority's opinion; that \nis not a party's opinion; that is not an individual's opinion. That is \nthe law of this land. Now, you can disagree with those laws, and you \ncan disagree with the terminology, but that is the law.\n  That is the law, in fact, to the point that, in Arizona v. United \nStates, in 2012, Justice Sotomayor asked:\n\n       So how--where do they get the records that show that this \n     person is an illegal alien that is not authorized to be here?\n\n  Was she being racist? pejorative? demeaning? dehumanizing? I don't \nthink so. I don't agree with all of her decisions, but I don't believe \nthat that was her intent when she broached that question there.\n  I will point out this provision--maybe I should read it again. I will \nread it again for the ranking member.\n\n       To the extent practicable, the committee instructs the \n     Library to maintain certain subject headings that reflect \n     terminology used in title VIII of the United States Code.\n\n  That is all it says. It is right here. There is nothing so demeaning \nabout that. This provision, in fact, was created in consultation, Mr. \nChair, with the Library of Congress. Imagine that. In working with the \nLibrary of Congress, we were able to come up with that language. \nExisting subject headings, including the term ``illegal alien,'' have \nbeen used for years and have been enshrined in law for 100 years. This \nis nothing new. Supreme Court Justices, as I have pointed out, have \nused it time and time and time again.\n  Now, if the Library of Congress adopted the practice of responding to \nevery instance in which there is a perceived offensive phrase, it would \nimpact their ability to prioritize the quality of service they provide \nto patrons every day. We are, actually, helping the Library here. We \nare not telling them what words to use. We are just saying, hey, be \nconsistent with U.S. law. That keeps it pretty simple, I believe.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Before we passed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act in \nthe 1960s and when we had the Jim Crow laws, which were an unfortunate \nstain on our history, there were plenty of people who said that the \nlaws that were in place were doing a favor to Negroes, which is the way \nthey were referred to at the time. For the chairman to suggest that we \nare doing the Library of Congress a favor by requiring them to continue \nto use a term that they have been petitioned to stop using, ``illegal \nalien,'' is insensitive, inappropriate, outdated, and political.\n  This is the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. We are supposed \nto be discussing how to fund the functions of the legislative branch, \nand we have just spent an extraordinary amount of time debating the \nimmigration debate that has been raging in this country for far too \nlong.\n  I guess I shouldn't be surprised that the majority believes that we \nshould continue to label people as ``illegal.'' People aren't illegal. \nActs that are committed are illegal, but people are not illegal, Mr. \nChair. That is, simply, why the American Library Association, the \numbrella policy organization for libraries across this country, has \npetitioned the Library of Congress to change the use of the term \n``illegal alien.''\n  What the majority is doing here, as I said, is setting Congress up as \nthe word police. Where are we going to stop? There are thousands of \nsubject headings that they change at the Library of Congress every \nyear. I can't imagine how many pages this bill will be when we start \nreferencing and spending time arguing over what they call each of \nthose. It is inappropriate; it is unacceptable; it is a complete waste \nof time. It injects politics into a bill that usually and, most often, \ndoesn't have it.\n  It is unfortunate that the funding of the Planned Parenthood select \ncommittee and that the funding of the Benghazi Select Committee have \ncontinued to politicize a bill that should, simply, be an effort for us \nto make sure that we can sustain the most significant beacon of \ndemocracy that the world has ever seen.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  It is remarkable that we are actually spending so much time on this; \nbut we must point out to the constituency who is watching that we have \nhad 7\\1/2\\ years of an executive who wants to ignore our laws. We have \nhad 7\\1/2\\ years of overreach by the executive branch, of its totally \nignoring the laws that have been passed by this body, and just poking \nus in the eye, saying, I don't care about the legislative branch. I \ndon't care about that legislative body. I don't care about the laws of \nthe land. In fact, I will ignore them, and I will instruct my agencies \nto do something different.\n\n  Yet, I hear it again from the minority that they want to ignore the \nwords, the terms, the identifications, the definitions of the very laws \nof this land. What message does that send to the youth of our country? \nWhat message does that send to law-abiding citizens in our country, \nthat there is a party in Washington, D.C., that, for whatever reason, \nwants to pick and choose which laws they want to uphold and defend, or \nwhich laws or words or terms or definitions in the laws that they will \nacknowledge or not acknowledge?\n  We are a Nation of laws. Whether we agree with the laws or we don't, \nwhether we agree with the terminology or we don't, we have all been \nelected by 700,000-plus constituency districts in which we can change \nthose laws if we choose. This is the opportunity to do it for the \nminority party if they like. In fact, throughout our laws, these terms \nare used. Whether they are agreeable terms or not by the minority, \nthose are the words that are in our laws.\n  I think we can all agree that the term ``illegal alien'' does not \nmean the human being is illegal. This is not an effort to demean \nanyone. We don't even identify what terms the Library must use. We just \nsay, Hey, please be consistent with U.S. Code. That is it. The simple \nfact is that immigrants, if they have entered this country illegally, \nare, in fact, illegal immigrants. According to U.S. Code, U.S. laws, \nthey have committed a crime. It is not the job of this committee's to \ncreate an alternate reality whatsoever. The laws are the laws.\n  Thankfully, the Supreme Court sees it the same way. We have Justice \nSotomayor as using the term ``illegal alien'' a half a dozen times and \nthe published opinion written by Justice Kennedy, and he joined the \nCourt's more liberal block as well, using it a number of times. It is \nvery consistent.\n\n[[Page H3645]]\n\n  I recall it was, maybe, a year or two that the ranking member, on a \ndifferent occasion, disagreed with me on another term. It was \n``ObamaCare.'' We were having a debate about policies, Mr. Chair, and I \nused the term ``ObamaCare.'' She found it offensive, pejorative maybe, \nvery negative, demeaning, used in a negative light. I believe she tried \nto strike my words during that time. So, if anybody is trying to be \nword police in this body, maybe it is the ranking member, who has a \nhistory of it.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chair, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman will state her parliamentary inquiry.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Is it not appropriate for the ranking member \nand the chairman, when we are debating, to go through the Chair when we \nare having that debate?\n  The CHAIR. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I would ask that you remind the chairman to do \nso, please.\n  The CHAIR. Members have been reminded to direct their remarks to the \nChair.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I would point out that the gentleman from Georgia is absolutely \ncorrect. I did raise that concern, and I thought it was appropriate to \nraise the concern that the way the majority meant the term \n``ObamaCare,'' as applied at the time, was intended to be pejorative. \nThen President Obama embraced the term; so we evolved because President \nObama decided that he liked that his name would be associated with \nmaking sure that 20 million people who now have health insurance but \nwho didn't before would be associated with his name.\n  That is all that the American Library Association and the Library of \nCongress are asking with regard to the people who are labeled as \n``illegal aliens.'' The gentleman from Georgia, it would be understood, \nis not someone who is labeled that way, so, perhaps, it is \nunderstandable that he would not understand why that was offensive. The \nAmerican Library Association and the Library of Congress have \nrecognized that the evolution beyond using a term that has been \ndetermined to be pejorative is essential. That is called progress. That \nis called tolerance.\n  Unfortunately, the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, through \nthe reference to title VIII in the United States Code, requires, in \nthis bill, the Library of Congress to continue to use the term \n``illegal alien.'' It is inappropriate, unfortunate, and it should be \ndeleted. We should have had an opportunity to debate an amendment to \nhave allowed that to happen.\n  The majority chooses to hide the fact. I mean, I wish they would have \njust owned up to it. Mr. Chair, they should have just put it right up \nin the bill. I don't know why they didn't. If they think it is the \nright thing to do, they should have just put that term right in the \nbill and spelled out that they expect the Library of Congress to \ncontinue to use it. Hiding behind title VIII of the U.S. Code shows \nthat they don't have, necessarily, the courage of their convictions to \nstand up for that term. Why? Because there are a whole lot of people in \nthis country who think it is offensive, including me and the Members of \nmy party.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I am sorry this is taking so long tonight to reach the admission by \nthe ranking member that this term does not exist in this bill. I mean, \nshe just said it: Why didn't they just be more explicit? Why didn't he \njust use the term? In fact, they are hiding behind U.S. Code. That is \nwhat I just heard from the ranking member.\n  As Americans, we don't hide behind the U.S. Code. The U.S. Code is \nour defense; it is our shield. The laws of this land are what protect \nus from one from another; so to suggest that one is hiding behind it \nwhen, in fact, we are defended by it is really amazing to hear tonight.\n  I am pleased to hear, though, that the ranking member has \nacknowledged that nowhere in this legislation do we direct the Library \nof Congress to use any term other than what is found in and is \nconsistent with the U.S. Code.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  What I suggested was that, because the majority realizes that the \nterm ``illegal alien'' is not something that is appropriate to continue \nto use as a subject heading, if they had spelled it straight out in the \nbill rather than hiding what their true intention was behind the \nreference to the U.S. Code, they probably would have had to have \nanswered a little bit more closely to the fact that they were making \nthis effort.\n  Now we have been able to at least have this discussion, and I am \nintentionally using most of my time to be able to shine a spotlight on \nthe fact that the majority wishes to continue to label people as \n``illegal,'' wishes to continue to politicize the legislative branch \nappropriations bill to inject the immigration debate into the funding \nof the legislative branch, and to set themselves up as the word police \nwith regard to subject headings.\n  This is what we need our colleagues to wrap their minds around, Mr. \nChair--requiring the Library to continue to use an offensive term in \ntheir subject headings so that researchers can't use the term that the \nAmerican Library Association has deemed more appropriate and not \noffensive. Instead, they insist on continuing to use an offensive term.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  That is unacceptable. It is inappropriate. We are going to continue \nto insist, and I will not be able to support this legislation as a \nresult of the insistence of the majority on labeling an entire group of \npeople ``illegal'' and politicizing this bill when the Library of \nCongress should be allowed to let the process work that works for \nthousands of other changes to their subject headings.\n  I will also point out, Mr. Chairman, that we do embrace evolution of \nterminology here. Just in May, a few weeks ago, we finally deleted the \nlast vestiges of the terms ``Oriental'' and ``Negro'' from the United \nStates Code. So we do have a process by which we take legislation like \nthat that has been introduced by Congressman Joaquin Castro, and we \nallow it to move through the process. That is the appropriate way that \nwe deal with discussion about changes in terminology in the code. We \ndon't do it in the legislative branch bill. And that is exactly what \nthe majority is doing by insisting that the Library of Congress \ncontinue to use that offensive term ``illegal alien.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I recognize this has been an \nexciting and tantalizing debate this evening.\n  Whenever the gentlewoman from Florida is ready to close, I will be \nready as well.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime to close.\n  I think it is unfortunate that myself and my colleagues on our side \nof the aisle don't feel that we can lend our support to this \nlegislation for a variety of reasons. First, there has been an \noverwhelming injection of politics into what should be an otherwise \nsolid piece of legislation in which we have done a lot of good work to \nmake sure that the functions of the legislative branch are able to make \nsure that we can exercise our roles and responsibilities as Members of \nthe legislative branch.\n  Unfortunately, due to the funding of the select committee on Planned \nParenthood, which continues the witch hunt into an organization that \nsimply exists to provide millions of women access to quality health \ncare, in which there has been absolutely no evidence whatsoever that \nthere was any wrongdoing, the majority continues to insist on funding \nthe witch hunt that is designed to prevent women from getting access to \nquality, affordable health care.\n\n[[Page H3646]]\n\n  It also continues funding for the Select Committee on Benghazi, an \ninvestigation in which the majority has actually admitted that they \nfound absolutely no wrongdoing. Yet they have not disbanded the \ncommittee, and they continue to provide funding for it in this bill.\n  Lastly, as we have been able to spend a few minutes debating here on \nthe floor, this bill tragically sets the legislative branch up as the \nword police and Members of Congress as the watchful sentries over the \nuses of the terms and subject headings at the Library of Congress. I am \nglad that we are really carefully protecting the card catalog in the \nLibrary of Congress to make sure that we can continue to use offensive \nterms when researchers look them up in the Library of Congress, like \n``illegal alien.''\n  This bill makes sure that, instead of evolving, instead of moving \nforward, instead of letting professionals who work in libraries decide \nwhat terms should be used in their subject headings, Congress is going \nto establish ourselves as the word police, politicize something where \nwe should not inject politics, and label people as ``illegal.''\n  Again, I will reiterate that there should have been an opportunity \nfor us to debate this issue separately. I am glad we have had an \nopportunity to discuss it here and to expose the majority for wanting \nto continue a bigoted, offensive term as the subject heading in the \nLibrary of Congress.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime to close.\n  We have heard a lot tonight about why the minority is opposed to this \nbill. They are opposed to this bill because of what is not in it. Do \nyou notice that? It is because of what is not in it.\n  They have yet to talk about the great things, the good things, and \nwhat this bill really is about. In fact, they are going to oppose this \nbill, as they did last year, just because of things that don't exist, \nthat are absent.\n  I will point out, and I want to remind the chairman and the \ncommittee, that this is really a good piece of legislation. It is very \nfamily friendly, which is one of our major focuses. We have thousands \nand thousands of visitors each year that come and visit this place, \nthis Capitol Building, this historic beacon of hope for our country and \nfor the world. Visitors come and visit our offices and tour the \nfacilities, and we want it to be family friendly, safe and secure, and \na welcoming environment. That is what this bill achieves.\n  It does that by providing something that is unique, something that I \nwas very passionate about in my days in the State of Georgia, and that \nis doing zero-based budgeting, something very unique. It is not done in \nall the other appropriations bills, but it is done in this one, where \nevery agency starts from zero and justifies each expense forward. That \nis what our constituents expect.\n  It even does it by eliminating the Open World Center, zeroing out, \nwinding down, and eliminating a program that was well-intended back in \nthe 1980s when it was first founded. But it is time to wind it down, \nmove on, and use those dollars for something else, changing priorities. \nThat is what this committee was focused on.\n  It continues the Member pay freeze. As I stated earlier, when our \nconstituents aren't getting a raise in this economy, the Obama economy, \nthen I don't believe we should be getting a raise either. It eliminates \nthat. It freezes that.\n  We do this by also cutting the House budget by 13.2 percent since \nRepublicans took the majority. That is something we don't share enough \nof. The House has taken the necessary steps to lead by example in \ncutting our budgets by 13.2 percent since taking the majority in 2010. \nI can't say the same about the Senate. I can't say the same about the \nexecutive branch, nor the judicial. But we can say that about our side, \nbecause we are leading by example.\n  Then it has a strong focus on constituent services. We were able to \nprovide additional resources for all Members, Republican and Democrat \nalike, from all corners of this country and from all the territories to \nmake sure that they have the resources necessary to meet the needs of \ntheir constituents, because that is really one of our number one \npriorities back in our districts and from our offices here is to \nprovide the services to our constituency.\n  We have heard a lot tonight about the Library of Congress. Look, the \nLibrary of Congress has a great history, a great heritage, and provides \na tremendous service. It has a history of providing law services to \nthis body and to the Senate over the years as well as constituencies \nthat come and do research. It does a great job.\n  All we have done in this bill is say, as you do your subject \nheadings, just make sure it is consistent with U.S. Code, be consistent \nwith the laws of this land. That way, those who are searching topics \nare searching topics that are consistent with what is being debated in \nthe Supreme Court, what is being debated in other courts throughout the \ncountry because they are using the laws of this land as they try \nvarious cases. So why not just use terminology that is consistent with \nthe Code that this body and that the Senate and that a President has \nsigned into law at some point.\n  Mr. Chair, I want to commend to this body and to the committee the \nLegislative Branch Appropriations bill. It is a good bill to be \nsupported and to be proud of and to know that you are going to be able \nto take care of your constituents better. And we have got a great \nfamily-friendly, safe, and secure environment for them to come and \nvisit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Byrne).

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in House Report 114-611.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n       Page 4, line 22, after the first dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $1,000,000) (increased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota (Mr. Ellison) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, we can raise living standards for working \nfamilies across this country if we use Federal dollars to create good \njobs.\n  My amendment would reprogram funds to create an office of good jobs \nwithin the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer. This office \nwould help ensure that the House's procurement and contracting \ndecisions encourage the creation of decently paid jobs, support \ncollective bargaining rights, and encourage responsible employment \npractices. Our amendment does nothing to alter existing procurement, \ndebarment, or contracting processes.\n  Right now, the U.S. Government is America's leading low-wage job \ncreator, funding over 2 million poverty jobs through contracts, loans, \nand grants in corporate America. That is more than the total number of \nlow-wage workers employed by Walmart and McDonald's combined.\n  Mr. Chairman, at this point, the Federal Government is leading the \nrace to the bottom through its processes and its failure to capitalize \non the procurement process. U.S. contract workers earn so little that \nnearly 40 percent use public assistance programs like food stamps and \nSection 8 to feed their families.\n  In other words, Mr. Chairman, because these jobs are paid so low that \nare funded by the Federal contracts, Uncle Sam has to subsidize these \npeople, working people, because they are not getting paid enough by the \nFederal contractors that employ them.\n  To add insult to injury, many of these low-wage U.S. contract workers \nare driven deeper into poverty because their employers steal their \nwages and break other Federal labor laws. Treating the people who work \nwith us here at the Capitol with dignity and respect is absolutely \nessential.\n  It is intended that the appropriation for the Office of the Chief \nAdministrative Officer be used to establish an Office of Good Jobs \naimed at ensuring that the Chief Administrative Officer's procurement \ndecisions encourage the creation of decently paid jobs, collective \nbargaining rights, and responsible employment practices. The office's \nstructure shall be substantially similar to the Centers for Faith-Based \nand Neighborhood Partnerships located within the Department of \nEducation, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of \nHomeland Security, Department of Health and Human Services, Department \nof Labor, Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department \nof Veterans Affairs, Department of State, Small Business \nAdministration, Environmental Protection Agency, Corporation for \nNational and Community Service, and U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I know Mr. Ellison is well-intended \nin\n\n[[Page H3652]]\n\nhis amendment. In fact, his amendment was offered during the House \ndebate on the Energy and Water Appropriations bill just recently, and \nit was rejected by an overwhelming majority on a bipartisan basis. In \nfact, the vote was 174-245. I know his intentions are well-meaning, and \nhe speaks well of the topic, but this amendment is no more appropriate \nin this context than it was previously. It ignores the fact that \nCongress operates an entirely different procurement system than other \nFederal agencies.\n  The House has an established procurement process that is in place to \nensure that all procurements are executed in a fair and a competitive \nmanner. The function of this amendment would only add additional time \nto an already sound procurement process.\n  I oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chair, I support my colleague's amendment.\n  The aim of this amendment is to create an office of good jobs for the \nHouse within the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer. This \noffice would help ensure that the House makes contracting and \nemployment decisions, encouraging the creation of decently paid jobs, \nimplementation of fair labor practices, and responsible employment \npractices.\n  As the legislative branch, we ought to be setting an example for the \nNation when it comes to contracting decisions. Members of Congress who \nare committed to creating good-paying jobs and supporting workers have \na chance with this amendment to see those values reflected right where \nwe work.\n  This office will help guide the legislative branch in making \nresponsible contracting and employment decisions and do right by the \ncountless men and women who help us perform the people's business each \nand every day.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment by voting ``yes.''\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I think this is a great example \nto show the openness of this process. In fact, this amendment was \noffered recently with the Energy and Water Appropriations bill and is \napplicable to be offered even here today. While I rise in opposition to \nthe gentleman's amendment, I think it is just a good example of \nbipartisanship and this open process, of an orderly structured process \nto get our job done here.\n  However, this amendment doesn't achieve what we would hope it would, \nand that is why I have to rise in opposition.\n  I mean, it is clear that vendors that do business with the House are \nalready reviewed against the GSA's excluding parties list, which \nincludes businesses that are then precluded from doing business with \nthe Federal Government for and, among other things, violating \nemployees' legal employment rights.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  As written, this amendment fails to do really much of anything. It \nhas no legislative effect. It fails to define what the office should \nexamine, where in the House of Representatives organizational structure \nthe office would reside, and what recourse, if any, a Member would have \nif he or she disagreed with a finding of the office.\n  Again, with that, I have to oppose the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, it is long past time, given this economy \nthat we have, for the Congress of the United States to prioritize good \njobs. The fact is that, if we have an agency, an office of good jobs \nmaking sure that everyone who we do business with is making sure that \nworkers are paid fairly, that they get every penny that they earn, and \nthat we are making sure that we prioritize good employers over the bad \nones, this is exactly what we should be doing. We live in a time of 40 \nyears of wage stagnation, and the Federal Government is deeply \nimplicated in this wage stagnation. The Federal Government, the U.S. \nCongress should do something about it.\n  Mr. Chairman, let me tell you about a friend of mine named Vee. Vee \nhas been a catering worker here at the House of Representatives for 27 \nyears. She is 67 years old. She says she has next to nothing for \nretirement. She jokes that she will be working until half an hour \nbefore her funeral. In Vee's own words: We aren't looking for a \nhandout; we are looking for a hand up.\n  No one who works for decades should be left without a secure \nretirement. Retirement insecurity isn't the only trouble she and her \ncolleagues face. Some of them don't get healthcare benefits from their \nemployer. Of the 50 catering workers serving Members and visitors to \nthe Hill, only about half have access to year-round health care.\n  We need to make it clear to current and future contractors that we \nwant them to put taxpayers' dollars in their contracts to use, taking \ncare of Americans who are working for them. This will help raise living \nstandards for all workers.\n  Let me tell you this, Mr. Chairman, when we see the Federal \nGovernment and we see State governments make good jobs the issue, the \nprivate sector falls in line. We have seen the Gap, even Walmart, \ntalking about raising issues. Why? Because President Obama signed an \nexecutive order to say that anyone who works for a Federal contractor \nhas to get paid at least $10.10 an hour. That kind of leadership is \nwhat makes the Federal Government not the leader in the race to the \nbottom but the leader in the race to the top.\n  Vote ``yes'' on my amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I am grateful for the \ngentleman's time tonight and taking time on this late evening to \nexpress his passion and zeal for workers all across this country. \nHowever, with that, because of his amendment and, as I mentioned, the \nimpact that it, in effect, really wouldn't have, I would have to oppose \nthe gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Blumenauer\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in House Report 114-611.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 17, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $100,000) (increased by $100,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman \nfrom Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, there is a bike share revolution that \nis spreading across America. Over 70 systems are now operating in 104 \ncities, including, next month, my hometown of Portland, Oregon. \nAtlanta's system opened today. This is an opportunity to provide the \nbicycle in a more convenient form, where people can rent by the half \nhour, by the hour, by the day.\n  We find that research shows that the bike share is safer than regular \nbicycles. There have been no fatalities recorded in more than 35 \nmillion trips around the country so far. It is cheaper. It is a \nhealthier form of transit. Low-cost memberships are available for low-\nincome populations, for example, in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia \nand Chicago.\n  The Nation's Capital is a model for bike share. Launched in 2010, \nthere are now over 350 stations around the D.C. area. Daily ridership \nis over 9,000. Bike share members report annual savings\n\n[[Page H3653]]\n\nof $700 to $800 a year due to riding the bike share.\n  My amendment suggests that it is time for the Architect of the \nCapitol to have the Capitol Grounds included in this process, requiring \na feasibility study on the installation and operation of bike share \nstations on the Capitol Grounds.\n  Right now, the nearest station to House Office Buildings is at the \nbottom of Capitol Hill, between the busy Independence Avenue and \nfreeway on-ramps. It is not convenient to our staff. It is not \nconvenient to the millions of visitors that come to Capitol Hill every \nyear. Thinking for a moment about the problems we have got now with the \nMetro maintenance, every person that takes a bike share is one more \nperson who is not on the road ahead of you or crowded into overcrowded \nfacilities.\n  I respectfully suggest that this amendment be adopted, that we have \n$100,000 within the Architect of the Capitol's budget to undertake this \nfeasibility study to improve the quality of life, the health, and \nmobility in and around this vital area of our Nation's Capital. It is \nunfortunate that this intense area of activity is underserved. This \namendment would help remedy that.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim \nthe time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I don't claim the time in \nopposition to speak against it. In fact, I am supportive of the \ngentleman's amendment, and I appreciate him bringing this forward. As a \ncyclist myself, I can tell you, I understand the importance of making \nsure, on a campus such as this or in a town such as this or an area \nsuch as this, that there is plenty of availability, and the bike share \nfacilities and locations are certainly around here, but we understand \nthat there are some absences or vacancies in spaces near to this \ncampus.\n  Saying all that, I do respect the Sergeant at Arms and the Capitol \nPolice and some of their concerns that they have expressed, and I would \nhope that, as the Architect moves forward with a study such as this, \nthat they would take those considerations into effect as well as they \nput their study together.\n  I thank the gentleman for his amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Blumenauer \namendment to request a feasibility study on the installation and \noperation of Capital Bikeshare stations on the Capitol Grounds. I would \nlike to thank Mr. Blumenauer for his bike-partisan leadership over the \nyears and for his work on this issue specifically. His passion for \ncycling is known to and appreciated by so many of us.\n  Mr. Chairman, Capital Bikeshare opened in 2010 in the District of \nColumbia and in Arlington, Virginia, which I am proud to represent. \nSince then, the system has grown steadily to include more than 350 \nstations. It has changed the way many people in this region travel. The \nU.S. Capitol receives millions of visitors every year, and millions \nmore visit our offices to talk about their issues and concerns. These \npeople are friends, families, and constituents. There are also guests \nof the United States from all over the world. Capital Bikeshare has \nbeen successful precisely because many of these visitors want to see \nour city up close, from the seat of a bicycle.\n  Expanding this very successful program to the Capitol Grounds is a \ngreat way to give tourists, local commuters, and our staffs an \nexcellent transportation alternative, not to mention the benefits the \nbicycle has on the environment, individual health, and traffic \ncongestion.\n  This need is especially great right now as the D.C.'s Metrorail \nsystem undergoes extensive, prolonged maintenance. This puts a real \nstrain on all the other modes of transportation in the city.\n  Capital Bikeshare is beloved by D.C. residents and visitors alike, \nand we should be setting a strong example by supporting the program and \nwelcoming stations in the place where we work, right here on the \nCapitol Grounds.\n  Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Blumenauer for his leadership and urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Welch\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 \nprinted in House Report 114-611.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 17, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $500,000)''.\n       Page 17, line 11, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $250,000)''.\n       Page 17, line 23, after the first dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $250,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman \nfrom Vermont (Mr. Welch) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Vermont.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here presenting this \namendment. My cosponsor of this amendment, Jaime Herrera Beutler, is \nunable to be here, but it is relevant. She had a baby 2 weeks ago--this \nis not her first child--and she is a breastfeeding mother.\n  This amendment is about creating the potential for the House Office \nBuildings and this Capitol to come into compliance with the General \nServices Administration guidelines for having breastfeeding stations \navailable for women who need them. There are 7,000 women who work here. \nThere are thousands of women who visit on a regular basis, and we don't \nhave the stations that the women who visit the Capitol, work in the \nCapitol, work in the House Office Buildings, or visit need to be here \nin order to take care of their infant children.\n  It is just amazing to me. Jaime Herrera Beutler is someone we all \nadmire. She can't be here--she wishes she was--but she is a big \nadvocate of this. What this amendment would do is not cost new money, \nbut it would allow a shift in money, $500,000, from the capital \nconstruction and operations account to the Capitol Building and House \nOffice Building accounts, appropriating $250,000 each.\n  The fact is, why wouldn't we want to be in compliance with the GSA \nrequirements as to the access to the breastfeeding stations for mothers \nwho work and visit here?\n  Mr. Chair, my hope is that there will be broad bipartisan support to \ndo something that I think all of us know needs to be done.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. WELCH. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman \nfor his thoughtful amendment. We are prepared to accept it, support it.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member of \nthe committee.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I join the chairman in \nsupporting the gentleman's amendment. This amendment would add \napproximately 30 lactation rooms to the Capitol complex. Working \nmothers rely on these rooms--and I can speak from experience--to ensure \nthat they can continue to work while breastfeeding their children.\n  This amendment rightfully recognizes that Congress must lead by \nexample to ensure that women can be both moms and leaders in their \nfield. In fact, my own office right now is serving as a lactation room, \nand that is because one of my wonderful staff is a nursing mom.\n  While I am happy to do that, it is our responsibility to maintain an \nenvironment where all of our employees feel comfortable, including \nworking mothers. Our staff deserves to feel welcome\n\n[[Page H3654]]\n\nand secure when they are ready to return to work. We should be doing \neverything we can to encourage working moms to return to the workplace, \nand it must start here on Capitol Hill.\n  As we all know, the offices in which we work are inadequate for moms \nto pump. Our staff is many to an office with open-air cubicles. Having \nlactation rooms is mandatory, essential, if we want to keep talented \nwomen in the workplace.\n  I want to thank the gentleman for offering this amendment. I urge its \nsupport and appreciate the chairman's support.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Graves. I \nappreciate his support of this amendment. I also want to thank the \nranking member for her support. I also thank my cosponsors, \nCongresswoman Matsui and Congresswoman Frankel, but I especially want \nto thank and congratulate Congresswoman Herrera Beutler.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Congressman Welch for his \nleadership on this common sense amendment.\n  Working mothers are driving our economy forward. Two out of every \nthree women are the sole or equal breadwinner in their households. Many \nof these women are juggling the responsibilities of caring for their \nchildren and supporting their family.\n  Having workplaces that accommodate the needs of our hard working \nAmerican mothers makes our economy stronger. Businesses across the \ncountry have made important improvements in their work place standards \nfor women. And the Federal government has too. In fact, the General \nServices Administration now requires that federal buildings have \nlactation stations for breastfeeding mothers.\n  But here in the U.S. Capitol we are not living up to these \nstandards--at the expense of the thousands of women who work in the \nCapitol and the millions of women who pass through these grounds every \nday. We need to make working mothers' ability to contribute to our \neconomy easier, not harder.\n  This amendment simply brings the House of Representatives into \ncompliance with existing laws already on the books and would not \nrequire any new funding. It is a common sense step forward for working \nmothers.\n  Our Capitol is a symbol of our democracy and should set the highest \nexample for the American people. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment which makes our Capitol more welcoming to all.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in House Report 114-611.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mrs. Blackburn\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in House Report 114-611.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Each amount made available by this Act is \n     hereby reduced by 1 percent.\n       (b) The reduction in subsection (a) shall not apply with \n     respect to--\n       (1) accounts under the heading ``Capitol Police'';\n       (2) ``Architect of the Capitol--Capitol Police Buildings, \n     Grounds and Security''; or\n       (3) the amount provided for salaries and expenses of the \n     Office of the Sergeant at Arms under the heading ``House of \n     Representatives--Salaries, Officers and Employees''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking the \ncommittee for the hard work that they have put into this bill and for \nthe way the House has approved reducing our budget over the last \nseveral years. If every department of the Federal Government were to be \nas active as we were in reducing our spending, our budget would be in \nbetter shape.\n  This bill provides a net total of $3.482 billion in fiscal year 2017 \nbase discretionary budget authority. That is $153 million below the \nPresident's budget request, $73 million above the enacted 2016 level, \nand $140 million above the level proposed by the Appropriations \nCommittee for fiscal year 2016.\n  However, I think there is more work that needs to be done. And thus, \nas I do for most of our appropriations bills, I am here with my 1 \npercent across-the-board spending reduction amendment.\n  It would reduce discretionary budget authority by $31 million and \noutlays by $28 million. It exempts the Capitol Police, the Architect of \nthe Capitol, Capitol Police Buildings, Grounds and Security, and the \nSergeant at Arms.\n  I am certainly aware that there is opposition to doing the penny-on-\na-dollar cut. I have heard many times that cuts like this are damaging \nand we shouldn't do them, but I think that cutting an extra penny on \nevery dollar not only goes to putting us on a better track, it helps to \npreserve our Nation's sovereignty for future generations.\n  When we have $19.2 trillion in debt, our constituents are saying: \nWhat are you going to do about this?\n  Well, here is an action that we can take: making a penny-on-a-dollar \ncut and saving ourselves some more money--$31 million--that will help \nto send the right message that, again, we are going to cut a little bit \nmore, just as the families in our districts are doing.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this \namendment, as it takes a meat-ax approach to cutting this bill by $31 \nmillion with an across-the-board cut of 1 percent.\n  The amendment exempts the Capitol Police and its buildings, as well \nas the Sergeant at Arms. It does not exempt our staff, including the \nofferer's own staff because it would cut the Members' Representational \nAllowance. It would also cut the Congressional Research Service, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, the Congressional Budget Office, \ncommittees of Congress, and the Office of Compliance.\n  The Legislative Branch bill, Mr. Chairman, has been flat for 3 years. \nAnd this bill finally provides a modest overall increase of 2.1 \npercent, but because we have not kept up with inflation, each year we \nare buying less and less for our dollar. The Congressional Research \nService, for example, is still below FY 2010 levels and reports it has \nlost 13 percent of its purchasing power.\n  We can't continue to do more with less. There is a reason the \nperception of Congress is damaged. We are damaging our ability to write \nand analyze legislation and have serious debates because we take the \npolitically expedient route, like the across-the-board cuts, because \nthey play well during town halls. But if we bothered to explain the \nbrain drain within the halls of Congress and the need to boost funding \nfor staff to do oversight, I have the belief that our constituents \nwould understand that.\n  If Members want a strong legislative branch to ensure oversight of \nthe executive, this amendment should be defeated.\n  The cut to the MRA is one of the most egregious that would result \nfrom this amendment. I happen to think my staff contributes to the \nwell-being of my constituents and are worth every penny we can afford \nto pay them after years of cuts to the MRA. The MRA is $97 million less \nthan it was in fiscal year 2010. This amendment would cut $5.6 million \nmore.\n  Mr. Chairman, you get the government you pay for, and I fear that \nthis amendment would do nothing more than hurt the service we are able \nto provide to our constituents.\n  I urge defeat of the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I will have to say that people do like \nacross-the-board cuts. Indeed, many governors, Republican and Democrat \nalike, use these. From coast-to-coast, they have used these. And our \nconstituents like them.\n  Take a look at the December 2012 POLITICO-George Washington \nUniversity Battleground Tracking Poll. It shows 75 percent approve of \nthem. January 2013, The Hill, 6-in-10 approve. Look at what happened in \nOklahoma in December: a 3 percent across-the-board cut. In March, they \ndid a 4 percent across-the-board cut.\n\n[[Page H3655]]\n\n  Why is it that our governors do these?\n  They work. Department heads like to be able to go in there and find a \nway to cut a little bit more in that budget and still meet the needs \nthat the people have said they want to see their government meet.\n  We have $19.3 trillion in debt. We are working to get the cost of \ngovernment down, but we have to do a little bit more. This is a way to \nengage rank-and-file Federal employees and to say to them: It is time \nfor us to get our fiscal house in order.\n  A penny on the dollar is what our constituents are doing. We should \ndo likewise. It is what our States are doing, because they can't crank \nthe printing press. They can't go borrow money. They can't have more of \nour debt that is owned by China and Japan and OPEC and the entities \nthat own our debt. They have to have balanced budget amendments. When I \nwas in the Tennessee State Senate, we didn't go home until we had the \nbudget in balance.\n  So I would encourage support of this amendment. It is a penny out of \na dollar. It is another $31 million in savings.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, as I said, this bill has already \ntaken hit after hit. We are far below the levels that we were at in \n2010. We have employees who deserve to be assured that we have enough \nrespect for their professionalism that we are going to adequately fund \ntheir ability to do their jobs, which is to represent our constituents.\n  This amendment takes, as I said, a meat-ax approach rather than what \nthe chairman and I worked together to do, which is to develop the \nsubstantive portions of this bill related to the funding of the \nlegislative branch in a precisionlike way.\n  It doesn't make sense. I have never heard of polling that actually \nasks generic questions of constituents on whether they like or dislike \nacross-the-board cuts. I am not sure what the purpose of electing \nMembers of Congress is if we are going to just make indiscriminate, \nacross-the-board decisions rather than use our brains and build \nconsensus around the decisions that we make.\n  That is the type of approach that this amendment would take, and it \nis inappropriate. We need to make sure that we are adequately funding \nthe legislative branch functions so that we can represent our \nconstituents effectively.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, the American people think they have \ntaken hit after hit. And they have taken it right in the wallet. They \nare sick and tired of this. They feel like this economy has taken a \nmeat-ax approach to their well-being. What they want to see is \nleadership that will work to get our spending habits under control here \nin Washington.\n  This is a great opportunity to lead by example and to say: A penny on \nthe dollar, we are going to do it for the children and for future \ngenerations.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, the American people are \nappreciative and understand that we have been through 75 straight \nmonths of private sector job growth, that we have added 20 million \npeople who didn't have health insurance before and who are now able to \ngo to the doctor when they are sick, that we have cut the deficit by \nnearly three-quarters, and that we have made progress. And we need to \ncontinue to build on that progress and help more Americans have an \nopportunity to reach the middle class.\n  All of those things were accomplished through funding the legislative \nbranch. And we need to appropriately fund it, adequately fund it, so we \ncan effectively represent our constituents.\n  I urge defeat of this ill-advised amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee \nwill be postponed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in House Report 114-611.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Could the Chair inform the committee of what \nthe intentions are tonight, about how many amendments we would move \nforward and how many for tomorrow?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair has just announced that amendment No. 7 \nis now in order.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I have an additional parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair would be prepared to entertain a motion \nto rise.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now \nrise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nAmodei) having assumed the chair, Mr. Byrne, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5325) \nmaking appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, had come to no \nresolution thereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3655-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3655-H3658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CELEBRATING PRIDE MONTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Byrne).

It is a chance to \nhonor the trailblazers and leaders that have contributed so much to the \nlives of LGBT individuals worldwide. And it gives us the space to \nremind one another that we are all humans, deserving of dignity, \nacceptance, and equal treatment.\n  The LGBT community, along with allies like myself, have fought to see \nthe end of discriminatory laws and policies. We have applauded as \nsociety itself opens its arms. And we have watched as more and more \nLGBT ``firsts'' make their mark in public service, Hollywood, and every \ncorner of our world.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  From the Stonewall riots that set the stage for the pride \ncelebrations that we have today, to the end of ``Don't Ask, Don't \nTell'' in our Armed Forces, to the landmark Supreme Court decision in \nObergefell v. Hodges, to the recent confirmation of the very first gay \nman to serve as Secretary of the Army, we have made clear, forward \nprogress.\n  But even as we celebrate the countless achievements of the past few \nyears, we must also acknowledge the continuing uphill battle for LGBT \nequality. This year has seen a deeply painful wave of laws passed by \nState legislatures and aimed at legalizing blatant discrimination \nagainst the LGBT communities.\n  There have been recent upticks in transgender violence and, just last \nweek, a disgraceful move by a few Members on the other side of the \naisle\n\n[[Page H3656]]\n\nto prevent the passage of an amendment that sought to prevent \ndiscrimination. That reminded us that we still have quite a bit of work \nto do.\n  That is why my colleagues and I support legislation like the Student \nNon-Discrimination Act, or the Safe Schools Improvement Act, or the \nEquality Act. That is why I remain committed to making sure that we \neliminate every form of discrimination in our society.\n  Who you are and who you love shouldn't affect which jobs you are \neligible for, who serves you in a restaurant, how much you make at \nwork, or anything else about your life.\n  In a Nation founded upon the principles of personal freedom and \nindividual rights, the word ``equality'' carries great weight. It \nshould mean equal treatment, respect, and access, regardless of race, \ngender, education, income, sexual orientation, with no exceptions. And \nas a LGBT ally, I am determined to make that vision a reality.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to present these few \nwords on behalf of a community that has suffered so many discrimination \nattempts, so much disharmony, so many harmful experiences. Yet, this is \na community of healthy, helpful, brilliant and introductory \nindividuals.\n  We must make sure that this society, our society, our House, this \ngreat America, stands firm for the equal opportunity of all people; \nthat it should have nothing to do with who we love or what our gender \nidentity is. It should be what do we have to offer to make our society \na better and healthy one.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Texas (Mr. Al Green).\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for \nyielding the time. I would like to thank the leadership for allowing \nthe time. And, Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my staff and the many \nmembers of the LGBT Caucus for helping us to produce H. Res. 772. This \nis the original LGBTQ Pride Month resolution, and I am very proud that \npersons have signed onto this resolution, so I want to thank all of the \ncosponsors, original cosponsors of the resolution.\n  I am grateful that the President of the United States has recognized \nPride Month. President Obama has taken quantum leaps forward in helping \nus to realize this notion that all persons are created equal and \nendowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, and among \nthem, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This is what Pride \nMonth is really all about, these inalienable rights.\n  I am proud to align myself and proud to call myself an ally of the \nLGBT community. I am an ally of this community for many reasons. I \nwould like to just share a few.\n  I have suffered invidious discrimination. I know what it is like to \nbe decided as one who should stand in a different line. I know what it \nis like to be required to drink from the Colored water fountain. I know \nwhat it is like to be required to sit in a different area in a theater. \nI know what it is like to have to ride in a certain place on a bus.\n  I have felt the sting of invidious discrimination, and my history \ndictates that I stand against invidious discrimination in any form \nagainst whomever. My history requires that I be where I am when it \ncomes to helping others who are being discriminated against.\n  So I am proud to have this resolution that we have presented, and I \nam proud to have presented it because there is still great work to be \ndone. We still have 28 States that allow someone to be fired for being \ngay, lesbian, or bisexual. No one should be fired because of who you \nhappen to be. Your performance should determine your position in a \nplace of work.\n  Unfortunately, in our country, we still have people who will look at \nsomeone and conclude that that person should not work in a certain \nposition.\n  Dr. King reminded us that it was the content of character that \ndetermines the worth of a people, not what they look like, not what you \nthink they may have as a preference in life, the content of character.\n  People should be judged upon their merits. They should ascend on \nmerits, and they should fail on demerits, not what they look like or \nwhat you think their preferences are.\n  Twenty-eight States still allow people to be fired based upon what \nsomeone thinks about their sexuality, or if they should happen to \nannounce their sexuality. Thirty States still allow someone to be fired \nfor being trans.\n  How people behave, as long as they are obeying the law, should not be \na means by which you can fire them. People have every right to be \nthemselves.\n  To all of those who are heterosexual, as am I, we should think about \nwhat it would be like for us to have to pretend to be something other \nthan that we are. People ought not to have to pretend or hide their \nsexuality.\n  I was very proud to see ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' fall because people \nought to be able to ask and to tell who they are and what their \npreferences are. This ought not be something that we ought to, somehow, \nimpose upon people as a shame. People should be proud of what God has \nmade them to be, and they ought to be able to share that with the \nworld. All persons created equal, endowed by their Creator, with \ncertain inalienable rights; that includes people who happen to be a \npart of the LGBTQ community.\n  We still have 28 States that don't include the protections for \nsexuality under housing discrimination laws; people just evicted \nbecause someone concludes something about their sexuality. You ought \nnot be evicted because of discrimination related to your sexuality.\n  There was a time in this country when females could not vote, a time \nwhen they couldn't own land, a time when they had to have a husband to \nacquire certain status in this country. But we have gone beyond that.\n  We should get beyond this notion that people should not have fair and \nequality with reference to housing in the greatest country in the \nworld. And I still say it is the greatest country in the world. I \nunderstand we have these problems, but I believe that people ought to \nreceive housing based upon behavior, not based upon what you think of \nthem.\n  We still have, in this country, 30 States that lack housing \nprotections for being trans. Again, what people think of you should not \ndetermine where you will be housed.\n\n  I am proud that President Obama, as I indicated earlier, has helped \nus move forward in this area and in many other areas, because it was on \nhis watch that the Supreme Court of the United States required that all \nStates recognize same-sex marriages, and that they issue licenses to \nsame-sex couples. This was a Supreme Court, but it was a Supreme Court \nthat this President had an impact on.\n  I am proud that, under this President, we have had the downing of \nDOMA, the notion that you can discriminate against same-sex couples \nwith their benefits. This President has helped us move forward in areas \nthat were taboo prior to his watch, and I believe that President Obama \nis going to be rewarded by history for his efforts to ensure that all \npersons are created equal. I am very proud that the Supreme Court has \ntaken other steps to make sure that equality exists among people.\n  But finally, as it relates to President Obama, let me just say that \nhis latest effort to make sure that the military lives up to the \nstandards that we believe should allow every person to serve in the \ncapacity that they were born into is a remarkable one.\n  I think his appointing Eric Fanning as the first Secretary of the \nArmy, a person who is openly gay, was probably one of the most \nsignificant things that he has done because this is a means by which \npeople relate to the country. People who serve in the military are held \nin high esteem. People who work with the military are held in high \nesteem. People who serve as Secretaries are held in high esteem, and I \nthank the President for this very bold and courageous move.\n  So we are very proud to have this resolution on the floor recognizing \nPride Month, and we do so because, in my opinion, every month ought to \nbe Pride Month. We ought not have a single month that we do this. But \nuntil we can overcome some of these greater adversities that are yet to \nbe dealt with, I think we have to continue to celebrate Pride Month.\n  I am honored to do this tonight with my colleague, and I thank the \ngentlewoman for the time. I want to assure the gentlewoman that H. Res. \n772, the\n\n[[Page H3657]]\n\noriginal LGBTQ Pride Month resolution, while it will not pass this \nCongress, I want to assure the gentlewoman that, in our lifetimes, this \nresolution will pass a Congress of the United States of America because \nthe Congress of the United States of America is metamorphosing. It, \ntoo, is coming to realize that we have to recognize the words of the \nDeclaration of Independence; that all persons doesn't mean all people \nof a certain gender; doesn't mean all persons of a certain hue; doesn't \nmean all persons who happen to be from a certain place. It literally \nmeans what it says; all persons are created equal, and that all people \nare endowed by the Creator with these inalienable rights, and that we \nmust bring the LGBTQ community within the purview of all that others \nenjoy and take for granted as a matter of course.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for the time.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his \neloquent and inspiring words and encouragement. And I, too, think that \nthis is a metamorphosing body, and I just pray sooner than later.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for \nyielding. Thank you, Representative Watson Coleman, for leading us in \nthis Special Order that is so significant.\n  I stand with many in lending my voice on behalf of the LGBT community \nin the 20th Congressional District of New York, and across the map of \nNew York for that matter, and across the Nation.\n  We mark Pride Month each year as an opportunity to celebrate the \nsteps that have been taken in the fight for justice, the fight for \nequality and civil rights for our friends and neighbors in the LGBTQ \ncommunity.\n  As we reflect on victories, I believe it is critical that we \nacknowledge the challenges before us; challenges like archaic bathroom \nlaws that conjure up the ghosts of segregation and separate water \nfountains; challenges like that of Supreme Court Chief Justices who \nrefuse to obey rulings from the Supreme Court when the highest court \ndictates that marriage equality is indeed the law of the land; \nchallenges like initiatives that are borne out of fear, out of bigotry, \nand out of misunderstanding; and even in Washington, D.C., large \nroutine appropriations bills that fail because one side of the aisle \nsimply cannot support an amendment that ensures taxpayer dollars are \nnot awarded to small businesses that, indeed, discriminate. These \nactions hurt each and every one of us.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  When my LGBT friends are robbed of opportunity that hurts my \ncommunity and local economies in New York's Capital Region, there needs \nto be a voice expressed. When LGBT kids are bullied, that teaches those \nwho witness the act that it is okay to diminish the humanity of those \nthat may be different from us.\n  These challenges are, unfortunately, a natural reaction to the \nmassive strides we have taken in a short couple of years on the way \ntoward equality. That does not make it acceptable, and we must work \ntogether to stamp out discrimination of any kind wherever and however \nit may exist.\n  Martin Luther King, Jr., has famously said: ``The arc of the moral \nuniverse is long, but it bends toward justice.''\n  That is where we are headed. We will get there sooner if we embrace \nthe ideals of tolerance, of togetherness, and certainly of inclusion.\n  Another civil rights giant, our friend and our colleague, Congressman \nJohn Lewis of Georgia, spoke words that I will never forget. He said: \n``Make good trouble.''\n  That is exactly what we must do during Pride Month and every month \nuntil our goals are achieved.\n  I thank the Congressional LGBT Caucus and its leadership for \nassembling us here today. Let's take this opportunity to recommit \nourselves to the noble and simple goal that everyone--that is \neveryone--has a shot at the American Dream regardless of their creed, \nregardless of their color, and regardless of their sexual orientation \nand identity.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to share thoughts this \nevening, and I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from \nNew York for his words and for taking the time to share what I think is \na very important issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of \nCalifornia (Ms. Loretta Sanchez), my colleague.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank \nthe gentlewoman from New Jersey for reserving this hour of time for us \nto talk about something that is incredibly important, the LGBTQ Pride \nMonth.\n  It is just remarkable to look back just in the time that I have been \nhere in the Congress to see the equality that has come about in these \nyears. Just 8 years ago, in my home State of California, there was a \nproposition to prohibit gay marriage, and it passed. When proposition 8 \npassed, it was really heartbreaking for not only California's LGBTQ \ncommunity and its allies, but really for our families because, quite \nhonestly, every family in some way or another is connected. We have \nfamily members who belong to the LGBT community.\n  But we didn't let this be a setback to us. Like other Americans, \nLGBTQ Californians believed that they deserved equality under the eyes \nof the law. So in July of 2013, the Supreme Court finally struck down \ncore components of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act law that was passed \nright before I got to the Congress. This important ruling made \nproposition 8 null and void, returning marriage equality back to my \ngreat State of California.\n  Last year, the Supreme Court guaranteed an individual's right to \nmarry whomever they love regardless of sex. The Supreme Court \nrecognized what we have known for a long time, that it is wrong to \ndeprive citizens of the right to marry the loves of their lives. They \nrecognize that to do so would be to treat same-sex couples like second \nclass citizens. Equality, fairness, and love won in the highest court \nof this Nation.\n  In our military, LGBTQ servicemembers have also achieved remarkable \nprogress towards equality and ending anti-LGBTQ discrimination. Just 5 \nyears ago, an LGBTQ American could not proudly serve their country in \nthe military. But since the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, our LGBTQ \nservicemembers are now able to serve openly in our military. What a \ngreat day.\n  While we celebrate this extraordinary progress, we also have to \nrecognize that we still have a ways to go. There are many States in our \ncountry where you can be fired from your job simply because you are \ngay. Across the country and in Congress, we are still seeing \ndiscrimination, discrimination, discrimination. Under our current laws, \nLGBTQ Americans aren't guaranteed the vital protections against \ndiscrimination. That is why I am a proud sponsor of the Equality Act. \nIt is time for Congress to pass this essential civil rights \nlegislation.\n  So, once again, I want to thank my colleague from New Jersey for \ncelebrating today and to understand that regardless of sexual \norientation, all Americans deserve life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier). \nCongresswoman Speier is another colleague from the great State of \nCalifornia.\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for giving me the \nopportunity to speak today about LGBT Pride Month.\n  Pride Month is coming at a crucial time this year. While we have made \nhuge strides in the LGBT community over the last few years--from \nmarriage equality to the introduction of the Equality Act--this year \nhas been a tragic and frustrating reminder of the terrain ahead.\n  Congress has ground to a halt, from legislative appropriations to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, as too many conservatives remain \nobsessed with legalizing discrimination from the contracting system to \nour own bathrooms. They just can't help themselves.\n\n[[Page H3658]]\n\n  We can't do our job right now, and soon we will be leaving for \nelection season without finishing the appropriations process all \nbecause conservatives are obsessed with making discrimination legal. \nThat's right. They want to make discrimination legal.\n  Who are they trying to serve?\n  The American people and corporate America are not standing for this \nbigoted behavior. Corporations around the country are canceling \nconventions in States that have passed legislation that prevents \ntransgender bathrooms from being available.\n  At the entryway to my congressional office stands a California flag \nbearing the rainbow stripes of the LGBT movement. It is a mark of how \nfar we have come that such a flag is now commonplace on Capitol Hill, \nbut on this Pride Month, conservatives are debating how best to \noverturn anti-discrimination provisions and bar their own constituents \nfrom using the restroom. This is absolutely ridiculous, and, frankly, a \ntragic nadir in congressional action.\n  I am sick and tired of my colleagues saying they oppose \ndiscrimination, that they are fighting for LGBT Americans, and that \nthey support equality when time and again they have voted just the \nopposite way.\n  How about instead of bickering about bathrooms, we look at passing \ntrue anti-discrimination laws?\n  Right now we don't have laws preventing housing, credit, workplace, \nor healthcare discrimination. We have lifted the ban on LGBT military \nservice, but our transgender servicemembers continue to serve in the \nshadows, never knowing if this will be the day they are dismissed. Now \nis the time to ban so-called gay conversion therapy that harms so many \nof our children.\n  Californians, and especially my beloved San Franciscans, have always \nbeen at the forefront of this fight for equality. As San Francisco \nSupervisor Harvey Milk said when he became one of the first openly gay \nelected officials, gay children who weren't accepted by their parents \nand peers used to feel they had few options: ``staying in the closet; \nsuicide. And then one day that child might open a paper that says, \n`Homosexual elected in San Francisco.' ''\n  That is what Harvey did many decades ago. One option is to go to \nCalifornia, he said, and the other is to stay and fight.\n  That is the fighting spirit we need to keep alive today as we work to \nmake sure our laws live up to the promise of the Declaration of \nIndependence, that all of us, each and every one of us, is created \nequal and that we should be treated that way.\n  So I thank my colleague again for giving us the opportunity to have \nthis Special Order to talk about Pride Month and the importance of not \njust being proud that there is a Pride Month, but redoubling our \nefforts to make sure that these really insidious amendments are not \nslipped into bills to enforce discrimination. Because that is what they \ndo. They legalize discrimination. We don't stand for that. That is not \nwhat this body is about, and that is not what this country is about.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia for her wise and compassionate concern and sharing of \ninformation.\n  I want to remind us that there are so many vestiges of discrimination \nagainst the LGBT community, not the least of which is also denying them \naccess to public accommodations. This isn't what this country stands \nfor. This isn't who we are. We are better than that. So I am glad to \nhave this opportunity to highlight some of our issues and concerns and \nthe support that we have for the LGBT community.\n  For everyone, anyone, and all of us celebrating this month, I wish \nyou a happy Pride Month.\n  Mr. Speaker, I conclude my Special Order hour, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3658-1", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Payne (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today and June 10 on \naccount of business in district.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/house-section/article/H3658-2", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3658-H3661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY MATERIAL\n\n\nupdated status report on current spending levels of on-budget spending \n and revenues for fy2016 and the 10-year period fy2016, through fy2025\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2016.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: To facilitate application of sections 302 \n     and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, I am transmitting an \n     updated status report on the current levels of on-budget \n     spending and revenues for fiscal year 2016, and for the 10-\n     year period of fiscal years 2016 through 2025. This status \n     report is current through June 6, 2016. The term ``current \n     level'' refers to the amounts of spending and revenues \n     estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted or \n     awaiting the President's signature.\n       Table 1 in the report compares the current levels of total \n     budget authority, outlays, and revenues to the overall \n     limits, as adjusted, contained in the conference report on S. \n     Con. Res. 11, as agreed to on May 5, 2015, for fiscal year \n     2016, and for the 10-year period of fiscal years 2016 through \n     2025. This comparison is needed to implement section 311(a) \n     of the Congressional Budget Act, which creates a point of \n     order against measures that would breach the budget \n     resolution's aggregate levels. The table does not show budget \n     authority and outlays for years after fiscal year 2016 \n     because appropriations for those years have not yet been \n     completed.\n       Table 2 compares the current levels of budget authority and \n     outlays for legislative action completed by each authorizing \n     committee with the limits contained in the conference report \n     on S. Con. Res. 11, as agreed to on May 5, 2015, for fiscal \n     year 2016 and for the 10-year period of fiscal years 2016 \n     through 2025. For fiscal year 2016 and the 10-year period of \n     fiscal years 2016 through 2025, ``legislative action'' refers \n     to legislation enacted after the adoption of the levels set \n     forth in the conference agreement on S. Con. Res. 11. This \n     comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act, which creates a point of order \n     against measures that would breach the section 302(a) \n     allocation of new budget authority for the committee that \n     reported the measure. It is also needed to implement section \n     311(b), which exempts committees that comply with their \n     allocations from the point of order under section 311(a).\n       Table 3 compares the current status of discretionary \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2016 with the ``section \n     302(b)'' suballocations of discretionary budget authority and \n     outlays among Appropriations subcommittees. The comparison is \n     needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget \n     Act because the point of order under that section equally \n     applies to measures that would breach the applicable section \n     302(b) suballocation. The table also provides supplementary \n     information on spending in excess of the base discretionary \n     spending limits allowed under section 251(b) of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act.\n       Table 4 compares the levels of changes in mandatory \n     programs (CHIMPs) contained in appropriations acts with the \n     permissible limits on CHIMPs as specified in sections 3103 \n     and 3104 of S. Con. Res. 11. The comparison is needed to \n     enforce a point of order established in S. Con.
