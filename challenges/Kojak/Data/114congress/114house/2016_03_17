STANTON II\n\n  (Mr. CRAWFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, as co-chairman of the Congressional \nExplosive Ordnance Disposal Caucus, today I rise to honor the life and \nservice of Gunnery Sergeant Michael D. Stanton II, United States Marine \nCorps, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Retired.\n  A native of St. Louis, Missouri, Gunny Stanton was born on January \n27, 1963, and passed on February 6, 2016, in Dunedin, Florida.\n  At the start of his career, Gunny Stanton was a telephone technician, \nbut he soon took those technical skills and put them to work as an \nexplosive ordnance disposal technician. When Gunny Stanton first began \nhis training, he attended the basic EOD course at Eglin Air Force Base. \nWhile in training, his block tests and final examination scores were so \nhigh that his records remain intact to this day.\n  In the course of his 18 years in the Marine Corps, Stanton earned \nmany awards too numerous to list in this space. He is preceded in death \nby his father, Michael Dale Stanton Sr.; and a brother, Brian Stanton. \nGunny Stanton is survived by his loving family: his wife, Terri \nStanton; his mother, Gloria Mueller; and a brother, Timothy Stanton.\n  While I know that his family and friends will remember him in their \nown personal way, I would like all of us here in the House of \nRepresentatives to remember him as a courageous leader and a fine \nmarine who each day bravely faced the challenges inherent in the life \nof an explosive ordnance disposal technician.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/house-section/article/H1421-7", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1421-H1422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IMMIGRANTS ARE PART OF AMERICA'S BACKBONE\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, later today House Republicans will forward a \nresolution authorizing the Speaker to file an anti-immigrant amicus \nbrief with the Supreme Court.\n  While Speaker Ryan has called for a vote, House Republicans refuse to \nreveal what the plan may say; but then again, given House Republicans' \nextensive record on anti-immigrant actions, little is left to the \nimagination.\n  Time and time again, GOP leadership has failed to bring a \ncomprehensive immigration reform vote to the floor. Instead, they have \nfavored deporting DREAMers. They have done all they can to undermine \nPresident Obama's executive actions on immigration.\n  Later this week, this gimmick that they are proposing will do nothing \nto\n\n[[Page H1422]]\n\nfix our broken immigration system. Instead, it sends a message that the \nGOP intends to continue confining hardworking immigrants and their \nfamilies to the shadows. Families who currently live in fear of \ndeportation should be afforded the opportunity to fully contribute to \nthe only country they call home.\n  As 5 million DACA/DAPA-eligible immigrants anxiously await the \nCourt's final decision, I remind my House Republican colleagues that \nimmigrants are part of America's backbone, and their contributions \nshould not be discounted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/house-section/article/H1422-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FRIVOLOUS ADA LAWSUITS ARE FLOODING OUR COUNTRY\n\n  (Mr. CONAWAY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to a wave \nof frivolous lawsuits flooding my district. These lawsuits use the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, a law that has done tremendous good in \nour Nation, as legal cover to sue small mom-and-pop businesses for \noften unnoticed and easily correctible ADA violations.\n  Businesses that have passed local inspections are often unaware that \nany ADA violation exists until a lawsuit arrives in their mailbox. \nInstead of demanding the violation be fixed, these lawsuits try to make \na quick buck by settling out of court. The businesses have little \nchoice: pay the settlement or pay expensive business-ending attorney \nfees to fight the charge.\n  Often these attorneys, as in my district, don't even live in the \nState. Some use Google Earth to find violations and then file these \nlawsuits remotely. This is wrong. It takes advantage of the ADA, those \nwith disabilities, and small businesses that thought they were in \ncompliance.\n  That is why I have cosponsored the ADA Education and Reform Act, \nwhich we believe will fix this problem. I will work to get this bill \npassed so west Texans won't be abused by predatory attorneys who care \nmore about money than helping those with disabilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/house-section/article/H1422-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FREE SPEECH IS UNDER ASSAULT IN TURKEY\n\n  (Mr. PERRY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, free speech and the freedom of the press are \nunder assault in Turkey.\n  No longer can the United States turn a blind eye as an increasingly \nauthoritarian regime continues to crack down on virtually all critical \nvoices. The harassment, intimidation, and prosecution of dissenting \njournalists and citizens as well as the government takeover of critical \nmedia outlets represents the antithesis of free speech and a free \npress. These are not the actions of a nation that respects democratic \nvalues.\n  Beyond the obvious consequences, by continuing on this path, the \nregime risks destabilization and pushing the persecuted into the arms \nof Islamist extremism.

His constituents knew they \nhad a friend in Congressman Coble. I work every day to live up to that \nexample.\n  Howard's 85th birthday would have been tomorrow.

RES. 639, AUTHORIZING THE SPEAKER TO \n             APPEAR AS AMICUS CURIAE ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSE\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I \ncall up House Resolution 649 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nof the House have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their \nremarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule, \nwhich will provide for consideration of House Resolution 639. I believe \nthe underlying resolution is imperative to protecting the balance of \npower that our Founders so carefully enshrined in the United States \nConstitution.\n  I would also like to point out that the House Committee on Rules held \nan original jurisdiction hearing and markup yesterday in which we \nreceived testimony and consideration of an amendment from the minority.\n  Mr. Speaker, over 25 States or State officials have filed suit \nchallenging the Obama administration's expansion of DACA and the \ncreation of DACA-like programs for aliens who are parents of U.S. \ncitizens or lawful permanent residents.\n\n[[Page H1423]]\n\n  On February 16, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas entered and the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Fifth Circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction prohibiting further \nimplementation of these programs on the ground that States are likely \nto prevail in their argument for the programs that have run afoul of \nthe law.\n  The Supreme Court indicated that they will begin hearing oral \narguments on United States v. Texas in April of 2016 and that it will \nconsider the plaintiffs' claims under the Take Care Clause. Because of \nthis timely consideration by the highest court in the land, it is \nimperative that the House consider this underlying resolution.\n  I want to make it very clear that this resolution is not about \npolicy. If you spoke with every single Member of this body, you would \nfind a wide spectrum of opinions regarding how to handle the estimated \n11 million illegal immigrants currently residing in the United States \nunlawfully. This resolution is not about those viewpoints. It is about \nthe fundamental separation of power ingrained in our founding document, \nthe Constitution.\n  Article I, section 8 gives Congress, not the President, the authority \n``to establish a uniform rule of naturalization.'' The administration \nsimply cannot ignore certain statutes and selectively enforce others or \nbypass the legislative process to create laws for executive fiat.\n  This administration has failed in its duty under Article II, section \n3 of the Constitution of the United States to take care that the laws \nbe faithfully executed, and the Supreme Court has specifically \nindicated that it will consider the plaintiffs' claims under the Take \nCare Clause. Clearly, the Court views this case as an important review \nof Article I and Article II issues and the balance of power between the \nbranches.\n\n                              {time}  0915\n\n  For that reason, and that reason alone, the United States House of \nRepresentatives is uniquely suited to speak to this underlying question \nthat has been raised by the court.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank \nthe gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Republicans in the House can't agree on a budget. \nThey take futile vote after futile vote to kill ObamaCare. They waste \nmillions of dollars and thousands of hours on the futility. Children \nare drinking lead-tainted water from aging pipes crisscrossing the \ncountry. Young people are saddled with crushing student loan debt. \nBridges are crumbling. Our schools are falling apart. Obviously, the \nMetro system in Washington is in serious condition. Our airports are \nstruggling to function, and we have no high-speed rail.\n  But what do we do here? We vote 64 times to take health care away \nfrom people. We have Benghazi hearings, which come to nothing. We have \nhad eight in the House. Many chairs of those committees have said there \nis nothing there, so we set up a Select Committee to look at it again \nand spend millions of dollars to see what they can find.\n  We go after Planned Parenthood, investigate them, set up a Select \nCommittee to do that--despite the fact that a case in Texas against \nPlanned Parenthood found in favor of Planned Parenthood and indicted \nthe people who made the film which created such a sensation in this \nHouse. We waste congressional time with duplicative, baseless \ninvestigations. Today, the crusade against President Obama reaches new \nheights.\n  This resolution surrounding United States v. Texas adds to the \nalready overwhelming list of baseless political tactics that the House \nmajority has used to discredit, undermine, and disrespect President \nObama.\n  This resolution makes a political statement, one that represents the \nHouse majority--not the entire House of Representatives or even the \nentire Congress, since a major part of it has been left out of this \naltogether.\n  This resolution seeks to put this whole Chamber on record when there \nis significant, vocal, and strong opposition. In fact, 186 House \nDemocrats, along with 39 Senate Democrats, have joined together for our \nown amicus brief in support of the President's executive actions.\n  Not only were the President's actions constitutional, they are in \nline with decades of bipartisan action by Presidents on immigration \nitself, including action by President Ronald Reagan and President \nGeorge H.W. Bush.\n  This is a rarely seen ploy, seeking to file an amicus brief as the \nwhole House, leaving out completely the voice of the minority. I hope \nthe American people will see it for what it is: purely political. This \nshows us, once again, that the Republicans are willing to prioritize \ntheir party over their country.\n  Adding insult to injury, Speaker Ryan has said:\n  ``The president is not permitted to write law--only Congress is.''\n  How true, indeed. So why don't we, the Congress, do what we were sent \nhere to do: write laws.\n  Republicans have reached for a tool that is not in their \nconstitutional tool box: running to the courthouse. Rather than \nallowing Congress to do its job, the Republicans insist on telling \nother branches of government how to do theirs.\n  It is quickly becoming clear that this is a dangerous moment in our \ncountry and in our political system. The Presidential primary field on \nthe Republican side is resorting to demagoguery and nativism, fanning \nthe flames of dangerous anti-immigrant anger and anger in general.\n  What the President rightly called ``vulgar and divisive rhetoric'' in \nthe Republican contest is a logical and foreseeable consequence of the \nanger and fear carefully and deliberately cultivated by decades of \nRepublican campaign strategy, as Republicans went beyond principled \nadvocacy for smaller government to the outright encouragement of people \nto think of government as the problem and their an enemy to be hated.\n  This debate would not have even been an issue if, last Congress, the \nHouse had taken up the bipartisan Senate immigration bill, which they \nwere asked time and time again to do but it never saw the light of day \nhere. That was an opportunity for our country to come together in a \nbipartisan way, instead of further dividing us.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the argument we are making today is that this President \nhas a repeated history of needing to have his actions resolved through \nthe court system.\n  The Supreme Court has acted over 13 times to rule against the Obama \nadministration. This President is an activist President that works \naround the legislature. As a matter of fact, even Members of this body \nhave implicated that they don't even know who their White House \ncontacts are.\n  We have repeatedly tried to work with the President. We hold \nhearings. They ignore and rebuff the things that we do. They disallow \nwhat are considered to be normal rules of law.\n  So this is an action that has been brought by the States, not by the \nUnited States Congress. We were simply asked to give an opinion, and \nthat is what we are doing today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. \nByrne) one of our bright, new members of the Rules Committee.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule \nand the underlying resolution.\n  I disagree with the gentlewoman from New York. This is not about \npolitics. This is about the Constitution of the United States. And it \nis very clear. It says the President ``shall take care that the laws be \nfaithfully executed.''\n  Now, some people may argue about what that may mean. But in 1792, \nPresident Washington, who was the chair of the Constitutional \nConvention in 1787, wrote this:\n  ``It is my duty to see the Laws executed--to permit them to be \ntrampled upon with impunity would be repugnant to'' my duty.\n  Fast forward to 2010. In response to those arguing for executive \namnesty at that time, President Obama himself stated:\n\n       I am President. I am not king. There's a limit to the \n     discretion that I can show because I'm obliged to execute the \n     law. I can't just make the laws up myself.\n\n  Six months later, the President went further. He said this:\n\n\n[[Page H1424]]\n\n\n  \n\n       There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are \n     very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration \n     system that for me to simply, through executive order, ignore \n     those congressional mandates would not conform with my \n     appropriate role as President.\n\n  Unfortunately, in 2012, President Obama reversed course and \nunilaterally imposed a massive program of executive amnesty in \nviolation of this country's immigration laws. In 2014, he doubled down \nwith a second, more expansive executive amnesty program.\n  According to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute, 87 \npercent of all illegal aliens will be exempted from immigration \nenforcement actions under this President's amnesty policies. Thus, \nimmigration laws, as actually written by Congress, will apply to a mere \n13 percent of violators.\n\n  In the upcoming case of the United States v. Texas, the Court will \nconsider whether the President's executive amnesty violated the \nConstitution. Consequently, that case has the potential to be one of \nthe most important constitutional decisions on executive power ever \ndecided.\n  This resolution authorizes the filing of an amicus brief on behalf of \nthis House in legal opposition to the President's unconstitutional \nactions.\n  As a lawyer, I can tell you amicus filings are important. They allow \nthe court to obtain information and arguments from nonparties who have \nan important bearing on this case.\n  This resolution will allow this body to be heard before the Supreme \nCourt.\n  This is not about immigration policy. This is about ensuring that \nthis President and future Presidents, regardless of their political \nparty, do not have the authority to ignore or change the laws through \nexecutive fiat. Ultimately, this is about the Constitution and \nprotecting the rule of law.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this rule and this important \nresolution.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up Representative Lofgren's resolution \nexpressing the position of the House in support of the Obama \nadministration in United States v. Texas.\n  If the House is going to take a vote on weighing in on an anti-\nimmigrant lawsuit filed against the President, we should at least have \nthe option of voting to support the President's executive actions, \nwhich are a worthwhile and temporary first step toward reforming our \nbroken immigration system.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren), \nthe distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nImmigration and Border Security, to discuss our proposal.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I think it is worth reflecting why we are \nhere.\n  When we had the bipartisan bill passed by the Senate last Congress, \nthe Congressional Budget Office calculated that it would mean almost a \ntrillion dollars to the positive for the American economy, not to \nmention the human toll that our current broken system inflicts on \npeople.\n  Now, we failed to act. And when we did, the President went to the \nOffice of Legal Counsel, an independent group, and asked them what he \ncould do, if anything. I thought they were rather conservative, but one \nof the things they said he could do was to give temporary reprieve to \nchildren who had been brought here without their concurrence and to the \nparents of American citizens. So he did that.\n  How could he do that? Because the Congress has delegated to the \nexecutive the authority to act. In 1952, we did so--it can be found at \n8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(3)--and again in 2002. When we created the Department \nof Homeland Security, we told the Department Secretary that he should \nestablish immigration policies and priorities for removal.\n  Now, why would that happen? We have only appropriated 4 percent of \nthe funds necessary to remove everyone who is here without their proper \npapers. So clearly, there needs to be some prioritization. We recognize \nthat. We told the Secretary to do it, and that is exactly what he did. \nWe delegated the authority.\n  On work authorization, again, we delegated that authority. In 1981, \nPresident Reagan went to rulemaking and established that authority, \nwhich is actually in practice; it has been in place. And Congress, in \n1986, explicitly recognized the authority to give work authorization to \nthose who are in deferred action status.\n  But even without that delegation, the President has long had the \nauthority to take the action that the President has in this case. It is \ncalled prosecutorial discretion and foreign policy.\n  In United States v. Arizona, Justices Roberts and Kennedy noted that \nwhen the executive has broad discretion, a principal feature of the \nremoval system is that it extends, and it extends to whether it makes \nsense to pursue removal at all.\n  This isn't new with President Obama. When President Reagan held that \noffice, he sponsored a bill that gave relief--amnesty, if you will--to \nseveral million people; but the Congress--and it is reflected in the \nJudiciary Committee report--specifically excluded the spouses and \nchildren of those who had relief. What did Reagan do? He gave deferred \naction to the spouses and the children who had been specifically \nexcluded from relief by the Congress because he didn't want to break up \nfamilies. That was about 40 person of the undocumented people at the \ntime--about the same amount that President Obama has dealt with.\n  Not only is this resolution wrong, it is the wrong process. Democrats \nwent to the Ethics Committee. We got approval to get a volunteer to \nwrite a brief, which I will later include in the Record. We read it \nbefore we signed it.\n  In contrast, what are you asking Members to do? You have no idea what \nyou are signing onto, just that you are against it.\n  Now, does this mean that you are saying that the Administrative \nProcedure Act applies whenever the President takes a discretionary \naction? Well, good luck fighting ISIS then. Good luck getting disaster \nrelief if there is a flood.\n  It is defective for process, too. There is a group called the \nBipartisan Legal Advisory Group. I have been involved with that in the \npast. That group is consulted when there is an issue that relates to \nthe prerogatives of the House. For example, is there a speech or debate \nissue before the court?\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  This did not come before the BLAG because this is political. This is \nnot about the prerogatives of the House.\n  Now, all Members of the House had an opportunity to file a brief, and \nRepublican Members still can if they can meet the time deadlines. But \nusing this process, I think there is a reason why CRS was unable to \ntell us any other instance where a process like this was used about the \nprerogatives of the House.\n  So this is a radical procedure and a radical act because it says the \nHouse cannot delegate to the executive, as we have done, because it \ncould cripple the President by requiring the Administrative Procedure \nAct whenever he takes a discretionary act, because it violates the \nprocedures the House has always used.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. But finally, the net result could be this: if the \nRepublicans prevail, we could end up with a roundup of a million kids \nwho did nothing wrong, who were brought here as infants, who don't even \nremember the country of their birth.\n  When all is said and done, that is what this is about.\n  I would urge that our colleagues vote ``no'' on this radical \nresolution. We will attempt to offer a resolution that, instead, is \nsomething you know what you are buying into, not a pig in a poke, but a \nthoughtful, reasoned brief that outlines what the House has done to \ndelegate to the executive, outlines what the executive's authority has \nbeen since Eisenhower.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you listen to our colleagues, they make wild \naccusations. They are swinging widely rather than understanding the \nessence of the case. The essence of the case is more than 25 States \nhave gone to Federal Court in Texas, at the heart of the border, and \nargued the laws of the United States of America.\n\n[[Page H1425]]\n\n  The process that comes about and that we agree with is we do not \nbelieve that the President of the United States, not any President, has \nthe authority, the responsibility, or the legal standing to do what \nthis President has done.\n  The President repeated that, evidently, some 21 times, that he did \nnot have that standing either to do what he eventually did, which was \npurely political, and that is what we are being accused of today.\n  We believe that rule of law is the most important attribute, and we \nsimply in the House of Representatives are supporting what the Supreme \nCourt has asked at the time the oral arguments will be done here before \nthe Supreme Court, probably in the next month or so.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. \nBuck), an esteemed district attorney in Colorado and currently a member \nof the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, the Constitution lays out a very clear picture \nof how our government works. In Article I, section 8, the Founding \nFathers gave Congress the duty to create laws. More importantly, \nArticle I gave Congress the authority to ``establish a uniform rule of \nnaturalization.''\n  Rather than enforcing the laws Congress created, the President has \nfailed to execute them. Through his executive actions, he has even \nbypassed this building, rewriting the laws on immigration to his \nliking.\n  Sadly, this is not the only time our President has bypassed Congress \nand, by extension, the will of the people. On energy regulations, \nhealth care, war powers, gun rights, and even judicial nominations, all \nhave faced Presidential work-arounds. Through executive actions, \nfailure to enforce laws, and administrative regulations, the executive \nbranch is slowly becoming a monarchy.\n  I founded the Article I Caucus last year to fight executive overreach \nand reassert the power of Congress. Today we have an incredible \nopportunity to speak to not just one, but two of the other branches of \ngovernment.\n  Speaker Ryan has a duty to stand up for Congress and the people of \nthis Nation by filing a friend of the court brief in this case. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote today to give him that prerogative.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nRhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).\n  Mr. CICILLINE. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, in April, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in \nthe United States v. Texas, a case that has been repeatedly litigated \nby our colleagues in the halls of Congress. And this resolution is \nabsolutely about immigration policy. Let's be clear.\n  Numerous hearings have been held in our committee challenging the \nconstitutionality of Deferred Actions for Parents of Americans. Our \ncolleagues, instead of moving forward on comprehensive immigration \nreform and fixing our broken immigration system, have instead insisted \non putting forth a resolution, a resolution that has no substantive \nfindings, makes no legal arguments against the executive action, and \nexists only in the hopes of securing time before the Court during oral \narguments.\n  If our colleagues do find themselves before the Court in this case, \nit would be helpful if they remember the settled Constitutional law on \nthis subject.\n  DAPA is a lawful exercise of executive discretion well within the \nbounds of the Constitution. It is based on laws enacted by Congress \nthat grant broad discretion to the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  Since 1952, Congress has authorized the executive branch to establish \nsuch regulations, issue such instructions, and perform such other acts \nas it deems necessary for carrying out its authority. And within that \nauthority, it is a reasonable exercise of the discretion delegated by \nCongress to do what it is doing.\n  The executive action focuses the limited resources of the Department \nof Homeland Security on public safety priorities, ensuring that we are \ndeporting felons, not families.\n  It is important to recognize that Congress appropriates enough to \nremove less than 4 percent of the unauthorized immigrants now in our \ncountry. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the statutory \nresponsibility to set enforcement priorities and to adopt policies \nnecessary for meeting these priorities.\n  It is consistent with the actions of Presidents of both parties for \nthe last decades, including President Eisenhower, President Reagan, and \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush. In fact, the strongest historical \nprecedent for DAPA was the Family Fairness program implemented by \nPresident Reagan and President Bush.\n  These executive actions will strengthen our communities, keep \nfamilies together, and grow our economy.\n  This resolution is not about limiting executive authority. It is \nabout attempting to reverse immigration policy set by the executive \nbranch.\n  I understand why my friends on the other side of the aisle don't want \nto admit that, or they want to frame it in the context of a \nConstitutional question, but it is really about changing policies that \nare keeping families together, that are making sure that we properly \nallocate resources to the most serious individuals who should be \ndeported, those who have committed crimes, and keep families together \nwhile we work to fix our broken immigration system.\n\n  This is about a fundamental change in immigration policy that will \nrip families apart, that will undermine our values as a country. We \nought to call it what it is.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the rule and vote against this \nresolution.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would remind this body, Mr. Speaker, that over 13 times the highest \ncourt in this land, the Supreme Court, has ruled against this activist \nPresident for exceeding his constitutional authority.\n  This President, in his own concoction of the way the country ought to \nbe run, does not follow the rules, not the rule of law, not the rule of \nproviding enough information for people by properly delineating the way \nrules and laws should be executed.\n  That is why we are here today. It has everything to do with our \nbelief that the President of the United States has not well and \nfaithfully properly executed the laws of the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nCarter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding and for his leadership on this important situation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 639.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are here again discussing the President and his \nexecutive actions. Back in November of 2014, President Obama announced \na series of executive actions that would have provided amnesty to \napproximately 5 million additional illegal immigrants.\n  Amnesty for these 5 million illegal immigrants would have been in \naddition to the millions who were provided amnesty under the \nadministration's 2012 actions.\n  The President continues to degrade the rights of American citizens \nand ignores the U.S. Constitution which this country was founded on.\n  The checks and balances that our Founding Fathers established made it \nspecifically clear that they wanted Congress to enact laws that shape \nour country, not the President. That is why I am supporting House \nResolution 639.\n  House Resolution 639 will allow the Speaker of the House to submit to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court its opinion, arguing that the President's \nexecutive action on amnesty for illegal immigration is \nunconstitutional. Congress must be able to express its arguments that \nthe President's executive order on amnesty is unconstitutional so we \ncan continue to maintain the balance of power between Congress and the \nPresident.\n  I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 639 so we can \ncontinue to deny the President's overreach of power and uphold the \nrights and responsibilities given to this body by the Constitution.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I think context is important in this debate \nwe are having today. I can't get it out of\n\n[[Page H1426]]\n\nmy head, as we look at House Resolution 639, that our Senate has just \nannounced that it is going to shut down the Supreme Court nomination \nprocess.\n  Only a few years ago, the House shut down the government for 16 days.\n  We have had 62 ACA repeals.\n  Mitch McConnell once said, famously, that his goal was to make Obama \na one-term President. He failed at that.\n  The fact is that here we are again with Republican efforts to \nundermine, thwart, and shut down President Obama. This is outrageous, \nin my opinion.\n  House Resolution 639 is nothing but a continuation of the politics of \nobstruction, just one more way to say you are not really the President, \nyou are not legitimate. That is what this represents today. That is the \nexercise we are taking on this floor.\n  President Obama's action will bring relief to millions of families \nwho live in fear. Families shouldn't be torn apart because House \nRepublicans refuse to work together with Democrats to pass an \nimmigration bill which would make executive action unnecessary.\n  While the Republicans held up progress, President Obama worked within \nhis authority and took courageous steps needed to address the problems \nof millions of Americans.\n  The Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and the expanded \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is an important step \ntoward fixing an immigration system that is inhumane and cruel, and it \nis within the right of the President to prioritize removal proceedings \nfor certain people. We have to prioritize them. We cannot remove \neverybody at the same time.\n  Furthermore, it is consistent with the action of past Presidents, \ndating back to President Eisenhower, including George H.W. Bush and \nRonald Reagan, who both took executive action to keep immigrant \nfamilies together.\n  The Republicans offer no substantive findings and no legal arguments \nin their resolution. This is a delay tactic. This is a political \ntactic. This does not serve the interests of the American people.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. ELLISON. The fact that executive action is right for American \nfamilies, and right for our economy, and right for our society, is what \nshould guide our actions today, not political delay tactics.\n  Republicans won't acknowledge that immigration and immigrants are an \nimportant part of the society that we live in. I stand with the \nfamilies that President Obama is trying to keep together within his \nauthority.\n  Vote ``no'' on House Resolution 639.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  There is a lot of good debate here today. The facts of the case are \nreal simple. The Supreme Court of the United States will be deciding \nthis.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Federal District Court of \nthe Southern District of Texas have let their answer be known, and that \nis they believe that the President is wrong. But we have a process to \nfollow, and the good part is it is not whether something House \nRepublicans are doing is trying to delay or to stop something that \nmight be a decisionmaking that has been made by someone else. We are \nsimply trying to support an action that was asked as a result by the \nSupreme Court: Do we have an opinion about this issue? And it is thus \nthat we are asking the House of Representatives to come together today \nto hear the facts of this issue and to then render a decision.\n  That, to me, Mr. Speaker, is normal and regular, and our Speaker, \nPaul Ryan, is most meticulous in looking at this issue. His advice and \njudgment comes from the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the \ngentleman from Virginia, Bob Goodlatte. Both of these gentlemen are not \nonly well balanced, but really doing what is being asked of them by the \nthird branch of government, which is the judiciary. The judiciary has \nasked the House of Representatives and parties to this suit if they \nwould please discuss this issue.\n  We believe our ideas are material to the question at hand, and that \nis why the United States House of Representatives, through the Rules \nCommittee, is here for this rule today and the underlying legislation \nin just a few minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nLance), an exciting young member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Rules Committee for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of Speaker Ryan's House \nResolution 639.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I continue to oppose President Obama's \nillegal amnesty program, and I have long believed that the proper venue \nto challenging the President's overreaching actions is primarily in the \ncourts of this country. To this end, I was 1 of 68 Members of \nCongress--and the only member from the New Jersey delegation--to sign \nan amicus brief in support of a lawsuit brought by a coalition of 26 \nStates against the President's executive order on immigration.\n  As a lawyer who has practiced constitutional law in my home State of \nNew Jersey, I have tried to study these issues closely. There is no \ngray area: Congress writes the laws, and the executive branch enforces \nthem.\n  The executive overreach consistently taken by this administration \ndemonstrates not only contempt for law, but a disregard for the \ncritical balance of powers central to our Constitution. The American \nsystem of self-governance would not be as strong as it is if it were \nnot for these bedrock principles.\n  Today, we have unelected officials in Federal agencies writing our \nlaws. The executive branch is appropriating taxpayer funds without \nauthorization from Congress, and departments are selectively deciding \nwhich laws to enforce. Prosecutorial discretion cannot be expanded to \nbreak the rule of law, as I am confident the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States will rule.\n  I applaud Speaker Ryan for pursuing an amicus brief to defend our \nArticle I powers under the Constitution. Given the President's gross \nexecutive overreach, it is essential for this institution to respond as \na whole. This action today is not only prudent, but an important and \nnecessary step in defense of the Constitution and the rule of law.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support House Resolution \n639.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from \nengaging in personalities toward the President.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lofgren).\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, this is a political act because this action \nonly comes with President Obama. We never did this with Republican \nPresidents.\n  Let me give you an example. After Tiananmen Square, the House of \nRepresentatives passed a bill to preclude the deportation of Chinese \nstudents. President Bush vetoed that bill. Do you know what he did \nthen? He deferred the deportation of the Chinese students because he \nhad the executive authority.\n  In 1999, a letter was sent to Janet Reno. It was signed by Henry \nHyde, Lamar Smith, Sam Johnson, and many others asking her to use her \nprosecutorial discretion and citing the fact that the prosecutorial \ndiscretion is clear in removal proceedings.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will include that letter in the Record.\n  I was shocked to hear Mr. Sessions say that the Court had solicited a \nbrief--maybe I misunderstood him--had asked the House for a brief. If \nthat is the case, I would respectfully request to see a copy of the \ndocument soliciting a brief from the House of Representatives. That is \na procedure that would be an extraordinary one, and it is certainly \nnews to me.\n  Finally, I would like to add that the fact that Mr. Goodlatte doesn't \nagree with the President has nothing to do with the fact that the \nprocedures were not followed in this case. The Bipartisan Legal \nAdvisory Group is the process established in the House to be used when \nthe House takes a step in Court to defend its prerogatives, which is \nwhat the majority is suggesting is at play in this case.\n\n[[Page H1427]]\n\n  This is clearly a political act, and if it succeeds, who will be \npunished? One million children who did nothing wrong, who will be \nrounded up and taken from their homes.\n  I don't know what Republicans think they are doing if they sign on to \nthis resolution because it doesn't give any findings nor does it say \nwhat, in fact, they are signing on to.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIowa (Mr. King), my dear friend.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman from Texas for \nyielding and for leading on this issue.\n  As I sit and listen to this debate, a number of things come to mind, \nand they start with this: I am hearing a lot of policy discussion over \non the other side of the aisle, but this is about a constitutional \nquestion.\n  We have just said good-bye to one of the great, great Justices in the \nUnited States Supreme Court, Justice Scalia, who often said that, when \nhe made a decision based on the Constitution and he was uncomfortable \nwith the policy that resulted from that constitutional decision, he was \nmost comfortable that he had made the right constitutional decision \nwhen he disagreed with a policy result of that decision.\n  That is also how we should view this case. Every one of us that has \nthe privilege to speak and address you on the floor of this House has \ntaken an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates. This is about the President's oath to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States, except his says take care to \n``preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates,'' and it is referenced in the Take Care Clause in the \nConstitution that requires him to take care that the laws be faithfully \nexecuted.\n  Now, I don't know that there is a schoolchild in this land that is \ngoing to get that wrong. They don't think that the President should \nexecute the law itself and then conduct himself in the fashion that he \nsees fit. I think they understand that the President, multiple times, \nhas lectured the country in his adjunct constitutional law \nprofessorship that he didn't have the constitutional authority to do \nwhat he did.\n  So this issue is about the Take Care Clause, the President keeping \nhis oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, and it is \nabout prosecutorial discretion, as the gentlewoman from California \nsaid; except that, it was a clear understanding, when they wrote the \nMorton Memos, that they were creating groups of people, classes of \npeople, and categories of people, and the Morton Memos were the \nbeginning of this. They created four different categories of people, \nand as far as I know, anyone who fit into those categories was \nessentially maybe individually dealt with because they processed their \npaperwork, but they were automatically exempted from the application of \nthe law. That is when this began.\n  We should not think, Mr. Speaker, that the House hasn't weighed in on \nthis. It goes back to this. March 2, 2011, was the introduction of the \nMorton Memos. That was the first executive overreach on immigration \nthat is starkly on paper. The first opportunity to push back on that \nwas a hearing in which Janet Napolitano asserted that it was on an \nindividual basis only and repeated herself. And Morton Memos themselves \nhave several references to an individual basis only, except that they \ncreate four categories of people. So the words don't mean what the \nrules do. They abuse prosecutorial discretion by granting it to vast \ngroups of people that were defined first in the Morton Memos.\n  So I brought an amendment June 7, 2012, that cut off all the funding \nto the Morton Memos. That passed 238-175 on a bipartisan vote. The next \nopportunity was the Morton Memos in DACA, another King amendment, June \n6, 2013, that passed 224-201, another bipartisan vote in the House of \nRepresentatives, Mr. Speaker.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas.\n  So we addressed the Morton Memos in this House and voted to defund \nthem in 2012. That was the first opportunity.\n  The next opportunity was 2013. We addressed the Morton Memos in DACA \nand defunded them in this House of Representatives. That was also a \nbipartisan vote.\n  Then August 1, 2014, we addressed DACA alone, defunded it, a vote of \n216-192, another bipartisan vote, Mr. Speaker.\n  Not to be completing it there, January 14, 2015, the House addressed, \nseparately, DAPA and Morton Memos in an amendment to defund. That \npassed 237-190. And we picked up the DACA in a separate amendment, same \nday, and that passed 218-209.\n  The House has voted time and time again. And if that was not enough \nfor the voice of the House to weigh in on this, we came back again on \nJune 3, 2015, another King amendment, and defunded the DOJ lawsuit we \nare talking about here now because we said: Step back, Mr. President; \nkeep your oath of office. We stood up, and we defended ours.\n  I will say this. Despite all of these votes, the government and \nDemocrat Members claim Congress has acquiesced to the unconstitutional \nactions when the House has a clear voting history of opposing each step \nin the President's path to amnesty.\n  So the House has now exhausted our remedies, with the exception of \nthe omnibus spending bills, where everything gets packaged up in one \nvote. Except for that, the House has done all it can, Mr. Speaker, \nexcept for this opportunity to introduce an amicus brief that will be \nthe voice of the House keeping our oath to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. I yield to the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Is it the gentleman's proposition that a vote in this \nHouse that does not become law voids an action of the House that does \nbecome law, to wit, the 2002 Department of Homeland Security Act that \ndirected the Secretary to establish priorities for removal?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Mr. SESSION. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  I am asserting that the House needs to do all it can to keep our oath \nto support and defend the Constitution, and we are doing this today \nwith this endorsement of the Speaker's amicus brief so that the House \ncan weigh in in defending our constitutional obligation.\n  I thank the gentlewoman from California and the gentleman from Texas.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the gentlewoman from New York for her \ncourtesies.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is important to take note, in light of the previous \ndebate and comments that were made, that this is a House divided. This \namicus brief more than likely will be supported by a number of Members, \nbut it will not be supported by the entirety of the House. So whether \nor not it is a majority, which is the other party, it is not going to \nbe the voice of the entirety of the House.\n  As far as I am concerned, and as the Constitution has made clear, \nthat responsibility that the President has exercised is a \nconstitutional authority. So I oppose the resolution because it is \nnothing more than our Republican majority's latest partisan attacks on \nthe President and a diversionary tactic to avoid addressing some of the \nmore important issues such as the broken immigration system.\n\n  Just a few years ago, the Senate Republicans and Democrats came \ntogether to produce and pass a very thorough assessment of the \nimmigration system, and they actually passed laws, the intent of the \nNation, represented by Senators, and that came to the House and never \nsaw the light of day to be able to be voted on. But yet the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, in an extensive series of hearings and then, of \ncourse, legislation, then wrote legislation that passed by voice vote \nin a bipartisan manner to protect the border, everything that the \nRepublican side is asking for.\n  But lying at the heart of the plaintiff's misguided and wholly \npartisan\n\n[[Page H1428]]\n\ncomplaint is a specious claim that President Obama lacked the \nconstitutional authority and statutory authority to take executive \naction. This frivolous and partisan lawsuit seeks to have DACA and DAPA \ndeclared to be invalid and to permanently enjoin the Obama \nadministration from implementing those salutary policies.\n  Let me briefly speak about these actions by the President. They are \nreasonable. The reason they are reasonable is because, in addition to \nestablishing the President's obligation to execute the law, the Supreme \nCourt has consistently interpreted the Take Care Clause as ensuring \nPresidential control over those who execute and enforce the laws and \nthe authority to decide how best to enforce the laws.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  Arizona v. United States, Bowsher v. Synar, Buckley v. Valeo, Printz \nv. United States, Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board.\n  Let me also say to you that this is a Texas case that they are \nsubmitting the amicus on. These are Texas DREAMers. Many of us have \nworked with them. They are in our institutions of higher learning. They \nare going to be contributing to society. This is what this amicus brief \nis, to turn them back and to turn their families.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an \nadditional 15 seconds.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. How would DACA and DAPA impact domestic violence? \nDACA provided a sense of peace, knowing that this woman would not be \ndeported.\n  I would argue to my friends that whatever the vote is today, it is \nnot the sense of the House. It is a divided House, and we are not \nsupporting an amicus to turn back the President's constitutional \nauthority.\n  With that, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the underlying \nresolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to both the rule governing \ndebate of H. Res. 639, and the underlying resolution, which authorizes \nthe Speaker to appear as Amicus Curiae on behalf of the House of \nRepresentatives in the matter of United States, et al. v. Texas, et \nal., No. 15-674.\n  I oppose the resolution because it is nothing more than the \nRepublican majority's latest partisan attack on the President and \nanother diversionary tactic to avoid addressing the challenge posed by \nthe nation's broken immigration system.\n  Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 639, if adopted, would vest in the Speaker alone \nthe power to file on behalf of the full House an amicus brief with the \nSupreme Court supporting the constitutionally untenable position of 26 \nRepublican-controlled states in the matter of United States, et al. v. \nTexas, et al., No. 15-674.\n  Lying at the heart of the plaintiffs' misguided and wholly partisan \ncomplaint is the specious claim that President Obama lacked the \nconstitutional and statutory authority to take executive actions to \nimplement Administration policy with regard to Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of American \nCitizens and Lawful Permanent Residents, the creation of (DAPA).\n  This frivolous and partisan lawsuit seeks to have DACA and DAPA \ndeclared invalid and to permanently enjoin the Obama Administration \nfrom implementing these salutary policies, both of which are intended \nto keep law-abiding and peace loving immigrant families together.\n  The purely partisan nature of the resolution before us is revealed by \nits text, which authorizes the Speaker to waste precious taxpayer funds \nand file on behalf of every Member of the House an amicus brief that no \nMember has seen in support of a position opposed by virtually every \nmember of the Democratic Caucus.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me briefly discuss why the executive actions taken \nby President Obama are reasonable, responsible, and within his \nconstitutional authority.\n  Pursuant to Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, the President, \nthe nation's Chief Executive, ``shall take Care that the Laws be \nfaithfully executed.''\n  In addition to establishing the President's obligation to execute the \nlaw, the Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the ``Take Care'' \nClause as ensuring presidential control over those who execute and \nenforce the law and the authority to decide how best to enforce the \nlaws. See, e.g., Arizona v. United States; Bowsher v. Synar; Buckley v. \nValeo; Printz v. United States; Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB.\n  Every law enforcement agency, including the agencies that enforce \nimmigration laws, has ``prosecutorial discretion''--the inherent power \nto decide whom to investigate, arrest, detain, charge, and prosecute.\n  Thus, enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity (DHS), properly may exercise their discretion to devise and \nimplement policies specific to the laws they are charged with \nenforcing, the population they serve, and the problems they face so \nthat they can prioritize our nation's resources to meet mission \ncritical enforcement goals.\n  Mr. Speaker, to see the utter lack of merit in the legal position to \nbe supported by the amicus brief permitted by H. Res. 639, one need \ntake note of the fact that deferred action has been utilized in our \nnation for decades by Administrations headed by presidents of both \nparties without controversy or challenge.\n  In fact, as far back as 1976, INS and DHS leaders have issued at \nleast 11 different memoranda providing guidance on the use of similar \nforms of prosecutorial discretion.\n  Executive authority to take action is thus ``fairly wide,'' and the \nfederal government's discretion is extremely ``broad'' as the Supreme \nCourt held in the recent case of Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. \n2492, 2499 (2012), an opinion written by Justice Kennedy and joined by \nChief Justice Roberts:\n  ``Congress has specified which aliens may be removed from the United \nStates and the procedures for doing so. Aliens may be removed if they \nwere inadmissible at the time of entry, have been convicted of certain \ncrimes, or meet other criteria set by federal law. Removal is a civil, \nnot criminal, matter. A rincipal feature of the removal system is the \nbroad discretion exercised by immigration officials. Federal officials, \nas an initial matter, must decide whether it makes sense to pursue \nremoval at all. If removal proceedings commence, aliens may seek asylum \nand other discretionary relief allowing them to remain in the country \nor at least to leave without formal removal.'' (emphasis added) \n(citations omitted).\n  The Court's decision in Arizona v. United States, also strongly \nsuggests that the executive branch's discretion in matters of \ndeportation may be exercised on an individual basis, or it may be used \nto protect entire classes of individuals such as ``[u]nauthorized \nworkers trying to support their families'' or immigrants who originate \nfrom countries torn apart by internal conflicts:\n  ``Discretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces immediate \nhuman concerns. Unauthorized workers trying to support their families, \nfor example, likely pose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who \ncommit a serious crime. The equities of an individual case may turn on \nmany factors, including whether the alien has children born in the \nUnited States, long ties to the community, or a record of distinguished \nmilitary service.\n  Some discretionary decisions involve policy choices that bear on this \nNation's international relations. Returning an alien to his own country \nmay be deemed inappropriate even where he has committed a removable \noffense or fails to meet the criteria for admission. The foreign state \nmay be mired in civil war, complicit in political persecution, or \nenduring conditions that create a real risk that the alien or his \nfamily will be harmed upon return.\n  The dynamic nature of relations with other countries requires the \nExecutive Branch to ensure that enforcement policies are consistent \nwith this Nation's foreign policy with respect to these and other \nrealities.''\n  Exercising thoughtful discretion in the enforcement of the nation's \nimmigration law saves scarce taxpayer funds, optimizes limited \nresources, and produces results that are more humane and consistent \nwith America's reputation as the most compassionate nation on earth.\n  Mr. Speaker, a DREAMER (an undocumented student) seeking to earn her \ncollege degree and aspiring to attend medical school to better herself \nand her new community is not a threat to the nation's security.\n  Law abiding but unauthorized immigrants doing honest work to support \ntheir families pose far less danger to society than human traffickers, \ndrug smugglers, or those who have committed a serious crime.\n  The President was correct in concluding that exercising his \ndiscretion regarding the implementation of DACA and DAPA policies \nenhances the safety of all members of the public, serves national \nsecurity interests, and furthers the public interest in keeping \nfamilies together.\n  Mr. Speaker, according to numerous studies conducted by the \nCongressional Budget Office, Social Security Administration, and \nCouncil of Economic Advisors, the President's DACA and DAPA directives \ngenerate substantial economic benefits to our nation.\n  For example, unfreezing DAPA and expanded DACA is estimated to \nincrease GDP by $230 billion and create an average of 28,814 jobs per \nyear over the next 10 years.\n  That is a lot of jobs.\n\n[[Page H1429]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, in exercising his broad discretion in the area of \nremoval proceedings, President Obama has acted responsibly and \nreasonably in determining the circumstances in which it makes sense to \npursue removal and when it does not.\n  In exercising this broad discretion, President Obama not done \nanything that is novel or unprecedented.\n  Let me cite a just a few examples of executive action taken by \nAmerican presidents, both Republican and Democratic, on issues \naffecting immigrants over the past 35 years:\n  1. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan used executive action in 1987 to \nallow 200,000 Nicaraguans facing deportation to apply for relief from \nexpulsion and work authorization.\n  2. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter exercised parole authority to \nallow Cubans to enter the U.S., and about 123,000 ``Mariel Cubans'' \nwere paroled into the U.S. by 1981.\n  3. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush issued an executive order that \ngranted Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) to certain nationals of the \nPeople's Republic of China who were in the United States.\n  4. In 1992, the Bush administration granted DED to certain nationals \nof El Salvador.\n  5. In 1997, President Bill Clinton issued an executive order granting \nDED to certain Haitians who had arrived in the United States before \nDec. 31, 1995.\n  6. In 2010, the Obama Administration began a policy of granting \nparole to the spouses, parents, and children of military members.\n  Mr. Speaker, because of the President's leadership and visionary \nexecutive action, 594,000 undocumented immigrants in my home state of \nTexas are eligible for deferred action.\n  If these immigrants are able to remain united with their families and \nreceive a temporary work permit, it would lead to a $338 million \nincrease in tax revenues, over five years.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me note that the President's laudable \nexecutive actions are a welcome development but not a substitute for \nundertaking the comprehensive reform and modernization of the nation's \nimmigration laws supported by the American people.\n  Only Congress can do that.\n  America's borders are dynamic, with constantly evolving security \nchallenges.\n  Border security must be undertaken in a manner that allows actors to \nuse pragmatism and common sense.\n  Comprehensive immigration reform is desperately needed to ensure that \nLady Liberty's lamp remains the symbol of a land that welcomes \nimmigrants to a community of immigrants and does so in a manner that \nsecures our borders and protects our homeland.\n  Instead of wasting time debating divisive and mean spirited measures \nlike H. Res. 639, we should instead seize the opportunity to pass \nlegislation that secures our borders, preserves America's character as \nthe most open and welcoming country in the history of the world, and \nwill yield hundreds of billions of dollars in economic growth.\n  I urge all Members to join me in voting against H. Res. 639.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Bost), who serves on the Agriculture Committee.\n  Mr. BOST. I thank the chairman for the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, whenever we take these offices--and understand, I have \nraised my hand and took an oath of office many times in my life, \nwhether it was in the United States Marine Corps., local government, or \nhere in Congress. When I take that oath and mention the fact that I am \nswearing allegiance to the Constitution to do my duty and do it \ncorrectly, I make that promise, and I make that promise to the American \npeople. This document that we take an oath to, the President himself \nhas to take that same oath.\n  When the President steps away from that oath, this House has no other \nthing that they can do but to act.\n  Any grade school civics student knows that Congress makes the law and \nthe President executes them. It is called the separation of powers, \nchecks and balances. But the President's executive amnesty proves once \nagain that he wants to do both--both. That is not in the Constitution. \nIt doesn't work that way.\n  Immigration law clearly state that individuals who are here illegally \nmust be removed. The President does not have the power to pick and \nchoose. That is not what the law says. He doesn't get to ignore the \nlaws.\n  The outcome of this case will be determined in the Court. But I want \nmy constituents--and I want to be on the record--to know that I will \nuphold the Constitution; I will stand for the Constitution; and I take \nmy oath of office very, very seriously.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the rule and the \nunderlying resolution so we can stop this unconstitutional move.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nWashington (Ms. DelBene).\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule and \nthe underlying legislation. And I call on the Speaker to stop this \npolitical game and allow the vote on comprehensive immigration reform \nthat we should have taken 2 years ago.\n  Everyone agrees that our immigration system is broken, but instead of \nvoting on a solution, Congress is again wasting time on a political \ngimmick that does not address a single real problem.\n  The President took lawful action to help families being torn apart by \nour current system. If Republicans take issue with what current law \nallows, they should stop obstructing meaningful debate and get serious \nabout comprehensive immigration reform.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I helped lead efforts last \nCongress to enact comprehensive immigration reform by introducing the \nBorder Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization \nAct, H.R. 15. I believe that bill would have passed if we had been \ngiven a chance to vote on it on the floor. We had 200 cosponsors and a \nchance to fix this problem then.\n  I won't blame the current Speaker for mistakes of the past, but he \nhas a chance to lead now.\n  For too long, Congress has failed to take meaningful action to \naddress our broken immigration system. As a result, we have a deeply \nflawed system that is not working for our communities, our businesses, \nimmigrants, or families.\n  It will take Congressional action to truly repair our broken \nimmigration system, so I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this \nresolution and demand that Congress act.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, the arguments that are on the floor today \nevolve and revolve around the issues that we believe are very \nimportant; that is, we believe that the President of the United States \nhas exceeded his executive authority, and the Supreme Court is going to \nhear the case.\n  But, in fact, today the question that lies before the House is about \nan action that will be taken by this House to support, in an amicus \nbrief, the positions that will be needed.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the \nSpeaker of the House.\n  (Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin asked and was given permission to revise and \nextend his remarks.)\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, I rise today to \nurge Members to support this measure, House Resolution 639. Let me \nexplain why, and why everyone should support this.\n  This resolution authorizes me, on behalf of the House, to file an \namicus brief to defend our Article I powers under the Constitution. \nNormally this question would be considered by what is known as the \nHouse's Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, but I am asking the whole \nHouse to go on the record, as an institution.\n  I recognize that this is a very extraordinary step. I feel it is very \nnecessary, though. In fact, I believe this is vital.\n  This is not a question of whether or not we are for or against any \ncertain policy. Members who are making immigration policy arguments are \nmissing the entire point here. This comes down to a much more \nfundamental question. It is about the integrity of our Constitution.\n  Article I. Article I states that all legislative powers are vested in \nCongress.\n  Article II. Article II states that the President ``shall take care \nthat the laws be faithfully executed.''\n  Those lines, that separation of powers, could not be clearer. Article \nI: Congress writes laws. Article II: Presidents faithfully execute \nthose laws.\n  In recent years, the executive branch has been blurring these \nboundaries to the point of absolutely overstepping them altogether. As \na result, bureaucrats responsible for executing the laws, as written, \nare now writing the laws at their whim.\n  This just doesn't throw our checks and balances off-balance, it \ncreates a fourth branch of government. This creates a fourth branch of \ngovernment\n\n[[Page H1430]]\n\nthat operates with little or no accountability whatsoever. Most \nprofoundly, this means that we the people, through our elected \nrepresentatives, are not drafting the laws that we live under. This is \nthe profound difference that is occurring here. This fourth branch of \ngovernment is a danger to self-government itself.\n  The Supreme Court has recognized the severity of this threat. In \nUnited States v. Texas, the Court has asked whether the President's \noverreach violates his duty to faithfully execute the laws. This House \nis uniquely qualified and, I would argue, obligated to respond.\n  Colleagues, we are the body closest to the people. We are the ones \nwho are directly elected by the American people every other year. And \nif we are going to maintain the principle of self-government, if we are \ngoing to maintain this critical founding principle of government by \nconsent of the governed, then the legislative branch needs to be \nwriting our laws, not the executive branch, and certainly not a branch \nof unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats. This is what is happening. And \nit is not just this administration, although this administration has \ntaken it to whole new levels.\n  As Speaker, I believe the authority of the office that I have been \nentrusted by each and every one of you is to protect the authority of \nthis body. I am prepared to make our case.\n  We must defend the principle of self-determination, of self-\ngovernment, of government by consent of the governed.\n  This Constitution protects our rights, as people. It makes sure that \nthe government works for us and not the other way around. It makes sure \nthat we, as citizens, if we don't like the direction our government is \ngoing, if we don't like the laws that we are being forced to live \nunder, that we can change that through the ballot box. And this is \nbeing undermined every day.\n  I am prepared to submit this defense of our Article I powers, and I \nask the whole House for its support.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lofgren), the ranking member of the Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Immigration and Border Security.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, obviously, we all like and honor the \nSpeaker of the House. I was pleased to hear his recognition that this \nshould have gone through the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group because \nthat is how the House organizes itself before asserting a privilege of \nthe House in court.\n  What he didn't say is why, since cert was granted on January 19--and \ntoday is March 17--he didn't call together the Bipartisan Legal \nAdvisory Group. Certainly, we have met in a much shorter time frame. I \nknow because I have been a participant in that process.\n  The failure to follow the procedures in this instance can only lead \nobservers to conclude that this is a more politicized action than is \ntraditional in terms of intervening in the court.\n  Now, the Speaker said: ``All legislative powers are vested in \nCongress.'' No one can disagree with that. And that the President must \n``take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'' No one can disagree \nwith that.\n  Is the Speaker saying that we did not, in 2002, delegate to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security the responsibility to establish \npriorities and policies, the priorities for removal, that we did not \nfail to provide most of the money that would be necessary to actually \nremove every single undocumented person in here? I think not. In fact, \nthe President has done exactly what we said he should do in 2002.\n  To approve this resolution, which says that he has acted inconsistent \nwith his duties, is a mystery. It is a pig in a poke for the \nRepublicans.\n  The District Court made a finding that in order to take a \ndiscretionary action, one would need to comply with the Administrative \nProcedures Act. That is a very bulky procedure--90 days posting.\n  Are the Members of the House being asked to say that whenever the \nPresident takes a discretionary action, he must post a rule for 90 \ndays? We don't know because this resolution only says we are against \nit.\n  If we are saying that a rule must be adopted whenever a discretionary \naction is taken, that would be an extraordinary departure from the \nPresident's power to act, and it is certainly something that Members \nought to know they are doing before they vote on this resolution.\n  Much has been said about the States that filed the lawsuit. They were \nall States with Republican Governors. But there are States who \ndisagree, including my State of California.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  There is a brief filed by the Californians which reads that the \ndiscretionary action the President took would generate 130,000 jobs in \nCalifornia and that it would provide $3.8 billion in taxes to \nCalifornia.\n  So if we are going to use as an excuse the fact that Republican \nGovernors filed a lawsuit to stop it, let's think about the States that \nhave been enjoined unfairly and that are experiencing extreme economic \ndamage because of the Fifth Circuit's misguided opinion.\n  I hate to say it, because I do appreciate the Speaker of the House, \nbut there is only one way to look at this resolution--as a highly \npoliticized effort. This is not the way the House has traditionally \nproceeded when adopting a court proceeding, a court intervention, that \ndeals with the privileges of the House.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I advise my colleague that I have come to \nthe end of my speakers and would wait for her to offer her final \ncomments, and I will close.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I am prepared to close.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the \nrule to bring up Representative Lofgren's resolution expressing a \nposition of the House in support of the Obama administration in United \nStates v. Texas.\n  If the House is going to vote on weighing in on the anti-immigration \nlawsuit that was filed against the President, we should at least have \nthe option of voting to support the President's executive actions, \nwhich are a worthwhile, if temporary, first step toward reforming our \nbroken immigration system.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, our immigration system is broken, as \nevidenced by the fact that there are 11 million undocumented persons \nwho are living in the United States.\n  Instead of engaging in a bipartisan legislative process to reform the \nsystem, the House majority has decided to focus on discrediting the \nPresident rather than forming policies that benefit our country. There \nis ample evidence of Presidents long before this one having exercised \nthe same executive order privilege without there having been any great \nrush by the House of Representatives to go to court to try to stop him. \nHouse Democrats would welcome the chance to work on a bipartisan \nsolution to the Nation's broken immigration system, but we can't \nbecause we simply are not allowed to participate--only to show up to \nvote.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the \nprevious question. If we have a ``no'' vote on this closed rule, we \nthen will be able to present our own resolution in support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the gentlewoman from New York for her engagement on this \nimportant issue and for her leadership on the Rules Committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, most of all, what we are doing here is acknowledging \nthat the Supreme Court of the United States will make this decision; \nbut in seeking input on this important question, we feel like the House \nis uniquely qualified to begin answering that question, literally, with \na vote. That is how we do things around here.\n  I do recognize and respect that the minority leader has gathered a \ngroup of those who might be Democrats--from the Democrat Party, House \nand Senate sides--for their own opinion, and they did file that. This \nis an action that will be taken today that is by the\n\n[[Page H1431]]\n\nHouse of Representatives, and I think the Speaker outlined why we are \nhere and the importance of it.\n  Mr. Speaker, in July of 2011, President Obama stated: ``I swore an \noath to uphold the laws on the books. Now, I know some people want me \nto bypass Congress and change the laws on my own. Believe me, the idea \nof doing things on my own is very tempting, I promise you, not just on \nimmigration reform, but that's not how our system works. That's not how \nour democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written.''\n  I quote the President of the United States on addressing the same \nissue exactly that is before us today.\n  Article I, section 8 gives Congress, not the President, the authority \nto establish a uniform rule of naturalization. It is directly out of \nthe Constitution. The President had it right at least 21 times.\n  Article II, section 3 of the Constitution of the United States \nrequires the President take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n  Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us today, before this body, is not \nabout policy. It is not about how we should handle the 11 million \nundocumented, illegal immigrants who are currently residing in this \ncountry. It is about our Nation's Constitution. It is about the checks \nand balances that our Founders labored over so intensely to ensure a \ngovernment will always be by and for the people. It has even been noted \nthat it has been taught and is taught today in elementary school that \nthe legislature--the Congress--writes the laws. That is why we are here \ntoday. It is even taught in our elementary schools.\n  Mr. Speaker, this administration, as well as future administrations \nfrom either party--whoever serves--must not be allowed to ignore the \nConstitution and circumvent those who write the laws, and it is \nimperative that the House speaks as an institution on this matter.\n  I am pleased with the arguments that have been made today. I believe \nthey were right and just, and I believe that our Speaker, Paul Ryan, in \nhis own wisdom and experience and temperament, is attempting to \napproach this as an important constitutional issue and as the \nprerogative and the right and the responsibility of the United States \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the \nunderlying legislation.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I submit the following amici curiae brief:\n\n                               No. 15-674\n\n               In the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n             United States of America, et al., Petitioners,\n\n                                   v.\n\n                  State of Texas, et al., Respondents.\n\n\n  ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE \n                             FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n   BRIEF OF 186 MEMBERS OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND 39 \n  MEMBERS OF THE U.S. SENATE AS AMICI CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS\n\n       Kenneth L.

Sprangers.\n       Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, LLP.\n\n\n                        INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE\n\n       Amici are 186 Members of the U.S. House of Representatives \n     and 39 Members of the U.S. Senate. A complete list of amici \n     is set forth in the Appendix. Among them are:\n       U.S. House of Representatives:\n       Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Leader.\n       Steny H. Hoyer, Democratic Whip.\n       James E. Clyburn, Assistant Democratic Leader.\n       Xavier Becerra, Democratic Caucus Chair.\n       Joseph Crowley, Democratic Caucus Vice-Chair.\n       John Conyers, Jr., Ranking Member, Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n       Zoe Lofgren, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Immigration \n     and Border Security of the Committee on the Judiciary.\n       U.S. Senate:\n       Harry Reid, Democratic Leader.\n       Richard J. Durbin, Democratic Whip.\n       Charles E. Schumer, Democratic Conference Committee Vice \n     Chair and Policy Committee Chair, and Ranking Member, \n     Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n       Patty Murray, Secretary, Democratic Conference.\n       Patrick J. Leahy, Ranking Member, Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n       Robert Menendez, Democratic Hispanic Task Force Chair.\n       As Members of Congress responsible, under Article I of the \n     Constitution, for enacting legislation that will then be \n     enforced by the Executive Branch pursuant to its authority \n     and responsibility under Article II, amici have an obvious \n     and distinct interest in ensuring that the Executive \n     enforces the laws in a manner that is rational, effective, \n     and faithful to Congress's intent. Given their \n     institutional responsibility, amici would not support \n     executive efforts at odds with duly enacted federal \n     statutes. But where Congress has chosen to vest in the \n     Executive discretionary authority to determine how a law \n     should be enforced and the Executive has acted pursuant to \n     that authority--as is the case here--amici have a strong \n     interest in ensuring that federal courts honor Congress's \n     deliberate choice by sustaining the Executive's action.\n\n\n                          SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n       Congress understands that the Executive is often better \n     positioned to determine how to adjust quickly to changing \n     circumstances in complex fields, particularly ones involving \n     law-enforcement and national-security concerns. Congress \n     therefore regularly gives the Executive broad discretion to \n     determine how to enforce such statutes. Rarely has it done so \n     more clearly than in the Nation's immigration laws.\n       Recognizing the Executive's institutional advantages in the \n     immigration context, Congress has for more than sixty years \n     granted the Executive broad discretionary authority to \n     ``establish such regulations; . . . issue such instructions; \n     and perform such other acts as [the Secretary] deems \n     necessary for carrying out his authority'' under the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (``INA''). 8 U.S.C. \n     1103(a)(3). And in 2002, in the face of a yawning gap between \n     the size of the unauthorized immigrant population and the \n     amount of resources reasonably available for enforcement, \n     Congress charged the Secretary of Homeland Security with \n     ``[e]stablishing national immigration enforcement policies \n     and priorities.'' 6 U.S.C. 202(5). Congress thereby \n     encouraged the Executive to focus its resources in a rational \n     and effective manner on cases in which the Nation's interest \n     in removal is strongest, to provide the maximum return on \n     Congress's sizeable but necessarily finite investment in \n     immigration enforcement.\n       As representatives of diverse communities across the United \n     States, amici have witnessed how an approach to enforcement \n     of the immigration laws that does not focus on appropriate \n     priorities undermines confidence in those laws, wastes \n     resources, and needlessly divides families, thereby exacting \n     a severe human toll. Amici thus regard the DAPA Guidance as \n     exactly the kind of ``enforcement polic[y]'' that Congress \n     charged the Secretary with establishing. Building on the \n     Secretary's decision to prioritize for enforcement threats to \n     national security, border security, and public safety, the \n     DAPA Guidance establishes a ``polic[y]'' that certain \n     nonpriority immigrants may be considered for ``deferred \n     action,'' i.e., memorialized temporary forbearance from \n     removal, which triggers eligibility for work authorization \n     upon a showing of economic need.\n       This Court has observed that deferred action is a \n     ``commendable exercise in administrative discretion.'' Reno \n     v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 484 \n     (1999) (``ADC''). Deferred action is not just a humanitarian \n     exercise. Like other uses of deferred action, the DAPA \n     Guidance facilitates the implementation of the Secretary's \n     priorities and promotes the efficient and effective execution \n     of the immigration laws consistent with the limited \n     enforcement resources available. The Guidance does this by \n     encouraging eligible persons to submit to a background check \n     so they can be identified and classified according to removal \n     priority, and by enabling those with an economic need to \n     support themselves lawfully.\n       That the Secretary's guidance is within his statutory \n     authority should not be open to doubt. For half a century, \n     the Executive has used deferred action and other forms of \n     discretionary relief in a variety of circumstances, even when \n     not specifically authorized by statute. Congress has approved \n     of those practices, repeatedly amending the immigration laws \n     without foreclosing the Executive's broad discretion to use \n     them--and even enacting provisions that presume the Executive \n     will continue its discretionary practice of deferred action. \n     Similarly, Congress has explicitly recognized the Executive's \n     broad discretion to determine which removable individuals \n     qualify for work authorization and has never disturbed the \n     Executive's decades-long practice of providing work \n     authorization to those granted deferred action.\n       The court of appeals' holding that the DAPA Guidance is \n     ``manifestly contrary to the INA'' reflects a misreading of \n     the INA\n\n[[Page H1432]]\n\n     and a faulty approach to interpreting complex regulatory \n     statutes like the immigration laws. The court reasoned that \n     the immigration laws' specific references to discretionary \n     relief from removal and work authorization under certain \n     circumstances implicitly foreclosed discretionary relief and \n     work authorization under others. But deferred action is not a \n     substitute for specific statutory statuses and forms of \n     discretionary relief, as it grants none of the legal rights \n     that lawful status provides. Moreover, the court's expressio \n     unius analysis disregards the broad grants of discretion that \n     are explicit in the immigration laws and the long history of \n     undisturbed executive exercise of that discretion. The \n     court's approach would make it virtually impossible for \n     Congress to grant the Executive the broad authority and \n     discretion required to tackle urgent and unforeseen \n     immigration challenges, while retaining the ability to direct \n     specific enforcement action it deems appropriate. More \n     generally, it would hamper Congress's ability to allocate to \n     the Executive the combination of broad discretion and \n     specific responsibilities so often needed to administer \n     sprawling statutory schemes effectively.\n       Finally, even if a claim under the Take Care Clause is \n     justiciable, and even if such a claim may be asserted against \n     an Executive officer other than the President, the claim must \n     fail here. The States' challenge rises and falls on the \n     proper interpretation of the immigration laws, and thus \n     should be viewed as presenting only a statutory claim. In any \n     event, the Take Care Clause surely does not prevent an agency \n     faced with the task of removing hundreds of thousands of \n     individuals each year from pursuing such removals in a \n     rational rather than haphazard manner in light of its limited \n     enforcement resources.\n\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I submit the following letter:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 1999.\n     Embargoed for release Monday, November 8, 1999.\n     Contact: Allen Kay, Rep. Lamar Smith.\n     Re Guidelines for use of prosecutorial discretion in removal \n         proceedings.\n\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Doris M. Meissner,\n     Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Service, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Reno and Commissioner Meissner: \n     Congress and the Administration have devoted substantial \n     attention and resources to the difficult yet essential task \n     of removing criminal aliens from the United States. \n     Legislative reforms enacted in 1996, accompanied by increased \n     funding, enabled the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     to remove increasing numbers of criminal aliens, greatly \n     benefitting public safety in the United States.\n       However, cases of apparent extent hardship have caused \n     concerns Some cases may involve removal proceedings against \n     legal permanent residents who came to the United States when \n     they were very young, and many years ago committed a single \n     crime at the lower end of the ``aggravated felony'' spectrum, \n     but have been law-abiding ever since, obtained and held jobs \n     and remained self-sufficient, and started families in the \n     United States. Although they did not become United States \n     citizens, immediate family members are citizens.\n       There has been widespead agreement that some deportations \n     were unfair and resulted in unjustifiable hardship. If the \n     facts substantiate the presentations that have been made to \n     us, we must ask why the INS pursued removal in such cases \n     when so many other more serious cases existed.\n       We write to you because many people believe that you have \n     the discretion to alleviate some of the hardships, and we \n     wish to solicit your views as to why you have been unwilling \n     to exercise such authority in some of the cases that have \n     occurred. In addition, we ask whether your view is that the \n     1996 amendments somehow eliminated that discretion. The \n     principle of prosecutorial discretion is well established. \n     Indeed, INS General and Regional Counsel have taken the \n     position, apparently well-grounded in case law, that INS has \n     prosecutorial discretion in the initiation or termination of \n     removal proceedings (see attached memorandum). Furthermore, a \n     number of press reports indicate that the INS has already \n     employed this discretion in some cases.\n       True hardship cases call for the exercise of such \n     discretion, and over the past year many Members of Congress \n     have urged the INS to develop guidelines for the use of its \n     prosecutorial discretion. Optimally, removal proceedings \n     should be initiated or terminated only upon specific \n     instructions from authorized INS officials, issued in \n     accordance with agency guidelines. However, the INS \n     apparently has not yet promulgated such guidelines.\n       The undersigned Members of Congress believe that just as \n     the Justice Department's United States Attorneys rely on \n     detailed guidelines governing the exercise of their \n     prosecutorial discretion, INS District Directors also require \n     written guidelines, both to legitimate in their eyes the \n     exercise of discretion and to ensure that their decisions to \n     initiate or terminate removal proceedings are not made in an \n     inconsistent manner. We look forward to working with you to \n     resolve this matter and hope that you will develop and \n     implement guildelines for INS prosecutorial discretion in an \n     expeditious and fair manner.\n           Sincerely,\n         Henry J. Hyde; Lamar Smith; Bill McCollum; Bill Barrett; \n           Barney Frank; Sheila Jackson Lee; Martin Frost; Howard \n           L. Berman; Brian P. Billbray; Charles T. Canady; Nathan \n           Deal; David Dreier; Eddie Bernice Johnson; Patrick J. \n           Kennedy.\n         James P. McGovern; F.

Martinez; Martin T. Meehan; Christopher Shays; Kay \n           Granger; Ciro D. Rodriguez.\n\n  The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:\n\n          An Amendment to H. Res. 649 Offered by Ms. Slaughter\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 2. Immediately upon the adoption of this resolution it \n     shall be in order without intervention of any point of order \n     to consider in the House the resolution (H. Res. 646) \n     expressing the position of the House of Representatives in \n     the matter of United States, et al. v. Texas, et al., No. 15-\n     674. The resolution shall be considered as read. The previous \n     question shall be considered as ordered on the resolution to \n     adoption without intervening motion or demand for division of \n     the question except one hour of debate equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n       Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of House Resolution 646.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n\n[[Page H1433]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER.

Texas, et al., No. 15674, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.\n\n\n                        Parliamentary Inquiries\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The gentleman \nwill state his parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, is the Speaker not already authorized by way \nof the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group to offer an amicus brief with \ncurrent authority without the need to pass the resolution under \nconsideration?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman may consult clause 8 of rule \nII for the role of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will please state his \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Is it in order to offer an amendment to amend section \n2 of the resolution to make the text of any amicus brief to be filed \navailable for all Members to review for 3 days previous to its filing?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 649, the \nprevious question shall be considered as ordered on the resolution to \nits adoption without intervening motion, except for a motion to \nrecommit.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. POLIS. Is it in order to amend section 2 of the resolution to \nformally include the amicus brief prepared by the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lofgren) and signed by more than 200 Democrats?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the Chair just stated, the previous \nquestion is ordered without intervening motion, except on a motion to \nrecommit.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. So it is not in order?\n  Mr. POLIS. Is or isn't?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. No intervening motions are in order except \nas provided in House Resolution 649.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Okay. Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman may state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Is it in order to offer an amendment to section 3 that \nwould make available all names of outside counsel that will be \nproviding services to the Office of General Counsel; that way the \nAmerican public can know who all the outside counsel is?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair's response remains the same.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, further inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. POLIS. Is it in order to offer an amendment to include a CBO \nreport on the costs of the Office of General Counsel that would occur \nunder this resolution?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair's response must remain the same.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Isn't it true, Mr. Speaker, that every President since \nPresident Eisenhower and up through President Obama has used powers \ngranted to them by Congress to set aside the deportation of certain \nimmigrants?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has not stated an inquiry \nrelated to the pending proceedings.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. I thought I was.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I have a further parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado will state his \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, is it true that Presidents Ronald Reagan and \nGeorge Bush protected in excess of 1 million undocumented immigrants by \nexecutive action?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is not stating a parliamentary \ninquiry related to the pending proceedings.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Further parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I believe that what we are seeing here are \nsome dilatory moves on behalf of the minority. While I respect every \nbit of that, we have decorum that is established in this House, and I \nbelieve the Speaker has adequately responded to the questions thereon \nby the gentlemen, and I ask that we move on forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask unanimous consent----\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend. All Members will \nsuspend.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 649, the resolution is considered read.\n  The text of the resolution is as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 639\n\n       Resolved, That the Speaker is authorized to appear as \n     amicus curiae on behalf of the House of Representatives in \n     the Supreme Court in the matter of United States, et al. v. \n     Texas, et al., No. 15-674, and to file a brief in support of \n     the position that the petitioners have acted in a manner that \n     is not consistent with their duties under the Constitution \n     and laws of the United States.\n       Sec. 2.  The Speaker shall notify the House of \n     Representatives of a decision to file one or\n\n[[Page H1435]]\n\n     more briefs as amicus curiae pursuant to this resolution.\n       Sec. 3.  The Office of General Counsel of the House of \n     Representatives, at the direction of the Speaker, shall \n     represent the House in connection with the filing of any \n     brief as amicus curiae pursuant to this resolution, including \n     supervision of any outside counsel providing services to the \n     Speaker on a pro bono basis for such purpose.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour \nequally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member \nof the Committee on Rules.\n  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) and the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Polis) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes, once again, the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman will please state her \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Under the rules of the House, in order to accept \nvolunteer efforts, one must be cleared by the Committee on Ethics. The \nresolution purports to seek pro bono assistance, but the inquiry is \nwhether this comports with the rules of the House requiring the \nCommittee on Ethics to preclear the acceptance of such assistance to \navoid unseemly or potentially illegal assistance?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will not interpret a pending \nmeasure. That is a matter for debate.\n  The gentleman from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H. Res. 639, authorizing the Speaker to \nappear as amicus curiae on behalf of the House of Representatives in \nthe matter of United States, et al. v. Texas, et al.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we have earlier stated, as we were debating and \ndiscussing the rule, over 25 States or State officials have filed suits \nchallenging the Obama administration's expansion of DACA and the \ncreation of DACA-like programs for aliens who are parents of U.S. \ncitizens or lawful permanent residents.\n  The States allege that these administrative actions run afoul of the \nTake Care Clause of the Constitution. Article II, section 3 declares \nthat the President ``shall take care that the laws be faithfully \nexecuted,'' which requires any President to enforce all constitutional \nvalid acts of Congress, regardless of the administration's views of the \nwisdom or the policy.\n  The States in this case that brought the case in southern Texas \nallege that these actions run afoul of the separation of powers set \nforth in the Constitution Article I, section 8, which gives Congress--\nnot the President--the authority to establish a uniform rule of \nnaturalization. That is directly from the Constitution.\n  Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act, which clearly \nspecifies the limited cases in which the executive branch can suspend \nthe removal of unlawful aliens.\n  Mr. Speaker, this administration has sought review on this case from \nthe Supreme Court, which granted its petition, and that is because this \nadministration lost in the Federal District Court in the Southern \nDistrict of Texas and lost its case in the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n  In doing so, the Court indicated that it would also consider the \nplaintiffs' claims under the Take Care Clause.\n  I include in the Record the official document from the Supreme Court.\n\n\n                 united states, et al. v. texas, et al.\n\n       The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. In \n     addition to the questions presented by the petition, the \n     parties are directed to brief and argue the following \n     question: ``Whether the Guidance violates the Take Care \n     Clause of the Constitution, Art. II, Sec. 3.''\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, the questions presented in the case are \nreally extraordinarily significant to the House of Representatives. In \nparticular, this case raises issues related to the limits on executive \ndiscretion not to enforce laws enacted by Congress as well as the point \nat which the exercise of such discretion turns into lawmaking, thereby \ninfringing on Congress' Article I legislative powers.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  It is precisely because of these constitutional questions pending \nbefore the highest court in our land, the United States Supreme Court, \nthat the U.S. House of Representatives--which, I believe, will present \na side which we believe is important from a constitutional \nperspective--will consider this resolution. The House, I believe, will \nand must protect its Article I legislative powers on behalf of the \nAmerican people and on behalf of Representatives who believe in self-\ngovernance.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, today there are a lot of legal arguments and talk. I \nwant to make sure the American people listening at home and watching at \nhome know exactly what we are talking about here today.\n  I want to talk about somebody whose life is on pause, waiting for the \nDAPA program to clear the courts. The brief that the Republicans are \nseeking to file is the exact opposite. It is saying that DAPA cannot \noccur. And this gentleman and his family, Colorado constituents of \nmine--just to put a human face on it--show what DAPA means for so many \nfamilies across our country.\n  Mr. Edin Ramos of Colorado--he is pictured there next to his three \nlovely kids and his wife--is a native of Honduras. He has been in the \nUnited States for over 13 years. His kids are American citizens, were \nborn here, don't know any other country. He fled his home country to \navoid persecution and extortion at the hands of local, corrupt \nofficials and gangs.\n  He is married to a U.S. citizen. They have three young children \ntogether. He is a very successful business owner in my district. He and \nhis wife employ 12 people. They make investments in our local \ncommunity. We rely on them for jobs, for the services they provide. Yet \nthe lack of any peace of mind prevents families like Edin Ramos' from \nreaching their full potential.\n  Every day his kids come home from school, and his wife worries over \nsomething as minor as a taillight being out or a speeding ticket, that \nMr. Ramos could find himself in detention for an indefinite period of \ntime, removed from his family, or even deported to another country \nwhich he doesn't have any ties to.\n  I would also like to talk about the case of Ms. Mercedes Garcia. \nMercedes is a long-time resident of my hometown, Boulder, Colorado. Her \nlife has been greatly affected by the arbitrariness of an immigration \nsystem that is immoral and has lacked meaningful priorities.\n  She has been in the United States for close to 20 years. She is the \nmother of three American children, U.S. citizen children. But you know \nwhat happened? Her husband was removed from the United States in 2011 \nover a traffic citation, forcing her to be the sole provider for her \nthree children.\n  Now, Mercedes is undocumented herself, and she fears contact by \nimmigration authorities on a daily basis. DAPA was a ray of hope for \nher. What DAPA would do is provide Mercedes with a meaningful level of \ncertainty, the ability to legally seek employment, the ability to \nprovide her family with expanded opportunities here in the U.S., and \nwould help make her American citizen children as successful as they are \nable to be.\n  Her children are just as American as you or me, Mr. Speaker, as is \nanyone born in the United States. Don't they deserve to have their \nmother help them succeed with all the great promises that this country \noffers? Why can't we give that certainty to their mother?\n  DAPA is a legal, commonsense, lawful exercise of discretion. It is \nconsistent with the actions of Presidents, both Democratic and \nRepublican, for decades. It directs, very simply, with the limited \namount of enforcement resources we have in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, that we want to focus on removing undocumented immigrants who \npose a threat to public safety or national security--not Mr.\n\n[[Page H1436]]\n\nRamos, not Ms. Garcia. We want to remove those who represent a danger \nor a threat to our country.\n  To somehow misfocus those limited resources on tearing apart families \ninstead of going after criminals would put the American people at risk. \nThe President has acted to make the American people safer by ensuring \nthat our limited law enforcement resources are focused where they will \nhave the biggest impact.\n  These policies are very simple. They create a process for low-\npriority enforcement immigrants who come forward, submit to a \nbackground check, register, be able to get a provisional work permit, \nand work legally. It enhances our public safety and national security.\n  Yet we hear people from the other side saying: Well, this is \nsomething Congress should have done. I agree. This is something \nCongress should have done. You know what? It is not my fault Congress \ndidn't do it.\n  I have talked about immigration every week and every month here on \nthe floor of the House. I cosponsored a comprehensive bill. I signed a \ndischarge petition last Congress to try to bring it forward. Yes, I \nagree.\n  You know what? Congress didn't do it, Mr. Speaker. And that is on the \nRepublican majority that Congress failed to act.\n  So the President moved forward with the legal authority he has and \nthat Republican and Democratic Presidents in the past have used to say \nthat Ms. Garcia is not the same risk to this country as a dangerous \ncriminal.\n  It is common sense, and it is about time that we move forward with \nDAPA and DACA.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, at this time you will see that our \nRepublican Members that will come and speak are men and women not only \nwith extensive legal experience, grounded in the law and the \nConstitution of the United States but will make their arguments from a \nprofessional nature that are directly related to the law.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), who served \nas a judge in Texas, and is a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, the issue before us today is whether the U.S. \nConstitution will be followed by the President or not. That is the \nissue. That is why we have this unusual situation, where the House of \nRepresentatives, by this resolution, is joining in on a legal action to \nlet that be resolved by the judiciary branch of government.\n  It all started in November of 2014, when the Department of Homeland \nSecurity wrote out a memo and sent it out to the fruited plain and said \nthat the Department of Homeland Security would no longer enforce U.S. \nimmigration law.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is a branch, a portion of the \nadministration.\n  This unprecedented, unilateral action by the executive branch was a \nnullification of immigration law of the United States. And it was not \ndone by Congress. It was done by administrative edict that came from \nthe White House.\n  Article I, section 8, clause 4 states that Congress--that is us--has \nthe power ``to establish an uniform rule of naturalization'' in the \nUnited States.\n  So what value is the law or the Constitution if the executive, who is \nsupposed to enforce the law--not make it, as we all learned in ninth \ngrade civics--sends out a memo saying it will no longer enforce the \nlaw?\n  The law of the land is repealed by the administrative pen because the \nPresident doesn't like the law, as written.\n  Repealing a law is supposed to be a legislative action--that is \nCongress--and is not supposed to be an executive action; that is, if \nthe Constitution is followed, which it is not under these \ncircumstances.\n  This illegal executive action will place a burden on the States that \nthe action is taking place against, such as my home State of Texas, \nwhere the amnesty proclamation by the executive branch, through its \nmemo, has been in effect.\n  The Federal Government is not going to pay for the benefits of these \n5 million-plus folks. The States will be forced, required, and \nobligated to pay for that.\n  So the States will pay for the driver's licenses, government \nbenefits, and health care benefits for these newly legalized \nindividuals. All of the money the State spends will be taken away from \nthe ability to provide services for U.S. citizens and residents who are \nalready legally in the U.S.\n  This action is in direct contravention of U.S. law. Texas, my State, \nwill be one of the hardest-hit. That is why the Governor of the State \nof Texas was the first to file a lawsuit--this lawsuit--against the \nunconstitutional action by the executive branch of government. And that \noccurred in 2014.\n  The Constitution, to me, is very simple. It lays out an outline for \ndemocracy. Congress makes the laws; the executive branch faithfully \nexecutes the laws; and the judiciary resolves disputes between \ngovernment, other entities, and between the branches of government.\n  So, if U.S. immigration law is going to be changed, the Constitution \nstates that it should be changed by the U.S. Congress. That is us.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Even if the Congress doesn't act, that doesn't give \nthe executive branch Burger King authority.\n  The Burger King philosophy is: the President wants it his way. He \ncan't have it his way. He has got to follow the Constitution. He is a \nformer constitutional law professor. He ought to know better.\n  That is what this lawsuit is about. That is why it is a \nconstitutional issue. And that is why we should join in with those \nother Governors in filing this lawsuit with an amicus brief to support \nthe Constitution of the United States against executive memos from the \nexecutive branch.\n  The executive branch should take care of the Constitution, not tear \nup the Constitution.\n  That is just the way it is.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez), a great leader on the issue of uniting \nfamilies.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, the fact is, we shouldn't even be here \ntoday. This is partisan politics at its worst. And using the resources \nof the Federal Government and the legislative branch of government to \npromote a political agenda is just an affront to all Americans.\n  Why don't you just say it clearly? This is your: I want to deport 4 \nto 5 million people. I wish the majority would stop talking about the \nConstitution and really talk about what it is they mean to achieve \nhere.\n  If you want to see people deported, why don't you all stand up and \nsay it? Be men and women of integrity and of your word and say: I want \n4 to 5 million unprotected, and amend this to say, ``this is a mass \ndeportation for 4 to 5 million people.''\n  You keep saying that the candidates out there on the Presidential \ntrail do not represent your values, do not represent who you are \npolitically, and then you come back here and stoke the fire even more.\n  What you are demonstrating here is that you should be doing \nimmigration reform. What you are demonstrating here is your impotence \nat being able to get it done. Why don't you just say that this is what \nit is all about?\n  Because out on the campaign trail, on immigration, we get lots of \ndemagoguery from the majority. The debate has sunk to a level where \npeople are actually throwing punches, and worse.\n  Two refugees from Southeast Asia and a gentleman from Puerto Rico \nwere shot and murdered in front of their children in Milwaukee because \nthey didn't have the right accent in their voice.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  Two students, a Muslim and a Latino, were attacked by a man when they \nencountered him beating a Black man in Kansas this week, and he turned \nto them and shouted racist threats and said they should just go and \nleave the country.\n  We have Go Back to Africa and Hitler salutes, and all of this is \nbecoming more and more what we expect, the reality we see in 2016.\n  And now the Republicans in the House are stoking the same anti-\nimmigrant fears and mass deportation fantasies some more. No, they are \nnot\n\n[[Page H1437]]\n\nleading. They are not calling for calmer rhetoric, let alone more \nrational policies. They are playing politics with immigrants, plain and \nsimple. Shame on them.\n  If Republicans are so secure in the validity of their arguments, they \nshould write a brief and submit it, just like the 259 Democrats did \nlast week, without politicizing and using this august body to bring \nabout your partisan political hatred against immigrants.\n  The vote is a political stunt disguised as a legal brief. This is not \na legal brief. This is a political stunt. The Republican majority sees \na crass political opportunity to stand with the anti-immigrant wing of \ntheir party.\n  I guess the Speaker thinks, hey, why play it straight when you can \nforce a purely political vote on immigration, designed to deepen the \npartisan line and validate the very angry people who go around showing \ntheir hatred, their bigotry, and their prejudice in the political \nprocess in America.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind Members to address \ntheir remarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I recognize that there are people in this body who are frustrated, \nand I have engaged a number of those people very thoughtfully, and they \nhave tried to engage me, I think, thoughtfully.\n  But the essence of what today's argument is about is actually a legal \nexercise because, in fact, the Federal District Court in southern \nTexas, Judge Andy Hanen, looked at the law, and he, in a judicial \nsense, heard evidence that would be presented from all of the some 25 \nStates, as well as the Federal Government; and findings of facts and \nconclusions of law, not upon hyper-political accusations or bombastic \ncomments that are made to attack another side, is what actually \nprevailed in the case.\n  I am well aware that a number of our colleagues want to talk about \npolitics, politics, politics, and make accusations. This is about the \nfoundation of law, and it actually goes to direct words out of the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  A Federal District Court is particularly in tune with those arguments \nas they handle constitutional issues and questions, and the Court \nclearly found in favor of these States. The Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, in reviewing that case, came to that same conclusion.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe you will see that the Supreme Court will also \nrule on the law, not upon political sound bites that come back and \nforth from this body.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \nGoodlatte), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the distinguished \ngentleman who, I believe, represents not only thought and balance, but \nwho is trying to work within the constitutional confines and the laws \nof this country.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this very \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, without enforcement of the law, there cannot be \naccountability under law, and political accountability is essential to \na functioning democracy. We in the House of Representatives who face \nre-election every 2 years, under the Constitution, are perhaps reminded \nof that more than others. And while there is at least one political \nbranch willing to enforce the law, we will not fail to act through \nwhatever means by which we can successfully avail ourselves.\n  When the President fails to perform his constitutional duty that he \ntake care that the laws be faithfully executed, the Congress has \nappropriations and other powers over the President. But none of those \npowers can be exercised if a sizable Senate minority controlled by the \nPresident's own political party refuses to exercise them, or in the \nabsence of veto-proof majorities in both Houses. Nor would the exercise \nof those powers solve the problem at hand because they would not \nactually require the President to faithfully execute the laws.\n  Of course, the most powerful and always available means of solving \nthe problem at hand is to vote out of office a President who abuses his \npower. In the meantime, however, the need to pursue the establishment \nof clear principles of political accountability is of the essence.\n  So today we consider a resolution to authorize the Speaker to file on \nbehalf of the House in litigation brought by a majority of the States \nchallenging the constitutionality of the President's unilateral \nimmigration amnesty program.\n  Earlier this year, the Supreme Court agreed to hear that \nconstitutional challenge to the President's immigration plan, which the \npeople's legislative representatives never approved.\n  So far, a Federal judge in Texas has issued a preliminary injunction \nin the case blocking the enforcement of the President's unilateral \nimmigration amnesty. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that \ninjunction.\n  Importantly, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in the case and, \nrather than limiting the issue the way President Obama requested, it \ntook the State's suggestion and requested briefing on the following \nquestion: ``whether the President's action violates the Take Care \nClause of the Constitution, Article II, section 3.''\n  That clause of the Constitution requires the President to take care \nthat the laws be faithfully executed.\n  The Founders would have expected Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, known as the people's House for its most direct \nconnection to the will of the people, to aggressively guard their role \nin the constitutional legislative process. The resolution before us \ntoday will provide another means of doing just that.\n  The stakes of inaction are high. The lawsuit challenges the \nPresident's failure to enforce key provisions of the immigration laws.\n  We should all support this resolution today as it aims to help \ndeliver a simple message: Congress writes the laws, under Article I, \nsection 1, the very first sentence of the United States Constitution.\n  We should all support this resolution today. Our own constitutionally \nrequired oath to support the Constitution of the United States requires \nno less.\n  What is required of the President of the United States is found in \nArticle II, section 3, which says, ``he shall take care that the laws \nbe faithfully executed.'' That is the issue before us.\n  For the Court to pay attention to this institution's concern, the \nCourt requires that the Congress take a vote, and that is what we \nshould do today in order to let the Court know that this brief is not \njust a collection of a group of Members; this is an actual vote of the \nUnited States House of Representatives to ask the Court to consider our \nvery well-founded concerns and protect the people's House, protect the \npeople's rights under the Constitution, protect the Constitution \nitself, and Article I, section 1, which said very simply, ``All \nlegislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the \nUnited States.''\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of Latin used on the other side. But the \nplain English is this vote is about ripping apart the families of my \nconstituents, Mr. Ramos, Ms. Garcia, countless others, millions across \nthe country. And this vote would weigh in from the House of \nRepresentatives that the House of Representatives, those who vote for \nthis, want those families ripped apart.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nBecerra), the chairman of the Democratic Caucus.\n  Mr. BECERRA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  So last week, 186 Members of this House and 39 Senators from the \nSenate filed an amicus brief. We filed it before the Supreme Court in \nthis very case that is being discussed, United States v. Texas. But we \nfiled it without using taxpayer dollars. We filed it individually, \nseparately from our official duties.\n  The brief that we submitted supports the actions which President \nObama took because he is our Nation's chief executive and he has the \nright to try to make our laws work as best as possible.\n  In the case of our immigration laws, everyone agrees that they are \nbroken, they are fractured, and it is a system that does not work \ncoherently. There are more than 4 million people who will be impacted \nby the decision that the Supreme Court reaches in the case of United \nStates v. Texas. President\n\n[[Page H1438]]\n\nObama took his actions exercising his authority under the Constitution \nto execute and implement the laws of the land.\n  So here we are today. Speaker Ryan and my colleagues on the House \nside, on the Republican side, will force this House to vote on a \nresolution authorizing the House to file a similar type of amicus \nbrief, albeit in this case opposing the President's position in the \ncase of United States v. Texas.\n  But there is a big difference between the amicus brief that was filed \nby 186 Members of this House and 39 Members in the Senate and what the \nRepublican majority in the House is intending to do today--a big \ndifference. They are looking to use taxpayer money to push forward \ntheir political partisan agenda and their position in this case of \nUnited States v. Texas; so they are injecting every American who pays \ntaxes into this fight, even though most Americans support a \ncomprehensive fix to our immigration system.\n  Why would we want to use taxpayer dollars to go litigate? These days \nit seems that my Republican colleagues in Congress spend more time and \ntaxpayer money filing partisan lawsuits and legal briefs than working \nto pass the country's must-do legislation. We have got a budget to do. \nWe should be passing jobs legislation, and, yes, we should be fixing a \nbroken immigration system by passing comprehensive immigration reform.\n  Congress doesn't need to file a legal brief lobbying the Supreme \nCourt to fix our broken laws. Most Americans know from their high \nschool civics classes that the Constitution vests the Congress with the \npower to make or change any law without having to hope or wait for the \nSupreme Court to bail out Congress for not doing its work.\n  In fact, today, Speaker Ryan said: ``The legislative branch of \ngovernment needs to be the branch making our laws, not the executive.'' \nHe is absolutely right. So rather than doing legislation to file a \nlawsuit, let's do our job, which is to make the laws.\n  This Republican Congress, unfortunately, is completely out of step \nwith the interests and expectations of the American people. It is time \nto legislate, not to litigate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, consistent with the Republican message \ntoday, one of our other senior Members who is a former chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee now serves as the chairman of the Science, Space, \nand Technology Committee. He is a gentleman who has devoted himself and \nhis life to the rule of law, a gentleman who is in the thick of the \nunderstanding of the immigration issue, being from San Antonio, Texas. \nHe has seen for a long time the need and the desire for not just \nCongress to work with the executive branch, but the rule of law. He has \nbelieved in that in his years of service to the Judiciary Committee. He \nstands as a testament to his belief in constitutional law--including \nFederal court and Supreme Court decisions--and how important they are. \nI want you to know, Mr. Speaker, that this gentleman has, for a long \ntime, spoken with balance and credibility on the issue, not just to \nrule of law, but also about this Nation and how we do treat those who \ncome to this country with dignity and respect.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nSmith), the young chairman from Texas.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the \nchairman of the Rules Committee and my Texas colleague for yielding me \ntime and also for his very generous comments.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution authorizing the Speaker to \nsubmit an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in support of the Texas-led \nlawsuit challenging the President's amnesty policies.\n  It is critical that the House of Representatives defend the \nConstitution, which specifically gives Congress, not the President, the \npower to enact immigration laws.\n  Regrettably, the President's policies have ignored laws, undermined \nlaws, and changed immigration laws. The President's policies have led \nto a surge of tens of thousands of illegal immigrants across our \nborders, allowed unlawful immigrants to compete with unemployed \nAmericans for scarce jobs, and established sanctuary cities that \nrelease dangerous criminal immigrants into our neighborhoods where many \ngo on to commit other crimes.\n  The House of Representatives must reinforce the rule of law and \nprotect the lives and livelihoods of the American people. Mr. Speaker, \nthat is why I support this resolution.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, happy St. Patrick's Day to you. What a way \nHouse Republicans have chosen to celebrate St. Patrick's Day.\n  Today we pay tribute to the contributions of generations of Irish \nimmigrants and their descendants to the fabric of America. Today we are \nreminded that ours is truly a nation of immigrants--that immigrants \nhave truly made America more American with their optimism, their hope, \nand their courage to come to America, and to make a future better for \ntheir families. That is what America is all about, and that is what \nimmigrants have strengthened.\n  We have spent this entire week with our Irish friends celebrating the \nheritage of immigrants in America. The Taoiseach--that would be the \nPrime Minister of Ireland--was here in the Capitol earlier in the week. \nHe spoke about immigration last night at the dinner. In the letter that \nwas read by the Irish Ambassador from the Taoiseach, he talked about \nimmigration. Here on the floor of the House, we are talking about \nimmigration in a totally negative way.\n  Why would House Republicans want to spend St. Patrick's Day in this \ninsulting manner to Irish immigrants?\n\n  House Republicans have brought forward a resolution authorizing the \nSpeaker to file an anti-immigrant amicus brief with the Supreme Court, \nbut they won't tell the House or the American people what they are \nplanning to say in it. Given Republicans' past positions and rhetoric, \nthat raises serious questions:\n  Will the Republicans yet again call for tearing apart families?\n  Will they call for deporting DREAMers?\n  Will they yet again suggest a religious test for prospective \nimmigrants?\n  Will they ask the Court to explore ending birthright American \ncitizenship, as they did in their Immigration and Border Security \nSubcommittee hearing?\n  Sadly, there is not much difference between the rhetoric of the \nRepublican candidate for President and House Republicans when it comes \nto a record of appalling anti-immigrant statements--an agenda of \ndiscrimination.\n  Furthermore, Republicans have denied House Democrats the opportunity \nto have a meaningful vote on our alternative amicus brief in support of \nthe President's immigration executive actions, which we filed with the \nCourt last week, 225 House and Senate Democrats.\n  The fact is the President's immigration actions fall within the legal \nand constitutional precedent established by every administration, \nRepublican and Democrat, since President Eisenhower.\n  The fact is the President has the right to take these administrative \nactions under the law, and he also is following in the precedents of \nformer Presidents to do so.\n  I don't know if the Republicans were silent or didn't know what was \ngoing on when President Reagan went further in his administrative \nactions on immigration in terms of affecting a higher percentage of \nimmigrants than President Obama's actions have affected.\n  The President is acting because Congress has refused to act to pass \ncomprehensive immigration reform. Even when the Republicans in the \nSenate had a bipartisan bill, it did not get the chance to have a vote \nin this House. So the President has acted.\n  President Reagan, to his credit, acted even after Congress acted, and \nhe signed their bill into law, and then he said back to Congress that \nyou didn't go far enough to protect families. So he initiated, by \nexecutive action, Family Fairness. That was carried on by President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush, and the spirit of all of that was carried \non by President George W. Bush, all of those, including President \nClinton in between and President Obama, were\n\n[[Page H1439]]\n\nstrong, strong advocates for comprehensive immigration reform and \nrespecting the role that immigrants play as a consistent reinvigoration \nof America.\n  So, by law, legal authority and by precedent, legal authority, the \nPresident has the right to do this. If it was okay when President \nReagan did it and President George Herbert Walker Bush did it, why \nisn't it okay when President Obama takes these same administration acts \nand, as I said, affecting a smaller percentage of people than President \nReagan did?\n  So here we go. It is long past time for us to have comprehensive \nimmigration reform that honors our heritage and our history. \nImmigration has always been the reinvigoration of America. Each wave of \nimmigrants brings their hopes, their aspirations, their faith, their \nwork ethic, and their determination to succeed to our shores.\n  Let us not tear families apart and deport young DREAMers and their \nparents. Let us oppose this radical, narrow-minded, anti-immigrant \nresolution. This St. Patrick's Day, let us recognize the immense \ncontributions that immigrants of all cultures and all creeds have made \nto the past, to the present, and to the greatness of America.\n  Happy St. Patrick's Day.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, consistent with what we have seen for the last 8 years \nby a White House and administration, so we see here on the floor of the \nHouse of Representatives a denial of trying to follow the law but, \nrather, to blame people, including using the word ``discriminatory'' \nand trying to attach that to a party.\n  Mr. Speaker, in fact, this issue is far different. This is based upon \nrule of law. In the Federal District Court in the Southern District of \nTexas, during the trial, there was a determination that was being \npushed about whether DACA would be characterized as an exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion. In fact, when challenged, because this was a \nclaim that the administration made, that Federal district court \nexamined the operation of the DACA process, and despite the claim or \nthe reason why the President had this authority, that DACA was applied \non a case-by-case basis, the administration could not provide one piece \nof evidence in the Federal district court, no examples of DACA \napplicants who would meet the program's criteria.\n  Mr. Speaker, it does matter why you do something, how you do \nsomething, and, if you are going to be a professional, how you sustain \nthat which you have done, in a Federal district court, when asked \ndirectly to sustain what the assertions are, could not even sustain \ntheir answers.\n  This is why we are talking about rule of law, Mr. Speaker, and to \ncome here and ascribe insults to a party, to a Presidential process, or \nto a rule, a body that operates under rule of law, I believe misses the \npoint.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina \n(Mr. Gowdy) in order to further this example of why Republicans are on \nthe floor at this time, and he will so adequately explain our case.\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, the issue in this case actually implicates \nthe very existence of the House. The law is the reason we exist. We do \nnot exist to pass ideas or to pass suggestions. We make law with the \ncorresponding expectation that that law will be enforced, respected, \nand executed.\n  We do so because the law is the thread that holds the tapestry of \nthis country together. It is the most unifying, equalizing force that \nwe have. It makes the rich respect the poor, and it allows the \npowerless to challenge the powerful. Attempts to undermine the law, Mr. \nSpeaker, regardless of the motivation, are detrimental to the social \norder.\n  In 2014, President Obama declared unilaterally that almost 5 million \nunlawful immigrants would receive deferred action under some tortured \ndefinition of ``prosecutorial discretion.''\n  I can't help but note the word ``discretion'' means sometimes you say \nyes, and sometimes you say no. But, of course, the administration has \nnever said no. The Court found not a single time has the administration \nsaid no. So that is not prosecutorial discretion, Mr. Speaker. That is \nlawlessness.\n  You may like what the President did. I take it from some of the \nspeakers that they do, and you may actually wish what the President did \nwas actually law. You may wish--Mr. Speaker, you may wish that when \nDemocrats controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House for 2 \nyears that they had lifted a finger to do a single, solitary thing \nabout what they are talking about this morning. You may wish that. You \nmay wish that all these grandiose policies that we are talking about \nthis morning on the other side, that they cared enough about them to \nactually make law when they had a chance, but they did not.\n  They know now that one person doesn't make the law in a republic. You \nmay want to live in a country where one person makes the law, but that \nwould not be this country. You would have to look for another one.\n  The President knows this because, more than 20 times, Mr. Speaker, he \nsaid he could not do the very thing that he eventually did. His power \ndidn't change. The law didn't change. The politics is all that changed.\n  We should have seen this coming, Mr. Speaker. He warned us. On this \nvery floor, he warned us that he didn't need the people's House. He \nsaid he would do it with or without Congress. Many of you cheered when \nhe said that. Many of you cheered because you benefit from the \nnonenforcement of the law today.\n  But tomorrow will be different. Tomorrow is coming, and tomorrow will \nbe different. Tomorrow you will cry out for the enforcement of the law. \nTomorrow you will want others to follow the law.\n  We are here, Mr. Speaker, because this administration violated one \nlaw in its haste to allow others to violate yet another law. The \nadministration lost, and then they appealed. So here we are before the \nSupreme Court.\n\n  For too long, Mr. Speaker, Congress has let the executive branch \nengage in constitutional adverse possession. Today it is immigration. \nTomorrow it will be some other law. One day, I say to my friends on the \nother side of the aisle, one day your party may not control the gears \nof enforcement. One day a Republican President might decide that he or \nshe doesn't like a law and is going to ignore it and fail to enforce \nit.\n  For more than two centuries, Mr. Speaker, the law has been more \nimportant than any political issue. It has been more important than any \nelection, and it has been more important, frankly, than any one of us. \nIt binds us together, and it embodies the virtues that we cherish like \nfairness, equality, justice, and mercy.\n  We symbolize our devotion to the law with this blindfolded woman \nholding a set of scales and a sword. That blindfold keeps her focus on \nthe law. But I want you to understand this, Mr. Speaker: once that \nblindfold slips off, it is gone forever. You can want to put it back \non, but it is gone forever, because once you weaken the law, good luck \nputting it back together.\n  So once you decide that some laws are worth enforcing and some are \nnot, once you decide that some laws are worth following and others are \nnot, then you have weakened this thing we call the law, and you have \nweakened it forever.\n  Let me just say this. I will say this, Mr. Speaker. It doesn't take \nany courage to follow a law you like. That doesn't take any courage, \nfollowing a law you like? What takes courage, which makes us different, \nis we follow laws even that we don't like, and then we strive to change \nthem--legally. That is the power and the fragility of the law. But once \nit is abandoned, it is weakened in the eyes of those we expect to \nfollow it.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes\n  Mr. GOWDY. I will say this, Mr. Speaker. In conclusion, in the oath \nof citizenship that we require new citizens to take--and I am sure the \nSpeaker already knows this, and perhaps some of my colleagues on the \nother side may know this as well--but in that oath, it references the \nlaw five separate times, five separate references to this thing we call \nthe law--in the very oath that we want new citizens to take, five times \nin a single paragraph.\n  Mr. Speaker, good luck explaining why new citizens should follow the \nlaw when those in power do not have to.\n\n[[Page H1440]]\n\nGood luck explaining the difference between anarchy and the wholesale \nfailure to enforce the law simply because you do not like it. Good luck \nstopping the next President from ignoring a law that he or she does not \nlike.\n  If the President can pick and choose which laws he likes, then so can \nthe rest of us, and you have undermined the very thing that binds us \ntogether. So be careful what you do today. Tomorrow is coming.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind Members to address \ntheir remarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Castro).\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, even 100 years ago, \nif you asked somebody who was living in Asia or Latin America or Europe \nwhere on Earth they would want to go if they were going to leave their \nhome country, the answer was very clearly the United States of America.\n  We proudly say, as Americans, that we are a Nation of immigrants, yet \nthroughout the generations, immigrants from different corners of the \nworld have encountered resentment and scapegoating here in our land.\n  Today we celebrate St. Patrick's Day for the Irish. When the Irish \ncame in the 1800s, they were greeted by signs that said ``No Irish need \napply'' in cities like New York and Boston. The Chinese, for many \ndecades, were excluded from admission into the United States. The \nJapanese and Germans were interned through World War II.\n  There was an operation called ``Operation Wetback'' in the Eisenhower \nadministration that rounded up and deported thousands, if not over a \nmillion, Mexicans and Mexican Americans back to Mexico.\n  The latest iteration of those politics, the latest attempt to relive \nour worst mistakes started when a man--who may become President--called \nMexican immigrants rapists and murderers.\n  There are times in our Nation's history when our politics become a \nrace to the bottom, and it takes people of good faith, of different \npolitical stripes and beliefs, to stand up and put the brakes on it. \nSometimes we have, and sometimes we have fail to do that. But make no \nmistake that we are in one of those eras now, and this resolution \nrepresents just the beginning.\n  My colleague from Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez), about 45 minutes ago \nreferenced talk of mass deportations. That is not just talk. That is \ncoming from the leading Republican frontrunners for President.\n  Do you know what that means? That means that you are going to go pull \n2- and 3- and 4-year-old kids out of homes, from their parents \nforcibly, and send them out of here. It means that you are going to \ntake parents and drag them away from their kids, leaving them alone.\n  I know that there are people of very good faith who disagree with \nDemocrats on this issue. In fact, many have spoken today, and I respect \ntheir opinions. But I would ask all of us, as Americans, to ask \nourselves whether this represents the very best of our Nation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. The fact is we are a Nation of immigrants, we \nhave always been a Nation of immigrants, and we will always be a Nation \nof immigrants. It is what has made us strong, it is what has made us \npowerful around the world, it is what has earned us friends, and it is \nwhat has made us the envy of the world.\n  All of us have to make sure, in governing, that 50 years from now, \nwhen somebody in Europe or Latin America or Asia is asked where on \nEarth they would want to move, if they were going to leaving their home \ncountry, that the answer is still the United States of America.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his courtesy.\n  And to my fellow Texan who is managing on the other side, the \nchairman of the Rules Committee, it is a moment in history that we are \nspeaking of, and it is powerful to follow my fellow Texan on the moment \nin history that we have.\n  Earlier today, I said that as my friends on the other side were \ndebating about the will of the House, I indicated that it is a divided \nHouse, and that is not the will of the American people. It is evidenced \nin the rules.\n  So to go and suggest that any brief that would wish to overcome, if \nyou will, the President's constitutional authority is bogus; it is not \ntrue. If this was a consensus, the brief would be prepared, and all \nMembers would sign onto the brief. That is not the case.\n  As I come from Texas, let me say that much of what is being done is \nout of fear. You don't understand it. You don't understand DREAMers.\n  We do in Texas. We have a State law that allows our DREAMers to go to \ncollege, and they are making good. I see them in my office. And I know \ntheir parents, of whom we are speaking about, because some of their \nparents' children are, obviously, children who are citizens and who are \nable then at a point in time to be able to be under the DACA and the \nDAPA.\n  So let me reinforce the fact that the President has acted under \nexecutive orders that squarely fall under the Take Care Clause, as \nensuring Presidential control over those who execute and enforce the \nlaws. You can rely on Arizona v. United States, Bowsher v. Synar, \nBuckley v. Valeo, Printz v. United States, and Free Enterprise Fund v. \nPCAOB.\n  The enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity, properly may exercise their discretion to devise and \nimplement policies specific to laws they are charged with enforcing, \nthe population they serve, and the problems they face so that they can \nprioritize our Nation's resources.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Are we to kick out children who are on their way to \nsuccess and then their parents?\n  And the reason why I want to dispel this myth of fear: These parents \nare working. Maybe they are working in positions that others would not \nhave; maybe they are working alongside of fellow Americans. I don't \nadhere to in any way to think of people displacing Americans looking \nfor jobs. That is not this issue.\n  A principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion \nexercised by immigration officials. Federal officials, as an initial \nmatter--we have prioritized criminals and those who would do us harm.\n  But we are operating out of fear, just as was earlier said. When \nsomeone who--the world does not know whether he is a Presidential \ncandidate or whether he is a spokesman for America--blocks and puts his \nhand up to stop all Muslims from coming in. Who will be next? Would it \nhave been the Irish in the 1800s? Would it have been the Italians in \nthe 1900s?\n  America has to get back to reasonable lawmaking, pass a comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill, and make a difference.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to close by saying I don't want the next \nvictim of domestic violence to be thrown out.\n  Vote against this resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to both the rule (governing \ndebate of H. Res. 639, and the underlying resolution, which authorizes \nthe Speaker to appear as Amicus Curiae on behalf of the House of \nRepresentatives in the matter of United States, et al. v. Texas, et \nal., No. 15-674.\n  I oppose the resolution because it is nothing more than the \nRepublican majority's latest partisan attack on the President and \nanother diversionary tactic to avoid addressing the challenge posed by \nthe nation's broken immigration system.\n  Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 639, if adopted, would vest in the Speaker alone \nthe power to file on behalf of the full House an amicus brief with the \nSupreme Court supporting the constitutionally untenable position of 26 \nRepublican-controlled states in the matter of United States, et al. v. \nTexas, et al., No.15-674.\n  Lying at the heart of the plaintiffs' misguided and wholly partisan \ncomplaint is the specious claim that President Obama lacked the \nconstitutional and statutory authority to take executive actions to \nimplement Administration policy regard to Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents\n\n[[Page H1441]]\n\nof American Citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents, the creation of \n(DAPA).\n  This frivolous and partisan lawsuit seeks to have DACA and DAPA \ndeclared invalid and to permanently enjoin the Obama Administration \nfrom implementing these salutary policies, both of which are intended \nto keep law-abiding and peace loving immigrant families together.\n  The purely partisan nature of the resolution before is revealed by \nits text, which authorizes the Speaker to waste precious taxpayer funds \nand file on behalf of every Member of the House an amicus brief that no \nMember has seen in support of a position opposed by virtually every \nmember of the Democratic Caucus.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me briefly discuss why the executive actions taken \nby President Obama are reasonable, responsible, and within his \nconstitutional authority.\n  Pursuant to Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, the President, \nthe nation's Chief Executive, ``shall take Care that the Laws be \nfaithfully executed.''\n  In addition to establishing the President's obligation to execute the \nlaw, the Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the ``Take Care'' \nClause as ensuring presidential control over those who execute and \nenforce the law and the authority to decide how best to enforce the \nlaws. See, e.g., Arizona v. United States; Bowsher v. Synar; Buckley v. \nValeo; Printz v. United States; Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB.\n  Every law enforcement agency, including the agencies that enforce \nimmigration laws, has ``prosecutorial discretion,'' the inherent power \nto decide whom to investigate, arrest, detain, charge, and prosecute.\n  Thus, enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity (DHS), properly may exercise their discretion to devise and \nimplement policies specific to the laws they are charged with \nenforcing, the population they serve, and the problems they face so \nthat they can prioritize our nation's resources to meet mission \ncritical enforcement goals.\n  Mr. Speaker, to see the utter lack of merit in the legal position to \nbe supported by the amicus brief permitted by H. Res. 639, one need \ntake note of the fact that deferred action has been utilized in our \nnation for decades by Administrations headed by presidents of both \nparties without controversy or challenge.\n  In fact, as far back as 1976, INS and DHS leaders have issued at \nleast 11 different memoranda providing guidance on the use of similar \nforms of prosecutorial discretion.\n  Executive authority to take action is thus ``fairly wide,'' and the \nfederal government's discretion is extremely ``broad'' as the Supreme \nCourt held in the recent case of Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. \n2492, 2499 (2012), an opinion written Justice Kennedy and joined by \nChief Justice Roberts:\n  ``Congress has specified which aliens may be removed from the United \nStates and the procedures for doing so. Aliens may be removed if they \nwere inadmissible at the time of entry, have been convicted of certain \ncrimes, or meet other criteria set by federal law. Removal is a civil, \nnot criminal, matter. A principal feature of the removal system is the \nbroad discretion exercised by immigration officials. Federal officials, \nas an initial matter, must decide whether it makes sense to pursue \nremoval at all. If removal proceedings commence, aliens may seek asylum \nand other discretionary relief allowing them to remain in the country \nor at least to leave without formal removal.'' (emphasis added) \n(citations omitted).\n  The Court's decision in Arizona v. United States, also strongly \nsuggests that the executive branch's discretion in matters of \ndeportation may be exercised on an individual basis, or it may be used \nto protect entire classes of individuals such as ``[u]nauthorized \nworkers trying to support their families'' or immigrants who originate \nfrom countries torn apart by internal conflicts:\n  ``Discretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces immediate \nhuman concerns. Unauthorized workers trying to support their families, \nfor example, likely pose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who \ncommit a serious crime. The equities of an individual case may turn on \nmany factors, including whether the alien has children born in the \nUnited States, long ties to the community, or a record of distinguished \nmilitary service.\n  Some discretionary decisions involve policy choices that bear on this \nNation's international relations. Returning an alien to his own country \nmay be deemed inappropriate even where he has committed a removable \noffense or fails to meet the criteria for admission. The foreign state \nmay be mired in civil war, complicit in political persecution, or \nenduring conditions that create a real risk that the alien or his \nfamily will be harmed upon return.\n  The dynamic nature of relations with other countries requires the \nExecutive Branch to ensure that enforcement policies are consistent \nwith this Nation's foreign policy with respect to these and other \nrealities.''\n  Exercising thoughtful discretion in the enforcement of the nation's \nimmigration law saves scarce taxpayer funds, optimizes limited \nresources, and produces results that are more humane and consistent \nwith America's reputation as the most compassionate nation on earth.\n  Mr. Speaker, a DREAMER (an undocumented student) seeking to earn her \ncollege degree and aspiring to attend medical school to better herself \nand her new community is not a threat to the nation's security.\n  Law abiding but unauthorized immigrants doing honest work to support \ntheir families pose far less danger to society than human traffickers, \ndrug smugglers, or those who have committed a serious crime.\n  The President was correct in concluding that exercising his \ndiscretion regarding the implementation of DACA and DAPA policies \nenhances the safety of all members of the public, serves national \nsecurity interests, and furthers the public interest in keeping \nfamilies together.\n  Mr. Speaker, according to numerous studies conducted by the \nCongressional Budget Office, Social Security Administration, and \nCouncil of Economic Advisors, the President's DACA and DAPA directives \ngenerate substantial economic benefits to our nation.\n  For example, unfreezing DAPA and expanded DACA is estimated to \nincrease GDP by $230 billion and create an average of 28,814 jobs per \nyear over the next 10 years.\n  That is a lot of jobs.\n  Mr. Speaker, in exercising his broad discretion in the area of \nremoval proceedings, President Obama has acted responsibly and \nreasonably in determining the circumstances in which it makes sense to \npursue removal and when it does not.\n  In exercising this broad discretion, President Obama not done \nanything that is novel or unprecedented.\n  Let me cite a just a few examples of executive action taken by \nAmerican presidents, both Republican and Democratic, on issues \naffecting immigrants over the past 35 years:\n  1. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan used executive action in 1987 to \nallow 200,000 Nicaraguans facing deportation to apply for relief from \nexpulsion and work authorization.\n  2. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter exercised parole authority to \nallow Cubans to enter the U.S., and about 123,000 ``Mariel Cubans'' \nwere paroled into the U.S. by 1981.\n  3. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush issued an executive order that \ngranted Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) to certain nationals of the \nPeople's Republic of China who were in the United States.\n  4. In 1992, the Bush administration granted DED to certain nationals \nof El Salvador.\n  5. In 1997, President Bill Clinton issued an executive order granting \nDED to certain Haitians who had arrived in the United States before \nDec. 31, 1995.\n  6. In 2010, the Obama Administration began a policy of granting \nparole to the spouses, parents, and children of military members.\n  Mr. Speaker, because of the President's leadership and visionary \nexecutive action, 594,000 undocumented immigrants in my home state of \nTexas are eligible for deferred action.\n  If these immigrants are able to remain united with their families and \nreceive a temporary work permit, it would lead to a $338 million \nincrease in tax revenues, over five years.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me note that the President's laudable \nexecutive actions are a welcome development but not a substitute for \nundertaking the comprehensive reform and modernization of the nation's \nimmigration laws supported by the American people.\n  Only Congress can do that.\n  America's borders are dynamic, with constantly evolving security \nchallenges.\n  Border security must be undertaken in a manner that allows actors to \nuse pragmatism and common sense.\n  Comprehensive immigration reform is desperately needed to ensure that \nLady Liberty's lamp remains the symbol of a land that welcomes \nimmigrants to a community of immigrants and does so in a manner that \nsecures our borders and protects our homeland.\n  Instead of wasting time debating divisive and mean spirited measures \nlike H. Res. 639, we should instead seize the opportunity to pass \nlegislation that secures our borders, preserves America's character as \nthe most open and welcoming country in the history of the world, and \nwill yield hundreds of billions of dollars in economic growth.\n  I urge all Members to join me in voting against H. Res. 639.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lofgren), the ranking member of the Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Immigration and Border Security.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, we have heard some very eloquent comments\n\n[[Page H1442]]\n\ntoday. I was particularly taken by my colleague from South Carolina \n(Mr. Gowdy), the chairman of the committee, his passionate speech about \nthe rule of law. In fact, we all do agree about the importance of the \nrule of law in American life and in the vitality of our country.\n  Unfortunately, the facts of this case have nothing to do with the \nspeech given by Mr. Gowdy.\n  On November 20, 2014, a number of memoranda were issued by the \nSecretary of Homeland Security. One of them is titled: ``Policies for \nthe Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants.'' \nThat was pursuant to the 2002 action of this Congress, creating the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and directing the Secretary to \nestablish priorities for removal. And it is worth pointing out that \nthis memorandum has not been enjoined. Nobody sued to stop it. It is in \neffect. Nobody has challenged its legality. It is what is happening \nright now.\n  In fact, the only things that have been enjoined temporarily are the \nDAPA, the relief for parents, and the expansion of relief for children.\n  My colleague, who I respect and like, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nPoe), did mention that the deferred action provides benefits, health \ncare, and education. In fact, the deferred action provides no such \nbenefits. It is not a legal status. It is a deferral of deportation. It \nis revocable at any time.\n  Here is what the memorandum establishing this said:\n  ``This memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or \npathway to citizenship. Only an act of Congress can confer these \nrights. It remains within the authority of the executive branch, \nhowever, to set forth policy for the exercise of prosecutorial \ndiscretion and deferred action within the framework of existing law. \nThis memoranda is an exercise of that authority.''\n  In fact, the exercise of that authority is nothing new. We have \nmentioned earlier that President Reagan deferred action on the \ndeportation of the wives and children of those who got relief through \nthe 1986 IRCA Act that Congress passed, despite the fact that Congress \ntold him not to do it, because he had the authority to do it.\n  We have also had instances where wives of American soldiers were \ngoing to be deported. Do you know what? The President gave them \ndeferral from deportation because it was unconscionable to us that a \nsoldier fighting in Iraq or Afghanistan would have his wife deported \nwhile he is over in the battlefield.\n  We have private bills that we take up, egregious cases. Do you know \nwhat? If we ask for a report from the Department about that bill, the \nDepartment defers action on it. They defer deportation for the person \nwho is the subject of that bill.\n  We, on the committee, thank them for doing that. We know that they do \nthat, and we agree and like that they do that.\n  I mentioned earlier that the Congress, after Tiananmen Square, passed \na bill to prevent the deportation of Chinese students who had been \nmurdered, some of them, in Tiananmen Square. President Bush vetoed that \nbill. Why did he veto it? He vetoed it so he could give deferred \ndeportation to the students because it was his position--and no one \nchallenged that--it was the President's authority to do that.\n  I want to raise another issue. My friend, the Chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, mentioned earlier this morning that the House had received a \nrequest to brief this issue. I was very surprised by that. It was the \nfirst I had heard of it. It is my understanding from the paper \nsubmitted that what he was referring to was the Petition for Writ of \nCertiorari, which was granted. This is what it says:\n  ``In addition to the questions presented by the petition, the parties \nare directed to brief and argue the following question--''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. I know that Mr. Sessions is not a lawyer and I would not \nsuggest he intended to mislead this House. But the comment was, in \nfact, misleading because that is not a requirement for the House to \nbrief that point. It is simply directed to the parties in the \nlitigation, which we are not.\n  This is about whether we deport kids or not, but it is also about \nwhether we engage in rhetoric that is injurious to the public because \nit distorts the actual facts of this case.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress has repeatedly and explicitly passed laws \ndelegating enforcement authority to the executive branch in the \nimmigration context.\n  Through DAPA and the expansion of DACA, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity is simply enforcing these existing laws that have previously \nbeen passed.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  Do you know what, Mr. Speaker? Words matter.\n  In talking about the families, like Ms. Garcia's from my district, we \nreally know that, especially during a campaign season or when there is \nrhetoric on the floor, the words that those of us in elected office say \nmatter. I found that out firsthand as I talked to some of the families \nin my district who have mixed status children who turn on to VTV and \nsee some of our national politicians rail against them.\n  I asked permission to use stories from some of our families here \ntoday. In the past, it has always been very customary that they have \nsaid, ``Yes. If it will help to share my story, please share it with \nthe American people. The American people will understand that I want to \nbe with my child. What is more family oriented than that?''\n  Those are the values of the people. Yet, when I asked over the last \nfew days and when my staff asked, there were many families who said no \nto having their stories told on the House floor.\n  Why? Because major, national political figures, like Donald Trump, \nare running for higher office and are trying to win votes by promising \nthat they will do everything in their power to break up families like \nMs. Garcia's. They promise to do everything in their power to rip apart \nour communities at the core, to separate American children from one or \nboth parents. By any means necessary, they say, we will deport mothers \nand fathers of American children.\n  We are better than that, Mr. Speaker. We are better than that. DAPA \nand DACA are an enormous step forward.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield myself an additional 1 minute.\n  I find it so annoying that they argue this is Congress' job; yet the \nvery people arguing that it is Congress' job are the people who are \npreventing Congress from doing its job. Thank goodness the President \nused his executive authority, which already exists, to move forward in \nprioritizing immigration cases just as President Reagan did, just as \nPresident Bush did.\n  If those on the other side believe that Congress should solve this, \nlet them stop standing in the way.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Gowdy).\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, four really quick points.\n  I would say to my friend from Colorado, through the Speaker, that one \nreason Congress may not enact new laws is that we have absolutely zero \nconfidence they will actually be enforced. Maybe if this President \nenforced current law, we would be more willing to embark on new ones.\n  Secondly, I think Judge Poe was right. I do think part of the opinion \ndeals with the conferring of benefits, but I would invite people to \nread it for themselves.\n  Thirdly, on this issue of prosecutorial discretion, Mr. Speaker, all \nlaw enforcement agencies have limited resources, but they don't hold \npress conferences ahead of time and announce ``you are not going to be \nprosecuted or investigated if you just steal 'this' amount of money. \nYou are not going to be prosecuted or investigated if you just possess \n'this' amount of controlled substances.'' This is not prosecutorial \ndiscretion. This is a political decision to not enforce the law.\n  Lastly, I want to say--and she is my friend--I have great respect for \nMs.\n\n[[Page H1443]]\n\nLofgren, and I am actually not including her in what I am getting ready \nto say because I will bet you, in 2008, she was ready, Mr. Speaker, to \nmove on comprehensive immigration reform when nobody else was. From \n2008 to 2010, when they had all the gears of government, they didn't \nlift a finger Mr. Speaker.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, they did not lift a finger. So with all of \nthe ideas I hear my friends talking about, it just makes me wonder: \nWhere were you when you had the House? Where were you when you had the \nSenate? Where were you when you had the White House? You had all three \nof them, and you didn't do any of the things you are talking about \ndoing this morning.\n  In conclusion, yes, you are right. It is Congress' job to pass the \nlaw. As soon as you show us that you are willing to enforce it, maybe \nwe will be willing to pass some new ones; but asking us to trust an \nadministration, Mr. Speaker, that is deciding, wholesale, certain \ncategories not to enforce, we may not be smart, but we are smarter than \nthat.\n  In the final analysis, Mr. Speaker, this is an issue about the \nconstitutional equilibrium. The House needs to speak up for itself, and \nI applaud Speaker Ryan for doing exactly that.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind Members, once again, \nto please direct their remarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend from Colorado.\n  Where we were was doing a lot of business unlike we are doing now.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution.\n  I say to my friends across the aisle, who are so passionate about \nCongress having a role in this case: where was that enthusiasm when \nCongress had ample opportunity to prevent this case by doing its job \nand enacting real, bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform?\n  The only reason this case exists is that Congress did not do its job, \nand then President Obama had no choice but to act in the limited \ncapacity that he could under the law. He acted within his legal \nauthority--something I am confident the Court will affirm. He acted \nbecause it would have been inhumane not to do anything while families \nwere being torn apart by our broken immigration policies and this \nCongress' failure to act.\n  The Democratic-controlled Senate passed a comprehensive immigration \nreform bill in June of 2013, and House Republicans did nothing for more \nthan 500 days before President Obama resorted to the power of his pen. \nNow to authorize the Speaker to file an amicus brief opposing the \nPresident's actions rather than acting through the office known as the \nBipartisan Legal Advisory Group is a break from the usual procedure by \nwhich the House weighs in on a matter before the courts in which it may \nhave an interest.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentleman an additional 20 seconds.\n  Mr. HOYER. In other words, this is not regular order, as is so often \nthe cry of my Republican colleagues. This is regular disorder. I am a \nmember of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group. It was never brought to \nus. We never considered it.\n  Mr. Speaker, we ought to oppose this resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution.\n  I say to my friends across the aisle, who are so passionate about \nCongress having a role in this case--where was that enthusiasm when \nCongress had ample opportunity to prevent this case by doing its job \nand enacting real, bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform?\n  The only reason this case exists is Congress did not do its job.\n  And then President Obama had no choice but to act in the limited \ncapacity that he could under the law.\n  He acted within his legal authority--something I am confident the \ncourt will affirm.\n  And he acted because it would have been inhumane not to do anything \nwhile families were being torn apart by our broken immigration policies \nand this congress failure to fix them.\n  The Democratic-controlled Senate passed a comprehensive immigration \nreform bill in June 2013, and House Republicans did nothing for more \nthan 500 days before President Obama resorted to the Power of his pen.\n  Now, to authorize the Speaker to file an amicus brief opposing the \nPresident's actions, rather than acting through the office known as the \n``Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group,'' is a break from the usual \nprocedure by which the House weighs in on a matter before the courts in \nwhich it may have an interest.\n  This amicus brief, which no one has even yet seen, reflects this \nmajority's policy of opposing the administration's legal, policy \ndeterminations to help immigrant families after having earlier \nabandoned its reponsibility to do so through statute.\n  I was proud to be one of 225 Democratic members of the House and \nSenate to sign our own amicus brief last week supporting the \nadministration's position.\n  I'm also among the Democratic members of the House proud to cosponsor \na reslution today in support of the President's executive actions and \noffering our amicus brief as an alternative to the one Republicans are \nputting forward to represent the views of the House.\n  And I will continue to work toward the goal of comprehensive \nimmigration reform legislation that offers an earned pathway to \ncitizenship, keeps families together, and makes it easier to recruit \nand retain talented innovators and entrepreneurs from abroad to \ncontribute to our economy and create jobs here in America.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this resolution.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I inquire as to how much time remains on both \nsides.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 1 minute \nremaining. The gentleman from Colorado has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  This discussion is about my constituents, Mr. Ramos and his family. \nIt is about keeping them together. As Mr. Gowdy says, it is about \nCongress not doing its job, Democrats and Republicans. In the absence \nof Congress doing its job, thank goodness this President or any \nPresident has used his executive authority that exists under the law, \nmost recently in the form of DAPA and DACA, to provide some certainty \nto Mr. Ramos and his family so that his American kids come home from \nschool to a loving family and so that those 12 jobs Mr. Ramos and his \nwife have created in our community are protected and preserved and \ntheir business is given every ability to expand.\n  Rather than doing the right thing by debating how to fix our broken \nimmigration system, this Chamber is working, once again, to undermine \nthe only significant progress that has been achieved in recent years.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution, to support the \nfamilies of Ms. Garcia, of Mr. Ramos, and of so many others who are \nscared to be named, and to reject this approach we see today.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I believe what \nhappened up in the Rules Committee was going through regular order--\nregular order to hear the original jurisdiction and regular order as we \nwere discussing, debating, and voting on the rule. Going through \nregular order here on the floor of the House of Representatives is \nimportant, and I appreciate the American people and the Speaker in \nunderstanding what we are attempting to accomplish.\n  I also reiterate that this resolution is not about policy. It is \nabout the law. It is about the Constitution of the United States. It is \nabout the fabric of our democracy and the checks and balances which are \ndemanded by every single Member of not only this House of \nRepresentatives, but also by the American people. It is about our \nAmerican Constitution.\n  The House, I believe, must speak, will speak, and will defend its \nArticle I legislative powers on behalf of the American people. Today \nyou have watched Republicans argue thoughtfully and carefully on behalf \nof this, and I urge my colleagues to join me and the Speaker in support \nof this important resolution.\n  While we have consulted with the Committee on Ethics and been advised \nthat this\n\n[[Page H1444]]\n\nresolution complies with its guidance in the House Ethics Manual, \nsection 3 of the resolution provides further authorization for the \nSpeaker to accept pro bono assistance so there is no question as to its \npropriety.\n  Mr. Speaker, the relevant portion of the House Ethics Manual states:\n\n       ``[A]s detailed below, Members and staff may accept pro \n     bono legal assistance for certain purposes without Committee \n     permission.\n       ``As to pro bono legal assistance, a Member, officer, or \n     employee may accept such assistance without limit for the \n     following purposes:\n       ``To file an amicus brief in his or her capacity as a \n     Member of Congress;''\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my \nsupport for the President's executive actions on immigration to expand \nthe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the \ncreation of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful \nPermanent Residents (DAPA) program.\n  Soon, the Supreme Court will consider U.S. v. Texas, the case \nconcerning President Obama's executive actions on immigration to extend \ntemporary relief from deportation for undocumented immigrants who \narrived in the U.S. when they were children and eligible parents of \nAmerican citizens or legal permanent residents. These crucial programs \nhave been halted as this litigation continues and our families, our \nbusinesses, and our economy hang in the balance.\n  Today, the House Republicans brought a polarizing resolution to the \nfloor authorizing the Speaker to file an anti-immigrant amicus brief \nwith the Supreme Court opposing these executive actions. I am \ndisappointed that House Republicans are attempting to block the \nPresident's executive actions on immigration from taking effect.\n  The President acted to keep hard-working immigrant families together \nand to ensure that DREAMERS can continue to live in the only country \nthey've ever known. As co-chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus' \nImmigration Task Force, I'm hopeful that the Supreme Court will \nrecognize the legality and importance of President Obama's executive \nactions for our immigrant families. We compromise our nation's family \nvalues when we tear apart families and instill fear and mistrust among \ncommunities.\n  With so much at stake, we can't rely on the courts to correct this \ninjustice. America deserves a fair and just immigration system, and our \nhard-working immigrant families have waited long enough. It's time for \nCongress to do its job and pass comprehensive immigration reform \nimmediately.\n  Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nopposition to H. Res. 639, a misguided resolution forced on all Members \nof the House of Representatives in an attempt to block President \nObama's execution action on immigration. This is yet another partisan \neffort by House Republicans to tear families apart and separate \nchildren from their parents.\n  This amicus brief that Speaker Ryan will file on behalf of the entire \nHouse of Representatives not only goes against well-established \nConstitutional precedents but also against our economic interest. The \nCongressional Budget Office and numerous other researchers have found \nthat immigration raises average wages for U.S. born workers and grows \nour economy by billions of dollars. In my State of California alone, \nthe President's Executive action will generate 130,000 jobs and lift \n40,000 Californian children out of poverty.\n  The actions taken by the President on the subject of immigration are \nwithin authority of the executive branch. I am proud to join 186 of my \nHouse colleagues in support of the President's immigration executive \nactions.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to House \nResolution 639, which would allow the Speaker to file an amicus brief \non behalf of the entire House of Representatives in United States v. \nTexas.\n  This case deals with critical executive actions implementing \nimmigration initiatives that will strengthen our communities, protect \nthe dignity of families, enhance public safety and national security, \nraise average wages for U.S.-born workers, and grow our economy by tens \nof billions of dollars.\n  Unfortunately, the majority opposes these initiatives and now seeks \nto influence this pending appeal before the Supreme Court.\n  I oppose this resolution for several reasons.\n  First, it is entirely unnecessary. Earlier this month, 185 of my \ncolleagues and I filed an amicus brief in this case with the Supreme \nCourt.\n  And other individual Members of this body are already free to file \ntheir own amicus briefs as well.\n  The Speaker, however, has chosen to expend legislative time on this \nmeasure instead of focusing on what Americans truly care about. \nAmericans are worried about jobs, about overwhelming student loan debt, \nand in my State, the safety of the drinking water.\n  Another problem with this resolution is that it authorizes the filing \nof an amicus brief on behalf of the entire House of Representatives in \nUnited States v. Texas when in fact it would not reflect the views of \nthe entire legislative body.\n  The amicus brief authorized pursuant to House Resolution 639 would \nrepresent the views of only the Republican majority.\n  The majority should not be able to bind the minority to this ill-\nconceived and misleading undertaking.\n  Finally, we have already thoroughly debated the constitutionality of \nthe President's executive actions and it is clear that the Deferred \nAction for Parents of Americans and expanded Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals immigration programs are lawful exercises of \nexecutive discretion.\n  Presidents from both parties, including George H.W. Bush and Ronald \nRegan, have routinely used similar deferred deportation policies to \npromote family unity in our immigration system.\n  These programs are commonsense solutions to our broken immigration \nsystem that has divided families for decades.\n  The Supreme Court is the proper venue to resolve this issue, and I am \nconfident the Court will find these actions consistent with the law and \nthe Constitution.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to oppose this ill conceived and \nwasteful resolution.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to \nthis resolution. H. Res. 639 is an unprecedented measure by the House \nMajority to make its opposition to deferred action the official policy \nof the United States House of Representatives.\n  A resolution offering the full House to file an amicus has never been \ndone before. Last week, I proudly joined 222 congressional colleagues \nin sending a amicus brief to the Supreme Court in support of immigrant \ncommunities and deferred action. House Republicans are welcome to do \nthe very same. However, to send a brief in the name of the full House \nand the American people is unprecedented and unwarranted.\n  DAPA, Deferred Action for Parental Accountability, and expanded DACA, \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, created by the President's 2014 \nExecutive Order, would give over 5 million immigrants living in our \ncountry today--including an estimated 182,000 immigrants living in \nHarris County, Texas--the opportunity to no longer live in fear and a \nshot at the American Dream.\n  The President's Executive Order that created DAPA and expands DACA is \nentirely within the Department of Homeland Security's legal authority \nto grant or deny applications for deferred action. Congress has \nexplicitly passed laws delegating broad immigration enforcement \nauthority to the Executive Branch.\n  There is a strong historical precedent for DAPA: During the \nadministrations of President Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, \ndeferred action was granted to hundreds of thousands of immigrants in \nthe 1980's and early 1990's.\n  All of this would be completely unnecessary, Mr. Speaker, if the \nHouse Majority had stood with the American people in the last Congress \nand passed comprehensive immigration reform. Instead, we will be voting \non an unprecedented resolution that has little, if anything, to do with \nfixing our nation's broken immigration system and everything to do with \nthe political season.\n  I sincerely hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, many \nof whom I have worked with for years and consider good friends, will \nnot allow the People's House, or their party, to adopt the anti-\nimmigrant views of Donald Trump. Mr. Trump's demagoguery and \nfearmongering against immigrants who came to this country for a better \nlife--just like our forefathers and foremothers before us--must not be \nallowed to become the sanctioned policy of Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand with me and \nvote against this needless and unprecedented resolution.\n  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res. 639. \nThis bill would allow Speaker Ryan, on behalf of the House, to file an \namicus brief in the Supreme Court case on expanded Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans \nand Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). An amicus brief submitted by the \nHouse of Representatives should convey the sentiments of the entire \nHouse and not just those of the Republican party--a party whose \nfrontrunner in the presidential campaign has maligned our immigrant \ncommunities with hateful and demeaning rhetoric. The Speaker and his \nparty do not speak for the whole House on this matter, and they \ncertainly do not speak for me.\n  I support the president's executive actions to expand DACA and \nimplement DAPA. Every president for more than fifty years, regardless \nof party, has taken executive action on immigration, including \nPresidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. President Obama's\n\n[[Page H1445]]\n\nactions are a step forward in allowing more people to come out of the \nshadows to participate more fully in our communities.\n  If Speaker Ryan and House Republicans are serious about reforming our \nbroken immigration system, they should not waste time and taxpayer \nmoney on partisan political stunts. Instead, I call on the Speaker to \nbring his caucus to the table to help negotiate a sensible, bipartisan \nimmigration reform package that will enhance our national security, \nprotect the dignity of families, grow our economy, and put millions of \nimmigrants on a path to citizenship.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express frustration and \ndisappointment in my Republican colleagues' obstinate and insulting \ndiscussion about President Obama's Executive Action on Immigration. We \nare a nation built on the shoulders of immigrants. For most of us, our \nfamily trees will reflect a history with roots in other nations--making \nus the sons and daughters of immigrants ourselves. It has become \nprofoundly clear, however, that many of us today have forgotten this.\n   The arguments being made on the House floor today not only \ndisrespect the legacy of the immigrants who helped shape this nation, \nbut it undermines the authorities we entrust to our nations President. \nSimply put, the Executive Action taken to address the immigration \ncrisis in this country fall wholly and legally into his executive \nauthority. DACA and DAPA are necessary in approaching our immigration \npolicy in a compassionate and humane way. We are not prepared to rip \nbabies from the arms of their mothers and deport them. We do not \nsupport destroying the families of hardworking men and women who came \nhere looking for a better life. We are better than that. America is \nbetter than that.\n   We all recognize that the President is responsible for upholding and \nexecuting the laws passed by this Congress. The actions taken on \nimmigration policy are not only legal but necessary, yet my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle appear to ignorantly and vehemently \ndisagree. So to them I ask, if this approach to immigration reform does \nnot sit well with you, why don't you instead do your job and bring \nforward legislation on comprehensive immigration reform and let us vote \non it in this House? You've made it clear in this discussion today that \nyou understand that it is Congress' job to create immigration law and \nyet, all I see is a Party content to sit on its hands and scream at the \nadministration for taking the action that they refuse to take \nthemselves. This nation is ready for comprehensive immigration reform. \nOur constituents deserve answers, our hardworking immigrant families \ndeserve relief and our undocumented guests, who work tirelessly to \ncontribute to the economy of this country, deserve a clear and fair \npathway to citizenship.\n   I support comprehensive immigration reform. I do not support this \nill conceived resolution. I urge a no vote.\n  Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, today, the House is taking up H. Res. \n639, authorizing the Speaker to appear as amicus curiae on behalf of \nthe House of Representatives in the matter of United States v. Texas \nconcerning the creation of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans \nand Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program and the expansion of the \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. I adamantly \noppose H. Res. 639. Congress needs to prioritize and pass comprehensive \nimmigration reform instead of wasting precious time with partisan, \nbackwards legislation like H. Res. 639.\n  For over a decade, Democrats and Republicans in both houses have been \ntrying to pass immigration reform. My colleagues and I have voted \nrepeatedly against Republican attempts to defund DACA and have signed a \ndischarge petition requesting a vote on comprehensive immigration \nreform. Because Arizona is a border state, we have suffered from years \nof federal inaction to fix our broken system. It's time for leadership \nto stop trying to obstruct programs like DAPA and DACA, which are \nkeeping Arizona families together, and pass comprehensive immigration \nreform to address border security in our state, offer a fair but tough \npathway to citizenship and provide an effective system to meet \nArizona's and the country's labor needs.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 649, the previous question is ordered on \nthe resolution.\n  The question is on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcCarthy), the majority leader and my friend, for the purpose of \ninquiring about the schedule for the week to come.\n  (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour \nand 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until \n6:30. On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and \nnoon for legislative business, and on Wednesday, the House will meet at \n9 a.m. for legislative business. No votes are expected in the House on \nThursday or Friday.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next \nweek, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will also consider H.R. 2745, the SMARTER Act, \nsponsored by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold). The bill will \nensure that no matter who reviews mergers and acquisitions, be it the \nFederal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice, there will be \nuniform rules so that every transaction is reviewed fairly.\n  I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for that information.\n  I did not see or hear ``the budget for this coming year.'' I know the \nCommittee on the Budget marked up the budget yesterday. As I understand \nit, they completed their work, and they have reported a budget. I do \nnot see it on the calendar for next week, which means that the earliest \nwe could consider a budget would be April.\n  Speaker Ryan, as the majority leader knows so well, indicated we are \ngoing to pursue regular order, which would be the adoption of a budget, \nthe establishment of a 302(a) allocation, which means the overall \nexpenditure level for discretionary spending, and then the markup and \nconsideration in this House of the 12 appropriation bills.\n  It would appear, if we are not going to do it next week, could we \nexpect to see the budget on the floor, Mr. Leader, in April?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  The gentleman is correct that the Committee on the Budget \nsuccessfully reported a budget resolution last night. I want to take a \nmoment to thank Committee on the Budget Chairman Tom Price for his \nwork, and the whole committee.\n  There are more conversations among Members which will be required \nbefore moving the budget to the floor, and therefore it will not be \nscheduled for the upcoming abbreviated week, but I will let the \ngentleman know as soon as we do schedule it.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for that information.\n  As the gentleman probably recalls, back in January Majority Whip \nScalise was quoted as saying: ``We will forge ahead with spending bills \nand other initiatives in the coming year.'' He implied that the House \nwould start early on its appropriation bills.\n  Now, I can remember, as a long-time member of the Committee on \nAppropriations, that early for us was early\n\n[[Page H1448]]\n\nMay for actual appropriation bills to be on the floor. In December, \nSpeaker Ryan stated: ``By having this budget agreement that my \npredecessor put in place, we no longer have a dispute over the \nsequester.''\n  Now, it is my understanding, Mr. Leader, that the budget that is \nbeing proposed is inconsistent with and does not carry out the \nagreement that was made between the Speaker and our leader and on which \nthe House voted, a significant majority of the House voted to pass a \nbudget deal. It is my understanding this budget does not carry it out.\n  After saying: Let's set aside the dispute over the sequester, the \nSpeaker went on to say: ``By getting the slate cleaned now''--Mr. \nLeader, this was December 22 that the Speaker said this. ``By getting \nthe slate cleaned now''--which meant this argument over sequester, \nwhich of course your chairman of the Committee on Appropriations has \nsaid is unreasonable and unworkable, in effect, and ``ill-advised'' was \nthe word that he specifically used.\n  The Speaker said: ``By getting the slate cleaned''--by making that \ndeal--``by getting this behind us, we can start our appropriations \nprocess early next year''--now, we are beyond early next year, of \ncourse--``and do it the right way, individual bills, all 12 bills, open \nup the process . . . do it the way the Founders intended in the first \nplace.''\n  My question to you is, Mr. Leader, do you expect that we will start \nconsidering appropriation bills on or before the end of April? Does the \nmajority leader contemplate the consideration of all 12 appropriation \nbills, as the Speaker indicated he wanted to do, with full \nconsideration open to amendment prior to the July adjournment, for \nessentially 6 weeks, coming back in September?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  You always make me smile when you come with your quotes. At times \nthey seem selective.\n  Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time just for a second, it always gives me \ngreat pleasure to bring a smile to your face, Mr. Leader.\n  I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Well, if the gentleman just wished me happy St. \nPatrick's Day, that would have done the same thing.\n  Mr. HOYER. I will wish you happy St. Patrick's Day, and I \ncongratulate Kelly on that beautiful green blouse she is wearing.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for his mood today, but I do want \nto correct the Record; and this is probably a good reason why we are \nnot bringing the budget to a shortened week next week, because you have \nsome misinformation.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  The budget that passed the committee abides by the exact number of \nwhat the agreement was. So I would find that you would probably be very \nsupportive.\n  Secondly, one thing that I would find is that it is our full \nintention to do all the appropriations bills on the floor. We believe \nin regular order. I remember a time here when I was in the minority \nthat we didn't have any appropriations bills on the floor. I did not \nspend the time to get the old quotes about that, because I think \nAmerica wants us to move forward.\n  We want to allow time for conversations on the budget.\n  Appropriations have been going through with their committee meetings. \nSo we are in line to get them done on time and moving them forward.\n  Mr. HOYER. I appreciate the gentleman's comments and observations.\n  He and I, frankly, have a factual disagreement on whether or not the \nbudget that was reported out does, in fact, reflect the agreement. \nTechnically, he may be accurate.\n  But, of course, the problem with this budget taking so long to \npresent--which I know the majority leader and the Speaker were hopeful \nit would have been done either in very late February or very early of \nthis month--clearly, the disagreement, as everybody knows, is that so \nmany of your caucus did not want to abide by the agreement that the \nthree leaders of their party voted for back in December. And we \nunderstand there are additional actions going on to placate those on \nyour side of the aisle who don't want to follow the agreement; and, in \nfact, they are looking for cuts beyond to return to sequester. That is \nwhy I referred to the sequester in my opening remarks, although the \nSpeaker said we have gotten beyond that argument. Well, obviously, we \nhaven't gotten beyond that argument. And that is, obviously, why your \nbudget has been delayed and why we are not considering it before we \nleave here for the Easter break and, therefore, will not consider the \nbudget in March.\n  So I understand that we have a different perspective perhaps--not a \ndisagreement necessarily, but a different perspective on what the \nbudget process is presenting.\n  If I can go on, Mr. Leader, let me ask you this. Very frankly, we are \nconcerned about adjourning next week. We are very concerned, Mr. \nLeader, that we have a brief week. Essentially, in the 2 weeks that we \nhave been here--this week and next--we are going to be meeting 3 full \ndays. We come in at 6:30 on one day. We will leave early today. We will \nleave early on Wednesday of next week.\n  We have three crises confronting Americans, and we ought to be \ndealing with those, Mr. Leader. We would urge that we not adjourn next \nWednesday. We would urge that we meet Thursday. Friday, of course, is \nGood Friday; and Sunday is Easter. Those are very serious holidays for \nan overwhelming number of us, and we ought to observe those.\n  But in the spirit of that holiday--of Good Friday and of Easter--we \nought to at least sacrifice some of our time in the week following that \nto address these three crises.\n  Mr. Leader, I just had the opportunity to meet with a young man, who \nis in the eighth grade, and his brother, who is in the sixth grade. \nThey are from Flint, Michigan. They have to pay for the water that they \ndrink at school because the water at school is unsafe for them to \ndrink.\n  Now, the administration has dealt with that, partially. Those of us \nwho have been to Flint, Michigan, have seen a lot of people on the \nground--from Health and Human Services to the CDC to the Health \nDepartment, from a lot of agencies of the Federal Government there to \nhelp. We should be acting on giving some direct help to Flint, \nMichigan, and assisting.\n  It is, I think, unfathomable why the State of Michigan that caused \nthis problem by shifting the water supply from Lake Huron through \nDetroit to the city of Flint--controlled by a receiver, appointed by \nthe Governor, not the mayor or council of Flint, Michigan. It is \nunimaginable to me that we would be charging children for water that \nthey ought to be supplied, as almost every school in America does.\n  So, we ought to be dealing with Flint.\n  Secondly, Mr. Leader, we have a crisis for a large number of \nAmericans. Both of these crises are somewhat related but are separate \nand distinct issues we ought to be dealing with, and you and I have had \nthe opportunity to discuss them. I appreciate your leadership and \nconcern.\n  You and I convened a joint meeting with the Department of Health and \nHuman Services; with the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention; NIAID and NIH's Tony Fauci; Secretary Burwell; and Dr. \nFrieden were there talking to us about Zika.\n  Zika is a health crisis for America and for Americans, and we ought \nto be dealing with that. We ought to be dealing with it by giving to \nthe administration the resources it needs to respond to this to make \nsure that America's health is safe and to make sure that the Americans \nwho are living in Puerto Rico have the resources to deal with the \neradication of the mosquito that transmits this disease and is a threat \nto health generally, but particularly the health, as the gentleman \nknows, of pregnant women or women who may become pregnant.\n  So Flint and Zika.\n  Lastly, I would mention that we ought to be dealing with the crisis \nthat confronts Americans in Puerto Rico who are going to be unable to \npay their bills. On May 1, they will have another large indebtedness \ndue.\n  We have been considering for many months now the authorization for \nPuerto Rico to be able to declare bankruptcy so that it can, in a \nreasonable, ordered fashion, settle that which they owe in a way that \nthey can accomplish.\n\n[[Page H1449]]\n\n  All three of these issues, Mr. Leader, we believe are critically \nimportant for us to address now. They have been pending for months--\nsome for as long as a year, in terms of Puerto Rico's prospective \nbankruptcy.\n  I would ask the leader if he would consider coming back after Easter \nand doing the work that we ought to be doing to meet these three \ncrises. I believe if we did so, the American people would say that we \nare a responsible body doing the work that needs to be done.\n  Frankly, Mr. Leader, over the last 3 weeks, we have done things that \ncould have mostly been done under suspension. We are filling time. We \nneed to fill that time with policies addressing the crises that \nconfront us.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  There are three questions in there, and I want to answer each and \nevery one of them.\n  As the gentleman did note, next week is Holy Week. We have Holy \nThursday; we have Good Friday, and, of course, Easter.\n  Now, the gentleman spoke with great passion, but there is one thing I \nthink you missed in this. I hope you have the same passion for those at \nthe EPA who knew of Flint and stayed silent, who did not warn those of \nthe water that had been poisoned.\n  The gentleman talks very boldly about wanting things done, but we \nshould talk about what has happened.\n  As we speak today, we just had a hearing on Flint, Michigan, where \nyou had Gina McCarthy in; you had the Governor of Michigan in.\n  Secondly, the gentleman knows that, when it comes to Zika, we had a \nmeeting together, where we pulled in all those in government who are \ndealing with this issue. And they will tell you, there is no short \nanswer for it. They will tell you the mosquito is not as easy as just \nspraying. And they will tell you, each and every day, they are learning \nsomething more.\n  The White House did not send us a supplemental until just a few weeks \nago. We have done nothing but move even faster. There is no agency--\nfrom the NIH or the CDC--lacking in money to be acting today, and they \nwill answer that question for you. They have money to go forward and do \nthe work that they need to do and that we believe needs to happen. We \ncan argue later about where that money comes from. But in no way have \nwe stopped or slowed down. We have actually been in front of this.\n  If I recall correctly, it was me who approached you on the floor and \nrequested that we work together on this. It was me who called you and \nsaid: Let's make this bipartisan. So we brought all the committee \nmembers in with the Secretary and Directors. So in no way do I want the \nAmerican public to think for one moment that we are not doing the work.\n  Now, there is not one easy answer for it. You can look around the \nworld to Australia; they have been battling this for quite some time. \nThere are challenges, but we want to make sure we get it done. I want \nto work with you to make that happen, but I don't want to play \npolitical games with it.\n  You know as well as I do, if you think we are here just on Good \nFriday and there is going to be a fundamental change, there won't be. \nBut we are making change on the work we are doing.\n  When it comes to Puerto Rico, we have been working on Puerto Rico. We \nhave been working on Puerto Rico so much, the committee chairman just \nwent there the last time we had a district work period to investigate. \nSo did Congressman Sensenbrenner and Chairman Bishop.\n  Yesterday the Speaker, myself, the committee chair from the Judiciary \nCommittee, Congressmen Goodlatte, Sensenbrenner, and Bishop, all met. \nAfter that meeting, Congressman Sensenbrenner directly went to speak to \nLeader Pelosi on what we are doing because we are doing this in a \nbipartisan manner. I think you are going to see hearings being \nscheduled very shortly. We want to get this right.\n  I understand your frustration because my frustration is across the \nChamber over here with the Senate, because we have acted many times on \nthe direction of where we are going.\n  The last part I would bring up is that we are going to have \ndisagreements on the budget. And maybe your argument is thinking the \nbudgets are different. They are different. We have brought a budget to \nthe floor every year we have been in the majority here, and they have \nbalanced. Every time the President has sent a budget here and we have \nput this on the floor, there have only been two votes on the other side \nof the aisle for the President's budget.\n  So, yes, we are going to have disagreements on the budget because we \nare going to fight over here to balance the budget and give us a \nbrighter future. And, yes, maybe philosophically, you think we need to \nspend more money. But that is a disagreement that I think the American \npublic expect you and I to have a disagreement on and fight for what we \nphilosophically believe in.\n  I just firmly disagree with your last question on all three--not from \na basis of politics, but a basis between you and I knowing what we are \ndoing. You and I both know personally what we have been working on. We \nhaven't hidden the fact. We haven't made it partisan. We have been very \nopen with it. We are going to solve the problem.\n  I am not going to play political games with you and say, if you come \non a Saturday, we are going to solve it. I am going to put us in a room \non the exact day that we should be. I am going to have the experts in \nthe room as well. We can disagree with where we want to go. But at the \nend of the day, we are going to solve the problem.\n  And I welcome working with you as we solve them.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments.\n  I want everybody to know that he is correct. He came to me to work in \na bipartisan fashion. In fact, we have come to one another at various \ntimes to work in a bipartisan fashion. And I am pleased to work with \nthe majority leader.\n  I think the majority leader--as I have said with him not present and \nI will say it here today--is someone with whom I can work, have worked, \nand expect to work. I think he is honest and straightforward when he \nmakes his representations to me, Mr. Speaker, so I want to thank him \nfor that.\n  But I want to reference all three of the issues that you just \ndiscussed. I am going to go in the opposite direction you went. The \ngentleman started out with the EPA. I am going to start out with the \nbudget.\n  As the gentleman I am sure knows, there is a $1.5 trillion asterisk \nin this budget: savings to be determined at some time in the future. \nHooray. What courage.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  What I am saying about the budget is we had a deal. We agreed, in a \nbipartisan fashion, an agreement that you and I both voted for.\n  Mr. Speaker, we both voted for it. It wasn't what either of us \nprobably wanted, Mr. Speaker, but it was an agreement. It was \ncompromise. It was how this body should and does work.\n  And the problem is we have had such great difficulty saying we are \ngoing to implement that agreement, notwithstanding what Speaker Ryan \nsaid just a few months ago.\n  So from the budget standpoint, A, I don't share the gentleman's \noptimistic view, Mr. Speaker, that it is balanced. It is easy to put an \nasterisk in there and say we are going to get $1.5 trillion somewhere, \nsomehow, from someplace. It is much more difficult to say where you are \ngoing to get it. And what the American people have seen is that \nasterisk is never realized.\n  So he and I disagree on the fact that, A, we haven't worked in a \nbipartisan fashion. We did. It was very tough. The Speaker, you, Mr. \nScalise, Leader Pelosi, and I, all five of us voted for an agreement.\n  Very frankly, it is our perception, Mr. Speaker, that the Leader's \nside of the aisle has not been able to carry out their agreement \nbecause of internal divisions within your party. Frankly, that is \nreported on. It seems to be self-evident, and that is our view. Our \nview is we had a number agreed upon.\n  It is not about spending more money. It is what we agreed to spend, \nin a bipartisan fashion, that is not being adhered to.\n  Secondly, when the gentleman says there is money somewhere, of course \nthere is money somewhere, but it is not a zero sum game. Somebody will \nbe\n\n[[Page H1450]]\n\ndisadvantaged and hurt and left behind if we take money from the \nprogram that this Congress appropriated to be spent on Ebola.\n  The gentleman came to me, we did have a bipartisan meeting, which I \nhave referred to and the gentleman has referred to. Tony Fauci was \nthere, Secretary Burwell was there, Dr. Frieden was there from the \nCenters for Disease Control.\n  All of them said that the suggestion that we take money from Ebola \nand put it towards Zika would harm the effort to ensure that Ebola does \nnot come back to our shores and, in fact, is controlled overseas as \nwell, because if it is overseas, it will ultimately come on shore here \nin America; so that they have asked for the resources to deal with Zika \nnow. The longer we wait, the more difficult it will be.\n  I agree with the gentleman entirely, that we are finding out new \nthings as each day goes by, as each week goes by. But the fact of the \nmatter is we need to give them the assurance that they will have the \nresources to deploy the kind of effort that we need to make sure that \nZika does not become an epidemic here in this country, in Puerto Rico, \nin the Virgin Islands, and in other places in the world.\n  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, it is, to me, very ironic. I have heard this \nyear, in years past, EPA, get out of our lives. EPA, stay out of our \ncommunities. EPA, we don't need your advice and counsel.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Governor of Michigan, knowing full well that the \nwater from the Flint River was not the kind of water that we ought to \nbe feeding to our children and to our adults, and refusing to spend the \nmoney to treat the pipes so that they would have been lined and the \nlead from the pipes would not leach into the water and adversely affect \nthe health of the children of Flint, nevertheless, went ahead.\n  In January of last year, the EPA advised the Governor of Michigan and \nthe Department of Environmental Quality in Michigan, you are getting \nlead in your water. It is dangerous. January 15, 2015.\n  Notwithstanding that advice, the Receiver, appointed by the Governor \nof Flint--the mayor wasn't in charge, the city council wasn't in \ncharge. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, appointed by \na Republican Governor, kept feeding the water to the people of Flint. \nAnd we have now determined that EPA kept after them after January 15, \nand their advice was ignored and, in fact, said, look, we have got it. \nWe can handle this. We have experts.\n  Frankly, a professor from Virginia Tech started testing the children \nand found that, tragically, the lead levels in the blood of the \nchildren of Flint were going up to dangerous and harmful levels.\n  So, Mr. Leader, very frankly, your party has made it very clear \nrepeatedly on the bills that you have brought to the floor, you don't \nwant EPA involved. I don't mean you personally. Let me make that clear, \nMr. Speaker.\n  But the votes on this floor have been to reduce EPA's authority, to \nreduce their involvement, to reduce reliance on EPA's wisdom on behalf \nof the health and environment of our country.\n  So then on all three of those issues, Mr. Speaker, let me say \nsomething in conclusion.\n  I know it is Holy Week. And what Holy Week teaches us is that we need \nto care for one another; that we need to make sure, Mr. Speaker, when \nthere are those in trouble and at risk, that we act. If that is not \nwhat Holy Week is about, I don't know what it is about.\n  We ought to be about the business of responding, Mr. Speaker, to \nthese three crises. Now, we don't have to do it on a Saturday, and I \nagree with my friend, the majority leader.\n  We say that all the time, ``my friend,'' but Kevin McCarthy is my \nfriend, Mr. Speaker. I have great respect for him. He is hardworking, \nhe is honest, and he cares about our country. Let there be no mistake.\n  But what I am trying to do, Mr. Speaker, is simply to elevate a sense \nof urgency to respond to two emergencies that confront Americans; and \nthat we, therefore, have a responsibility to act, act promptly, \ndecisively, and effectively. I am urging that we do that, and I am \nurging that we not waste time in accomplishing that objective.\n  I am through, unless the majority leader would like to respond \nfurther. I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I just want to \nrespond to a few points you made.\n  The money that we are talking about using for Zika, so nobody is \ndelayed, is leftover money from the emergency supplemental voted in \n2014. I know it is dealing with Ebola, but it is $3 billion sitting \nover there. They have some leftover money that they should make sure \nthat they don't wait 1 day to start working.\n  Now, you talk of the budget. We just passed a budget out of the \nBudget Committee that had a discretionary number of $1.07 trillion. \nNowhere does it show that that is not the agreement.\n  Now, you and I can debate a lot, but since Republicans took the \nmajority, if you look at the numbers of--and I know in your last year \nin the majority, you didn't produce a budget. But we have saved America \ntremendous, more than $800 billion by taking the majority.\n  Now, you and I both know that the real challenge for America is the \nmandatory spending, and we have to get to that.\n  Now, when you talk about the EPA, the challenge that I find, and \nnobody should ever have water like Flint had. But I am very passionate \nabout this issue. I am passionate that the children have drinking \nwater. You know why? Because that same thing is happening in my State \nbecause of lack of water.\n  Every year we have been in the majority, we have passed a bill here \ndealing with California water, but it goes nowhere in the Senate.\n  I want the same for children across the country, because it is not \njust these two areas, there are lots of places we have to deal with \nthis.\n  But if I remind the gentleman, I think it was just a month ago, \nbipartisan on this floor, the vote was 416-2, telling the EPA not to \nhold information because, when it came to Flint, they knew of it and \nthey waited months before they brought that information forward.\n  So you and I work together, just as both sides of the aisle in here. \nThey said the EPA needs to stop. If they have information on any \ncommunity, don't hold that, release it. People need to be warned. \nPeople need to be advised.\n  I was proud of the fact that both sides joined together, and I look \nforward to our being able to work on the other issues.\n  Now, you and I may have a disagreement on the timing, because what I \nhave found, these committees have been working. We want to get it \nright. And in no way, in no shape, have we not kept you, one, a part of \nit, or if we even have a meeting, advised of it.\n  Congressman Sensenbrenner walked from a meeting with the Speaker, the \ncommittee chairs, and me directly over to your Leader Pelosi, the same \ntime that we have been dealing with this within the committee, showing \nall what is being worked on, and I hope we can keep that same working \ntogether as we solve the problem.\n  I wish the gentleman from Maryland good luck in his NCAA bracket. But \nas he knows, Cal State Bakersfield has never lost in the tournament. \nNow don't take it we have never been in it, but we have never lost yet.\n  Mr. HOYER. I appreciate his wishes of good luck, and I hope they \nresult in many Maryland victories. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. Speaker, obviously, we don't have a difference on objectives. And \nyes, the gentleman from Wisconsin did walk across yesterday, yesterday.\n  The Puerto Rican bankruptcy challenge has been confronting us for \nmore than two-thirds of a year. This is not something new. Zika is new, \nbut Puerto Rico's bankruptcy challenge is not new.\n  So I am simply saying, Mr. Speaker, that these are matters of \nurgency, of crisis, and we believe that we ought to work on those. We \nbelieve working together, as the majority leader said, we can get that \ndone, and we would hope that we would do so.\n  Unless the majority leader wants to say something further, I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/house-section/article/H1450-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1450-H1451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ADJOURNMENT FROM THURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016, TO MONDAY, MARCH 21, 2016\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY.

Mr. Speaker, in celebration of Women's History Month, I \nrise to honor a pioneer for women's suffrage from my district.\n  Elizabeth Cady Stanton was born in Johnstown, New York, where she \nattended Johnstown Academy until the age of 16. As Members of this \nHouse and people across our country know, Elizabeth would go on to be \none of the true trailblazers of the women's suffrage movement for our \nNation.\n  She helped organize the Seneca Falls Convention, where she presented \na Declaration of Sentiments, a call for women's rights, proclaiming \nthat men and women are equal, which was a revolutionary concept in \n1848.\n  As the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, I certainly would not \nbe here today on the House floor without the passion, activism, and \ndedication of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. And so it is my honor to \ncelebrate her legacy today for Women's History Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/house-section/article/H1451-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH AND POVERTY\n\n  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate Women's History Month, \nbut also highlight the harmful impact of poverty on women all over our \nNation.\n  This month we celebrate Women's History Month and reflect on the \ngenerations of American women and their many contributions that have \nbrought us to this place in our history.\n  For example, as Women's History Month was being created back in the \n1970s, the Honorable, the late Shirley Chisholm, my mentor and friend, \nshe was making history. She became the first African American woman to \nserve in Congress, and the first woman and African American to run for \nPresident of the United States.\n  Throughout her career, she broke many glass ceilings, while remaining \nunbought and unbossed.\n  Today we see women challenging the status quo everywhere, from sports \nand politics, to STEM fields and corporate boardrooms. In fact, I am \nproud to serve in this Congress that has 104 women, the most in \nhistory, with our very first Speaker, Nancy Pelosi.\n  But too many women are still fighting to break down barriers and lift \nthemselves and their families out of poverty.

Mr. Speaker, in 2015, the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development released a new strategy that will affect ending \nhomelessness and the programs involved. However, this top-down approach \nis forcing homeless shelters to change the way they serve the most \nvulnerable members of their communities or risk losing access to \nFederal grants.\n  In my district, at least two different homeless shelters have lost \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in grant funding that they once \nreceived. The Esplanade House has provided a housing option to homeless \nfamilies with children in Chico, California, for over 25 years. The \nprograms they have put in place for their residents have achieved \nremarkable success rates. Because of HUD's new approach, the Esplanade \nHouse's ability to continue to help the less fortunate members of their \ncommunity is in jeopardy.\n  I have sent a letter to Secretary Castro and plan to meet with his \nstaff to make sure our concerns are heard and that this new approach is \nrevised. Indeed, it has taken away accountability of their clients, and \nnow just makes handouts.\n  A Washington-knows-best approach that doesn't take into consideration \nthe impact it has at the local level is the wrong way to fight \nhomelessness. We need to empower these local entities to be more \neffective in fighting homelessness in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/house-section/article/H1451-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HALT ANTI-IMMIGRATION PROCEEDINGS ON AMICUS BRIEF\n\n  (Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. AGUILAR.

Will they advocate ending birthright citizenship \nand repealing part of the 14th Amendment? Will it call for building \ntheir big, beautiful, 50-foot-tall wall along our southern border?\n  Comprehensive immigration reform has historically been an issue that \nreceives bipartisan support, and I welcome this discussion.

Mr. Speaker, there is no question that the \nbarrage of attacks committed by ISIL are crimes against humanity.\n  The administration's strategy in Syria and against ISIL up until now \nhas been to do the bare minimum, which has only exacerbated the \ndeteriorating situation. Assad remains in power and has, himself, \ncommitted an untold number of war crimes through the use of chemical \nweapons and barrel bombs against his own people, all while giving ISIL \ntime to develop and to strengthen.\n  Last month, the administration failed to comply with the legally \nmandated deadline to submit a plan to Congress. However, just this \nweek, the House unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution condemning \nthe attacks as genocide; and today, Secretary Kerry determined that \nChristians, Yazidis, and Shiite groups are victims of genocide. Because \nof the Obama administration's inaction and failure to develop a \ncomprehensive strategy, minorities continue to be targets for these \natrocious attacks.\n\n[[Page H1452]]\n\n  Now that the administration has begun to recognize the severity of \nthese massacres, it is time to finally create a comprehensive strategy \nthat will address the root causes of this conflict, including the \ncontinued presence of Assad in Syria.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/house-section/article/H1452-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HEZBOLLAH TERROR DESIGNATIONS\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, the Gulf \nCooperation Council pledged to designate Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy, \nas a terrorist organization. This positive move was followed up with a \nsimilar designation by the Arab League. This is in stark contrast to \nPresident Obama's strategy, where he continues to appease the Iranian \nregime at the expense of our traditional alliances in the region.\n  Do problems still exist within some of the Arab League nations as it \nrelates to support for terror and terror financing? Of course they do.\n  I will continue to press all of those nations to do more to curb \nthese problems and to tackle all extremist groups, not just Hezbollah. \nBut designating Hezbollah as a terrorist group is a step in the right \ndirection. We must work with these nations and encourage greater \ncooperation to root out all extremist groups.\n  Mr. Speaker, instead of allowing Iran's continued provocations to \npass without repercussion, the Obama administration should be holding \nIran accountable for its actions. It is long past overdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/house-section/article/H1452-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PENN STATE FARM EMPHASIZES VALUE OF AGRICULTURE\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

Mr. Speaker, I rise during National \nAgriculture Week to recognize the tireless work of our farmers, \nranchers, and producers. I am proud to represent Nebraska's Third \nDistrict, the number one agriculture district in the Nation.\n  As the world's population grows, demand for food is projected to \nincrease by as much as 60 percent by 2050. This provides great \nopportunity for Nebraska agriculture.\n  Our innovative producers utilize the latest advancements in the \nindustry, including biotechnology. When biotechnology is applied to \ncultivated crops, producers increase yields while using less land, less \nwater, and fewer chemicals. Not only is this good for the environment, \nit also lowers the cost of food at a time when one in eight people \nworldwide is suffering from chronic malnutrition.\n  Study after study has shown the safety and vast benefits of biotech \ncrops. I am confident our farmers and ranchers can meet growing global \ndemand, but the Federal Government must let them do their jobs. As \nfounder and co-chairman of the Modern Agriculture Caucus, I am \ncommitted to promoting sound policies to help producers do what they do \nbest: help feed the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/house-section/article/H1452-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NO MORE UNAUTHORIZED SPENDING\n\n  (Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS.

Mr. Speaker, facing persecution, murder, and \ntorture each day, Christians overseas are persecuted for their \nreligious beliefs. These individuals are being slaughtered, raped, and \nsold into slavery and forced to watch as their churches are burned \ndown.\n  This morning, the State Department labeled these atrocities as \ngenocide. This is mass genocide by ISIS and other radical jihadist \ngroups that is taking place throughout the world.\n  Less than a year ago, 30 Ethiopian Christian men were marched to a \nbeach, beheaded, and shot by radical Islamist terrorists because of \ntheir religion. These killers proudly put the video of the executions \non YouTube.\n  In total, over 1,000 Christians have been killed by the radical \nIslamic State. These atrocious, cold-blooded massacres are an attack on \nthe very nature of human existence: the right to practice one's \nreligion.\n  Declaring the torture, crucifixion, and murder of Christians and \ncertain religious groups genocide is now the official position of the \nUnited States. Genocide in any form is a grave injustice to those who \nare persecuted for their beliefs. Those people who murder Christians \nand other minorities because of their religion must be brought to \njustice because, Mr. Speaker, justice is what we do.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                           International law\n\n       Genocide is defined in Article 2 of the Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (1948) as \n     ``any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, \n     in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or \n     religious group, as such: killing members of the group; \n     causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the \n     group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of \n     life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in \n     whole or in part1; imposing measures intended to prevent \n     births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children \n     of the group to another group.''\n       The definition of Genocide is codified in 18 U.S. Code Sec. \n     1091:\n       (a) Basic Offense.--Whoever, whether in time of peace or in \n     time of war and with the specific intent to destroy, in whole \n     or in substantial part, a national, ethnic, racial, or \n     religious group as such--\n       (1) kills members of that group;\n       (2) causes serious bodily injury to members of that group;\n\n[[Page H1453]]\n\n       (3) causes the permanent impairment of the mental faculties \n     of members of the group through drugs, torture, or similar \n     techniques;\n       (4) subjects the group to conditions of life that are \n     intended to cause the physical destruction of the group in \n     whole or in part;\n       (5) imposes measures intended to prevent births within the \n     group; or\n       (6) transfers by force children of the group to another \n     group;\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/house-section/article/H1453-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1453-H1457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR CASE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Curbelo of Florida). Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Rothfus) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the \nmajority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on the topic of this Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, next week, the Supreme Court will hear the \nmost important religious freedom case in decades. It is Zubik v. \nBurwell. The purpose of this Special Order is to talk a little bit \nabout religious freedom and what is at stake here.\n  Before I begin, I yield to my colleague, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith), who has long been a champion of human rights across \nthe globe and understands the importance of religious freedom and is \nalso the chair of our Pro-Life Caucus.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I want to thank my good friend and \ncolleague, Keith Rothfus, for his tremendous leadership on protecting \nthe weakest and the most vulnerable among us, including the unborn and \ntheir mothers who are at risk of violence perpetrated by abortion, and \nfor his dedication to protecting conscience rights, again, the subject \nof today's Special Order.\n  Next week, the Court will hear oral argument on a landmark case for \nreligious liberty. The impact of the Court's ruling in this case cannot \nbe overstated, but the question before the Court is really quite \nsimple: Can the government coerce the Little Sisters of the Poor and \nother people of faith to violate their conscience?\n  The Obama administration is telling these religious sisters, women \nwho have given their life in service to God by taking care of the \nelderly poor, that their conscience is irrelevant and that they must \nfollow the Federal Government's conscience rather than their own.\n  This abuse of government power is absolutely antithetical to the \nAmerican principle of freedom of religion and the First Amendment. \nUnless reversed, Obama's attack on conscience rights means that \ngovernment can impose discrimination against Americans who seek to live \naccording to their faith.\n  The Little Sisters have 30 homes for the elderly across the United \nStates. Each Little Sister takes a vow of obedience to God and of \nhospitality ``to care for the aged as if they were Christ Himself,'' \nand they wear religious habits as a sign to others of God's presence in \nthe world. Yet the Obama administration is dictating to the Little \nSisters and others about how they should interpret their own religious \nbeliefs. That, in a word, is outrageous.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  The Sisters object to having their healthcare plans used to funnel \ndrugs and devices that they have a moral objection to, including drugs \nthat could even destroy a young human life. The sisters say that \nfacilitating the provision of these items is a violation of their \nreligious beliefs, and the government is saying: No, it isn't. We know \nbetter than you.\n  Under the Obama administration's coercive mandate, the Little Sisters \nand other religious organizations, like Priests for Life and Geneva \nCollege, are put in the impossible situation of being forced to violate \ntheir religious beliefs or face Obama-imposed crippling fines of $100 \nper day per employee. In the case of the Little Sisters, that would \nmean about $70 million per year.\n  This obscene penalty is completely unfair, unreasonable, and \nunconscionable. The Obama administration is saying: We will punish you; \nwe will hurt you; we will stop you from serving, unless you provide \nhealth care according to the government's conscience, not your own.\n  President Obama has no business imposing his morality on people of \nfaith, but that is exactly what this oppressive mandate does.\n  Let's make no mistake about it, this mandate is very much Obama's \nwillful intention. The imposition of this attack on religious freedom \nis no accident. It comes straight from the pages of ObamaCare.\n  In December of 2009, in the run-up to passage of ObamaCare, Senator \nMikulski offered an amendment which provided the authorizing language \nfor this oppressive mandate; and some, including Senator Casey, \nrigorously supported Senator Mikulski's amendment.\n  Mr. Speaker, when President Obama spoke in 2009 at Notre Dame \nUniversity--which, I would say parenthetically, has also filed suit \nover the mandate--he spoke about drafting a sensible conscience clause. \nYet today, protection of conscience is another highly visible broken \npromise of ObamaCare.\n  The Supreme Court, Mr. Speaker, has a duty to protect the right of \nthe Little Sisters of the Poor and others to live according to their \nconscience, to ensure that they serve the elderly poor according to \ntheir conscience.\n  Again, I thank Mr. Rothfus for his leadership.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, again, for his long \nleadership on this very important subject of protecting life and \nprotecting conscience.\n  He mentioned something about the government deciding what is or is \nnot a sincerely held belief. It has been long established, Mr. Speaker, \nthat that is up to the religious adherent-to-be, making that decision, \nnot the government, not the government to interpose itself and tell an \nindividual what is a sincerely held belief for the individual. That is \na fundamental freedom that the individual has.\n  I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa), who also has \nconcerns about what is at stake.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Rothfus.\n  Also, I appreciate following somebody like the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith), who has been a tremendous leader on life and on the \nindividual liberties that we are guaranteed and that, indeed, were the \ncornerstones of the founding of this country and are our religious \nrights. So I am glad to be able to support Mr. Rothfus today in this \nSpecial Order about our First Amendment to the Constitution.\n  We know that next Wednesday, it appears the Supreme Court will hear \noral arguments for the Little Sisters of the Poor in the consolidated \ncases of Zubik v. Burwell.\n  Now, why is it we are even having to do this? How far have we gotten \nout of touch, as a Nation and as this oppressive government, that we \nhave to go to court to assert the religious rights and freedoms of \nindividual organizations, like Little Sisters and others that are \njoining them? It is outrageous to me because, again, a cornerstone of \nthe founding of this country is religious rights.\n  The Little Sisters of the Poor is a tremendous faith-based \norganization consisting of Catholic nuns who serve the elderly in over \n30 countries around the world, giving from their hearts to help people \nin a way they see fit in their views and their religion with God.\n  My scheduler, Caitlin, hosts a weekly movie night at the Little \nSisters D.C. home, where she and many others can attest to the \nincredible work that is done by these nuns.\n  The HHS mandate under ObamaCare is now forcing religious \norganizations, like the Little Sisters, to provide health care plans, \ncontraceptives, drugs, and things that they find that are against their \nbelief system, that violate their deeply held belief system system; yet \nthe club of ObamaCare and this Federal Government, hitting them over \nthe head saying ``you have to provide this,'' goes against our founding \nprinciples, and I think the whole country should be outraged by this, \nmerely so that a few can have something provided to them for free by an \norganization that shouldn't have to be doing so.\n\n[[Page H1454]]\n\n  Indeed, John Adams once stated: ``Nothing is more dreaded than the \nnational government meddling with religion.'' It is a fundamental \nliberty critical to a thriving and free society.\n  We have been blessed in a free country, where we can have our \nexpression free, not having to adhere to a healthcare mandate or being \nforced to bake a cake because of someone else's idea of violating \nreligious views. It is not government's place to determine what a \nperson's religion requires or adheres to. Our laws should support and \nencourage citizens to worship without fear of reprisal from an \noppressive Federal Government.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for religious organizations, such as \nLittle Sisters of the Poor, and protect them from this horrific HHS \nmandate. And for the Supreme Court, once they decide to weigh in on a \ndecision, not just to have yet another partisan down-the-line decision \nbased on politics but, indeed, look into their hearts and look into \ntheir souls to what is right for the founding principles of this Nation \nand for people like Little Sisters of the Poor to carry out their God-\ngiven and God-driven agenda to help the people of the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank Mr. Rothfus for the time and for leading \nthis Special Order here today.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman LaMalfa for those \nobservations and to hear about some personal interactions with the \nLittle Sisters of the Poor and the tremendous work that they do.\n  We see the Little Sisters of the Poor at my parish about once a year. \nThey are the most unthreatening individuals you would imagine. They \nstand at the door. Some of them are older, so it appears that some of \nthem may have a little bit of arthritis as they are bent over holding a \nbasket. And in that basket is a request for donations. They beg. They \nbeg for people to support their work, which is caring for the most \nvulnerable people in our society, the elderly poor.\n  We haven't gotten here in a vacuum, Mr. Speaker. I think it is very \nimportant for us to take a look at the historical context of religious \nfreedom and its importance.\n  Freedom of religion is fundamental in our country. An interesting \nnote, here in my pocket is the Constitution, and religious freedom is \nliterally the very first freedom mentioned in our Constitution. It is \nin the Bill of Rights.\n\n  ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, \nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''\n  The very first freedom mentioned.\n  After freedom of religion, there is freedom of speech, freedom of the \npress, freedom of the right of the people to peaceably to assemble and \nto petition the government for a redress of grievances. But the very \nfirst freedom mentioned is the freedom of religion.\n  It is interesting because we also talk about rights in our society. \nAs a footnote, our founding documents--the Declaration of Independence \nand the Constitution--talk about rights. But the very first right in \none of our founding documents is the right to life.\n  In our Declaration, ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that \nall men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \ncertain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the \npursuit of happiness.''\n  The very first right in our founding documents is the right to life, \nand the very first freedom in our founding documents is the freedom of \nreligion.\n  Why was it so important? Because there is a long history, Mr. \nSpeaker, of how religion has been treated throughout the world.\n  You can go back to the beginnings of the development of the Christian \nfaith in Europe where we saw this religious sect begin in the Holy Land \nand then spread to the capital of the Roman Empire.\n  It was the Roman emperors who first persecuted the people of faith, \nwho had the Christian faith. We saw how the emperors forced early \nChristians to violate their conscience.\n  It might not seem as any big deal. All they wanted was for \nindividuals to burn a little pinch of incense before the Roman gods \nbecause the emperors were concerned about threats to the empire; and \nthey thought if they could appease the Roman gods, if they had \neverybody in the empire doing that little pinch, it was not going to \nhurt anybody.\n  In fact, a lot of Christians went along with it. But there were those \nwho did not because they could not do that in their conscience. And \nwhat happened to them? They were murdered. They were murdered because \nthey did not burn that pinch of incense to the Roman gods.\n  So we look back through history and we understand now that it was \nwrong for an all-powerful government to go after people of conscience's \nsincerely held beliefs. We all recognize that as abhorrent right now.\n  But it wasn't just 2,000 years ago or 1,800 years ago, Mr. Speaker, \nthat we saw these persecutions happening. There was a gentleman in 16th \ncentury England, in 1535. We know him now in history as ``a man for all \nseasons.'' Thomas More, an extraordinary intellect, was a poet, lawyer, \nfather, husband, Speaker of the House of Commons, chancellor.\n  Mr. More was a man of serious faith and serious conscience. He had a \nvery good relationship with his friend, King Henry VIII, but King Henry \nhad a problem. He had made an arrangement to have special permission \ngranted where he could marry the widow of his brother who had died, \nCatherine of Aragon.\n  But after some time, Henry was concerned that he did not have a male \nheir that he wanted to leave the throne to. So he thought he needed \nanother wife.\n  We know the course of history: He divorced Catherine, and he married \nAnne Boleyn. He wanted the people of England to accept that. He knew \nthat his dynasty was at stake, so he required people to accept that.\n  Thomas More, in conscience, could not. He was jailed in the Tower of \nLondon. His books were taken away. He refused to speak on the matter \nbecause he thought that silence would protect him. Then there was \nperjury, and he was convicted of treason for opposing the king, and he \nwas beheaded, all because he was following the dictates of his \nconscience.\n  This was the context, Mr. Speaker, in which Western history was \ndeveloping. And as the Renaissance was happening--and More was part of \nthe English Renaissance--and as we went into the later 16th century and \nthe 17th century, the development of thinking on religious freedom--and \nthere were religious wars throughout Europe, and all these minorities \nseemed to be getting oppressed by the government--a number of sects \ndecided that there would be a better place where they could practice \ntheir faith in conscience, and that place was the New World across the \nocean.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  It took a lot of trouble to get to the New World--dangerous new \nterritory, treacherous crossing, unknowns--but these were people who \nwere looking to build a city upon a hill. We know the stories of \nPilgrims, who sought religious freedom, and of, later, the Puritans. My \nown State, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, was established as a \ncolony where people of conscience would be protected.\n  William Penn, in his Pennsylvania Charter of Privileges in 1701, \nwrote:\n  ``No people can be truly happy, though under the greatest enjoyments \nof civil liberties, if abridged of the freedom of their conscience as \nto their religious profession and worship.''\n  Penn, himself, was jailed for his exercising his conscience, as he \nwrote from Newgate Prison in 1670:\n  ``By liberty of conscience, we understand not only a mere liberty of \nthe mind but the exercise of ourselves in a visible way of worship, \nupon our believing it to be indispensably required at our hands, that \nif we neglect it for fear or favor of any mortal man, we sin and incur \ndivine wrath.''\n  All of these individuals were seeking protection, were seeking a \nplace where they could exercise their freedom of conscience. Maybe \nthat, Mr. Speaker, is why the freedom of religion is the first freedom \nmentioned in our Bill of Rights.\n  Our Founders, the Fathers of our country, understood the importance \nof religion. President George Washington remarked in his farewell \naddress that religion and morality are ``the firmest props of the \nduties of men and citizens'' and ``the indispensable supports of the \ndispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity.''\n  Six years prior to his farewell address, Washington wrote a letter to \nthe\n\n[[Page H1455]]\n\nHebrew Congregation in Newport, Rhode Island, which contained, \narguably, one of the most beautiful articulations of religious liberty \nin American history:\n  ``The citizens of the United States of America have a right to \napplaud themselves for having given to mankind examples of an enlarged \nand liberal policy--a policy worthy of imitation. All possess alike \nliberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship. It is now no more \nthat toleration is spoken of as if it were the indulgence of one class \nof people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural \nrights, for, happily, the Government of the United States, which gives \nto bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only \nthat they who live under its protection should demean themselves as \ngood citizens in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.''\n  Alexis de Tocqueville, who visited this country in the 1830s, \nexplains in ``Democracy in America,'' in looking back at the experience \nof the Pilgrims: The Pilgrims came, de Tocqueville said, ``to make an \nidea triumph.'' They founded a community, the Pilgrims, and a society \nwhere government could not encroach on their particular religious \npractice. This is part of the fabric of our country.\n  Look at the experience in history. All of the Founders were well-\nversed in our history, the Western history--of the importance of \nconscience, of religious freedom. Outside observers coming to this \ncountry, like de Tocqueville, were seeing it and understanding the \nimportance of people of faith to correct the errors that were in our \ncountry. The movement to abolish the abominable practice of slavery \nhappened because people of faith stood up and recognized the inherent \nindignity of the practice and the violation of fundamental human \nrights. History in our country is just replete with instances of people \nof faith who have stood up to make a difference. One hundred years \nafter the end of the Civil War, it was people of faith who began the \nmarches in the South. It was people of faith from the north who went \ndown to help.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King was a pastor. He went to seminary in my home \nState of Pennsylvania, to the Crozer Theological Seminary. He was \nmotivated by what was the fabric of his life, which was grounded in \nscripture. He asked the big questions.\n  Just before his death, Dr. King says:\n  ``Conscience asks, `Is it right?' And there comes a time when we must \ntake a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but one \nmust take it because it is right.''\n  People of faith, people of conscience, we have seen them very active \nin the effort to protect all human life since the Supreme Court, in \n1973, took what then-Justice White said was an exercise in raw judicial \npower and said that certain human beings aren't persons.\n  We know that we have had more than 50 million abortions since that \ntime, but it has been people of faith who have been looking for \nsolutions, who have been seeking to help women in crisis. Whether it \nhas been Catholic charities, crisis pregnancy centers, people of faith, \nthey have been standing up and providing assistance to women in crisis, \nwalking with them, helping to carry the burdens that they are \nexperiencing--of women who have often been abandoned and isolated, who \ndon't feel like they have a friend but then who find a hotline where a \nvoice picks up--somebody who has been motivated by his faith to be \nsitting by that phone, wanting to help, asking to help.\n  Next week, the Supreme Court is going to be taking a look at this \ncase. Again, it may be the most important religious freedom case the \nCourt has heard. The Court is going to make the decision: For the \nindividual who objects to signing a form based on his religious belief, \nis that a legitimate exercise of his conscience?\n  That is not the government's decision, Mr. Speaker. The government \nshould not be subjectively telling an individual in this country, who \nhas a fundamental First Amendment right--a first freedom--to exercise \nhis religion, what is legitimate and what is not. That is what is at \nstake here.\n  It is interesting that my diocese--the diocese in which I live, the \nDiocese of Pittsburgh--is the lead plaintiff named in the case, Bishop \nZubik.\n  Bishop Zubik has written:\n  ``Religious freedom is not secondary freedom; it is the founding \nfreedom. Religious freedom in this country means that we pledge \nallegiance to both God and country, not to God or country.\n  ``We have the right not just to worship, not just to pray privately. \nWe also have the right to try to have an impact on our society for the \ncommon good. We have our rights to express our beliefs publicly and try \nto convince hearts and minds. We not only have a duty but the right to \nlive out the faith in our ministries of service.\n  ``Religious freedom is not a passive act. Religious freedom is \nintentionally action. Religious freedom has to be expressed. Religious \nfreedom has to be lived. Religious freedom has to be out in the open, \namong the people. Freedom of religion can never be confined to merely \nthe freedom to worship. It defies the Constitution and does a mortal \ninjustice to society.''\n  The First Amendment doesn't say ``freedom to worship.'' It says \n``freedom of religion.''\n  For those who are Christians, you can go to Matthew, chapter 25, and \nthe mandates that we have from Jesus.\n  Looking at whether in your life you fed the poor, clothed the naked, \ngave drink to the thirsty, visited those in prison, when you go up to \nthe pearly gates, those who have lived in accordance with Matthew 25 \nmay still ask the question: When did I help you? When?\n  ``When you did it to the least of my brothers, you did it to me.''\n  That is not happening inside the church, Mr. Speaker. That is \nhappening on the streets. It is happening in hospitals. It is happening \nin health clinics. It is happening in food banks. It is happening on \ncounseling hotlines. These are people of faith who are engaged in \npublic society, who want to help others. In a spirit of solidarity, \nthey are standing with those who are suffering, and they are wanting to \nhelp--motivated by their faith.\n  That is what the Little Sisters of the Poor do. I mentioned how the \nLittle Sisters come to my parish and beg. They are not a very \nthreatening bunch, Mr. Speaker. They have homes across the country in \nwhich they are taking care of the elderly. They offer an opportunity \nfor dignity for the people who have lived long and hard lives. At the \nend of their lives, they may not have much to show for it from a \nmonetary perspective, but they may have lived very rich lives in the \nway they were helping in their communities. That is not a condition for \ngoing to stay with the Little Sisters of the Poor. They love \nunconditionally and they provide a chance for people in their senior \nyears to have a little bit of respect and a little bit of dignity.\n  The Little Sisters of the Poor are up against a leviathan--Goliath--\nthe all-powerful United States Federal Government at the Department of \nHealth and Human Services.\n  It says, ``You will sign this. You, Sister, will sign this.''\n  ``But,'' Sister says in her conscience, ``I can't do that.''\n  ``Sister, it is an opt-out.''\n  Sister is saying, ``Yes, but if I sign that document, that sets in \nchain the provisions of services that violate my conscience. You are \nforcing me to take an act to be the cause--the cause of something I \ndon't believe in.''\n  ``But, Sister, you will. You will do this.''\n  Think back 2,000 years, 1,800 years. The Empire needs to be protected \nfrom barbarians who are going to be coming across--the Goths, whoever \nit is. We have to sacrifice just a pinch--just a pinch--to our Roman \ngods to be protected.\n  Thomas More: King Henry's surrogates go to Thomas in the tower. \n``Just sign the document. Just sign the document. It is not going to \nhurt. It will bring peace. It will make sure that the king's dynasty \nwill continue. We are tired of religious wars in Europe, and if the \nking doesn't have a male heir, then we are going to have all kinds of \ncontinued wars. There is a very good justification, Sir Thomas, to sign \nthat document.''\n  Thomas says, ``I can't. I can't.'' He lost his head.\n  People of faith in England and in Holland--wherever--knew that if \nthey got to these shores, they could live in freedom of conscience.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Now we have the all-powerful government coming in and saying: You \nwill\n\n[[Page H1456]]\n\ncomply; you will sign. Oh, Sister, that is not a violation of your \nreligious freedom. Trust us.\n  Really? Really? How is it that the Federal Government could be the \narbiter of what is a sincerely held belief? Doesn't that set the \ngovernment up perhaps as an entity itself making religious decisions?\n  I thought the Federal Government was not supposed to make religious \ndecisions. If the Federal Government has a bureau of what is a \nsincerely held religious belief, that is a pretty serious issue that \nthe Court needs to take a look at.\n  I wonder what you would call that bureau? Bureau of legitimate \nreligious practices? Bureau of legitimate religious beliefs? Bureau of \nwhat we will allow you to believe in this country? Is that what this \nis?\n  It is obvious, Mr. Speaker, that religious freedom is not a priority \nhere for those who promulgate these regulations.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek), who is a \nstalwart defender of human life.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Rothfus for setting \nup this time so we can draw attention to this case of the Little \nSisters of the Poor and for his eloquent defense of the right to life.\n  I am here today to also support the Little Sisters of the Poor and \nall the faith-based groups in our country that seek to help the poor \nand unfortunate among us.\n  Northern Michigan, where I come from, is home to many of these \norganizations, and I am very familiar with the good works that these \ngroups do in our communities. We need to be doing more to encourage \nthis type of service and make faith-based organizations even more \nimportant in our country, not put undue problems in their way and make \nthem do things that they don't believe in.\n  The undue burden that is being imposed on many of these organizations \nby the Federal Government is completely wrong. Thanks to the \nPresident's healthcare law, faith-based organizations are being forced \nto participate in a convoluted system that leads to abortion, a \npractice that is contrary to their and my deeply held beliefs.\n  I stand with the Little Sisters of the Poor and many of my \nconstituents in northern Michigan in the belief that life inside the \nwomb is just as precious as life outside the womb. Both unborn and born \nchildren have a right to life, and we have a duty to defend this right. \nThis is a civil right. This is what our country was founded upon. Life \nis the first of the freedoms that are enumerated.\n  My hope is that Americans who believe in the sanctity of life will \nkeep strong in their efforts to stop the Federal Government's intrusion \ninto our religious freedom.\n  I, myself, am frankly amazed that we live in a country that was \nfounded on the right to life and liberty--and we all have heard the \nphrase ``life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness''--and that the \nFederal Government is paying for losing a civil right: the right to \nlife.\n  I don't know what it is exactly, how this country that is founded on \nprinciples like that could have gotten to this state. It is one of the \nreasons I am standing here. I never was involved with politics in my \nlife until this administration came upon the scene and started \ndestroying the fabric of our Republic.\n  I think often, too: How does this happen? How does God allow this to \nhappen? This time in our lives, in our country, is truly a test of our \nfaith.\n  Really, Mr. Speaker, I am here to be sure that all Americans continue \nto fight and not lose the hope that our country will solve this problem \nand get out of the business of paying for abortions and the tragedy of \nabortion over the many years that it has been legal in this country. I \ncall upon those Americans to continue to work hard, to keep strong in \ntheir efforts, to bring an end to this tragedy that is going on in \nAmerica and the overreaching Federal Government that is allowing it to \nhappen.\n  I again commend Mr. Rothfus for doing this and really call out to all \nAmericans to not lose hope that we are going to put a stop to this and \nto continue to fight for the lives of the unborn and unfortunate.\n  I again applaud those faith-based organizations that continue to \nfight and go to court over this and that we need to continue to do \nthis.\n  I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to speak.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Benishek.\n  Again, you think about the dignity of the human person and, as he \ntalked about, the importance of the right to life, just a fundamental \nright.\n  Again, as I mentioned earlier, the first right in our founding \ndocuments, beginning with the first freedom being the freedom of \nreligion.\n  It is amazing to me how the freedom of religion in this country has \ninformed the world and what took root in this country 240 years ago, \nwhich is the notion that we were not going to have an established \nchurch and that we were going to allow people to freely exercise their \nfaith and how that has led to this proliferation in our country of the \npractice of faith. And comparing what is happening in the United States \nversus other countries, particularly in Europe where there was an \nestablished church, we know that more people go to church in this \ncountry than in Europe.\n  It was the American experience, I think, that has really informed \nothers, including the Catholic church, of which I am a member. I hark \nback to what President Washington had written to the Hebrew \ncongregation:\n  ``The citizens of the United States of America have a right to \napplaud themselves for having given mankind examples of an enlarged and \nliberal policy: a policy worthy of imitation. All possess, alike, \nliberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship.''\n  It is amazing to look at that letter and then to reflect how the \nCatholic church came together under, now, Pope Saint John XXIII with \nthe Second Vatican Council, which the whole idea was to open up the \nchurch and to engage modernity and to see what was out there that might \ninform how people are ordering their lives.\n  The Second Vatican Council issued a number of remarkable documents, \nincluding a declaration on religious freedom, the Dignitatis Humanae. \nIt states:\n  ``The exercise of religion, of its very nature, consists before all \nelse in those internal, voluntary and free acts whereby man sets the \ncourse of his life directly toward God. No merely human power can \neither command or prohibit acts of this kind.''\n  The Second Vatican Council, they had to recognize how religious \nfreedom developed in this country because there was no coercion. \nConversely, there is the long history going back hundreds of years, \ncenturies, back to the Roman martyrs where the emperor was forcing \npeople to act against their conscience, King Henry VIII.\n  Here we have, today, an all-powerful Federal Government sitting in \njudgment on what somebody's sincerely held belief is. The Court needs \nto protect this fundamental freedom. The Court needs to protect \nconscience. This country is a better place because of it.\n  It is interesting because, as the Affordable Care Act has been \nimplemented, the purported compelling interests that the government \nuses about providing access to health care, they have set up a regime, \na scheme where not every single plan is being required to provide the \nservices that the Little Sisters of the Poor find objectionable or that \nthe Diocese of Pittsburgh would find objectionable or Geneva College, a \nChristian college in my district, would find objectionable, because \nthey grandfathered some plans. They grandfathered plans that cover \nmillions of people.\n\n  So I guess it is a compelling interest when they are going after a \nlittle religious charity, but it is not a compelling interest if they \nare going against a big corporation that might have a grandfathered \nplan.\n  Oh, it is just signing a little paper, Sister.\n  No, it is not; it is coercion.\n  If the Little Sisters of the Poor are providing health insurance to \ntheir employees without the mandated services that include abortion-\ncausing drugs, if they provide a health plan that covers cancer, covers \nmaternity benefits, covers a broken bone at the emergency room, but \ndoesn't cover those services they find objectionable, they will be \nfined $36,500 a year for one person. All told, when you add it all up, \nit is $70\n\n[[Page H1457]]\n\nmillion. But if they provide no plan--no plan at all--it is $2,000 per \nemployee. If that doesn't send a message of coercion, I don't know what \ndoes.\n  I urge the Court to recognize the right of conscience and to be \ntolerant of that. This country is a wonderful country. ``Tolerance'' is \none of the words that we have inscribed down here on the rostrum of the \nHouse of Representatives--``tolerance.''\n  It is a two-way street, Mr. Speaker, and I would urge the folks at \nthe Department of Health and Human Services to give a better \nappreciation for tolerance.\n  This country just has a long history of protecting religious freedom \nfrom the very beginning through the movement to abolish slavery, \nthrough the movement to ask for the cashing of the promissory note that \nReverend Dr. Martin Luther King talked about, to the pro-life movement, \nto the charities, the hospitals, the clinics, the schools, and the food \nbanks that have all been run by religious organizations. It is about \nthese organizations wanting to take care of people.\n  Although not a party to the case, I think of a story involving the \nMissionaries of Charity, that order founded by blessed Teresa of \nCalcutta, who will be canonized a Catholic saint this September by Pope \nFrancis, who spoke here in this Chamber.\n  Mother Teresa's nuns have established a number of homes around the \nworld. We know that they had a home for the elderly in Yemen, and some \nof those residents were murdered just weeks ago by radical jihadists. \nFour of the sisters were murdered as well.\n  Mother Teresa has established homes in our country, and I remember \nhearing a story about a home in San Francisco in either the late 1980s \nor early 1990s. It was a home that was caring for people with AIDS. \nThere was a story of one gentleman who was going to die, and he needed \na place to stay.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  The Missionaries of Charity took him in, and they nursed him back to \nhealth. He went back out and continued his life, but he got sick again \nand came back again. The sisters welcomed him back.\n  As he neared the end of his life, he was scared until Mother Teresa \npicked him up in her arms. For once in his life, he found unconditional \nlove and peace because a person of faith whom we all recognize did \ngreat things because of faith, that person found peace.\n  Millions of people in this country have found peace because of the \nfree exercise of religion. Let's not crush that. Let's protect these \nfundamental freedoms of religious freedom, the tremendous good that is \nbeing done. We should not make religious organizations adjuncts of the \nall-powerful Federal Government: You can practice your charity as long \nas you do it the way we want you to. We lose something there, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. Speaker?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Babin). The gentleman from Pennsylvania \nhas 11 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I am going to yield the balance of my time \nto the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), who has long been an \nadvocate for the types of freedoms I have been talking about, religious \nfreedom, and the first right that we have been talking about, the right \nto life.\n  I yield to Mr. Gohmert.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), my friend. I mean, just within days of Mr. \nRothfus arriving here at the Capitol as a United States Congressman, we \nwere together, abiding together, standing together, and it has been my \ngreat honor to do so. I have come to know his heart. He is a man of \nintellect, a man of character.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. So the gentleman from Texas will control the time, I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to join my colleagues in \nsupport of fundamental American values, among which are commitments to \nreligious freedom, human rights, and religious expression.\n  As a Catholic, my faith plays a significant role in every aspect of \nmy life and fosters a respect for the religious rights and freedoms of \nothers.\n  Next week, the Supreme Court will hear from our religious non-profit \norganizations, including the Little Sisters of the Poor, which have \nchallenged the HHS mandate and its impact on their religious rights and \nfreedoms.\n  I believe in the importance of patient-centered health care for \nwomen, and I also want to ensure that conscience rights and religious \nliberties are protected.\n  At its core, this case is about the state forcing religious \norganizations to provide for services that violate their beliefs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/house-section/article/H1457-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1457-H1460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FREEDOM OF RELIGION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, to hear my friend Mr. Rothfus talk about \nthe Little Sisters of the Poor--I have not met them personally as he \nhas. I don't know them personally as he does, but it is rather clear \nthey bear a great deal of resemblance in the way they carry themselves, \nin the way they help others, in the way they are incredibly selfless, \nthat they are living their lives truly committed to doing what Jesus \nsaid when he said: If you love me, you will tend my sheep.\n  These Little Sisters of the Poor, these Catholic nuns, since I \nhaven't met them personally and dealt with them personally, as the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), my friend, has, I take it \nfrom his description and from what I have seen of them on television \nand heard them speak on radio and television and in the written media, \nthese are precious, extraordinary women, the kind of people about which \nJesus spoke when he said: They will inherit the Earth.\n  Unfortunately, between that time when they inherit all things, they \nhave to endure the slings and arrows of people who ridicule and \npersecute Christians for their beliefs. It is so remarkable that we are \nsupposed to have this incredibly educated judiciary, this incredibly \neducated group of people in the United States, when, as I have heard \nrepeatedly in my district over the last few months, you know, there is \nsense, s-e-n-s-e, in Washington and at the Capitol, but it's not common \nsense there.\n  It is common sense where the Little Sisters of the Poor are located. \nIt is common sense where I live in Texas, common sense among the 12 \ncounties that I travel constantly. There are places around the country \nit is common sense, but not here, because the people around the country \ncan read the First Amendment to our Constitution. It says Congress \nshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or \nprohibiting the free exercise thereof.\n  This is a Nation, according to our Founders, who had a tremendous \namount to say about our foundation. I know that we have had people \neducated to the level of Ph.D.--perhaps even beyond, whatever that is--\nand yet they have not gotten a complete education of the basis on which \nthis Nation was founded. They have been convinced by people who have \ntaken tiny little parts of our founding and seen little trees and \nshrubs and ignored the forest.\n  If people on the Supreme Court and in our Federal court system would \ndare to look at a full history of this Nation, they might actually read \nwhat the Pilgrims themselves said in their own writing, their own \nagreement, because in 1620, November 11, 1620--I am quoting from the \nPilgrims:\n  ``In the name of God, Amen . . . having undertaken, for the glory of \nGod, and advancement of the Christian faith, and honor of our king and \ncountry, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of \nVirginia, do by these presents solemnly and mutually in the presence of \nGod and one of another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a \ncivil body politick.''\n  Or how about September 26, 1642, some educational institution called \nHarvard that has also been educating people out of common sense. Thank \nGod there are people who have graduated from Harvard and have been able \nto maintain some level of common sense. But Harvard said:\n  ``Let every student be plainly instructed and earnestly pressed to \nconsider well the main end of his life and studies is to know God and \nJesus Christ, which is eternal life (John 17:3) and therefore to lay \nChrist in the bottom as the only foundation of all sound knowledge and \nlearning. And seeing the Lord only giveth wisdom, let every\n\n[[Page H1458]]\n\none seriously set himself by prayer in secret to seek it of Him \n(Proverbs 2:3).''\n  Or how about this entry in George Washington's prayer book. Perhaps \nsome of our courts' liberal judges, some of them have probably heard of \nGeorge Washington, and I know in some of our schools we have had to \ndrop the study of real history because they are teaching to the \nridiculous test that some bureaucrats think should be appropriate \nbecause the Federal Government has gotten too involved and gone beyond \nwhat the Constitution allows them to require and do. But George \nWashington's prayer book included this prayer:\n  ``O, most glorious God and Jesus Christ, I acknowledge and confess my \nfaults in the weak and imperfect performance of the duties of this day. \nI called on Thee for pardon and forgiveness of sins, but so coldly and \ncarelessly that my prayers are come my sin and stand in need of pardon. \nI have heard Thy holy word, but with such deadness of spirit that I \nhave been an unprofitable and forgetful hearer . . . Let me live \naccording to those holy rules which Thou hast this day prescribed in \nThy holy word. Direct me to the true object, Jesus Christ, the way, the \ntruth and life. Bless, O Lord, all the people of this land.''\n  Wow. That was the father of our country, in his prayer book that is.\n  So I think about the wisdom. Proverbs says fear the Lord's beginning \nof wisdom, and I think about the wisdom of a lady who is not that well \nformally educated, Ms. Milam in Mount Pleasant, Texas, one of my \nmother's best friends.\n  My late mother had some awesome friends, and I loved to hear them \ntalk.\n  Ms. Milam's daughter, Emma Lou, was talking to her mother, Ms. Milam, \nand it was my great honor when I was able to drive as a 14-year-old and \nMs. Milam would call over and tell my mother: Tell Louie I have got \nsome homemade rolls.\n  And I would head over to Ms. Milam's house because they were \nincredible. She had real butter.\n  She didn't have a very advanced education. I don't know if she got to \nseventh or eighth grade. I know she didn't go too far at all in school, \nbut she was a very, very smart woman. And having discussions, sometimes \neating rolls and real butter, and hearing the wisdom of this lady--I \nthink she was 90, maybe, when she said this, but her daughter was \ntalking about someone there in our hometown where I was growing up, \nMount Pleasant, and she mentioned a guy there.\n  Ms. Milam said: He is a fool.\n  Emma Lou, her daughter, said: Mother, he has his Ph.D.\n  Ms. Milam said: I don't care. He will always be a p-h-u-l, fool.\n  There are people in this country, they may have their Ph.D.s, but \nthey will always be, as dear Ms. Milam, Emma Lou Leftwhich's mother, \nyou say he will still be a p-h-u-l, fool.\n  She may not have been the most accurate speller, but she knew a fool \nwhen she saw and heard one.\n  So we have people who have not been properly educated about our \nhistory, and so they go about miseducating others by telling people \nlike me when we were students: By the way, Benjamin Franklin was a \ndeist, someone who believes if there was something that created the \nuniverse and it didn't just all amazingly happen from a big bang or \nwhatever--some of us believe there could be a big bang and still have \nbeen intelligent design to what happened.\n  But we were told Ben Franklin, no, he didn't believe that there was a \nGod that intervened in the ways of man, that if there was a deity or \nsomething of force that set things in motion, that that thing, force, \ndeity, whatever it is, if it still exists, it never interferes with the \nlaws of nature, the ways of man. It just lets everything play out, so \nwe are on our own.\n\n  But if you look at the words Ben Franklin wrote and spoke himself, we \nknow what he said in 1787, June, at the Constitutional Convention, \nbecause he was asked for a copy. He wrote it down. Madison took notes, \nbut Franklin wrote it down. In part, he says--and, of course, he was 80 \nyears old, a couple years away from meeting his Judge, his Maker. This \nbrilliant man said:\n  ``I have lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more \nconvincing proofs I see of this truth--that God governs in the affairs \nof men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His''--\nGod's--``notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his \naid?''\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  ``We have been assured, sir, in the sacred writings that `except the \nLord build the house, they labor in vain that build it.' ''\n  He said:\n  ``I firmly believe this; and I also believe that, without His \nconcurring aid, we shall succeed in this political building no better \nthan the builders of Babel; we shall be divided by our little partial \nlocal interests . . . and we ourselves shall beome a reproach and a \nbyword down to future ages.''\n  This is a man who is one of the greatest Founders of this country, \nwho made clear, standing before all of these brilliant people in \nPhiladelphia and the little Independence Hall and told them unashamedly \nthat if we do not invoke God's help here in our effort to put together \na Constitution that this country will work and live under, then we will \nsucceed no better than the builders of Babel. It will all come crashing \ndown, as the Tower of Babel did.\n  Yet we get far enough from that amazing speech in 1787--and yes, it \nis true that because they didn't have a treasury; they didn't have \nmoney; they weren't getting paid; they weren't able to hire a chaplain, \nas they had throughout the Revolution. The Continental Congress had a \nchaplain that led in prayer every day before they started.\n  They didn't have money. They didn't have a treasury. They couldn't \nhire a chaplain. There were denominations of Christians there that \ndidn't trust other members to do a prayer that was satisfactory for \nall, so they all had to hire a chaplain during the Continental Congress \ndays to do the prayer for everyone, that they could all be assured was \na fair prayer to each of the Christian sects. Even the Quakers would \nnot get upset if they picked the right Christian chaplain. So that is \nwhat they did.\n  But it is true, after Franklin made this speech, that it was pointed \nout they have got no money. They can't hire a chaplain. So they will \nget to that later--and later, they did. Because since that first day \nthat Congress was sworn in, in 1789, in Federal Hall there in New York, \nright after George Washington put his hand on his own Bible and added \nthe words to the end of his oath of office ``so help me God,'' he goes \nin, he makes a brief speech--back in those days, they did that, a brief \nspeech--to Congress. Then they all went down to St. Paul's Chapel, \nwhich is still there, that was protected from the concrete and debris \nand steel--all those things that came flying--totally protected by a \nsycamore tree that fell there in the cemetery. It was totally \nprotected--even the fragile stained glass windows--from any harm.\n  The chapel where George Washington and the first Congress, after they \nwere sworn in, came down Wall Street and actually had a prayer service \ntogether in St. Paul's Chapel.\n  Is it any wonder that, after 9/11, the only building that was not \nharmed in what was considered part of Ground Zero was St. Paul's \nChapel, where that first prayer session came together? Jonathan Cahn \nhas written eloquently about that.\n  When I was there a few months after 9/11, that is where everybody was \nbringing their wreaths and their messages that just broke your heart: \nHas anyone seen this person? It is St. Paul's Chapel.\n  It is not just me that says it. But let's go to another of our \nFounders. A lot of people don't know that he was a Founder, Noah \nWebster.\n  In 1783, Noah Webster wrote and published the first book on proper \nspelling for words, which eventually morphed into our dictionary. \nGeneration after generation has learned at the hands of Noah Webster, \nand a lot of people don't realize what an important role Noah Webster \nhad as a thinker, as a brilliant man, as a confidant to George \nWashington, as a confidant to Alexander Hamilton, another of our \nFounders.\n  But that brilliant man, Noah Webster, said this:\n  ``The moral principles and precepts contained in the Scriptures ought \nto form the basis of all of our civil constitutions and laws. All the \nmiseries and evils which men suffer from vice, crime, ambition, \ninjustice, oppression, slavery, and war, proceed from their despising \nor neglecting the precepts contained in the Bible.''\n  Wow.\n\n[[Page H1459]]\n\n  Of course, Jedidiah Morse, the father of American geography, as he is \ncalled, and the father of Samuel B. Morse, stated:\n  ``Whenever the pillars of Christianity shall be overthrown, our \npresent republican forms of government, and all the blessings which \nflow from them, must fall with them.''\n  Of course, this is what the Supreme Court has been doing, the very \nthing that our Founders, including this direct statement of Jedidiah \nMorse made: when the pillars of Christianity fall, then self-government \nis going to fall with it.\n  And that is why John Adams had made the point that he did, that this \nform of government is intended only for a religious and moral people. \nIt is totally ineffective to govern any other kind.\n  Yes, they had some things wrong. No one should have been enslaved \nwhen a Constitution and a Bill of Rights were adopted, as it was. No \none should have been. People should have been treated equally--not by \nbehavior or conduct, because there have to be laws governing behavior \nand conduct and choices--but regarding things that you have no control \nover: race, creed, color, gender, national origin. And it took a little \nwhile to get that right.\n  People talk about Jefferson. People say he didn't even believe in \nGod. Are you kidding me? Jefferson, whose memorial is not far from this \nvery Capitol--a beautiful dome overlooking the Tidal Basin--has \ninscribed on the walls:\n  ``Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a \nconviction that these liberties are the gift of God?''\n  John Quincy Adams, our youngest diplomat in the history of the United \nStates, appointed by George Washington. Became President in the \nelection of 1824. He was the only person to have been President and, \nafter he was President--defeated in 1828 by Andrew Jackson--runs for \nCongress in 1830. Nobody ever did that before or since. Why would \nanybody run for Congress after they had been President?\n  Well, in the case of John Quincy Adams, it was because he believed \nGod had called him to do what William Wilberforce was doing and had \nalmost completed doing in the British Empire, and that is, eliminating \nslavery because of his beliefs of the teachings in the Bible.\n  By the way, John Quincy Adams overlapped with Lincoln for about a \nyear just down the hall here. We now call it Statuary Hall. It has got \na brass plate where his desk was. There is a brass plate where a \nskinny, not that handsome guy sat in the very back for 2 years, \noverlapped with Adams.\n  I asked the historian Steve Mansfield about this. He said, there is \nno question about it that Abraham Lincoln, sitting at the back of \nStatuary Hall--the back of the House Chamber down the hall, listening \nto the speeches of John Quincy Adams over and over about the evils of \nslavery and how in the world could we expect God to continue blessing \nAmerica when we are putting brothers and sisters in chains? He said, \nthere is no question; those speeches materially affected Lincoln more \nthan anything else in his 2 brief years in the House of \nRepresentatives, so much so that after the compromise of 1850 and \nslavery appeared to be perpetuated, that eventually he had to get back \ninvolved in politics to try to get rid of slavery.\n\n  Why? Because Lincoln, who started as an infidel, as Mansfield's book \n``Lincoln's Battle With God'' points out, he bragged about being an \ninfidel in the early 1820s. But by the time he became President, he had \nno question whatsoever: There is a God Almighty who has control of the \nuniverse. He does let us make free choices. And Lincoln felt like he \nmay have made some wrong choices that contributed to trouble in the \ncountry that broke his heart, caused him depression. But he believed.\n  He was materially affected by the man who believed that God had \ncalled him to bring an end to slavery. And in obedient response to what \nhe believed was God's calling, he materially affected that young \nfreshman sitting at the back of Statuary Hall to the point that he \nended up being the leader that brought about the end of slavery.\n  My friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus) was quoting from and \nrelating to Martin Luther King, Jr. What was he? He was an ordained \nChristian minister who believed in God, who believed in the saving \ngrace of Jesus Christ, just like the little Sisters of the Poor, who \nhave dedicated their lives to helping others who don't have the ability \nto care for themselves. They have spent so much of their lives that \nwould equate to millions and millions of dollars providing health care \nand help to people in need.\n  And what happens? We have, as Thomas Jefferson related, gotten so far \nfrom remembering where our rights come from that this Nation is in \nperil of continuing to stay free.\n  You have other statements. John Quincy Adams says:\n  ``The highest glory of the American Revolution was this: It connected \nin one indissoluble bond the principles of civil government with the \nprinciples of Christianity.''\n  From the day of the Declaration, they--the American people--were \nbound by the laws of God and by the laws of the gospel which they \nnearly all acknowledged as the rules of their conduct.\n  Well, certainly.\n  Under the freedom of religion in our First Amendment that was adopted \nJune 15, 1790, nobody can be forced to become a Christian. God gives us \nfree choice. And that is part of the foundation of this Nation and the \nfreedoms. And the minute that a majority of this country think our \nfreedoms come from a government, those freedoms are gone.\n  The Nation--at least a majority--must accept that our freedoms are a \ngift from God that should be protected by the government, and the \nminute a majority believes otherwise, then it is--as defendants used to \nsay, after they were sentenced in my court, sometimes they would say: \nIt is all over but the slow talking and the low walking.\n  And so it will be over for this Nation when a majority believes that \nfreedom is something this government in Washington gives benevolently \nto us. Because once that belief is a majority belief, then the \ngovernment giveth and the government taketh away.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  What that government will find, as every government that has ever \nbeen instituted, whether king, dictator, emperor, Parliament, Congress, \nit ultimately will always find that when you do not know the basis, the \nfoundation of the world, then your government will not last just a \nwhole lot longer. That is why the Founders kept trying to make sure we \nunderstood this.\n  Alexis de Tocqueville, that my friend, Mr. Rothfus, referenced, who \ncame over here to do a study of what was making America so special and \ngreat. This one is not often quoted, but it is a quote from 1835:\n\n       There is no country in the world where the Christian \n     religion retains a greater influence over the souls of men \n     than in America, and there can be no greater proof of its \n     utility and of its conformity to human nature than that its \n     influence is powerfully felt over the most enlightened and \n     free nation of the Earth.\n\n  There are so many quotes that are part of our history. Franklin \nRoosevelt, 1935, says:\n\n       We cannot read the history of our rising development as a \n     nation, without reckoning with the place the Bible has \n     occupied in shaping the advances of the Republic. Where we \n     have been the truest and most consistent in obeying its \n     precepts, we have attained the greatest measure of \n     contentment and prosperity.\n\n  It was the Ambassador to the U.N. from Lebanon, and later President \nof the U.N. of the General Assembly said this in 1958, ``Whoever tries \nto conceive the American word without taking full account of the \nsuffering and love of salvation of Christ is only dreaming.\n  ``I know how embarrassing this matter is to politicians, bureaucrats, \nbusinessmen and cynics, but whatever these honored men think, the \nirrefutable truth is that the soul of America is at its best and \nhighest Christian.''\n  But you don't have to be a Christian. You can be an atheist, \nagnostic, Buddhist, Muslim, whatever you want to be, as long as the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights is foremost in your guiding \nprinciple here in this country.\n  But this administration has done what really would be unthinkable in \nany other administration. It basically has an undeclared--publicly \nundeclared war against Christianity. And it has\n\n[[Page H1460]]\n\nsown seeds around the world so that when I have met and wept with \npeople, victims in Nigeria and around the world, they don't understand \nwhy America doesn't stand up against Christian genocide around the \nworld and their suffering. Because when you look, the United States \nGovernment will litigate against the Little Sisters of the Poor, Mother \nTeresa, basically, and say: You have got to believe what we tell you to \nbelieve. You have got to practice the religious beliefs we tell you to \nbelieve. We don't care how moral and Christian and wonderful and humble \nand helpful you have been. We don't care. You are going to do what the \nnew God of this country says, the five majority on the Supreme Court. \nThat is the new God.\n  It is about marriage. It is about everything else. Until the five \nmajority in the Supreme Court wake up and allow freedom of religion not \nto be prohibited, consistent with the First Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution, then we have not a whole lot of time left as a \nfree people.\n  As an Australian group told me, if something happens to the United \nStates, forget trying to come to Australia. We are gone as soon as you \nare.\n  It is time we stand up and make sure religious freedom lives again \ncompletely free in America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/house-section/article/H1460-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATE BILL REFERRED\n\n  A bill of the Senate of the following title was taken from the \nSpeaker's table and, under the rule, referred as follows:\n\n       S. 719.
