The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nAlabama (Ms. Sewell) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I rise on Restoration \nTuesday to honor my guest to tonight's State of the Union Address. Ms. \nSheyann Webb-Christburg of Montgomery, Alabama, will be joining me as \nmy special guest to President Obama's final State of the Union Address.\n  Sheyann was 8 years old and was one of the youngest foot soldiers who \nmarched from Selma to Montgomery. I believe that Sheyann is the \nembodiment of the struggle for voting rights equality in Alabama and in \nAmerica.\n  On this Restoration Tuesday, it is my sincere hope that her presence \nwill remind us of the modern-day fight for ensuring that every American \ncitizen has access to the ballot box.\n  At an early age, Sheyann recognized that America had failed to live \nup to its own promise by depriving African Americans of their sacred \nright to vote. Sheyann's bravery reminded those around her that they \nare fighting for the next generation--her generation--as fervently as \nthey were fighting for their own. Her courage also made it possible for \nme to represent our hometown of Selma in Congress.\n  On a personal level, I am thankful to call Sheyann my friend and \nmentor. She was my childhood babysitter, so I literally grew up in her \nshadow.\n  Her presence at President Obama's final State of the Union should \nonce again remind us of the gravity of our responsibility to protect \nthe vote for all Americans. Since the civil rights era ended, there are \nnow modern-day barriers to voting. Since the Supreme Court struck down \nsection 4 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in 2013, my office has made \nrestoring this critically important section one of our top priorities.\n  For the past 3 years, my State of the Union guest has represented a \ndifferent aspect of the voting rights movement:\n  In 2014, my guest to the State of the Union was Selma's mayor, George \nEvans. As mayor of the birthplace of the Voting Rights Act, he \nrepresented the dynamic role Selma and her leaders have played in the \nfight for voter equality.\n  In 2015, I invited the 104-year-old Amelia Boynton Robinson as my \nguest to the State of the Union. As the matriarch of the voting rights \nmovement, Amelia challenged an unfair and unjust system that kept \nAfrican Americans from exercising their constitutionally protected \nright to vote. I will always cherish the time we spent together when \nshe honored me as my special guest.\n  I think it is befitting that since last year my special guest was the \noldest living foot soldier, that my guest this year would be the \nyoungest living foot soldier--Sheyann Webb.\n  All of these individuals have paved the way for me to accomplish all \nthat I have today, and I am forever grateful. Their legacy should \ninspire us not to take for granted the very sacred vote, and that is \nthe right to vote. Their sacrifices remind us that there is much more \nwork to be done, and my hope is that this Chamber will take on the \nchallenge of doing that work.\n  We should try to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I think that \nour work begins even today. I hope that Sheyann Webb, as my special \nguest to the State of the Union, will remind all of us that it is \nreally important that we protect the sacred right to vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H283-5", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H283-H284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DANGERS OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RECKLESS REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT AGENDA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed more light on \nPresident Obama's reckless refugee resettlement agenda and the danger \nthat it poses to Americans.\n  In my office, we are getting many calls about this as you hear about \nthe new plans that he has and also as our constituents watch the news \nof what is happening in Germany and what is happening in other \ncommunities. Let me cite just a couple of examples.\n\n[[Page H284]]\n\n  Last week, according to The Wall Street Journal and numerous media \noutlets, two refugees from Iraq were arrested for making false \nstatements involving terrorism. These arrests took place one in \nCalifornia and one in Texas.\n  In the California arrest, one refugee came to the U.S. in 2012 and \nsubsequently traveled to Syria in November 2013. He bragged in social \nmedia posts about fighting alongside terrorist groups such as Ansar al-\nIslam. This refugee returned to the U.S. a few months later. When \ninterviewed by the FBI in October 2014, he denied being a part of any \nextremist group and denied providing materiel support to terrorists.\n  What we found in Texas is this. The refugee was charged on three \ncounts: attempting to provide materiel support to the Islamic State, \nprocuring citizenship or naturalization unlawfully, and making false \nstatements.\n  This is precisely why President Obama's plan to admit thousands of \nadditional Syrian refugees into the country at a time of heightened \njihadist threats and the San Bernardino massacre is beyond reckless and \nis dangerous to our communities.\n  There is no way to vet the refugees that are coming from Syria and \nIraq and verify that they are the person represented on the documents \nthat they carry. Are the documents false, or is the person who they say \nthey are or someone else? It proves what many have been saying for \nmonths about Islamic extremists: they can and will exploit the refugee \nprogram.\n  These arrests showcase what is so painfully obvious to the American \npeople: the President's agenda is endangering our national security, \nand it is costing our hardworking taxpayers millions of dollars.\n  Let me ask you a few questions:\n  Do you feel more or less safe than you did 8 years ago?\n  Do you fear the attack of terrorism in your community?\n  Do you question your safety when you go to a public event?\n  How does the President's foreign policy and our national security \naffect where you work and where you live?\n  How can the administration be so naive?\n  How can the administration continue to put partisan politics over the \nsafety of the American people?\n  How can the administration continually refuse to name our enemy?\n  Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic extremism. We must confront \nthe danger of radical extremism and check the President's irresponsible \nresettlement agenda.\n  I want to mention H.R. 4218. It is legislation that I drafted and \nintroduced with Representatives Barletta, DesJarlais, and Lamar Smith. \nUnder the bill, no funding would be made available for refugee \nresettlement operations until four conditions are met:\n  Number one, Congress passes a joint resolution approving of the \nPresident's refugee resettlement plan;\n  Number two, CBO provides a report to Congress scoring the long-term \ncost of the program;\n  Number three, DHS submits a report identifying all terrorists and \ncriminal activity connected to refugees since 2001;\n  And number four, the President submits a report to Congress on the \nprior year's cost of admitting refugees and proposes offset spending \ncuts to pay for the resettlement program.\n  We must halt the President's refugee resettlement operations. It is \nsimply too dangerous, and we cannot afford the risk to our Nation's \nsecurity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H284-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HUMAN TRAFFICKING MONTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Bass) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, January is Human Trafficking Month, and I rise \ntoday to continue to be a voice for the countless victims of human \ntrafficking in the United States.\n  If we, as Members of Congress, want to truly address the sex \ntrafficking epidemic, we must face the facts. We must acknowledge and \naddress the direct link between children in the foster care system and \nchildren who become victims of sex trafficking. For far too many \nchildren, the foster care system is an unwitting gateway to sex \ntrafficking. This is a nationwide issue that requires a Federal \nresponse.\n  In 2010, 59 percent of the children arrested on prostitution-related \ncharges in L.A. County were in the foster care system. A 2007 report \nfrom the U.S. Department of Justice found that 85 percent of identified \nchild sex trafficking victims in New York State also had contact with \nthe child welfare system. Further, according to the FBI, an estimated \n70 percent of child sex trafficking victims in Florida had histories \nwith the child welfare system.\n  Children in the foster care system are our children. When they fall \nvictim to trafficking, it means that all of us have failed. To help all \nvictims of trafficking, including foster youth, we must change our \nmindset on how we address this horrific crime.\n  A child who cannot consent to sex should never be called a \nprostitute. The men who prey on them are not johns; they are child \nmolesters.\n  ``T'' Ortiz Walker Pettigrew is a former foster care youth who became \na sex trafficking victim. When she was 15 and still in foster care, \n``T,'' as she is called, was arrested for prostitution. While serving \ntime in juvenile hall, she discovered that more than half of the girls \nserving with her were also charged with solicitation and, like her, \nforced to sell themselves.\n  She described her treatment in juvenile hall as how you would treat a \ndog in a kennel. She was put in a box and kept waiting. She was treated \nlike a criminal and did not receive any counseling or support services. \nBecause she was punished and not helped, she was arrested again when \nshe was 16 years old, and she spent her 17th birthday in juvenile hall.\n  I am grateful that she found the strength and support to escape from \nher pimp. She now uses her voice to advocate for sex trafficking \nvictims and to urge policymakers at all levels of government to do our \njobs to prevent young girls from becoming sex trafficking victims.\n  Because of actions from women like ``T,'' local officials in Los \nAngeles have changed their approach to addressing this issue. They \nhaven't realized that arresting the victims won't solve the problem.\n  Last year, L.A. County Sheriff Jim McDonell announced that his \ndepartment will immediately stop arresting children on prostitution \ncharges. This announcement was coupled by the L.A. County Board of \nSupervisors adopting a countywide effort to ensure that child victims \nof sex trafficking are truly treated as victims and receive the support \nservices they need instead of punishment.\n  Last year, this Congress came together as Democrats and Republicans \nto pass comprehensive human trafficking legislation, but our work does \nnot end when the bill is signed. We must also use our positions to urge \nlocal officials in our districts to follow the best practices used \naround the country.\n  To truly make a difference this Human Trafficking Awareness Month, I \nurge all Members to reach out to their local sheriffs and local elected \nofficials and urge them to learn from Los Angeles and begin treating \nsex trafficking victims as victims. Although the legislation is a great \nstep forward, we should also use the power of our voices and our \npositions to ensure that more girls get the help they need instead of \nbeing treated as criminals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H284-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H284-H285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  CUBA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as we get further away from December \n17, 2014, the date that President Obama announced his change in U.S. \npolicy toward Cuba, it has become apparent that there could be no \nabusive or provocative act committed by the tyrannical Castro regime \nthat the Obama administration is not willing to overlook or willing to \nexcuse.\n  Even after the Cuban regime was caught red-handed shipping surface-\nto-air missiles, two MiG aircraft, and tons of Cuban-made weapons and \nmunitions to North Korea in violation of several U.N. Security Council \nresolutions, it could not stop President Obama's desire to placate the \nCastros.\n  This and the most recent revelation that the United States Government \nfound out in June of 2014 that Cuba managed to come into possession of \na\n\n[[Page H285]]\n\nU.S. Hellfire missile and continues, to this day, to turn over that \nsensitive military technology are not isolated events. Both incidents \nunderscore exactly how egregiously the administration has erred and the \nextraordinary lengths to which the President will go in order to hide \nthese transgressions from Congress and from the American people.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  You see, Mr. Speaker, after the President made his December 17, 2014, \nannouncement, it has been revealed that not only did the administration \nkeep Congress uninformed of the negotiations, but the negotiations had \nbeen taking place for over a year and a half.\n  If we follow the timeline, that means that these secret negotiations \nwere taking place after the administration was already made aware that \nthe Castros were in possession of a U.S. Hellfire missile and after \nHavana sent the illicit shipment of arms to Pyongyang.\n  Even after the administration offered concession after concession to \nthe Castros--the loosening of restrictions on travel, the opening of \nEmbassies--the list goes on and on--the President refused to make the \nreturning of sensitive missile technology a precondition to the \nnegotiations or to the implementation of this misguided policy.\n  Let's stop and think about this for a second, Mr. Speaker.\n  The President has given the Castro regime almost everything it could \nhave asked for. What did we ask for in return? Did we demand free and \nfair elections? Of course not. Did we demand the end of the persecution \nof dissidents and the release of political prisoners? You have got to \nbe kidding. Of course not. Did we demand the regime stop the long list \nof human rights abuses? No.\n  In fact, just this past Sunday, over 200 people were arrested in Cuba \nbecause they were calling for religious tolerance. But never mind that. \nLet's look at the cool, classic Chevys that are all through the streets \nof Havana. That is what we are supposed to be talking about.\n  The President didn't even demand that the Communist regime, with \nknown and close military ties to Russia, China, and North Korea, turn \nover to the U.S. the Hellfire missile it had been in possession of \nsince June of 2014.\n  I don't need to remind my colleagues of how incredibly dangerous it \nis for the Castros to be in possession of this sensitive military \ntechnology or how incredibly damaging it could be to our own national \nsecurity interests when, not if, the regime turns that technology over \nto one of our adversaries.\n  Last year both the Russian Minister of Defense and China's top \nmilitary official visited Havana to discuss ways to strengthen their \nmilitary cooperation efforts with Cuba, and a senior Castro regime \nofficial traveled to North Korea for military talks.\n  Mr. Speaker, not only has the President's Cuban policy been a \ndisaster for the people of Cuba, it has been a disaster for our own \nsafety and security. There should be--there must be--a full and \nthorough investigation into this Hellfire missile incident. If this \nadministration won't do what is necessary to hold the Cuban regime \naccountable, then we in Congress must use every available tool in order \nto do so.\n  We cannot allow the administration's endless train of concessions to \nthe tyrannical Cuban regime to continue while it turns its back on \nthose who are suffering under the regime's oppression. This is not what \nAmerica stands for, and we should not allow President Obama's misguided \nforeign policy objectives to ever change that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H285-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SERGEANT MATTHEW McCLINTOCK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. McDermott) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, on the wall outside my office are the \nfaces of 149 men and women from Washington State who were killed in \naction over the past 14 years in Afghanistan and in Iraq.\n  Today it is with reverence that I will add the 150th face: Sergeant \nMatthew McClintock's. Matthew was killed in Helmand Province in \nAfghanistan on the 5th of January.\n  Sergeant McClintock was a Green Beret, an engineer, a National \nGuardsman, as well as a dedicated friend, son, husband, and father.\n  He joined the Army in 2006 and served in both Iraq and Afghanistan \nover the course of three tours. On one of his tours, his best friend \nwas killed. So you can imagine what was in his mind when he was now \nleading a group in Afghanistan and one of his men was on the ground, \nhit. He knew the danger, but he went out to try and save his teammate.\n  He epitomized everything we admire about our warriors: their skill, \ntheir mettle, their commitment to their teammates, to their families, \nand to us as a nation. The loss of a promising, smart, steadfast young \nman, whose devotion to family and country was freely given, should not \nand will not be accepted without sorrow and respect.\n  I had the chance to meet Matthew's wife, Alexandra, and their 3-\nmonth-old son, Declan, on Friday, when Matthew came back to Dover Air \nForce Base. Everything his family said about him speaks of a man I \nwould like to have known.\n  It is said that the true soldier fights not because he hates what is \nin front of him but because he loves what is behind him. Matthew leaves \nbehind a proud and beautiful family.\n  His wife asked that she have a chance to go up to Walter Reed to see \nthe man her husband went out to save, who is still alive. That is the \nkind of family this is. We, as a nation, should be forever grateful \nthat someone of his caliber--and his family--continues to choose to \nfight.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have entered the 15th year of this war, and it is \neasy to forget what is still going on in Iraq and Afghanistan and in \nother places where our soldiers are.\n  I became aware of this because somebody in my district was Matthew's \nfather-in-law. He called me up and asked if I would be of help. I was \nglad to do it, but I realized I had not been aware of what had happened \nto him.\n  So I asked the Army press people: Was this reported in the press?\n  They said, yes, that it was on television for 45 seconds.\n  The American people are being allowed not to see and not to hear \nabout Matthew McClintock. They are not being told what is going on.\n  We sent him there. We gave him the gun. We gave him the bullets. We \ngave him the body armor. We gave him everything and sent him over there \nand asked him to do this for us. He did it. He was willing to lay down \nhis life for us.\n  We deserve more time with people like Matthew and like many of the \nsoldiers who went before him. But for those who survive them--Matthew's \nteammates, his family--Alexandra and especially Declan--when this war \nfinally ends, they deserve long and happy lives in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H285-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H285-H286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WASP ARLINGTON INURNMENT RESTORATION ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Denham) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the contributions the \nWASPs have made to our great country. These are the Women Airforce \nService Pilots, and they represent an elite group of female pilots.\n  They flew combat missions during World War II. These women displayed \ncourage, valor, and a willingness to serve, and they made invaluable \ncontributions to our Nation's efforts to battle on the world stage.\n  There were fewer than 1,100 WASPs, and 38 of them died during their \nservice. But because the unit was created in 1942, the WASP group was \nnever granted full military status.\n  In 1977, Congress retroactively granted Active-Duty status to these \nbrave pilots to ensure that all VA policies, laws, and services would \napply to them; yet, the Army recently denied the request of WASPs who \nwere seeking a place in Arlington National Cemetery. They say they are \nrunning out of space.\n  This decision flies in the face of our Nation's efforts to recognize, \nreward, and treat honorably the contributions of all of our veterans. \nThese women deserve the same honor that is bestowed upon hundreds of \nthousands of their fellow servicemembers.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring and supporting the \nbill.\n\n[[Page H286]]\n\n  I say this to the VA: Find the space.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H286-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H286-H288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN SCIENCE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, universities are supposed to be in the \nbusiness of illumination, but as we have seen in recent cases at Cal \nTech and at UC Berkeley, that is not always the case.\n  At UC, world-renowned astronomer Geoff Marcy sexually harassed \nstudents for years with no consequences. The light of knowledge can \ncast some dark shadows. Brave women recently alerted my office to still \nmore harassment in astronomy, now at the University of Arizona.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record this report from the University \nof Arizona regarding Dr. Timothy Slater. This report was sealed for \nover a decade while Dr. Slater went on with his career. His example \nshows why so few women continue careers in science and in engineering.\n\n                              Confidential\n\n\n                          Investigative Report\n\n       Complaint No: 04-06A-MKM\n       Complainant: Administrative Review\n       Respondent: Dr. Timothy Slater\n       Department: Department of Astronomy, Steward Observatory\n       Date Complaint Received: August 2004\n       Report Date: March 31, 2005\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Prior to July 2004, several individuals approached the \n     EOAAO to discuss sexually charged conduct they were \n     experiencing in the College of Astronomy, and Steward \n     Observatory. They stated that the conduct was occurring \n     across ranks; some indicated the conduct was creating a \n     sexually hostile work environment. Some indicated retaliation \n     might be occurring. These individuals refused to file \n     complaints against the department because they feared work-\n     related repercussions, including unlawful retaliation. \n     Consequently the EOAAO met with administrators in the \n     Department of Astronomy and Steward Observatory to discuss \n     initiating an investigation into sexual harassment, sexually \n     hostile work environment. The department, in turn, formalized \n     a request for investigation, such that this Administrative \n     Review began in August 2004.\n       Responsive to evidence obtained in the early stages of \n     investigation, the EOAAO named Dr. Tim Slater as a respondent \n     in this case, on September 24, 2004. The EOAAO notified Dr. \n     Slater of his respondent status in accordance with EOAAO \n     procedures, identifying sexual harassment and retaliation as \n     the relevant issues.\n       Dr. Slater was hired by the University of Arizona on August \n     6, 2001, as an Associate Professor of Astronomy. He received \n     tenure standing in May 2004. He has a variety of duties at \n     the university, including his post as the Conceptual \n     Astronomy and Physics Education Research (CAPER) team leader.\n\n\n                         scope of investigation\n\n       In the course of the investigation, the investigator \n     interviewed multiple individuals--some more than once--who \n     were associated with the Department of Astronomy, Steward \n     Observatory, and/or the CAPER team. Witnesses were selected \n     either randomly, or with an effort to cross-section levels of \n     authority and closeness, professional and/or personal, with \n     the respondent. All efforts were made to get a comprehensive \n     point of view.\n\n\n                                 issue\n\n       Did Dr. Slater violate the University's Sexual Harassment \n     Policy, as well as the policy's Retaliation component?\n       Witness B stated that Dr. Slater and Witness J make a lot \n     of sexual jokes and create sexual banter on a regular basis. \n     She noted a lot of the women tend to ignore this when it is \n     occurring around them.\n       On a regular basis, Dr. Slater has told Witness B she would \n     teach better if she did not wear underwear.\n       On at least one occasion he grabbed her underwear through \n     her dress, stretched it and snapped it, and said, ``You'd \n     look a whole lot better without these on,'' or words to that \n     effect. That same day he invited her to attend a lunch with a \n     visiting female graduate student from [redacted] and Witness \n     J. Dr. Slater indicated they would be lunching at a local \n     topless bar. At lunch both Dr. Slater and Witness J paid for \n     and received lap dances. Dr. Slater offered to purchase a lap \n     dance for Witness B; she declined and he did not push the \n     issue further.\n       Witness B reported that during the semester the sexual \n     conduct occurs daily.\n       Witness C provided the following information:\n       Witness C stated that she has continual but infrequent \n     interaction with Dr. Slater during the course of her work. \n     She stated that her concern regarding Dr. Slater reflects \n     sexual conduct occurring on one day: [redacted] Witness C \n     traveled with Dr. Slater to [redacted] by car, in the company \n     of a female graduate student.\n       During the car trip, Witness C told Dr. Slater some work \n     she had completed for CAPER. He responded by saying, \n     ``Awesome! I could just kiss you full on the mouth,'' or \n     words very close to those. Witness C stated she found this \n     response distasteful.\n       Later he asked her, ``How bad can I be with you?'' When she \n     asked him what he meant, he asked her if she would be \n     reporting his comments back to her supervisor.\n       Dr. Slater went on to relate that when he goes to academic \n     conferences out of town he goes online to set up ``hook-ups'' \n     (sexual dates) with women in the geographic area. He told \n     Witness C that his personal (sexual) record was four (4) \n     women in twenty-four (24) hours.\n       Dr. Slater also stated that he and his wife occasionally \n     set up manage-a-trois.\n       Dr. Slater and the accompanying female graduate student \n     discussed the upcoming visit of Dr. Slater's colleague. She \n     asked Dr. Slater if she would have to sleep with him, to \n     which Dr. Slater replied, ``No, not this one.'' Witness C \n     looked at them and exclaimed, ``What?'' whereupon Dr. Slater \n     told her that occasionally he might have to ask her to take \n     one for the team.\n       Talking about Witness J, Dr. Slater said, ``Yeah, he likes \n     the young ones. Witness C asked if that individual did not \n     have a girlfriend. Dr. Slater replied that a girlfriend was \n     one thing, but a student was another. Witness C asked if the \n     students were minors, to which Dr. Slater responded that they \n     were all probably over 18.\n       He added that he, Dr. Slater, preferred a more mature woman \n     who knew ``her way around the bedroom.'' Some minutes later \n     he turned to Witness C and asked her if she knew ``anything \n     about or was any good at giving blowjobs, because (the \n     accompanying female--name deleted) does not like to give or \n     receive them--maybe you could give her some pointers.''\n       Witness C then told Slater he was being completely \n     inappropriate. She said, ``You barely know me. I only started \n     a couple of weeks ago, and you're already talking to me like \n     this. Doesn't the U of A give sexual harassment training, or \n     were your absent that day?'' She went on to say that she has \n     a particularly large boyfriend (whom she described, in part, \n     as Black) She told Dr. Slater that he would not appreciate \n     the manner in which Dr. Slater was speaking to her. Dr. \n     Slater then asked Witness C if it were true that once you \n     went black, you'd never go back,'' or words to that effect.\n       Later Dr. Slater joked that he would pull off at a rest \n     stop so they could have a threesome. Witness C responded by \n     saying, ``Like that's going to happen,'' or words to that \n     effect. After that she tried changing the subject every time \n     it turned sexual, and then she related a story of personal \n     tragedy (non-sexual,) which she noted seemed to sober Dr. \n     Slater and the other female right away.\n       Witness C stated that she reported Dr. Slater's conduct to \n     the Principle Investigator (PI) on her project. The PI, in \n     turn, told her she should report it to her supervisor, which \n     she did.\n       [Relevant to Witness D's testimony] Witness C stated she \n     was aware that Dr. Slater appeared to be trying to take \n     [redacted] program [redacted] away from the department and \n     bring it over to Steward Observatory where he also works. She \n     stated he has been pulling funding from the program. \n     Additionally he bad-mouths the Program Coordinator, Witness \n     C's supervisor. He has also been giving responsibilities \n     previously held by that supervisor to his various graduate \n     students.\n       The witness recalled that other female graduate students \n     had commented that their advisors, Dr. Slater and Witness J, \n     were too sexual in their demeanor.\n\n\n                      Information from Respondent\n\n       On September 30, 2004 Dr, Tim Slater provided the following \n     information:\n       He stated that he recalled two occasions on which \n     individuals complained directly to him about his personal \n     conduct.\n       In [redacted] talking about a bachelor party at a strip \n     club, such that a graduate student commented, ``That really \n     creeps me out when you talk that way in front of me,'' or \n     words to that affect. He recalled apologizing.\n       A graduate student and former CAPER team member telling him \n     that it had made her uncomfortable when he massaged her \n     shoulders publicly, while hosting a teacher workshop. Dr. \n     Slater recalled that she was concerned others might \n     misinterpret the nature of their relationship, were they to \n     observe his gesture.\n       Dr. Slater characterized himself as a ``touchy'' person who \n     often hugs people. He stated that he is a ``flirtatious'' \n     person, and defined that as ``friendly,'' and ``flattering.'' \n     He stated this is mostly with the CAPER group, since CAPER \n     constitutes his primary professional and social interaction.\n       Dr. Slater stated that he hugs males as well as females, \n     and that he brought many people on the team [CAPER] from \n     Montana and Kansas [universities there.] Many had lived in \n     his house with him and his wife from time to time, and some \n     of the relationships were of 10-12 years' duration. He added \n     they had been in each other's weddings. He stated that they \n     all socialize together at someone's house (often his) on 2-3 \n     occasions per month.\n       Dr. Slater stated that he and Witness J run the CAPER \n     group, and that within the group they have a joke that he, \n     Slater, is the ``mom,'' and Witness J is the ``dad.'' He \n     stated that some of the CAPER team members were more like \n     family than others; he listed the two groups.\n       Regarding reports that he had given out ``sex toys'' at \n     social events; he recalled that\n\n[[Page H287]]\n\n     he had given one female graduate student a pickle or \n     cucumber-shaped vibrator at a ``pre-marriage'' party. He \n     could not recall having given out chocolate handcuffs, as \n     specifically alleged. Regarding the vibrator, he recalled \n     that the recipient was a collector of the vegetable it \n     represented, and that he was certain she was not offended by \n     it. He recalled there were pickle or cucumber jokes going \n     around the office for several days, thereafter.\n       Dr. Slater did not recall making the comment that he would \n     have to install cameras in his home, as alleged, and \n     referential to the alleged comment that everyone [in CAPER] \n     had engaged in sexual activity in his home. Dr. Slater \n     reiterated that many of the CAPER team members had, in fact, \n     lived with him at his house over the years.\n       Regarding allegations that he stopped to look at women, and \n     commented on their appearance, he stated this was common \n     practice for him, and that he might have done it anywhere \n     from ``one-to-ten-to-a-hundred times.'' He denied that he had \n     a rating system, but recalled saying things like, ``You're \n     going to have to say that again, because that's too \n     distracting.'' He confirmed he had made such comments to \n     women in the department and often Witness J, who joked with \n     him in a similar fashion.\n       Regarding allegations that he told a colleague he had a \n     prohibition against ``blue balls'' in the office (referencing \n     an exercise ball,) he stated he did not recall making the \n     comment, but that it was ``consistent'' with the kinds of \n     comments he would make.\n       He believed he had not told a colleague he would have \n     invited her to swim over the weekend but for the likelihood \n     she would wear her swim suit. He stated he doubted that \n     comment because he is not exclusionary by nature.\n       He did not recall telling a [subordinate female] colleague \n     that she would teach better were she to stop wearing \n     underwear, and did not recall snapping her underwear [through \n     her T-shirt dress, as alleged.] However, he stated, he did \n     tend to say a lot of sexual things.\n       Dr. Slater confirmed that he took a visiting female \n     graduate student, as well as a male and a female \n     [subordinate] colleague to lunch at a local strip club. He \n     did not recall that specific event, but stated that he [and \n     the accompanying male] usually purchase lap dances when they \n     go. He usually offers to purchase lap dances for others, as \n     well. He stated they go about once per month, and that it's \n     usually a mixed group (male and female.)\n       Dr. Slater recalled that a group of department women had \n     gone to a male club in honor of a wedding or birthday, and \n     reported having a terrible time. Somehow, as an offshoot to \n     that situation, one of the women [Witness B] thought she \n     might like female clubs better, and decided to join the men. \n     He could not recall how many times she attended, but thought \n     probably several. He stated that he has gone with his wife, \n     and several of the graduate students and/or colleagues. He \n     stated the tab is always collected for ``Dutch'' treat: \n     departmental funds are never used.\n       For complete report go to http://speier.house.gov.\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2016.\n     Catherine E. Lhamon,\n     Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, Office of Civil Rights, \n         Department of Education, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Assistant Secretary Lhamon: Thank you for your \n     leadership and commitment to eradicating sexual harassment \n     and assault on college campuses. Knowing your interest in \n     this area, I wanted to bring the attached report to your \n     attention, which details disturbing sexual harassment by a \n     former faculty member at the University of Arizona. Despite \n     finding that Dr. Timothy Slater committed a policy violation \n     in the matter of ``sexual harassment, hostile work \n     environment,'' the report and its incriminatory revelation \n     were sealed, and Dr. Slater moved to a new job at the \n     University of Wyoming, where he continues to supervise \n     students and teach workshops. In light of this, I ask that \n     the Office of Civil Rights clarify whether universities that \n     find a Title IX violation by faculty or staff are required to \n     disclose the results of their investigation to other \n     educational institutions.\n       The incidents described in the report are alarming. One \n     complainant said that Dr. Slater told her on a regular basis \n     that ``she would teach better if she did not wear underwear'' \n     and ``grabbed her underwear through her dress, stretched it \n     and snapped it, and said `You'd look a whole lot better \n     without these on,' or words to that effect.'' He asked \n     another complainant ``if she knew anything about or was any \n     good at giving blow jobs, because (name deleted) does not \n     like to give or received them--maybe you could give her some \n     pointers.'' Dr. Slater himself admitted that he gave an \n     employee a vegetable-shaped vibrator, that he frequently \n     commented to his employees and students about the appearance \n     of passing women, and that he told one person ``that his \n     personal sexual record was four women in 24 hours.''\n       Staff spoke directly to a witness who recounted several \n     inappropriate interactions. She observed Dr. Slater \n     instructing an undergraduate student to ``touch your elbows \n     behind your back for me'' in order to scrutinize the \n     student's breasts, and touching graduate students on the leg \n     while making inappropriate statements. At a lab social event \n     at the Slaters' residence, video pornography was shown before \n     dinner. She recounted hearing Dr. Slater tell male colleagues \n     on more than one occasion that he enjoyed teaching large \n     lectures in rooms with stadium seating because the female \n     students in Arizona wear short skirts and often forget to \n     cross their legs. Dr. Slater once required the witness to \n     attend a lunch at a fully nude strip club with him in order \n     to discuss her academic work, with the implied consequence \n     that he would not discuss her work with her if she refused to \n     go. While she was there, she was pressured to attend future \n     lunches at the strip club. According to the witness, it was \n     made clear to her, though never explicitly stated, that if \n     she wanted to function in the lab that she had to take part \n     in this sexualized culture. Because of these incidents, the \n     witness left the field of astronomy.\n       Staff spoke directly to another witness, who experienced \n     inappropriate comments and unwanted physical contact from Dr. \n     Slater. At a one-on-one work meeting, he told her that all \n     the other graduate students had sex at his house, that he had \n     video cameras, and asked when she would also have sex at his \n     house. During a lab social, she witnessed Dr. Slater and \n     another lab supervisor stating that at this party, lab \n     members were going to use the Slaters' hot tub naked. Dr. \n     Slater also touched her shoulders and stroked her back while \n     she was teaching, until she sent him a formal email \n     requesting that he stop. Due to the hostile work environment, \n     the witness transferred out of Dr. Slater's group, losing \n     years of progress towards her graduate degree.\n       A third witness separately confirmed that Dr. Slater led \n     laboratory outings to strip clubs.\n       The Slater report is disturbingly similar to the recent \n     case at the University of California, Berkeley, in which Dr. \n     Geoff Marcy, a prominent astronomer, violated campus sexual \n     harassment policies with minimal consequences for 9 years \n     until his story was publicized through the media. As the \n     University of Arizona did with the Slater case, UC Berkeley \n     kept the final report on Dr. Marcy's behavior confidential, \n     perhaps because, as Science Magazine put it, ``[t]he details \n     of UC Berkeley's inquiry into Marcy's conduct does not \n     reflect well on the institution, with the process stretching \n     for more than 4 years and Marcy given only weak sanctions \n     after repeated promises to reform.'' The final report from UC \n     Berkeley contained a sentence that could be applied equally \n     to Dr. Marcy and Dr. Slater: ``[i]t cannot be overstated how \n     Respondent's inherent influence and authority over the \n     complainants, real or perceived, heightened the impact of his \n     behavior on those experiencing or witnessing it.''\n       The Slater case, while lurid, is just a symptom of a much \n     larger problem--how to prevent harassment, and effectively \n     deal with it when it occurs. Dr. Slater states that he is now \n     reformed, but there are still few consequences for faculty \n     members who sexually harass students. In some ways, the \n     situation is reminiscent of the Catholic Church's coddling of \n     child-molesting priests. As in the Church, universities \n     protect perpetuators with slap-on-the-wrist punishment and \n     secrecy, while victims are left alone to try to put their \n     academic careers and lives back together. One peer-reviewed \n     study found that over a quarter of women surveyed (and 6% of \n     men) have been sexually assaulted while conducting scientific \n     fieldwork, and 71% of women and 41% of men also reported that \n     they were sexually harassed.\n       The profound effect of this dynamic on the participation of \n     women in science cannot be overstated. From 2002 through \n     2012, women received one-third or fewer of the doctorates \n     awarded in physical sciences, mathematics, engineering, and \n     computer science, and as of 2013 one-third or fewer of all \n     tenure or tenure track faculty positions in core STEM fields \n     were held by women. Indeed, all of the victims we talked to \n     suffered career consequences as a direct result of the \n     harassment, including losing years of graduate work, forgoing \n     professional opportunities, and changing fields of study. In \n     the Marcy case, one of the victims, who had aspired to work \n     at NASA, left astrophysics entirely as a direct result of \n     being harassed.\n       When students found to have violated university policy \n     through the Title IX disciplinary process transfer to another \n     institution, the university that found the violation may \n     inform the other institution, but is not obligated to do so. \n     While this policy is vastly insufficient, it at least allows \n     universities to have the option to inform other universities \n     of the final results of a disciplinary proceeding. However, \n     no similar guidance exists for faculty or staff. I ask that \n     the Office of Civil Rights issue a clarification on the FERPA \n     or Title IX disclosure requirements when faculty or staff \n     whose conduct violated Title IX transfer to another \n     institution.\n       Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look \n     forward to hearing from you soon.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jackie Speier.\n\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, some universities protect predatory \nprofessors with slaps on the wrist and secrecy, just like the Catholic \nChurch sheltered child-molesting priests for many decades.\n  The incidents described in this report are lurid and disturbing. One \ngraduate student was told regularly by Dr.\n\n[[Page H288]]\n\nSlater that she would teach better if she did not wear underwear. He \nasked another graduate student to give women pointers on oral sex \ntechniques.\n  Dr. Slater himself admitted that he gave an employee a vegetable-\nshaped vibrator and that he frequently commented to his employees and \nstudents about the appearance of women.\n  My staff spoke with one female grad student who was required to \nattend a strip club in order to discuss her academic work with Dr. \nSlater. The woman has since left the field of astronomy.\n  The second female grad student told us that, during a one-on-one work \nmeeting with Dr. Slater, he told her that all of the other graduate \nstudents had had sex at his house, that he had video cameras, and asked \nwhen she would join him to have sex there. She transferred out of Dr. \nSlater's lab, losing years of work.\n  This is a significant reason as to why women hold fewer than one-\nthird of the faculty positions in science and engineering.\n  Dr. Slater has said he is now reformed, which may be the case, but \nhis actions, however lurid, are just symptoms of a larger problem of \nhow to effectively deal with sexual harassment in academia.\n  I agree with Dr. Meg Urry, the president of the American Astronomical \nSociety, who said: ``In my view, this is what it would take to move the \nneedle: severe and visible consequences for violating policies on \nharassment--and they do have to be visible.''\n  That is why I plan to introduce legislation to require universities \nto inform other universities of the final results of a disciplinary \nproceeding. When students, faculty, or staff whose conduct has violated \ntitle IX transfer to another institution, the universities to which \nthey are moving should be aware of their past conduct.\n  I encourage anyone who has experienced sexual harassment in science, \nwhether it is related to this incident or another, to call my office.\n  Students enter astronomy to study the stars, not their professors' \nsex lives. It is time to stop pretending sexual harassment in science \nhappened a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H288-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BARBARA STOCKTON PERRY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Holding) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, on New Year's Day, we mourned the loss of a \ngreat lady, Barbara Stockton Perry. Today I rise to celebrate Barbara's \n89 years of life that she devoted to her Christian faith, to her \nfamily, and to her community.\n  Barbara was born on November 3, 1926, in the town of Franklin, which \nis a small North Carolina mountain community that is tucked away under \nthe Great Smoky Mountains.\n  Though the population was very small, Barbara had a large personality \nand a keen mind. She was the valedictorian of Franklin High School in \n1943, and she graduated cum laude from Brenau College in 1947.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  She then went on to the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill \nSchool of Law. She was the only woman in the class of 1950, and she was \na member of the law review as well. This was classic Barbara, \ndistinguishing herself as a highly intelligent woman who was not afraid \nto break glass ceilings.\n  Barbara's first position out of law school was as assistant legal \ncounsel to the Belk Stores Corporation in Charlotte. Then, after \nmarrying Warren Perry in June of 1951, she moved to Kinston, North \nCarolina, with him and became a partner at Perry, Perry and Perry law \nfirm. There, she became involved in the State bar and the local bar and \nwas named to the Board of Governors of the North Carolina Bar \nAssociation.\n  Community service was important to Barbara. So throughout her life, \nshe donated her time and efforts to a long list of organizations, \nincluding the United Way, the North Carolina Symphony, the Kinston Arts \nCouncil, the Kinston-Lenoir County Bicentennial Commission, and the \nPride of Kinston organization. A lifelong educational advocate, Barbara \nalso served on the Board of Trustees of Parrot Academy, Lenoir \nCommunity College, Brenau University, and UNC-Chapel Hill, where she \nwas elected to two terms on the Board of Governors of the entire 16-\nuniversity UNC system.\n  In recognition of her contributions to North Carolina, she was \nhonored by two North Carolina Governors, Jim Holshouser and Pat \nMcCrory. Both of these Governors awarded her the Order of the Long Leaf \nPine. If ever anyone instilled and fostered pride in the great State of \nNorth Carolina, certainly it was Barbara Stockton Perry.\n  Ever devoted to faith, Barbara served for many years on the board of \nAngel Ministries. She was a long-time member of the Gordon Street \nChristian Church and more recently joined the Faith Fellowship Church.\n  While her contributions to her community are beyond measure, \nBarbara's true joy was her family. She lost the love of her life, \nWarren, in 2003, but theirs was a life filled with adventure. By all \naccounts, they traveled the world together and shared a dance on all \nseven continents. At home, this extraordinary lady was known to her \nfamily simply as Mama Perry. She was happiest when she was surrounded \nby her children, grandchildren, and extended family.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is impossible to condense the life of this truly \nremarkable woman into a few short minutes. I will close in saying that \nI was honored and privileged to know her, and I give thanks to Barbara \nPerry for devoting her life to her family, her community, and her \nfaith. She will be missed beyond measure. May God always bless her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H288-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H288-H289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          STATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, last Friday, the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics released the monthly jobs report for December. It was \nanother in a long, uninterrupted string of good reports. The report \nshowed that the economy gained 292,000 private sector jobs last month \nand that the unemployment rate fell to 5 percent.\n  During 2015, the economy added nearly 2.7 million jobs. Nevertheless, \nmany of my colleagues across the aisle continue to talk as if the \nrecovery under President Obama has been lackluster. They seem to forget \nthe economic meltdown that occurred under the leadership of the prior \nadministration. But the millions of Americans who lost their homes, \ntheir jobs, they haven't forgotten.\n  Let's look at how far we have come in the period after President Bush \nleft office. The truth is, the record is pretty impressive. First, a \nreminder of where we started. Back in January of 2009, when President \nBush left office and President Obama was sworn in, the economy shed \nnearly 820,000 private sector jobs in January in 1 month alone. As \nformer Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke described it, we were facing the worst \nfinancial crisis in global history, including the Great Depression.\n  Between the end of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, real GDP fell \nby 4.2 percent. Around $17 trillion in household wealth evaporated \nduring the Great Recession. To put that number in some perspective, $17 \ntrillion is about equal to our entire gross domestic product, the sum \ntotal of all the goods and services produced by the entire economy of \nthe United States for all of 2014. That is a great deal of money to \nlose. In fact, it would be almost enough to pay off our entire national \ndebt.\n  In July of 2009, there were about seven unemployed workers for every \nsingle job opening in the country, meaning that no matter how hard most \nunemployed people tried to get a job, six out of every seven of them \nwere going to be just out of luck. You may recall that back then our \ncolleagues across the aisle were adamantly opposed to extending jobless \nbenefits.\n  By October of 2009, the unemployment rate had reached 10 percent. \nHousing prices were falling. Lending was frozen. The stock market had \ncratered. Businesses were failing. People all over the country were \nlosing their jobs, their homes, their savings, and their hopes. It was \na pretty terrible time for millions of Americans.\n\n[[Page H289]]\n\n  Now, much has changed. 2014 and 2015 were the strongest 2 years of \njob creation since 1998 to 2000, when Bill Clinton was President. The \nprivate sector is powering the economy forward. Our businesses have \nadded 14 million jobs over a record 70 consecutive months of job \ngrowth. Wages have finally begun to rise. Nominal average hourly \nearnings for all private employees have now risen 2.5 percent over the \npast year. The ratio of unemployment seekers to job openings has fallen \nfrom 7 to 1 to 1.5 to 1. That is about the lowest this ratio has been \nsince early 2007.\n  Since the start of the Obama administration, our real GDP has \nincreased by 14 percent. The U.S. auto industry, which was on death's \ndoor when President Obama took office, is now healthy, thriving, and \nenjoyed record sales in 2015. Our auto industry is now exporting and \ncreating even more jobs. Oil and gas prices are low. Mortgage rates \nremain low. Inflation is simply not a factor. The dollar is strong, and \nhousing prices are back up to where they were in 2007.\n  All of this recovery was not an accident, not a stroke of good luck. \nThings certainly would have been quite different if we had only \nlistened to the counsel of our colleagues across the aisle. They \nvehemently opposed efforts taken by the Obama administration to \nstimulate the economy, and they opposed actions by the Federal Reserve \nthat turned out to be very critically important.\n  What would have happened without these actions by the Federal Reserve \nand the Democrats in Congress? The recession would have lasted twice as \nlong, according to a recent study by highly respected economists Alan \nBlinder and Mark Zandi. The Blinder-Zandi study found that without \nthese actions, the unemployment rate would have reached nearly 16 \npercent, and we would have lost twice as many jobs, more than 17 \nmillion. It is a bit scary to even think about.\n  So the facts show that we have had a very strong recovery. Are we \ndone? Absolutely not. There is much more work to do to ensure the \nrecovery reaches everyone. Big challenges remain. Many families are \nstruggling to make ends meet, to make the mortgage payment, to save for \ntheir children's education. We need faster wage growth, accessible \nchild care, and higher education that is affordable to all families. It \nis time to pass comprehensive immigration reform and to protect \nAmericans from gun violence.\n  I am excited about the opportunity to make real progress on these \nissues this year, and I look forward to working in a bipartisan way to \ncontinue to focus on the challenges facing middle class families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H289-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PRO-LIFE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Ratcliffe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, the Declaration of Independence contains \na passage that every student in America learns at an early age. It \nexplains that each of us are endowed by our Creator with certain \ninalienable rights, chief among them the right to life. This highlights \nand reminds us just how much our Founders valued the right to life.\n  As an elected Representative, the words in our Declaration that \nfollow are equally compelling: To secure these rights, governments are \ninstituted among men. How often we forget that government exists first \nand foremost to secure the right to life.\n  Now, this is an immense responsibility, one that I take very \nseriously, because one of the highest honors I have in representing the \nFourth Congressional District of Texas is defending the most vulnerable \namong us, our unborn children. I am proud to have a voting record that \nreflects my unwavering commitment to protecting unborn life and ending \ntaxpayer funding of abortion.\n  I will also be the first to tell you that legislators represent only \none piece of the puzzle in the ongoing and vital effort to promote a \nculture of life. There are literally thousands of unsung pro-life \nheroes in the Fourth Congressional District of Texas, whose effort to \npromote a culture of life are not about gaining recognition or \nnotoriety, but are simply rooted in an abiding sense of protecting the \ninalienable right to life, which our Founding Fathers spoke of.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to recognize a few of these \npro-life heroes in my district, people like Melanie Grammar and Deborah \nButts with the Texas Federation of Republican Women; Michelle Smith and \nAnn Hettinger in Rockwall, Texas; Chip Adami at the True Options \nPregnancy Center in Sherman; Mason Randall and Robin Stevenson at Lake \nPointe Church Adoption Ministry; Kristie Wright at the First Choice \nPregnancy Resource Center in Texarkana; Threesa Sadler and Tim \nStainback at the Raffa Center in Greenville; Joanne Vuckovic at the \nRockwall Pregnancy Resource Center; and the great folks at both the \nParis and Fannin Pregnancy Care Centers.\n  The dedication of individuals like these and thousands of others \nacross the Fourth Congressional District of Texas is appreciated, it is \nnecessary, and it certainly does not go unnoticed. Thank you all for \nyour commitment to protecting the incredibly important cause of life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H289-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H289-H290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      BILL TO COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESS COMPACT IMPACT IN AFFECTED \n                             JURISDICTIONS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nGuam (Ms. Bordallo) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, today I introduced legislation that will \nhelp address the impact of the Compact of Free Association--these are \nthe Pacific Islands--on affected jurisdictions like Guam and the State \nof Hawaii.\n  I continue to support the intent of the Compact, and I do understand \nthe benefits that these agreements have for our Nation and our \nsecurity. However, the costs borne by our local governments amount to \nmillions of dollars for providing social services to Compact migrants \nare unsustainable, and Congress must act to provide relief for affected \njurisdictions who have spent millions of local funds to support the \nCompact and the migrants.\n  COFA migrants make positive contributions to our community, but \ninsufficient support from the Federal Government causes a significant \nsocioeconomic strain on our island communities. This strain only \nincreases, especially with uncertain economic conditions in the Freely \nAssociated States, as well as the impact climate change is having on \nPacific Island nations.\n  The bill I am introducing, as well as proposals that I have made in \nthe past, will provide relief and empower local jurisdictions with \nsolutions to reduce the burden of the Compact.\n  The best solution to Compact impact would be an increase in annual \nmandatory funding from the current $30 million to the $185 million \nrecommended by the GAO. However, the current budget environment makes \nappropriating this very difficult.\n  Nonetheless, I am proud to also cosponsor another bill, a bill \nintroduced by Congressman Takai of the State of Hawaii, that would \nincrease this annual appropriation, and I hope that we can at least \nhave a debate on this measure.\n  However, as we work to find long-term solutions to Compact impact, I \nbelieve that there are important and innovative fixes that would \nprovide much-needed relief to our local governments without much cost \nto taxpayers.\n  Now, this approach is a more budget-friendly way to address this \nchallenge. The bill's provisions address four areas to reduce the \nburden.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  First, my bill would permit the affected jurisdictions to use the \namount that they have spent to provide social services to COFA migrants \ntoward the non-Federal portion of providing Medicaid to their local \nresidents. The bill proposes a new formula that would increase the \nFederal medical assistance percentage for each of the affected \njurisdictions, and this would go a long way toward alleviating the \nburden on affected jurisdictions by increasing the percentage \nassistance provided by the Federal Government for Medicaid.\n  Secondly, the bill would categorize elementary and secondary \neducation-aged COFA students as federally connected students and make \nthem eligible for Impact Aid. I understand the fiscal challenges that \nthe Impact Aid community faces, and I am committed\n\n[[Page H290]]\n\nto working with them to address the effect this bill may have on them. \nThe bill attempts to offset this effect by increasing funding \nauthorization and ensures that we are not taking from one group just to \npay another.\n  Thirdly, this legislation would clarify Congress' intent when we \nextended eligibility for housing assistance programs to the COFA \nmigrants. This bill ensures that U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful \npermanent residents are not displaced and are given priority when \napplying for housing benefits.\n  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, this bill would commission independent research \non the viability of the current compacts and make recommendations on \npolicy alternatives moving forward. I do hope that this research will \nprovide strategic guidance as we move toward renewal of the compacts in \n2023 and ensure that we are administering these agreements in the best \nway.\n  I am so very pleased to count the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Takai) \nas an original cosponsor of my bill.\n  As this Congress discusses solutions for the crisis in Puerto Rico, \nit is important that we also discuss challenges that the other \nterritories face, especially the challenge of supporting the Compact of \nFree Association. While the challenges facing affected jurisdictions \nare nowhere near as serious as Puerto Rico, Mr. Speaker, doing nothing \nwould only welcome economic and security challenges down the road.\n  I do look forward to this bill becoming law and it being a tremendous \nhelp to jurisdictions affected by the Compact impact.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H290-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           INDEPENDENCE PLAZA HONORS AMERICA'S SPACE PROGRAM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Olson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, in the summer of 1972, my dad was transferred \nfrom northwest Alabama to southeast Texas. I remember the first time I \ngot off the Gulf Freeway, headed east down NASA Road 1, and saw the \nJohnson Space Center and the Nassau Bay resort hotel with an NBC studio \non top. Right then, it hit me: my neighbors were astronauts, Moon \nwalkers. My life was changed forever.\n  The next 9 years were rather dull. Three missions of Skylab and one \nhandshake with the Russians on Apollo-Soyuz.\n  The excitement came back in 1981. The Space Shuttle Columbia flew for \nthe first time. The space shuttle was the heart and soul of human \nspaceflight until July 21, 2011, when three words ended the program: \n``Houston, wheels stop.''\n  Those words were heard in the dark, 4:57 a.m. Texas time. My home was \ndark for 4\\1/2\\ years. That darkness will end on January 23 when Space \nCenter Houston opens Independence Plaza right by the Johnson Space \nCenter. Independence Plaza will have the Space Shuttle Independence \natop the 747 transport carrier.\n  Our space shuttles flew 133 successful flights, with crews as small \nas two or as large as seven, with 55,000 pounds of payload. Our \nshuttles carried astronauts from 17 nations: Belgium, Canada, France, \nIsrael, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan, \nMexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, and America.\n  Our shuttle built the International Space Station, which has had a \nhuman being on board since November 2, 2000. Scott Kelly has been on \nboard the ISS since March 27, 2015. Scott must love the view because he \nwill come home after 1 year in orbit.\n  The Hubble Space Telescope would have been the biggest piece of space \njunk ever without the space shuttle. When it was launched in 1990, it \nwas a telescope that needed glasses. Its vision was blurry. Five \nshuttle missions followed, fixed its vision, gave it decades of new \nlife, and changed history.\n  But Independence Plaza will do more than remind us of the \nachievements of our space shuttle. This exhibit will ensure we never \nforget the two crews we lost on space shuttles. Dick, Michael, Judy, \nRon, Ellison, Greg, and Christa touched the face of God when Challenger \nexploded after 73 seconds of flight on January 28, 1986. Eighteen years \nlater, on February 1, 2003, we lost Rick, Willie, Michael, Kalpana, \nDavid, Laurel, and Ilan when Columbia returned mortally wounded and \nbroke up over their home, my home State of Texas. Independence Plaza \nwill ensure that these 14 heroes will always be revered, and a new, \nyoung generation of Americans will follow their lead and soar into the \nheavens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H290-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FINAL STATE OF THE UNION MESSAGE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, one recalls the state of the Union that \nPresident Obama inherited upon taking office: overwhelming problems \noccasioned by the near collapse of the economy, 700,000 jobs lost \nbefore he was even in office half a month. It would take many months \nmore to arrest the slide. There were fierce battles, arguments about \nwhether we should spend money to try to help people and industries.\n  His work was complicated by the announcement early on by the \nRepublican leader in the Senate that his number one goal was not to fix \nthe economy or deal with health care or the environment or national \nsecurity; it was to prevent President Obama from being reelected to a \nsecond term.\n  Time has shown that the money that was spent was critical, and most \nindependent experts agree that we should have invested more heavily in \nthings like rebuilding and renewing America. Even so, our performance \nhas been better than any of the other developed economies.\n  Those results were achieved with divisions and arguments that \ncontinue to be played out today on the national political stage as \nthere are people seeking the Presidency later this year. But my hope is \nthat, as the President addresses this Chamber tonight, there might be \nan opportunity to move past some of the divisions and controversy.\n  My hope is, as the President looks up in the gallery and sees the \nFirst Lady, that he might pause and acknowledge her important work in \nhealth and nutrition; that he might spend just 3 minutes on a topic \nthat can bring people together; that he would admit that we as a \ngovernment still pay too much to the wrong people to grow the wrong \ncrops in the wrong places, that we would be far better off if we \nweren't subsidizing people to grow food that actually makes Americans \nsick.\n  I would hope that he would propose that the Federal Government help \nmore farmers and ranchers with research and market access at home and \nabroad. Let's pay those farmers and ranchers to protect water quality \nand water quantity.\n  I would hope that he would propose that we subsidize more healthy \nfood in our schools and for senior citizens and low-income people.\n  I would hope that he would acknowledge the revolution that is taking \nplace in food and agricultural thought and policy in this country, as \ndocumented in the recent PBS special, ``In Defense of Food,'' with \nMichael Pollan.\n  There is an exciting national movement promoting value-added \nagriculture, healthy food, animal welfare, and environmental protection \nthat will strengthen rural and small town America and provide more \nsatisfaction for the men and women who work in agriculture.\n  It would only take 3 minutes, but it would be an important milestone \nfor this revolution of food and farm policy that cannot happen soon \nenough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H290-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H290-H291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING COACH FRANK BEAMER ON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Griffith) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Coach Frank \nBeamer on the occasion of his retirement as the head football coach at \nVirginia Polytechnic Institute and State University--more commonly \nknown and fondly known as Virginia Tech--located in Blacksburg, \nVirginia, as Coach Beamer concludes his highly successful career. For \nalmost three decades, Coach Beamer has been a tremendous leader in \nVirginia and a mentor to hundreds of student athletes.\n  In 29 seasons under Coach Beamer's leadership, Virginia Tech football \nhas enjoyed unprecedented success, notching 237 wins, three Big East \nchampionships, four Atlantic Coast Conference\n\n[[Page H291]]\n\nchampionships, and the opportunity to play for a national championship. \nHis ``Beamer Ball'' style of play has led Virginia Tech to become one \nof the Nation's most respected college football programs.\n  In 1999, Coach Beamer was named the consensus Associated Press \nCollege Football Coach of the Year.\n  Coach Beamer's first postseason berth as head coach at Virginia Tech \nwas a trip to the 1993 Independence Bowl game, which resulted in a \nvictory for the Hokies. It was only fitting that Coach Beamer ended his \ncoaching career with a 55-52 victory over the University of Tulsa in \nthe 2015 Independence Bowl, capping off a school record 23 straight \npostseason bowl games.\n  Raised a short drive from Blacksburg, in Hillsville, Virginia, Coach \nBeamer graduated from Hillsville High School, where he earned 11 \nvarsity letters as a three-sport athlete in football, basketball, and \nbaseball. He went on to attend Virginia Tech as an undergraduate and \nstarted 3 years as a cornerback, playing on the Hokies' 1966 and 1968 \nLiberty Bowl teams.\n  While attending Radford University to receive his master's degree in \nguidance, he began his coaching career in 1969 as an assistant at \nsouthwest Virginia's Radford High School.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  From there, he went on to work as a graduate assistant at Maryland \nfor 1 year, followed by the Citadel for five seasons, where he was \ndefensive coordinator for two of those.\n  In 1979, Coach Beamer joined Murray State University as defensive \ncoordinator and was named head coach in 1981.\n  In 1987, he made his way back to his native southwest Virginia to \ntake the reins at Virginia Tech. He has brought honor to southwest \nVirginia and Virginia Tech by always being the consummate Virginia \ngentleman and a darn good football coach to boot.\n  He has devoted his time and passion to the teams he has coached as \nwell as the greater southwest Virginia community. In fact, in 2004, he \nwas presented with a Humanitarian Award by the National Conference of \nCommunity and Justice for his contributions to fostering justice, \nequity, and community in the Roanoke Valley.\n  As evidenced by his incredible success, Coach Beamer has much to be \nproud of and can look back on an honest and accomplished career. His \npassion for coaching led him to achieve what many coaches only dream \nof.\n  He has positively shaped the futures and touched the lives of the \nVirginia boys and girls that he has dealt with--particularly, the boys \non his football team--and has made us a better State. This is truly the \ngreat measure of a great coach.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to help commemorate the career of a \nremarkable man. After 29 years of dedicated leadership to Virginia Tech \nand the greater community, I would like to thank Coach Beamer for his \nservice. I wish him and his family all of the best in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H291-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO OTIS CLAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Her lower back, hips, and leg joints \nbecame painful.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Dold) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, this past weekend brought together a group of \ninnovators at the Kemp Forum on Expanding Opportunity in South \nCarolina. This important forum highlighted new and creative ideas to \naddress the stubborn problem of poverty in America.\n  The Federal Government spends more than half a trillion dollars each \nand every year on antipoverty measures. That is a significant devotion \nof resources. Yet, while some progress has been made in the last 50 \nyears, today there are still nearly 50 million Americans living in \npoverty.\n  Nobody would deny that the results fall far short from where they \nneed to be. This is because, at the end of the day, success in the war \non poverty is measured not at the program level, but on the individual \nlevel. Success isn't about how many programs exist, but how many people \ncan improve their lives by moving up and out of poverty.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the fundamental principles of this great Nation \nis the idea of freedom of opportunity, the opportunity to find work, to \nsupport yourself, and to support your family.\n  By working with local community groups like YouthBuild and leaders \nlike Bob Woodson, I have been able to see numerous success stories, \nlike my guest for tonight's State of the Union address, Lavell Brown.\n  This young man has successfully worked with community groups in North \nChicago to grow as an individual and to get on a path to a sustainable \ncareer, and he is now giving back to others at YouthBuild Lake County.\n  This model of empowering the individual and helping them develop the \nskills needed to escape poverty is what we need to replicate millions \nof times over. If we can combine the focus on individuals with a \nrelentless drive to innovate, I am confident that, in the next 50 \nyears, our efforts to end poverty and provide greater opportunities \nwill be a success.\n\n[[Page H292]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H292-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, this week we will send a measure to the \nPresident that rejects the EPA's waters of the United States power \ngrab, a measure that the Senate has already joined us in supporting.\n  The EPA's plan would grant it jurisdiction over fully 95 percent of \nmy home State of California, allowing an unaccountable Federal agency \nto insert itself into land use decisions across the State. In my \ndistrict, residents have experienced Federal actions so ludicrous that \nI can't make them up.\n  In Tehama County, a farmer was fined for planting wheat in a manner \nthat the government claimed damaged navigable waters. Never mind that \nthe farm has been listed as a wheat allotment by the USDA for decades.\n  In another instance, the government used the Clean Water Act to \nattack a family farm for shifting to more efficient irrigation systems, \nthis during a drought in California. Imagine getting fined for saving \nwater.\n  In both instances, the government sanctioned farmers for activities \nthat are clearly exempt under the Clean Water Act.\n  In fact, language I sponsored to defund the regulation of exempt \nactivities was signed into law in December; yet, the EPA persists in \nthese illegal activities.\n  When Congress can't trust Federal agencies to use the authority they \nalready have and when we can't trust them to follow clear congressional \ndirection, how can we possibly consider granting them more power and \nmore responsibility?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H292-9", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IN HONOR OF U.S. ARMY STAFF SERGEANT MATTHEW McCLINTOCK\n\n  (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize U.S. Army Staff Sergeant \nMatthew McClintock, a fallen hero who answered the call to serve his \ncountry.\n  Last week I had the solemn honor of joining his family--his wife, \nAli, his 3-month-old son, Declan, his parents, and others--at Dover Air \nForce Base for Sergeant McClintock's final trip home. It was an \nexperience I will never forget. It is important that his service and \nthe sacrifice that he and his family have made be acknowledged here in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Sergeant McClintock joined the Army in 2006, and he served in both \nIraq and Afghanistan. On his most recent deployment, he was serving as \na citizen soldier in a National Guard Special Forces unit.\n  Not only will he be remembered as a Green Beret and as a hero, he \nwill be remembered as a loving son, husband, and father who was so \nproud to welcome his son into the world. That world is stronger and \nbetter because of his service.\n  Nothing we can say can ease his family's pain, but I can promise that \nthe service of this hero and his sacrifice will not be forgotten. It \nwill live on in the memories of those he called comrades and in the \nmemories of his commanders, who routinely cite the example he set.\n  It will live on in the gratitude of this Nation. Most importantly, it \nwill live on with his wife, son, and other family members, who knew \nbetter than anyone else his love for his country and for the people in \nhis life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H292-10", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H292-H293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE PRESIDENT'S PUSH ON GUN CONTROL\n\n  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the President's proposed \nexecutive actions on gun control. And you will probably hear more about \nthis tonight, right here in this Chamber.\n  The Second Amendment has been engrained in American life since 1791, \nand, since then, Congress has been committed to preserving those \nconstitutional rights. However, the President has a different agenda.\n  His proposed plan on gun control is yet another example of his \nunconstitutional legislative strategy, using executive orders and \ncircumventing Congress to get his way.\n  Recent events have shown us that Americans deserve the right to \nprotect\n\n[[Page H293]]\n\nthemselves, and stripping law-abiding citizens of their right to bear \narms will not accomplish that.\n  The American people do not want to see their Second Amendment rights \nlimited, and neither do I. I will do everything in my power to fight \nagainst this administration's gun grab.\n  For 225 years, Americans have had the right to bear arms, and I am \nnot about to see this right be compromised for the sake of a political \nlegacy. The Constitution is not merely a significance. It is the law of \nthe land.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H293-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               END THE OVER-PRESCRIPTION OF PAIN KILLERS\n\n  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HIGGINS.

There are 19,000 Americans who lost their lives, and more die \nevery day.\n  I thank the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for their work \non this issue, and I urge the administration, Congress, and the medical \ncommunity to end the over-prescription of painkillers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H293-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE PRESIDENT'S LEGACY OF FAILURE\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this evening the President \nwill address Congress and the American people and will defend his \nlegacy of failure in jobs, national defense, and more gun control.\n  The President's legacy has destroyed jobs and has increased \nregulations that cripple small business. He should change course to \nsupport creating jobs and reducing unnecessary regulations, and he \nshould repeal ObamaCare.\n  The President's legacy overseas--abandoning Iraq, not upholding the \nred line in Syria, and opposing a NATO training force in Libya--allowed \nISIS to grow, with children fleeing, drowning at sea.\n  The President should change course to actually destroy ISIS. American \nfamilies need a positive plan for victory in the global war on \nterrorism.\n  The President's legacy of more gun control would not have stopped any \nof the mass attacks. The President should change course to reform \nmental health and to stop terrorists from attacking American families.\n  I join the rest of America in hoping the President offers a positive \nagenda for the American people tonight, not more Big Government \nfailure.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H293-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            2015 NCAA FOOTBALL NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP VICTORY\n\n  (Ms. SEWELL of Alabama asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama.

He was an Olympic ski racer on \nthe U.S. ski team in 1948 and 1952, an official for the Eastern Amateur \nSki Association, and a leader in business and philanthropy as president \nof the George B.H. Macomber Corporation.\n  He loved the challenge and thrill of downhill ski racing, and he was \na founder in 1957 of Wildcat Mountain Ski Area in my district in \nPinkham, New Hampshire.\n  Yet, as George found such extraordinary success, he never forgot to \ngive back to his community. Over the years, he was a fierce supporter \nand advocate for many important causes in Boston and throughout New \nEngland.\n  He was the father of three extraordinary ski racers and the \ngrandfather of several more.

I am also opposed to Federal \nfunding of abortion.\n  On January 6, the House sent the Restoring Americans' Healthcare \nFreedom Reconciliation Act to the President's desk.

Mr. Speaker, the most ancient Christian communities of all \nare in the Middle East where faith has been handed down in unbroken \nsuccession since the Apostles. It is there that terrorists are \nattempting to commit genocide against Christian believers.\n  To an alarming extent, they are succeeding. For the first time in 16 \ncenturies, there is no Catholic Mass offered in Mosul. Christians were \nonce 15 percent of the population in Syria. Now, they are less than 5 \npercent. The percent in Egypt has been cut in half. ISIS has over 100 \nChristians captive, even as we speak.\n  Christian refugees are often afraid to stay at United Nations camps \ndue to the threats of violence even there. As a result, there are \ndisproportionately few Christians among those granted refugee status by \nthe United States. Only about 3 percent of Syrian refugees admitted \ninto the United States are Christians.\n  While Christians are perhaps the most threatened group of all in \nSyria, the United States must not allow another genocide to happen on \nour watch, and we must ensure that we are helping those who are most \nvulnerable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H295-4", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF HAITI EARTHQUAKE\n\n  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the sixth anniversary of \nthe devastating earthquake that struck the nation of Haiti on January \n12, 2010. Today marks 6 years since the magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck \nsome 15 miles south of Port-au-Prince, which is Haiti's population \ncenter and the seat of its government.\n  The aftermath of the quake was unimaginable. It is estimated that as \nmany as 316,000 people perished and nearly 1.3 million were displaced. \nThis tragedy struck in a nation already hobbled by grinding poverty, \nhealth disparities, and food insecurity.\n  Today, there remain approximately 147,000 internally displaced people \nin Haiti with countless others remaining displaced outside of IDP \ncamps.\n  The world and the American people, though, responded to the \nearthquake with compassion and generosity. To date, the U.S. has \ncontributed billions to recovery efforts, along with donors from around \nthe world.\n  The Assessing Progress in Haiti Act, which I introduced in the \nHouse--it was a bipartisan effort with Congresswoman Ileana Ros-\nLehtinen--which President Obama signed into law 2 years ago, provides \ncritical oversight and reporting to ensure that aid be delivered in the \nmost effective way possible.

Res. 22 is a joint resolution with the U.S. Senate to end the \nEPA's ridiculous waters of the United States rule seeking to expand the \ndefinition of ``navigable waters'' to include puddles, ditches, and \nother small bodies of water, making them subject to inspection.\n  Of course, we all want to ensure that rules are followed to keep our \nwaters clean, but making puddles and ditches subject to inspection just \nto expand the reach of Federal regulators has nothing to do with clean \nwater.\n  Mr. Speaker, you might recall that the House voted to put a stop to \nthe waters of the U.S. rule last year, and the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court \nof Appeals granted a nationwide stay on the rule. However, this joint \nresolution is the measure we needed to finally send this bill to the \nPresident and put the responsibility for this harmful rule on him.\n  I will continue to fight against this radical environmental agenda \nbeing forced on Americans by this administration through executive \noverreach.

Jails and prisons now house more than three times the number \nof mentally ill individuals than do mental health facilities and \nhospitals.\n  It is clear that part of criminal justice reform deals with mental \nhealth, but it also deals with rehabilitation and reentry, which we are \ndiscussing in the Committee on the Judiciary.

Mr. Speaker, I want to turn your attention \nto the crisis in Madaya, Syria.\n  Since July 2015, this town has been under siege by the evil regime of \nBashar al-Assad. It has deprived the citizens; it has starved them; and \nin the last month, at least 31 have died. Those who try to flee face \nindiscriminate barrel bombs and targets by the Assad regime.\n  Bill Clinton once said that the greatest regret of his Presidency was \ninaction in Rwanda. Mr. Speaker, I fear that our greatest regret, both \nof this President and of this House, will be inaction in Syria. There \nare over 250,000 dead men, women, and children by the evil regime of \nAssad because they believed that to target women and children puts more \ncollective pain than to target just fighters.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we are going to destroy ISIS--and we all want to \ndestroy ISIS--you cannot destroy ISIS with the existence of Assad. \nAssad is the greatest recruiter to ISIS that has ever existed. Whether \nit is ISIS today or the next iteration tomorrow, Assad must go for the \nsake of a free Syria.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H297-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 12, 2016.\n     Hon.

Keep in mind, \nthe Shiite extremist alliance of Tehran, of Assad, of Hezbollah has \nkilled far more Americans than ISIS has, starting with our marines in \nthe 1980s, and including hundreds of our servicepeople in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. They have killed far more civilians than ISIS ever aspired \nto, over 200,000 in Syria alone.\n  Finally, as long as Assad is in power in Syria, the Sunni community \nwill be rising up in rebellion. Assad doesn't fight ISIS; but he did, \nin effect, by his policies, create ISIS.\n  In addition, the extremist Shiites around Maliki in Baghdad did the \nsame in Iraq by oppressing the Sunni community of Iraq and giving rise \nto this ISIS scourge. Let us remember, we have got to go after ISIS and \nthe extremist Shiite cabal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/house-section/article/H297-4", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Washington?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported a rule, House Resolution 583, providing for consideration of \nthree important pieces of legislation. Those are H.R. 1644, the STREAM \nAct; H.R. 3662, the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act; and S.J. Res. \n22, a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the \nEPA and Army Corps of Engineers' rule relating to the definition of \nwaters of the United States under the Clean Water Act.\n  The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1644 under a structured \nrule, making four amendments in order, three from the Democrats and one \nfrom the Republicans, H.R. 3662 under a closed rule and S.J. Res 22 \nalso under a closed rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, like many Americans, I have grave concerns about the \nadministration's nuclear agreement with Iran. Since the agreement's \nadoption in July, Iran has shown no goodwill or intention of improving \nits relationship with the West. In many ways, the Iranian regime has \nincreased its aggressive attitude toward the United States and our \nallies.\n  Against U.N. Security Council resolutions, the rogue nation has \nexpanded its ballistic missile program, testing two missiles as \nrecently as last fall. Just on December 26 an Iranian military ship \nfired a rocket near U.S. and French military vessels in the Persian \nGulf. These incidents occurred just months before crippling \ninternational sanctions against the country are scheduled to be lifted.\n  Further, Iran continues to be a state sponsor of terrorism, a direct \nthreat to our closest ally in the region, Israel, continues rampant \nhuman rights abuses, and continues the wrongful imprisonment of five \nAmerican citizens.\n  President Obama and senior administration officials have claimed that \nthe nuclear agreement and lifting of economic sanctions, which could \nreturn as much as $100 billion in frozen assets to Tehran, will help \nIran down a more moderate path. However, reality appears to show the \ncontrary is occurring.\n  Just weeks after the deal was signed, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali \nKhamenei stated that: We won't allow American political, economic, or \ncultural influence in Iran.\n  And just last week the Supreme Leader told a gathering of prayer \nleaders that: Americans have set their eyes covetously on elections, \nbut the great and vigilant nation of Iran will act contrary to the \nenemies' will, whether it be in elections or on other issues, and, as \nbefore, will punch them in the mouth.\n  While President Obama may find something positive in Iran's actions \nand statements, I believe Congress owes it to the American people to \nview Iran with skepticism and concern.\n  H.R. 3662, the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act, requires the \nPresident to certify that those individuals and entities receiving \nsanctions relief under the Iranian nuclear deal are not involved in \nIran's support for terrorism, its human rights abuses, or its ballistic \nmissile program.\n  By passing this legislation, Mr. Speaker, Congress can help ensure \nthat the U.S. will continue to sanction and deter terrorism and illegal \nballistic missile tests within the state of Iran.\n  In arguing for the nuclear deal's adoption, the President committed \nto Congress and to the American people that our ``sanctions on Iran for \nits support of terrorism, its human rights abuses, its ballistic \nmissile program, will continue to be fully enforced.''\n  This legislation gives us the opportunity to hold the President to \nhis word and conduct the necessary oversight to ensure that sanctions \nare enforced.\n  Additionally, this rule will provide for consideration of two other \nvery critical measures that will help protect American businesses and \nfamilies from the administration's regulatory overreach.\n  Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1644, \nlegislation that was drafted in response to the Office of Surface \nMining Reclamation and Enforcement's ongoing rulemaking process that \nseeks to govern the interaction between surface mining operations and \nstreams. It is commonly referred to as the stream buffer zone rule.\n  In December 2008, the outgoing Bush administration published its \nfinal stream buffer zone rule. This rule was the product of over 5 \nyears of deliberation, extensive scientific research, environmental \nanalyses, public comment, and a concurrence from the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  Put simply, this rule was developed the right way, with transparency, \nunbiased research, scientific integrity, stakeholder engagement, and, \nmost importantly, public involvement.\n  However, shortly after the final 2008 rule was released, several \nenvironmental groups filed a lawsuit against the OSM, ultimately \nleading to a settlement agreement between OSM and the environmental \ngroups.\n  After numerous missed deadlines, the environmental organizations \nrenewed the litigation, the administration agreed with the complaint. \nAs a result, the court vacated the 2008 rule and OSM subsequently \nrestarted the rulemaking process.\n  Since that time, the entire process has lacked transparency. \nOversight conducted by the House Committee on Natural Resources, of \nwhich I am a member, revealed that the settlement agreement's expedited \ntimeframe, coupled with an inexperienced contractor and gross \nmismanagement of the rulemaking process, resulted in major issues with \nthe administration's rule.\n  Now, this may sound just a little familiar. It is the very same sue \nand settle practice that the House addressed just last week with the \npassage of H.R. 712, the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and \nSettlements Act.\n  The outcome is another example of why sue and settle leads to poor \nrulemakings and onerous regulations that significantly harm the people, \nbusinesses, and jobs they are supposed to be supporting.\n  Backroom deals between environmental groups and Federal agencies do \nnot lead to sound regulations, but instead circumvent the rulemaking \nprocess to serve the interest of a select few, namely, special \ninterests and environmental groups.\n  For 6 years, OSM has been rewriting this rule, and the ongoing \nprocess has now cost the taxpayers over $10 million, though this is \nonly a small fraction of the cost it will have on businesses and \nhardworking American families.\n  The stream protection rule will drastically reduce our access to \ncoal, which accounts for nearly half of our country's electricity, \nleading to higher electricity costs and significant job losses.\n\n  According to a study from the National Mining Association, the number \nof direct mining jobs that could be lost is between 40,000 and 77,000 \nand the total job losses is between 112,000 and 280,000, a fact that is \nunderscored by the Nation's second largest oil company, Arch Coal, \nfiling for bankruptcy, largely due to the increased cost of Federal \nregulations. That happened just this week, Mr. Speaker.\n  For these reasons, it is imperative that we pass H.R. 1644, \nlegislation that delays the rule's implementation, increases scientific \ntransparency for rulemakings affecting mining, directs a transparent \nthird party to evaluate the existing stream buffer zone rule, and \nreduces duplicative regulation.\n  This rule also makes in order legislation dealing with an issue that \nI hear about very often in my congressional district. It strikes the \ncontroversial waters of the United States, or WOTUS rule.\n  S.J. Res. 22 is a resolution of disapproval of the President's WOTUS \nrule that was passed by the Senate in bipartisan fashion, and it is now \ntime for the House to consider and pass this important measure.\n\n[[Page H299]]\n\n  This legislation was crafted in response to the WOTUS rule \npromulgated by the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers, which redefines \nand vastly expands the scope of water subject to Federal jurisdiction \nunder the Clean Water Act. By issuing this rule, these agencies have \ngiven themselves broad new power over water and land across the United \nStates.\n  Like many of my constituents, I am very concerned with this massive \nFederal overreach. It goes far beyond the agencies' statutory authority \nand could impose significant costs not only on American farmers and \nsmall businesses, but on States and local governments. The rule is \nanother Federal power grab that has more to do with controlling land \nuse decisions than protecting access to clean water.\n  Mr. Speaker, S.J. Res. 22 utilizes the Congressional Review Act to \nblock this harmful regulation, and it is time to send this critical \nmeasure to the President's desk. I urge my colleagues to support this \ncommonsense legislation and the rule providing for its consideration.\n  Mr. Speaker, the rule we consider here today provides for the \nconsideration of three bills that are critically important for the \nfuture of this country.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  We must pass H.R. 1644 and S.J. Res. 22 to protect American families \nand businesses from the rampant executive overreach that will be the \ndefining achievement of the Obama administration.\n  Furthermore, the United States must stand with our allies in the \nMiddle East, as well as around the world, in the face of growing \nIranian aggression, which threatens not only the stability of the \nregion, but the strength of U.S. alliances and standing in the world.\n  I stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto ensure that the Obama administration's shortsighted nuclear \nagreement does not unravel decades of work by the U.S. and our allies \nto impose meaningful sanctions on the country of Iran. These sanctions \nhave restricted Iran's ability to spread its radical beliefs and \ninflict unknown damage on its neighbors in the region, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this rule, as well as the underlying legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse) \nfor yielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong opposition to this rule and the \nunderlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of three \npieces of legislation, and two of these bills are under a completely \nclosed process. In fact, these are the 49th and 50th closed rules in \nthis Congress.\n  Last year was the most closed session in the history of our country, \nand I think this year will probably beat last year. I don't think that \nis anything to be proud of.\n  This is supposed to be the greatest deliberative body in the world, \nbut the problem is, we don't deliberate very much anymore. We don't \npass legislation. Instead, we pass sound bites, and that is what we are \ndoing here today.\n  This Chamber has become an echo chamber, if you will, for the \nRepublican Congressional Campaign Committee and its priorities, and the \npeople's business gets tossed to the side.\n  When Speaker Ryan took the gavel, he promised openness and a return \nto serious legislating. And my colleagues on the Rules Committee, we \ngive them many opportunities to be more generous with granting more \nopportunities for Members of both sides to be able to offer amendments. \nAnd every time we do that, they vote ``no.'' And every time we bring up \nan open rule, they vote ``no.''\n  Here we are, with two more bills that will be debated under a \ncompletely closed process this week. Things have to change here, and I \nhope my colleagues in the leadership on the other side will reflect on \nwhat the purpose of all of us being here is supposed to be.\n  I would say it is about trying to find ways to come together and to \npass things that will help improve the quality of life for all the \npeople of this country, as well as to ensure our security in this \ndangerous world.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me say a few words about H.R. 3662, the Iran Terror \nFinance Transparency Act. My Republican friends would have us believe \nthat this bill is a serious effort to increase congressional oversight \nof sanctions relief under the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction, commonly known as the Iran deal.\n  I wish that were true, Mr. Speaker. Such a bill could bring together \na substantial number of Members from both parties. I would be even more \nconfident about such a bill if it were crafted with input from the \nadministration about how Congress could be most helpful and effective \nin monitoring the Iran nuclear deal.\n  Regrettably, what is coming before the House is another ultra-\npartisan bill that would shut down the ability of the United States to \ncarry out its own obligations under the Iran deal.\n  Rather than the world closely monitoring Iran's compliance, this bill \nwould make the United States a target of condemnation for failing to \nfulfill its commitments. In fact, it would be the United States that is \nthe nation in noncompliance with the Iran nuclear deal.\n  Now, many of my colleagues who are critics of the Iran nuclear deal \nhave already signaled that they cannot support this bill. House \nRepublicans made no attempt whatsoever to make this bill a bipartisan \nbill. They made no attempt to draft a bill that might actually be \nsigned by the President and worth the American taxpayers' time. This is \npolitical theater at its worst, plain and simple.\n  This latest House Republican bill is even more dangerous because it \nplays politics with our national security.\n  No one here wants to see Iran freed from its commitment not to \ndevelop a nuclear weapon, but that is exactly what this bill would do \nif it ever became law. It would make sure that the United States could \nnot fulfill its part of the bargain, thus killing the nuclear \nagreement, and Iran would once again be free to pursue building nuclear \nweapons. That is insane.\n  How can my Republican friends possibly think that this is a good \nidea?\n  I believe that there are Members of Congress in both parties who want \nto work together with the administration in a bipartisan manner to \nbuild on the progress that they have made to prevent Iran from \nobtaining a nuclear weapon.\n  I do believe there are Democrats and Republicans in Congress who \ngenuinely want to strengthen the ability of the U.S. and the \ninternational community to respond effectively to Iran's recent testing \nof ballistic missiles, hold Iran accountable for their support of \nmilitant and terrorist organizations in the Middle East, and secure the \nfreedom of Americans currently imprisoned in Iran.\n  I also believe that achieving these goals may not require \nlegislation, but strong bipartisan actions that increase U.S. leverage \nwith our international partners and with Iran.\n  But playing dangerous political games with our national security by \nbringing legislation like this to the floor, legislation that would \nundermine and perhaps even kill the nuclear deal with Iran, is not the \nanswer.\n  Now, luckily for the American people, this bill is not going to go \nanywhere. Even if it were actually passed by both Chambers of Congress \nand made its way to the President's desk, it would be vetoed, and I \nstrongly doubt that the Congress would be able to overturn a \nPresidential veto in support of such a clearly partisan bill.\n  Last week, Congress voted for the 62nd time to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act, and soon afterward, that bill was vetoed by the President. \nThat is 62 times that Republicans wasted the American people's time and \ntaxpayer dollars trying to take health care away from millions of \nfamilies, all to make a political point.\n  Congress has already voted on the Iran deal. My colleagues who \nopposed the deal tried to kill it, and they failed. It is now official \npolicy. Are House Republicans going to take us down the same path they \ndid with the Affordable Care Act? Are we also going to vote on this \nbill 62 times, a bill that we know the President will veto, just so the \nRepublicans can make a political point?\n\n[[Page H300]]\n\n  Let's stop wasting the American people's time on such bills. Let's \nput politics aside and actually work together to responsibly monitor \nimplementation of the Iran deal and find ways to strengthen U.S. \nleverage in other areas of concern on Iran.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 3662 and reject this rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, the House is also taking up two Republican bills \nthat would have devastating effects on the environment and our Nation's \npublic health. The first piece of legislation, S.J. Res. 22, is the \nRepublican majority's fifth attempt to get rid of the Clean Water Rule. \nHere we are, having the same discussion once again, wasting the \nAmerican taxpayers' time and money.\n  The Clean Water Rule was created in response to the Supreme Court \ndeclaring that the Clean Water Act needed to be narrowed and more \nclearly defined. So the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers did just \nthat--they narrowed the scope and provided for much-needed \nclarification.\n  With the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers doing exactly what they were \nsupposed to do, you would think that would be the end of it. The EPA's \nability to protect our water from pollution has been narrowed and the \nindustry received the clarification that they wanted.\n  Unfortunately, my Republican friends are pushing new legislation to \nfurther weaken vital environmental protections.\n  The final bill before us, H.R. 1644, the STREAM Act, is a bill that \nis going nowhere and is the same bill that Republicans brought up last \nyear, with the only difference being--and this is a major difference, I \nguess--but the only difference is that they changed the name. \nOtherwise, it is the same thing.\n  Mr. Speaker, the sole purpose of this Republican bill is to reverse \nthe rule that the Department of the Interior released last year that \nregulates the destructive practice of mountaintop removal mining.\n  It has long been known that mountaintop removal mining heavily \npollutes drinking water, destroys wildlife habitats, and puts local \ncommunities at greater risk of contracting life-threatening diseases.\n  Keeping the American people healthy and safe should always be our \nfirst priority in Congress. Yet, this bill is more focused on making it \neasier for big energy companies to continue the destructive and \ndangerous practice of mountaintop removal and gives no thought \nwhatsoever to the risks it poses to the American families nearby.\n  Before the recent rule released by the Department of the Interior in \nJuly 2015, parts of the regulations for mountaintop mining were more \nthan 30 years old. Updates were clearly long overdue, and the fact that \nHouse Republicans are now actively working against the safeguards \nestablished by the rule is astounding.\n  Are Republicans so beholden to big coal companies that they would put \nthe health and safety of our country's families at risk? This bill \nclearly suggests that the answer is yes.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are only 2 weeks into the new year, and instead of \nHouse Republicans starting the year by working in a bipartisan way to \nbring serious legislation to the floor, we are, once again, debating \npolitical messaging bills that fail to address the most pressing issues \nwe face in a constructive way.\n  There is so much we need to do, and I believe that there is so much \nthat we can agree on and actually move forward that will get through \nboth Chambers and go to the White House and be signed and become law \nand actually improve things for the people of this country. That is \nwhat we are supposed to be doing here.\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve a lot better than this.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have got several colleagues here that would like to \nweigh in on all three of these issues. But before I turn the floor over \nto them, I just wanted to make a comment about the fact that there are \ntwo closed rule bills in this.\n  All of these issues before us today have been thoroughly vetted. They \nhave been through the committee process. They have had ample \nopportunity for people to weigh in.\n  In fact, one of the bills is in a structured rule. Actually, we are \nallowing four amendments. Three of those amendments are from the \nDemocratic side. So I think that there is ample opportunity for all \npeople to make their feelings known on this legislation in front of us.\n  I would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that transparency, public \ninvolvement, and anything that the administration, that this government \ndoes, is not a waste of time. In fact, it is our duty to make sure that \nthe public has the ability to see what its government is doing, to make \nsure it is done in the light of day.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. \nSmith), my good friend.\n  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and, certainly, the \nunderlying legislation.\n  Despite abundantly clear congressional intent to limit Federal \njurisdiction under the Clean Water Act to only navigable waters, the \nwaters of the United States rule will expand EPA's jurisdiction to \nnearly all areas with any hydrological connection to navigable waters.\n  This rule relied on--and I want to quote here General Peabody of the \nArmy Corps of Engineers--``inappropriate assumptions with no connection \nto the data provided, misapplied data, analytical deficiencies, and \nlogical inconsistencies.''\n  In fact, the Army Corps, the joint author of the rule, was so \nconcerned about the EPA's methods, they wanted their name and logo \nremoved from EPA documents.\n  Furthermore, it has now come to light that the EPA broke Federal law \nby engaging in a propaganda campaign to carry out this agenda behind \ntheir rule.\n  Congress has a responsibility to guard against these bureaucratic \npower grabs by executive agencies. This is why I introduced the \ncompanion bill to the underlying legislation immediately after the rule \nwas finalized. The resolution has gained more than 70 cosponsors, with \nsupporters from both sides of the aisle.\n  Thanks to the expedited procedures established under the \nCongressional Review Act, when we vote on this legislation tomorrow, \nthe bill will proceed directly to the President's desk.\n  Tomorrow's vote will also mark the second time legislation has passed \nout of the House of Representatives to repeal the waters of the U.S. \nrule with bipartisan support.\n  My hope is the President will listen to the American people, listen \nto their concerns, local officials, small-business men and women, and \nbegin pursuing policies which expand economic opportunity, and not \nstifle innovation with one regulation after another.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to respond to something the gentleman from \nWashington said when he basically made the statement that as long as \ncommittees take action, we don't need open rules. That is a whole new \napproach to the way this place is being run. I thought the Speaker of \nthe House made it very clear he wanted more open rules. The previous \nSpeaker of the House did, too. He didn't do that.\n  The bottom line is just because a committee took action on it, there \nare 435 Members of this House, and not everybody is on the same \ncommittee. We ought to be able to have a free-flowing debate, and \npeople ought to be able to offer amendments. We ought to deliberate.\n  I am going to make a prediction that, if we did have an opportunity \nto truly be a deliberative body, you might get better legislation, and \nyou might get legislation that gets lots of bipartisan support and \nactually gets signed into law and we get things done. Instead, we are \nstuck in this pattern where we really don't have regular order. We have \norder enforced with an iron fist where people are just locked out. It \nis not just Democrats that are locked out of the process; it is \nRepublicans as well. When you close a rule down completely, it means \nnobody--nobody--has an opportunity to offer anything.\n\n[[Page H301]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nSherman), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on \nAsia and the Pacific.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the portion of the rule \nthat deals with the Iran terrorism bill.\n  I have voted for every Iran sanctions bill to come to this floor. I \nhelped draft many of them, and I am ready to draft, work on, and vote \nfor Iran sanctions bills in the future even if they are opposed by the \nadministration. Keep in mind, nearly every Iran sanctions bill, which \nhas passed this House floor, became law, and gave us at least some \nleverage over Iran, was opposed by the then-George W. Bush \nadministration and by this administration.\n  We need a good process to draft good legislation that will do what \nPresident Obama promised we would do, and that is adopt new sanctions \ndesigned to change Iran's behavior with regard to its nonnuclear \nwrongdoing, its support for terrorism, its missile test in violation of \nU.N. Security Council resolutions, its human rights record, and its \nseizure of American hostages.\n  Unfortunately, this is a flawed bill which is the product of a flawed \nprocess. Look at the process: 100 cosponsors, all from one party, with \nno Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee invited to help draft the \nbill or even invited to cosponsor it.\n  Now this process is epitomized by a closed rule. The gentleman from \nWashington offers a new definition of an open rule. An open rule is a \nclosed rule on a bill that has been considered by a committee. That is \nthe new definition of ``open rule.'' I suggest we keep the old \ndefinition.\n  This is a closed rule that prevents people from offering amendments \nthat might have had a better chance of passing on the floor than they \nwould have in committee. A Member should be free to offer amendments \nboth on the floor and in committee if they are a member of the \ncommittee; but this is a closed rule, and this process of a closed rule \nprevents amendments to fix flaws in the bill.\n  There are at least two. The first is that the bill deprives the \nPresident of the authority to delist some 489 entities. It locks them \non to the SDN list, but it leaves out 269 other entities, creating two \nclasses of wrongdoing companies and other entities that sponsor and \nfacilitate terrorism for no apparent reason. An entity stays on the \nlist until the President issues a certification, a certification that \nno President could ever certify. You have to certify that we know that \nfrom the beginning of time the entity has not had any dealing with any \nof dozens of different terrorist organizations. That is a certification \ndesigned to be impossible and designed to lock entities in.\n  I look forward to a bipartisan process. For example, I have a bill \nthat has been cosponsored by the current and immediate prior chair of \nthe Foreign Affairs Committee. There are other bills subject to a \nbipartisan process because we do need new sanctions on Iran to change \nits nonnuclear wrongdoing. Those sanctions are warranted because Iran \nhas engaged in the missile test in violation of the U.N. Security \nCouncil resolution, because its support for terrorism is responsible \nfor the deaths of tens of thousands of people in Syria and Yemen, and \nbecause it used to hold four but now holds five American hostages, not \nto mention its other human rights records. It is consistent with \nadministration policy that we have sanctions on Iran's nonnuclear \nbehavior.\n  The negotiations in Vienna, the negotiations on this deal, left out \nall of Iran's nonnuclear behavior, not because it was intended to give \nthem carte blanche, not because we were accepting their support for \nterrorism, but because these were to be the subject of other sanctions \nand other efforts to force a change in Iran's behavior.\n  Finally, the question is, well, do sanctions work? That is the one \nthing the opponents and proponents of the deal agreed on. The \nproponents of the deal said that the sanctions have brought us a very \ngood deal. The opponents of the deal said that more sanctions will get \nus a better deal. So in a House that was divided on almost every aspect \nof Iran policy, the one thing we agreed on was that sanctions have the \ncapacity to change Iran's behavior.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The time of the gentleman \nhas expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. So the President promised that we would not abandon our \nefforts with regard to Iran's terrorism and with regard to Iran's \nhostage taking, and that we would not abandon the four hostages they \nhad then or the additional hostage that they have taken since the deal, \nand that we would not turn a blind eye to the fact that Iran is the \nsingle most important ally of the butcher Assad, who has killed over \n200,000 of his own people, not to mention Iran's support for terrorism \nin Yemen.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should not fail to do so simply because we have a \ndeal that was exclusively, strictly, and explicitly limited to dealing \nwith Iran's nuclear program. That said, the bill before this House \ntoday is a flawed bill that cannot be corrected because of a flawed \nprocess. We need a bipartisan process that crafts a policy toward \nIran's nonnuclear wrongdoing that unites, if not all of this House, a \nlarge majority of this House.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to make the point that \nit is customary, whether Republicans are in control or whether \nDemocrats control, that the CRAs, the Congressional Review Acts, come \nto the floor under a closed rule. I might also say that, regarding the \nSTREAM Act, all amendments that were germane were made in order. As it \ncomes to the bill pertaining to Iran, that bill was marked up in \ncommittee last week. No amendments were offered, and the bill passed on \nvoice vote.\n  Having made those points, Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngood gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule.\n  Tonight President Obama will deliver his final State of the Union, \nwhere I expect he will celebrate his supposed achievements over the \nlast 7 years. Outside the beltway, and especially in western \nPennsylvania, there is little to celebrate about the Obama Presidency. \nThe war on coal has been a central feature of Washington's misguided \nefforts over the past several years, and it has caused the loss of over \n40,000 jobs in the coal industry across the country and economic \nhardship in coal country.\n  Later today we will vote on the STREAM Act, which challenges OSM's \nso-called stream protection rule. I am a cosponsor of this legislation, \nand I look forward to its passage.\n  The stream protection rule is yet another block in the wall of \nregulation that President Obama has been building the last 7 years. It \nwill lead to the loss of thousands of jobs, and it will reduce coal \nreserves by 41 percent. That amounts to a $20 billion loss to the \neconomy.\n  Just yesterday we learned of the bankruptcy of yet another coal \ncompany. The job losses, firm closures, and disruptions to our \ncommunities are real, and they cannot be ignored any longer. This is an \nattack on cheap, plentiful, and reliable energy, and it will result in \nmore control from Washington of the economy and the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow Members to support the passage of this \nrule and the associated bills.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I again continue to be amazed that the gentleman from \nWashington defends this process. I don't know how anybody can defend \nthis process, it is so flawed. The end result is, again, bringing bills \nto the floor that are going nowhere and that are sound bites. They are \nnot serious legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration \nPolicy on all three bills in which the White House says they will veto \nthese bills.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n                         h.r. 1644--stream act\n\n         (Rep. Mooney, R-WV, and 34 cosponsors, Jan. 11, 2016)\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1644, which would \n     delay for at least three years updated regulations, known as \n     the Stream Protection Rule, to protect streams\n\n[[Page H302]]\n\n     from the effects of destructive surface coal mining \n     practices. Such a needless delay of these important \n     safeguards would impact the communities and economies that \n     depend on clean water and a healthy environment.\n       The current stream protection requirements governing \n     surface mining activities are more than 30 years old and do \n     not incorporate significant advances in scientific knowledge \n     and mining and reclamation techniques. An arbitrary three \n     year restriction to block the updated modern, science-based \n     regulations would significantly impair the ability of the \n     Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) \n     to accomplish the mission and responsibilities the Congress \n     laid out in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of \n     1977, including preserving clean water, human health, and the \n     environment.\n       H.R. 1644 would prevent the restoration of hundreds of \n     streams, result in deterioration of water quality for \n     thousands of stream miles, and create sustained regulatory \n     uncertainty, as well as public health impacts for downstream \n     communities. In addition, the bill would impose arbitrary \n     requirements and unnecessary processes that would seriously \n     impede OSMRE's ability to use the best available science to \n     protect public health and the environment.\n       If the President were presented with H.R. 1644, his senior \n     advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\ns.j. res. 22--disapproving epa/army rule on waters of the united states\n\n          (Sen. Ernst, R-IA, and 49 cosponsors, Nov. 3, 2015)\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes S.J. Res. 22, which \n     would nullify a specified Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA) and the Department of the Army (Army) final rule \n     clarifying the jurisdictional boundaries of the Clean Water \n     Act (CWA). The agencies' rulemaking, grounded in science and \n     the law, is essential to ensure clean water for future \n     generations, and is responsive to calls for rulemaking from \n     the Congress, industry, and community stakeholders as well as \n     decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. The final rule has been \n     through an extensive public engagement process.\n       Clean water is vital for the success of the Nation's \n     businesses, agriculture, energy development, and the health \n     of our communities. More than one in three Americans get \n     their drinking water from rivers, lakes, and reservoirs that \n     are at risk of pollution from upstream sources. The \n     protection of wetlands is also vital for hunting and fishing. \n     When Congress passed the CWA in 1972 to restore the Nation's \n     waters, it recognized that to have healthy communities \n     downstream, we need to protect the smaller streams and \n     wetlands upstream.\n       Clarifying the scope of the CWA helps to protect clean \n     water, safeguard public health, and strengthen the economy. \n     Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 focused on specific \n     jurisdictional determinations and rejected the analytical \n     approach that the Army Corps of Engineers used for those \n     determinations, but did not invalidate the underlying \n     regulation. This has created ongoing questions and \n     uncertainty about how the regulation is applied consistent \n     with the Court's decisions. The final rule was developed to \n     address this uncertainty and it should remain in place.\n       If enacted, S.J. Res. 22 would nullify years of work and \n     deny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty \n     needed to invest in projects that rely on clean water. EPA \n     and Army have sought the views of and listened carefully to \n     the public throughout the extensive public engagement process \n     for this rule.\n       Simply put, S.J. Res. 22 is not an act of good governance. \n     It would sow confusion and invite conflict at a time when our \n     communities and businesses need clarity and certainty around \n     clean water regulation.\n       If the President were presented with S.J. Res. 22, his \n     senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n            H.R. 3662--iran terror finance transparency act\n\n         (Rep. Russell, R-OK, and 62 cosponsors, Jan. 11, 2016)\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3662, the Iran \n     Terror Finance Transparency Act, which would prevent the \n     United States from implementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan \n     of Action (JCPOA) by tying the Administration's ability to \n     fulfill U.S. commitments under the deal to unrelated, non-\n     nuclear issues.\n       H.R. 3662 includes provisions that connect the United \n     States' JCPOA commitment to provide sanctions relief by \n     delisting certain Iran-related individuals and entities, \n     including banks, to non-nuclear issues outside of the scope \n     of the JCPOA. In addition, certain provisions would \n     effectively preclude delisting of individuals or entities on \n     Implementation Day of the JCPOA--the day on which the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency verifies that Iran has \n     completed key nuclear-related steps that significantly \n     dismantle and constrain its nuclear program--based on \n     activity that may have taken place and ended long before \n     Implementation Day and involving persons or activity that \n     will no longer be sanctioned post-Implementation Day. By \n     preventing the United States from fulfilling its JCPOA \n     commitments, H.R. 3662 could result in the collapse of a \n     comprehensive diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and \n     verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. \n     Such a collapse would remove the unprecedented constraints on \n     Iran's nuclear program that we achieved in the JCPOA, lead to \n     the unraveling of the international sanctions regime against \n     Iran, and deal a devastating blow to America's credibility as \n     a leader of international diplomacy. This would have ripple \n     effects, jeopardizing the hard work of sustaining a unified \n     coalition to combat Iran's destabilizing activities in the \n     region, calling into question the effectiveness of our \n     sanctions regime and our ability to lead the world on nuclear \n     non-proliferation.\n       The Administration has consistently made clear that the \n     purpose of the nuclear negotiations, and ultimately the \n     JCPOA, was to address one issue only--the international \n     community's concerns over Iran's nuclear program and to \n     verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The \n     JCPOA is the mechanism through which the United States was \n     able to garner international support for our sanctions and \n     achieve a diplomatic resolution.\n       As we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program \n     through implementation of the JCPOA, the Administration \n     remains clear-eyed and shares the deep concerns of the \n     Congress and the American people about Iran's support for \n     terrorism. Powerful sanctions targeting Iran's support for \n     terrorism, its ballistic missile activities, its human rights \n     abuses, and its destabilizing activities in the region remain \n     in effect. Anyone worldwide who transacts with or supports \n     individuals or entities sanctioned in connection with Iran's \n     support for terrorism or development of WMD and their means \n     of delivery, including missiles--or who does the same with \n     any Iranian individual or entity who remains on Treasury's \n     Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List--puts \n     themselves at risk of being sanctioned.\n       The President has made it clear that he will veto any \n     legislation that prevents the successful implementation of \n     the JCPOA. If the President were presented with H.R. 3662, he \n     would veto the bill.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from \nthe Win Without War coalition, 11 million activists across the country \nin opposition to H.R. 3662.\n\nA Statement From Drew Proctor, Advocacy Director of ``Win Without War''\n\n       The Win Without War coalition, on behalf of our 11 million \n     activists, urges your office to stand strong against all \n     attempts to undermine the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \n     in Congress.\n       In particular, we urge Representative McGovern to OPPOSE \n     H.R. 3662, the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act.\n       H.R. 3662, which would prohibit President Obama from \n     delivering on sanctions relief, has the potential to damage \n     the leadership and credibility of the United States at this \n     critical moment just before the historic agreement is \n     implemented. Furthermore, the timing of the House's vote--\n     between President Obama's State of the Union speech and the \n     deal's implementation date later this month--appears to be a \n     deliberately partisan act designed to undermine the President \n     and weaken his legacy. At a time when much of the Middle East \n     is engulfed in war, the US has rightfully seized this \n     opportunity to solve one of our most pressing national \n     security threats without dropping a single bomb. We must not \n     let political interests trump our national security goals. \n     Huge progress has been made since the Iran deal was announced \n     last July. Just yesterday, Iran reportedly took steps to \n     remove the core of its plutonium reactor and fill it with \n     concrete.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Drew Proctor,\n\n                                                Advocacy Director,\n                                                  Win Without War.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 65 \nenvironmental organizations representing millions of members in \nopposition to H.J. Res. 22.\n\n                                                 January 12, 2016.\n       Representative: The undersigned organizations, and our \n     millions of members and supporters, oppose the Dirty Water \n     Resolution (S.J. Res. 22). The ``Resolution of Disapproval'' \n     under the Congressional Review Act attacks the Clean Water \n     Rule, the Obama administration's landmark initiative to \n     restore safeguards against pollution and destruction for \n     lakes, streams, wetlands and other water bodies.\n       The Clean Water Rule restores important safeguards that \n     once existed for a variety of water bodies. Those safeguards \n     were eroded after a pair of Supreme Court decisions and by \n     policies the Bush administration adopted, which left many \n     water bodies inadequately protected or lacking the pollution \n     control requirements of the Clean Water Act. The rule \n     restores prior protections for many critical wetlands, which \n     curb flooding, filter pollution, and provide habitat for a \n     wide variety of wildlife, including endangered species and \n     wildfowl and fish prized by hunters and anglers.\n       The Dirty Water Resolution is an extreme action that seeks \n     to kill the Clean Water Rule using the Congressional Review \n     Act, which goes far beyond stopping a disapproved \n     administrative action. The Congressional Review Act says that \n     an agency may not adopt ``a new rule that is substantially \n     the same'' as the disapproved rule, and the breadth of that \n     requirement is very unclear.\n\n[[Page H303]]\n\n       In the context of the Clean Water Rule, it could be read to \n     prohibit EPA and the Army Corps from issuing any rule that \n     establishes protections for waters that the Clean Water Rule \n     covers, like lakes, streams, and wetlands. The Dirty Water \n     Resolution radically undermines the agencies' ability to \n     clarify the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act--despite \n     urging from industry associations, conservation groups, \n     members of Congress, state and local leaders, and Supreme \n     Court justices for such a clarification.\n       By pursuing this anti-clean water resolution, pro-polluter \n     members of the House of Representatives are seeking to kill a \n     commonsense and modest rule containing scientifically-sound \n     and legally-valid protections for the nation's waters, \n     including critical drinlcing water supplies.\n       Restored clean water protections enjoy broad support. In \n     polling for the American Sustainable Business Council, eighty \n     percent of small business owners--including 91% of Democrats, \n     73% of Independents and 78% of Republicans--said they \n     supported the then-proposed Clean Water Rule. A strong \n     majority, 71%, also said that clean water protections are \n     necessary to ensure economic growth; only six percent said \n     they were bad for growth. Similarly, a bipartisan research \n     team polled hunters and anglers nationwide and discovered \n     that 83% surveyed thought that the Environmental Protection \n     Agency should apply the rules and standards of the Clean \n     Water Act to smaller, headwater streams and wetlands. Support \n     for this policy was strong across the political spectrum, \n     with 77% of Republicans, 79% of Independents and 97% of \n     Democrats in favor.\n       We ask that you oppose the Dirty Water Resolution (S.J. \n     Res. 22) because it will undermine protections for our \n     drinking water supplies, flood buffers, and fish and wildlife \n     habitat. This attack on clean water is not only a waste of \n     the House's time but also an excessive and dangerous act that \n     jeopardizes clean water for generations to come.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alliance for the Great Lakes, American Rivers, American \n     Whitewater, Amigos Bravos, Arkansas Public Policy Panel, \n     BlueGreen Alliance, Central Minnesota Chapter of Audubon, \n     Clean Water Action, Conservation Minnesota, Earthjustice, \n     Endangered Habitats League, Environment America, Environment \n     California, Environment Colorado, Environment Connecticut, \n     Environment Florida, Environment Georgia, Environment \n     Illinois, Environment Iowa, Environment Maine, Environment \n     Maryland, Environment Massachusetts.\n       Environment Michigan, Environment Minnesota, Environment \n     Montana, Environment New Hampshire, Environment New Jersey, \n     Environment New Mexico, Environment New York, Environment \n     North Carolina, Environment Oregon, Environment Texas, \n     Environment Virginia, Environment Washington, Freshwater \n     Future, Friends of the Cloquet Valley State Park, Friends of \n     the Mississippi River, Great Lakes Committee--the Izaak \n     Walton League, GreenLatinos, Greenpeace, Gulf Restoration \n     Network, Hoosier Environmental Council, Iowa Environmental \n     Council, Kentucky Waterways Alliance.\n       League of Conservation Voters, Michigan Wildlife \n     Conservancy, Midwest Environmental Advocates, Minnesota \n     Center for Environmental Advocacy, Minnesota Conservation \n     Federation, Minnesota Environmental Partnership, Missouri \n     Coalition for the Environment, Natural Resources Defense \n     Council, Nature Abounds, Ohio Wetlands Association, \n     PennEnvironment, Prairie Rivers Network, Religious Coalition \n     for the Great Lakes, River Network, Save the Dunes, Shaker \n     Lakes Garden Club, Sierra Club, Southern Environmental Law \n     Center, Surfrider Foundation, Tennessee Clean Water Network, \n     Wisconsin Environment, Wisconsin Wildlife Federation.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from \neight sportsmen and conservation organizations in strong opposition to \nS.J. Res. 22.\n\n                                                 January 11, 2016.\n     Re Hunters and Anglers Strongly Oppose S.J. Res. 22 \n         Invalidating the Final Clean Water Rule\n\n       Dear Representative: The undersigned sportsmen and \n     conservation organizations strongly oppose Senate Joint \n     Resolution 22, which the House of Representatives may vote on \n     this week and would invalidate the final Clean Water Rule. \n     This important rule clarifies Clean Water Act jurisdiction in \n     a manner that is both legally and scientifically sound.\n       This joint resolution is an extraordinary and radical \n     action to overturn a fundamental, once-in-a-generation final \n     rule that is critical to the effective implementation of the \n     1972 Clean Water Act, and that was adopted following an \n     exhaustive public rulemaking process. The resolution would \n     overturn a rule that finally resolves longstanding confusion \n     and debate, promotes clarity and efficiency for regulatory \n     programs promoting river health, and preserves longstanding \n     protections for farmers, ranchers, and foresters.\n       By using the Congressional Review Act, this joint \n     resolution not only wipes out the final Clean Water Rule but \n     also prohibits any substantially similar rule in the future. \n     It locks in the current state of jurisdictional confusion and \n     offers no constructive path forward for regulatory clarity or \n     clean water. America's hunters and anglers cannot afford to \n     have Congress undermine effective Clean Water Act safeguards, \n     leaving communities and valuable fish and wildlife habitat at \n     risk indefinitely.\n       This joint resolution dismisses the voices of the millions \n     of Americans, including businesses that depend on clean \n     water, who support the new rule and are eager to reap its \n     benefits. The agencies engaged in a very transparent and \n     thorough multi-year rulemaking process that included over 400 \n     stakeholder meetings and an extended public comment period \n     that produced over one million comments. Nearly 900,000 \n     members of the public commented in support of the Clean Water \n     Rule. A recent poll found that 83 percent of sportsmen and \n     women think the Clean Water Act should apply to smaller \n     streams and wetlands, as the new rule directs.\n       The Clean Water Rule clearly restores longstanding \n     protections for millions of wetlands and headwater streams \n     that contribute to the drinking water of 1 in 3 Americans, \n     protect communities from flooding, and provide essential fish \n     and wildlife habitat that supports a robust outdoor \n     recreation economy. The sport fishing industry alone accounts \n     for 828,000 jobs, nearly $50 billion annually in retail \n     sales, and an economic impact of about $115 billion every \n     year that relies on access to clean water. The Clean Water \n     Rule will translate directly to an improved bottom line for \n     America's outdoor industry.\n       Opponents claiming the rule goes too far and protects water \n     too much have filed a barrage of nearly identical legal \n     challenges in numerous district and appellate courts across \n     the country. On October 9, 2015, the 6th Circuit Court of \n     Appeals temporarily stayed the Clean Water Rule nationwide. \n     The Clean Water Rule and those who oppose it will have their \n     day in court.\n       Meanwhile, we want Congress to know that despite these \n     legal challenges, conservationists across the nation are \n     steadfast in our support for the Clean Water Rule. After \n     nearly 15 years of Clean Water Act confusion, further delay \n     is unacceptable to the millions of hunters and anglers eager \n     to have their local waters fully protected again. We are \n     confident that, when the dust settles in the courts, the \n     Clean Water Rule will withstand challenges saying it protects \n     our water too much.\n       The Clean Water Act has always been about restoring and \n     maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity \n     of the Nation's waters. It is bedrock support for America's \n     more than 40 million hunters and anglers and for the 117 \n     million Americans whose drinking water depends on healthy \n     headwater streams.\n       We thank all of the members of Congress who stand with \n     America's sportsmen and women to block attempts to derail the \n     rule, and ask you to reject S.J. Res. 22 and any other \n     legislative action against the rule that may follow this \n     year.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Fisheries Society, American Fly Fishing Trade \n     Association, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, International \n     Federation of Fly Fishers, Izaak Walton League of America, \n     National Wildlife Federation, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation \n     Partnership, Trout Unlimited.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from nine \npublic interest, environmental, and labor organizations strongly \nopposing H.R. 1644.\n\n                                                 January 11, 2016.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members \n     and supporters we strongly urge you to oppose the stream \n     pollution bill, H.R. 1644, a bill expected on the House floor \n     the week of January 11, 2016. This bill would put costly and \n     unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles in the already overburdened \n     regulatory process with the sole intent of ensuring that coal \n     companies can continue to destroy streams with coal wastes.\n       The present rules protecting such streams date to 1983. \n     After the Department of Interior took several years to \n     develop the proposed Stream Protection Rule, this bill \n     requires a new study, this time by the National Academy of \n     Sciences, on the effectiveness of the current decades-old \n     surface mining regulation. The bill carves out two years for \n     the completion of that study and then bars DOI from updating \n     the rule for an additional year after that. In the meantime, \n     communities will continue to shoulder the burden of water \n     pollution and mining abuses. The intent of these new delays \n     is clear: let the mining companies continue unimpeded with \n     sacrificing the streams and health of the communities that \n     surround their mines.\n       Another section of the bill adds new procedural hurdles \n     before DOI can act under the surface mining law. Today, the \n     Secretary and the heads of all rulemaking agencies regularly \n     make available all the information relied upon concurrently \n     with the proposed or final rule. Doing so enables \n     stakeholders to weigh in during the public comment period on \n     the basis for the proposal. This bill requires DOI to publish \n     all scientific data used in a proposed rule 90 days before \n     publication. It is unclear what the intent of this redundant \n     provision is other than to congest the regulatory system with \n     even more process and delay. If the Agency fails to meet this \n     new paperwork burden, the goal of the authors is met--the \n     protections must be delayed even further.\n       Unfortunately, these types of delay tactics are becoming \n     increasingly common across\n\n[[Page H304]]\n\n     the regulatory spectrum as polluters attempt to dodge their \n     responsibilities. Thus, H.R. 1644 continues a dangerous trend \n     of undermining public health and environmental protections \n     under the guise of transparency. We urge you to vote against \n     this legislation, both to protect mining communities and to \n     our reject attempts to delay and frustrate improved \n     regulatory protections.\n           Sincerely,\n       Center for Biological Diversity, Center for Effective \n     Government, Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of \n     Concerned Scientists, Economic Policy Institute, Institute \n     for Agriculture and Trade Policy, Natural Resources Defense \n     Council, Public Citizen, United Auto Workers, United States \n     Public Interest Research Group.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the \nUnion of Concerned Scientists in strong opposition to H.R. 1644.\n\n                                Union of Concerned Scientists,\n\n                                                September 9, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: The Union of Concerned Scientists, \n     with 450,000 members and supporters throughout the country, \n     strongly opposes The Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute \n     to H.R. 1644, the STREAM ACT. H.R. 1644, as amended, would \n     require the public disclosure of any and all information used \n     to promulgate rules, and even policy guidance, relating to \n     the Surface Mining and Control Act.\n       As we highlighted in Science, this proposal is just another \n     example of what's becoming an old and tired song: an attempt \n     to cloak an effort to block common-sense regulation in the \n     guise of transparency. Furthermore, as we noted in a letter \n     sent to the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this year \n     opposing H.R. 1030, the Secret Science Reform Act, this type \n     of proposal represents a solution in search of a problem and \n     greatly impedes the agency's responsibility to protect public \n     health and the environment.\n       The amended version improves the original bill by exempting \n     certain types of data from public disclosure. However, the \n     language is so vague, it will make it very difficult for \n     scientists doing federally-funded research to know whether or \n     not the data they have spent years collecting may be \n     prematurely disclosed before they can publish their own \n     studies. At the very least, this discourages scientists from \n     doing any crucial research that may be required to be \n     publicly disclosed.\n       Worse, by linking agency rulemaking to public disclosure, \n     this bill risks the timely implementation of regulations and \n     guidance documents that protect the public health and safety \n     and our environment. Agency rules will be delayed if any \n     piece of underlying data used to inform rules or guidance \n     documents is not publicly disclosed 90 days before the \n     proposed rule or guidance is published. This is flawed \n     because the data is not owned by the Department of Interior \n     and the release of the data is under the researcher's \n     control. For each day the data is delayed, the comment period \n     is extended by a day. If the delay lasts longer than six \n     months, the rule must be withdrawn.\n       These restrictions apply even to emergency rules, unless a \n     delay ``will pose an imminent and severe threat to human \n     life.'' Notably missing here however is the environment. For \n     example, if a stream is polluted at a level that doesn't pose \n     an immediate risk but may pose a long-term risk, under this \n     proposal, the environmental pollution could not be stopped \n     until it might be too late.\n       This proposal offers special interests a new way to game \n     the system, by challenging the comprehensiveness of any data \n     that the Department of Interior submits to fulfill the bill's \n     requirements. Who decides when the data includes ``all the \n     data?'' How much data, for example, must be released to \n     justify an economic assessment, or an environmental analysis \n     or a guidance document?\n       Unanswered, too, is the question whether a regulation or \n     guidance document based on exempt information is considered \n     valid for purposes of this bill. Could the use of exempt \n     information itself be grounds for a challenge?\n       This bill would also expend taxpayer dollars by requiring \n     the Department of Interior to spend $2 million on a study to \n     evaluate the ``effectiveness'' of 1983 regulation to protect \n     perennial and intermittent streams through the use of stream \n     buffer zones. But the goal of the study is not to actually \n     help the Department of Interior become a better custodian of \n     our environment.\n       The real goal is to impose a sweeping moratorium on all \n     regulations related to stream buffer zones for the time it \n     takes the National Academy of Sciences to complete the \n     ``comprehensive study'' plus another year for review. Since \n     the bill anticipates funding for the NAS in both 2016 and \n     2017, Interior regulations would be blocked for at least \n     three years. If the study is never funded though, the rules \n     would be indefinitely delayed.\n       We recommend that you oppose Representative Mooney's \n     amendment to H.R. 1644, as well as the underlying bill. The \n     proposal would inhibit the Department of Interior's ability \n     to carry out its science and evidence-based responsibility to \n     protect human health and the environment. We strongly urge \n     you not to report this proposal out of committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Andrew A. Rosenberg, Ph.D.,\n                                  Director, Center for Science and\n                         Democracy, Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nthe great State of Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler).\n  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, for 20 years, Republican and \nDemocratic administrations, alike, have effectively regulated navigable \nwaters--which is the official term--under the Clean Water Act to \nprotect both our environment and private property, but the Obama \nadministration is trying to change all of that. The Obama \nAdministration's new definition will give the EPA authority over every \npond or seasonal stream, drainage ditch, or puddle in the United \nStates--every single one. Every piece of land where water falls from \nthe heavens, the EPA is claiming control over.\n  What does that mean if you want to put a deck on your house or move \nyour driveway or build a shed or something similar? It means you are \ngoing to have to apply to the Federal Government for a permit.\n  What do those permits look like? They take upwards of 788 days to \nobtain, and they cost upwards of $270,000 to get per permit, per \npuddle, per ditch, or per stream that you want to amend.\n  So I hope you are either really rich and have a ton of time on your \nhands or you don't want to ever change anything because this is almost \nimpossible.\n  I would call this new change a solution in search of a problem, but \nit is a solution that is going to create a problem. There is no \nevidence that this is going to give us stronger environmental \nprotections, that we are going to have cleaner water, or that we are \neven going to have a benefit. What is really going to happen is the EPA \nis going to be kingmaker; and you and I, as Americans, are going to be \nforced to grovel at their feet, begging for permits on our own land.\n  This really impacts those of us in the West tremendously. Every \nAmerican should sit up and pay attention because this impacts \neverybody, including cities and counties.\n  I hope you don't need a new hospital in your area or you don't need a \ngrocery store or perhaps your city needs to expand or grow or change, \nbecause this effectively says that one agency, headed by very political \nand liberal--at this point, very liberal--ideologues will get to make \nthat decision, and they are not going to give us the benefit. That is \nthe scary thing here.\n  So I look forward to joining with Republicans and commonsense \nDemocrats, because believe it or not, just like in years past, \nRepublicans and Democrats are both opposed to this, to put this block \nin place and to move forward.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would just simply say that there is a difference \nbetween Democrats and Republicans when it comes to the environment, \nprotecting the health and well-being of the people of this country, \nespecially from industry. I think we, on the Democratic side, have \nconsistently been on the side of protecting people, and my friends on \nthe other side have been consistently on the side of industry, no \nmatter what it means to people.\n  We see what is going on in Flint, Michigan, right now and the \nterrible water crisis that is happening there and the Republican \nGovernor who is part of what appears to be a coverup at the expense of \nthose citizens. It really is quite astonishing.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Again, this bill is going nowhere. It is going to be vetoed by the \nWhite House. So we can go through this charade.\n  I would just conclude right now, at least this portion of my speech \nhere, by saying that, as I said in the beginning, if, in fact, my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle want to get serious about \nlegislating, there are areas of agreement on these environmental \nissues, and certainly on this issue regarding Iran, where Democrats and \nRepublicans can come together. But for whatever reason, I think my \nRepublican friends have no interest in serious legislating. I think \nthat is regrettable because what we are doing here is wasting taxpayer \nmoney and wasting the people's time here in this Congress. We could be \ndoing other things that could actually be moving this country forward.\n\n[[Page H305]]\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Hill).\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Washington (Mr. \nNewhouse) for yielding.\n  In my capacity as a member of the House Committee on Financial \nServices' Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing and as a \nbusinessperson with over three decades of experience in both \ninternational affairs and banking, I have carefully considered the \ntestimony of leading foreign policy experts cautioning against America \nblindly putting its faith in a country that has never done anything to \nmake them worthy of that trust.\n  The nuclear agreement has only emboldened the Iranian regime. And why \nwouldn't it? When one sees the recent results of President Clinton's \nagreement with North Korea and this administration's lack of resolve \nand realism, why not?\n  I remind this body, Secretary Kerry, and the President of the warning \nissued to the House of Commons by Winston Churchill: ``An appeaser is \none who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last.''\n  The Iranians have kidnapped another American, taken deliveries of \nmissile technology from Russia, conducted missile tests in violation of \nU.N. Security Council resolutions, and ramped up the actions and \nrhetoric against our Arab allies. All of this is disturbing. This is \nall before Iran has even received a dime of up to $100 billion in \nexpected sanctions relief.\n  When he announced the nuclear agreement, the President said: \n``American sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism, its human \nrights abuses, its ballistic missile program, will continue to be fully \nenforced.''\n  The bill discussed in this rule, H.R. 3662, guarantees that. This \nbill removes the politicization of the listed entities in the nuclear \nagreement and forces this President to live up to his own rhetoric.\n  I am proud to support this critical piece of legislation. I call on \nall Members to support the rule and final passage of the bill and help \nguarantee the safety of the American people and our allies around the \nworld from one of our most credible threats to our national security.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would just say to the gentleman that, if this were a serious effort \nto do something in response to Iran's behavior, this would be a \nbipartisan effort, but it isn't. It is clear what this is. This is a \nway to basically try to embarrass the President, I guess. That seems to \nbe the motivation behind almost everything that is brought to this \nHouse floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I said before, we ought to be doing serious business \nhere, and we are not. One of the things that we have been trying to do \non our side is to bring to the floor legislation and amendments to deal \nwith the terrible situation with regard to gun violence in our country. \nWe are rebuffed at every moment. We can't bring anything to this floor \nwith regard to guns, I guess because the Republican Congressional \nCampaign Committee doesn't want to tick off the National Rifle \nAssociation.\n  Be that as it may, I want to urge my colleagues to defeat the \nprevious question. If we do, I will offer an amendment to the rule to \nbring up bipartisan legislation--this is actually Democrats and \nRepublicans who support this--that would close a glaring loophole in \nour gun laws allowing suspected terrorists to legally buy firearms. \nThis bill would bar the sale of firearms and explosives to those on the \nFBI's terrorist watch list.\n  Mr. Speaker, amidst gun violence in communities across our country \nand global acts of terrorism, it is time for Congress to act and keep \nguns out of the hands of suspected terrorists.\n  I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the \nRecord along with extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on \nthe previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for the life of me, I can't understand why \nsomehow it is okay to bar suspected terrorists from flying on \nairplanes, but somehow it is this terrible infringement on their rights \nto say that they can't go out and buy a firearm. It makes absolutely no \nsense. I don't think the American people--whether you are Democrat or \nRepublican or Independent--can figure out why people are so resistant \nto that here in this Congress.\n  Here is a novel idea. bring it to the floor. Allow us to have an up-\nor-down vote, not just a procedural vote, but a real up-or-down vote on \nthis, and I am willing to bet that it will probably pass with a \nbipartisan vote.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, if it embarrasses the President to be held \naccountable for the very words that come out of his mouth, I guess \nthere is not much we can do about that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nLaMalfa).\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Washington for \nyielding me the time.\n  I guess if we want to advance policy around here, the rhetoric coming \nfrom across the aisle about it being a waste of time to legislate and \nput these ideas out in front of the American people and hold the \nPresident accountable for the runaway efforts by his administration and \nhis agencies, then we are just not hearing an honest effort on the \nother side.\n  We have half-baked regulations that will damage sectors of our \neconomy in this 262 pages of revised rules that are coming down from \nthe Department of the Interior. Since 1983, the stream buffer zone rule \nhas been a rule that has struck a pretty good balance between \nprotecting water resources and mining. Adding 262 new pages effectively \nbans all mining within 100 feet of anything that they might define as a \nstream, which is going to have very detrimental effects on energy and \nour ability to conduct business in this Nation.\n  The new rule would lead to the loss of thousands of jobs, damage our \nNation's ability to produce critical minerals, construction materials, \nand domestic energy, something that we have had an advantage on up \nuntil recently.\n  While Interior claims to have spent 6 years studying this rule, it \nmanaged to completely ignore the views of the States impacted by the \nrule. I think we need to have more local input and support to H.R. 1644 \nand hold the administration accountable for what it does.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter), my good friend.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and passage of S.J. \nRes. 22, which provides congressional disapproval on EPA's extreme \noverreach with their waters of the U.S. rule.\n  Last June, the EPA published its final orders of the U.S. rule that \nwould virtually give them authority over any place water flows or \naccumulates. This would include driveways, ditches, manmade ponds, and \neven our watered lawns.\n  Currently, private and public entities spend an average of $271,000 \nand wait an average of 788 days to obtain permits from the EPA for \nprojects currently under its jurisdiction. Expanding EPA's authority in \nthis unprecedented way would be extremely devastating to landowners, \nespecially farmers, and make devastating statistics even worse.\n  With this bill, Congress would nullify this ridiculous rule and \ncontinue to provide Americans with personal control over their \nproperty. Property is not an asset that can be taken control of on the \nwhim of a government agency. Property rights are an essential natural \nright of every American, and this fact has been embedded in our \ncountry's DNA since its beginning.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this rule and S.J. Res. 22 so we can \nprevent this terrible law from infringing on the natural rights of all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I have heard a couple of speakers now talk on this, and I think some \nof the confusion might be cleared up if they actually read the rule.\n  The gentlewoman from Washington who spoke earlier talked about that \nthis would regulate puddles. Well, the\n\n[[Page H306]]\n\nclean water rule does not regulate puddles. In fact, numerous comments \nwere submitted to EPA asking the Agency specifically to exclude \npuddles. I have got good news for you: the final rules does just that, \nand the clean water rule does not regulate most ditches either. We \nmight as well get those facts on the table.\n  I would urge my colleagues on the other side that maybe they ought to \nread the rule before they come up with a bill like the one they came up \nwith.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't know what else to say, other than the fact that \nthis process stinks. Again, two closed rules and a structured rule on \nthe third bill.\n  We have a controversial bill on Iran that is one of the most partisan \npieces of legislation on foreign policy that has been brought to this \nfloor by my Republican friends. It is really frustrating because I \nthink there is a lot of common ground on holding Iran accountable where \nDemocrats and Republicans could come together and actually craft \nsomething that had, if not unanimous support, almost unanimous support. \nI think that would be a powerful signal to send not only to Iran, but \nto the rest of the world. But instead of going down that road, my \nRepublican friends decided to squander that opportunity and come up \nwith a political sound bite.\n  The same goes for the two environmental bills that are being brought \nbefore this House. They are going nowhere, but they are nice sound \nbites, and they may please a particular special interest, but this is \nnot serious legislating.\n  I am going to say to my colleagues again, I know you are going on \nyour retreat this week, and maybe there ought to be a side meeting that \nsome of my friends have about what it is that they think we ought to be \ndoing here in this Chamber and what it is that they think that their \njob ought to be. I would suggest that it has to be about more than just \npolitical sound bites and messaging bills.\n  There is a lot that we need to get done. That requires us working \ntogether. I won't get everything I want and you may not get everything \nyou want, but we need to figure out a way to make this place work \nbecause it is not working. There is a reason why the approval rating of \nCongress is like in the negative numbers. It is because people see \nconsistently nothing but political sound bites and messaging bills come \nto the floor and get voted on and we debate them passionately, but they \ngo nowhere. I think people would like us all better, Democrats and \nRepublicans, if we actually accomplished something.\n  I hope you go on your retreat and you kind of reflect on that, and \nmaybe you will come back the week after with a new outlook. Maybe all \nof these promises from the Speaker of the House and the previous \nSpeaker of the House about a more open process about regular order will \nbe more than words when you come back.\n  I would finally say again that I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on \nthe previous question so we can bring up this commonsense bipartisan \nbill to basically prevent those who are on the terrorist watch list \nfrom being sold guns.\n  Again, I, for the life of me, don't understand why it is so \ncontroversial, but in this House of Representatives it is.\n  Vote ``no'' on the previous question. Vote ``no'' on this closed \nrule, and reject this closed process.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate the good gentleman's wishes for a good retreat for the \nRepublicans this coming next few days, and I look forward to finding \nopportunities to work together with his side of the aisle on many \nimportant things facing our Nation.\n  I just would remind them, too, that there have been plenty of \nopportunities for all Members of this body to have input on these \npieces of legislation before us through committee, here on the floor, \nin Rules. I think following regular order is proving exactly what we \nwanted it to do to give people that opportunity. I am very happy that \nwe have been able to do that.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule that we are \nconsidering today allowing for consideration of three very important \npieces of legislation that I think will protect our national security \ninterests abroad and hold the administration accountable for sanctions \nlifted under the Iran nuclear agreement. It will ensure that mining \ncommunities and hardworking families are not crushed by another \ncrippling Federal regulation, and it will help protect our rural \nwestern communities by providing much-needed relief from the burdensome \nwaters of the United States rule.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Although we may have different viewpoints and differences of opinion, \nI believe this rule and the underlying bills are strong measures that \nare important to our country's future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 583 as well as the \nunderlying bills.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:\n\n          An Amendment to H. Res. 583 Offered by Mr. McGovern\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     1076) to increase public safety by permitting the Attorney \n     General to deny the transfer of a firearm or the issuance of \n     firearms or explosives licenses to a known or suspected \n     dangerous terrorist. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill \n     shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. \n     All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 1076.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule\n\n[[Page H307]]\n\n     [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens \n     the resolution to amendment and further debate.'' (Chapter \n     21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ``Upon rejection of \n     the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported \n     from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member \n     leading the opposition to the previous question, who may \n     offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time \n     for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair \nwill reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on \nthe question of adoption.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 1644.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 583 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1644.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1431\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 1644) to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of \n1977 to ensure transparency in the development of environmental \nregulations, and for other purposes, with Mr. Paulsen in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) and the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Lowenthal) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1644, the Supporting \nTransparent Regulatory and Environmental Actions in Mining Act, or the \nSTREAM Act for short.\n  The STREAM Act has three goals. First, it establishes a requirement \nfor scientific transparency and integrity in any rulemaking conducted \nby the Office of Surface Mining--we will be calling that OSM during our \ndebate--under the authority of the Surface Mining Control and \nReclamation Act of 1977. Some people call it SMCRA.\n  In the past, the Office of Surface Mining, or OSM, has sought to \npromulgate rules based on internal studies that are not made public. \nThe first section of H.R. 1644, the STREAM Act, ensures transparency by \nrequiring OSM to publish all scientific products it relies on in the \nrulemaking process.\n  For federally funded scientific products, the STREAM Act requires OSM \nto also publish raw data. If a scientific product is withheld from the \npublic for more than 6 months, then the rule, environmental analysis, \nor economic assessment it supports will be withdrawn.\n  The second goal is to require an independent third-party assessment \nof the existing 1983 rule--which we are operating under right now--to \ndetermine if any deficiencies exist. The purpose of the independent \nstudy is to mitigate the polarization of this issue.\n  As such, the STREAM Act requires the Secretary of the Interior, in \nconsultation with the Interstate Mining Compact Commission, to contract \nwith the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of the 1983 \nstream buffer zone rule.\n  Mr. Chairman, this study will examine the effectiveness of the \nexisting 1983 rule by the National Academy of Sciences and make \nrecommendations for improving the rule, if necessary.\n  The Secretary is prohibited from issuing any regulations addressing \nstream buffer zones or stream protection until 1 year after the \ncompletion of the study and is required to take into consideration the \nfindings or recommendations of the study.\n  This element of the STREAM Act is important because it ensures that \nthe 24 States with primacy over surface mining will have input on the \nstudy. Unfortunately, beginning in 2011, OSM completely shut the States \nout of the rulemaking process, even though OSM had signed memoranda of \nunderstanding with 10 cooperating agency States in 2010 and one other \nState signing on as a commentator.\n  According to OSM, ``States permit and regulate 97 percent of the \nNation's coal production. States and tribes also abate well over 90 \npercent of the abandoned mine lands problems.'' That is in the words of \nOSM.\n  The expertise for understanding the stream protection rule and other \nregulations promulgated under the Surface Mining Control and \nReclamation Act lies with the States, not with OSM. Yet, the States \nwere completely cut out of the rulemaking process.\n  The third goal, finally, of H.R. 1644 is to inhibit OSM's regulatory \noverreach by curtailing regulatory action that would duplicate, \nenforce, or determine compliance with laws that are outside of OSM's \njurisdiction.\n  An express concern related to the ongoing stream buffer zone rule \nrewrite is\n\n[[Page H309]]\n\nthat OSM has sought to interpret and enforce the Clean Water Act, which \nis outside of its authority, by establishing a new set of water quality \nmonitoring, evaluation standards, and procedures. In fact, the draft \nrule amends 475 existing rules promulgated under SMCRA, the Surface \nMining Control and Reclamation Act.\n  OSM used the rulemaking process to rewrite the Surface Mining Control \nand Reclamation Act of 1977 and went well outside of Congress' intent \nin writing that law.\n  Also--and this is amazingly shortsighted for our economic and energy \nfuture as a country--the draft rule released in July 2015 would freeze \nor sterilize more than 60 percent of the Nation's coal reserves.\n  If the draft rule, as written, is finalized, the administration will \nexpose the U.S. taxpayer to takings litigation. This has happened \nbefore. An example would be the Whitney Benefits case in Wyoming that \ninvolved a regulatory taking of coal reserves that underlie alluvial \nmaterial.\n  Passage of the STREAM Act will halt this destructive rulemaking \nprocess and provide an avenue for a collaborative approach to address \ndeficiencies in the existing rule, if any, with the primacy States. It \nwill save and protect the American taxpayer.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the STREAM Act, or H.R. \n1644, which is simply the latest attempt by the majority to prevent the \nimplementation of new, commonsense rules to protect people and the \nenvironment from the destructive impacts of mountaintop removal coal \nmining.\n  Mountaintop removal mining is a serious environmental and health \nthreat. It occurs throughout Appalachia. Countries literally blast the \ntops off of mountains, scoop out the coal, and dump what used to be the \nmountaintop into the valleys below.\n  In the process, landscapes are scarred, wildlife habitat is \ndestroyed, mountain streams are buried, fish are killed, and the people \nliving in the valleys suffer.\n  The impact on the landscapes, as you can see from this picture here, \nis obvious. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to look at this photo of \na mountaintop removal mine and understand the catastrophic impact to \nthe environment. The impacts, however, to people are not as obvious to \nthe naked eye, but they are just as severe.\n\n  Several years ago there was an article titled ``Mountaintop Mining \nConsequences,'' in the journal Science. As we all know, Science is one \nof the most preeminent scientific journals in the world.\n  In that paper, a dozen scientists from 10 institutions reported that \nmountaintop mining with valley filling ``revealed serious environmental \nimpacts that mitigation practices cannot successfully address.''\n  They went on to write that ``water emerges from the base of valley \nfills containing a variety of solutes toxic or damaging to biota,'' and \nthat ``recovery of biodiversity in mining waste-impacted streams has \nnot been documented.'' Again, that is a direct quote.\n  But let's also talk about the impacts upon people. They write, \n``Adult hospitalizations for chronic pulmonary disorders and \nhypertension are elevated as a function of county-level coal \nproduction, as are rates of mortality; lung cancer; and chronic heart, \nlung, and kidney disease.''\n  These are serious issues. They deserve a serious response. The \ncurrent administration proposed such a response in July of last year \nwith a new rule to govern mountaintop removal mining. Sadly, the \nmajority is falling back on the same political playbook they have used \ntime and time again: attack, obstruct, and delay.\n  What do I mean by that? As it was pointed out, the development of the \nstream buffer zone, which is what we are talking about, took place \nunder the Reagan administration in 1983, in which the President and the \nadministration proposed a buffer around streams to protect the valleys \naround it.\n  It was just the beginning. It gave the Office of Surface Mining \noversight over the management, knowing that there are really some \nproblems in there still to be worked out later in terms of how you \nregulate when this is done primarily by the States. This new buffer \nrequirement that you have got to give these streams 100 feet on each \nside went on after 1983.\n  On December 18, 2008, at the very last moment--at midnight--in \nPresident Bush's term, he introduced a new stream buffer rule in which \nhe basically eviscerated the old and gave many more exemptions and, as \nI quoted, put in a new rule in 2008 that said that not only did it \nloosen protection, it allowed for the dumping of this residue from \nmining into the streams if avoiding disturbance of the stream is not \npotentially or reasonably possible. So what it said is that you can \ndump. If you can't figure out what else to do, you can dump.\n  Immediately that was challenged in the courts. By 2014, the Federal \ncourts overturned Bush's stream buffer rule. That is where we were by \n2014. It was overturned by the courts even though it was never fully \nimplemented to change the Reagan rule.\n  Then what happened right after that, in February 2014, the majority \nparty then said, ``Let's put up the loosening of the buffer rule by \nhaving now put the Bush rule into legislation.''\n  Well, that was voted down. That came out of this House, but never was \nvoted upon and never got to the President's desk.\n  Then what happened in the omnibus bill is they decided to change from \ndirect opposition by weakening the rule to delaying the rule. They \nsaid, ``Well, let's put in a 1-year delay.'' This December that was one \nof the riders in the appropriations omnibus, but that was taken out at \nthe last minute.\n  Then we held a hearing in Natural Resources on this new bill that is \nbefore us, H.R. 1644, which occurred, as we all know, in May of 2015. \nWe held a hearing on this stream buffer rule to delay the new rule that \nwas going to be coming out in 3 years. But we had the delay in it. We \nheld that hearing 2 months before the rule was even proposed.\n  So we are delaying a rule that was first proposed months before we \neven actually saw what we were delaying in that rule. Then what happens \nis that we are now here to vote on a bill that delays the action for 3 \nyears.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  It is really all about delay. It is not about the policy, because the \npolicy, we would give at least a chance to work with this new stream \nprotection rule if we were really dealing with the policy and seeing \nwhat needs to be improved upon where we are. We are going back to \ndelaying it, the new implementation.\n  Why did it take from 2008 until now to really come up with a new \nstream protection rule?\n  Well, in large part that was due to the majority party's multiyear \ninvestigation into the rule. We had various subpoenas and tens of \nthousands of pages of documents, but in the end we found no political \nmisconduct. All we did was to delay the implementation of a new rule \nfrom even coming out and costing the taxpayers money.\n  There were political shenanigans going on in the rule, even though \nthey found no real political shenanigans going on. However, we had 12 \nhearings to deal with political shenanigans. The administration's \nproposed rule comes out in July. It is now January, over 7 months.\n  How many hearings have we heard on the proposed rule? How many? I \nthink the answer is zero. So we have never discussed the proposed rule. \nWe are now voting to delay it, without ever discussing what it is, and \nit is just completely irresponsible to be now voting on something that \nstops a rule in its tracks that we have never had time to discuss.\n  Now, we know that this bill isn't going to go anywhere. Even if the \nSenate was to pass it, the President has already issued a veto threat.\n  So instead of this bad rerun, where the majority now is trying to \nevade and block this rule for the fourth time, maybe we should take a \nlook at some of these environmental consequences and health impacts of \nmountaintop removal mining; look at the proposed rule and try to work \nwith the administration to really come up with something that protects \ncommunities, instead of just attacking and, if that doesn't work, \ndelaying.\n\n[[Page H310]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nWest Virginia (Mr. Mooney) who has done an excellent job on the \ncommittee representing the folks of West Virginia.\n  Mr. MOONEY from West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Lamborn \nand Chairman Bishop for their leadership in getting this bill to the \nfloor, and my friend, Bill Johnson, for his continued support on this \nissue.\n  It is imperative that we pass our bill, H.R. 1644, the Supporting \nTransparent Regulatory and Environmental Actions in Mining Act, also \nknown as the STREAM Act.\n  My bill delays the implementation of the Obama administration's \nstream protection rule. When the rewrite of the rule was first \nproposed, the Office of Surface Mining described it as a ``minor'' \nregulation that would only impact one coal region. They could not be \nmore wrong.\n  This rule contains sweeping changes that modify 475 existing rules \nand is over 2,500 pages in length. Taken together, these changes will \ndestroy up to 77,000 coal mining jobs nationwide, including up to \n52,000 in the Appalachian region.\n  This would be devastating to States, like my home State of West \nVirginia, that have already been hit hard by President Obama's \ncontinuous war on coal. Between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs in western mining \nStates will be lost, between 5,000 and 14,000 jobs will be lost in the \ninterior States, and between 30,000 and 50,000 jobs in the Appalachian \nregion will be lost due to this new stream protection rule.\n  These new regulations would be catastrophic to the hardworking \nAmerican families that depend on coal to keep their energy costs low. \nIn my State, 90 percent of power is generated by coal-fired plants.\n  One recent study showed that if the Obama administration successfully \nimplements its radical environmental policies, the average American \nfamily will experience a $1,707-a-year increase in their home energy \ncosts by the year 2025.\n  The average American family earned $53,657 last year. The average \nfamily in West Virginia earned $41,059, which is $12,598 under the \nnational average. This home energy cost increase will be detrimental \nfor all Americans, but especially for West Virginians.\n  When I campaigned to represent the people of the Second Congressional \nDistrict of West Virginia, I promised that I would do all I could to \nfight for the coal industry and the hardworking men and women of our \nState. You have to understand that these jobs in West Virginia are \ngood-paying jobs. These are jobs that families rely on to put food on \nthe table and provide for the health and safety of their families.\n  This STREAM Act is completely unnecessary. Going after these jobs is \ncallous and wrong.\n  West Virginia and our country need the STREAM Act to pass the House \nand the Senate and be signed into law. I urge my colleagues in the \nHouse to vote for this important bill today.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, not long ago, the Speaker of the House, \nPaul Ryan, said that he wanted to make the House an ``ideas factory.'' \nBut with this bill today, it is clear that the only items being \nproduced by the House are cookie-cutters, because we have done this \nbefore, again and again and again.\n  House Republicans have made it their mission to kill the stream \nprotection rule and protect the ability of coal companies to dump their \nmining waste wherever they want. They didn't see the rule until last \nJuly, but that hasn't kept them from a 5-year crusade to prioritize \nmining company profits over the health and welfare of nearby \ncommunities, wildlife, and the environment.\n  First, they carried out a multiyear investigation into this rule, \nholding no less than 12 hearings and demanding tens of thousands of \npages of documents, and ultimately coming up with nothing. Then they \npassed a bill last Congress to block the rule. Actually, they liked it \nso much, they passed the bill twice. Those bills, however, went \nnowhere.\n  This Congress, they included a rider on the appropriations bill to \nblock this rule and voted down my amendment to strip the rider out. The \nrider was eventually removed before the bill became law.\n  This bill will suffer the same fate. It will not become law. \nPresident Obama has said he would rightly veto this bill, and there are \nnot nearly enough votes to override that veto.\n  So why are we wasting this Chamber's time on this meaningless cookie-\ncutter legislation when we could be facing the real energy crises \nconfronting the Nation, such as admitting that climate change is real \nand helping coal mining regions make a smooth transition off dirty \nfuel?\n  But if we want to talk about the stream protection rule and the \ndevastating impacts of mountaintop removal coal mining, we would have a \nhearing on it in the Natural Resources Committee, and I would welcome \nsuch a hearing.\n  But, as my colleague and friend from California has pointed out, \ndespite the 12 hearings the majority held on this rule before they ever \nread it, they have not held one since it was published. It is almost as \nif their minds were made up about the rule before it even came out. \nThat doesn't sound much like an idea factory to me, Mr. Chairman.\n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), a member of the Natural Resources \nCommittee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for \nthe time to speak regarding this important legislation, which I believe \nwould help relieve the overregulation that we have seen in recent years \nin the coal industry.\n  The coal mining industry has supported countless jobs in \nPennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District for generations and \ncontinues to do so. In addition to jobs, coal also helps provide \nmillions of Americans with affordable and reliable energy.\n  However, overregulation, such as the stream buffer rule, has taken a \nbig toll on our region. Layoffs have affected miners and companies \nacross Pennsylvania, as these job creators continue to face \nunprecedented regulatory challenges.\n  Reports have indicated that the rewrite of the stream buffer zone \nrule from the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement \nwould lead to the elimination of 7,000 mining jobs and cause economic \nharm in 22 States.\n  With the rewritten regulations proposed, this bill introduces a bit \nof common sense, Mr. Chairman. It seeks to make sure that the \nregulation is based on proven science, requires a study on the strength \nof existing stream buffer rules, and, finally, seeks to end duplicative \nrulemaking. This is the least we can do to help limit the strain and \nprovide some certainty for coal companies and, quite frankly, families \nwho make their living in that industry where so many jobs are in the \ncommunities that we serve.\n  As a cosponsor of this legislation, I strongly support it, and I urge \nmy colleagues to vote ``yes'' on final passage.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Yarmuth).\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  In recent weeks, we have learned about the water contamination \nproblems in Flint, Michigan. By now, many of us have seen angry mothers \nand fathers on local television there, holding up water that looks like \nthis, demanding a response from government officials.\n  I think we all support the steps that the State and Federal \nGovernment are now taking to ensure that the water in Flint is safe for \nfamilies to drink. But what if the legislation we are debating right \nnow prevented government officials from taking that action? There would \nobviously be an outcry from Members on both sides of the aisle, and the \nbill would likely be defeated, as it should be.\n  I am here on the floor today to say that this bill does, in fact, \nblock government officials from protecting the water supply, not for \nthe people of Flint, but for families in Appalachia and other coal \nmining communities.\n  This water isn't from Flint, Michigan. It is from a well near a \nmountaintop removal site in eastern Kentucky. This orange water is what \ncomes out of\n\n[[Page H311]]\n\ntaps in much of Appalachia, where water is contaminated by toxic mine \nwaste from the reckless practice of mountaintop removal mining.\n  I have talked to teachers in eastern Kentucky who tell me that when \nthe children in their classes draw their environment, they draw the \nwater orange because that is what they see. How tragic is that?\n  I have had the opportunity to fly over mountaintop removal sites and \nthe areas around them, and the water looks a lot different than it \nshould, a lot of colors that come out of Crayola boxes.\n  Explosives used in the MTR process pollute the air, and the exposed \nrock and particulate matter allow heavy metals and toxins to leach into \nand poison the water. The situation is made even worse by coal \ncompanies who are allowed to dump mining waste directly into waterways.\n  These actions, and the consequences of mountaintop removal, have \ncreated a public health crisis, with families living near or downstream \nof these mining sites experiencing higher rates of cancer, heart \ndisease, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, birth defects, and \ninfant mortality.\n  More than 2,000 miles of Appalachian streams have been poisoned since \nmountaintop removal began about 40 years ago. The Obama administration \nis trying to respond to that crisis with the commonsense, \nscientifically sound stream buffer rule. This proposed rule would take \nsome important, although modest, steps to limit mountaintop removal \npractices and protect the water supply in mining communities.\n  This bill would stop those efforts. It allows coal companies to \ncontinue to destroy mountains, pollute water supplies, and endanger the \nhealth of families living in the surrounding communities.\n  Whether in Flint, Michigan, or eastern Kentucky, all families deserve \nwater that is clean and safe and a government that cares and responds \nwhen their health is in jeopardy.\n  I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous measure.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am going to recognize a Member in just a second. But \nin response to Mr. Yarmuth, I would just like to point out that the \nOffice of Surface Mining has left States out of the discussions. States \nlike Kentucky are not allowed to collaborate in this process, and that \nis unfortunate, because I think Kentucky and other States have \nsomething to contribute to this dialogue and this issue. So that is \nwhat the STREAM Act that we are going to vote on in a little bit would \naccomplish.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  It brings the States back into the equation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nJohnson). He has been a stalwart defender of the coal industry and the \nfuture that coal has in the energy and economy of our country.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. I thank the chairman for those kind words.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is an extremely important topic, and I couldn't \nagree more with what the gentleman has just said.\n  This is largely an overreach by a Federal agency stepping all over \nthe rights of the States to regulate their own use of their natural \nresources.\n  So, for that reason, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1644, the \nSTREAM Act, legislation that requires OSM to extend its new stream \nbuffer rule while the National Academy of Sciences studies how current \nOSM rules affect the industry.\n  Mr. Chairman, OSM's rule will cost jobs, increase electricity prices, \nand jeopardize grid reliability, along with usurping states' rights. \nStop and think about it for a second. Shouldn't Federal agencies \nunderstand what that all means before enacting a rule like this?\n  The Supreme Court certainly does. The Supreme Court has already told \nthe EPA, for example, in one instance: You have got to consider the \neconomic impacts of the rulemaking that you are doing.\n  According to recent studies, OSM's proposed rule will have several \nvery negative impacts. Let's talk about how it is going to cost jobs. \nAs many as 80,000 people could lose their jobs. Now, OSM said it is \nonly 7,000, but a recent study says that it could be upwards of 80,000 \npeople.\n  OSM denies this job loss because they say these jobs will be replaced \nby jobs created to comply with the rule. Something tells me that those \nsupposed new jobs are not going to be in places where mining is going \non, in places like eastern and southeastern Ohio.\n  You are talking about entire communities rolling up the sidewalks. It \nis going to raise electricity prices and affect the energy grid \nreliability.\n  Roughly 64 percent of Ohio's energy comes from coal. Ohio's \nelectricity prices are currently below the national average. In total, \n22 States rely on coal as their primary fuel source.\n  This is going to usurp states' rights. State regulators who perform \n97 percent of regulatory activities are completely left out of this \nrulemaking process. In fact, all but two cooperating agency States have \nterminated their agreement because of OSM's actions.\n  Look, this administration and this rule reflect a callous disregard \nfor American coal, American coal miners, their families, the businesses \nthat rely on the energy, and the industry as a whole.\n  Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to put politics aside. \nThis is about an industry. It is about people's lives. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the STREAM Act.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the Member from \nVirginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the STREAM Act. We \nshould not willfully delay the stream protection rule. I have seen \nfirsthand the impacts of coal mining, both positive and negative. I \nspent 9 years visiting the coal counties in Virginia: Buchanan, \nDickenson, Lee, Wise, Russell, and others.\n  When times are good, there are good incomes and nice cars. When times \nare hard, times like today, when we are not mining much coal mostly \nbecause of the abundance of natural gas, then things are pretty sad.\n  When I was Lieutenant Governor of Virginia during the 1990s, \nmountaintop removal became the most prevalent coal mining technique in \ncentral Appalachia. Surely, coal can have a positive impact on local \neconomies. But we also have to look at the impact it has on the \nenvironment and the health of these same communities.\n  My good friend, Mr. Johnson of Ohio, has said that these are about \nthe lives of people. Absolutely right. And we have shown callous \ndisregard for the health of the people who live in these communities.\n  The citizens of these same Virginia coal counties have by far the \nworst health outcomes of anybody in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The \ncost-benefit analysis, yes, but we are not doing anything to stop coal \ncompanies from mining coal or even mountaintop removal. We are just \ndemanding that it be done responsibly.\n  It takes tons of rocks and soil to expose underlying coal seams, but \nthese are placed in valleys, headwater streams filled with all this \ndisplaced material. This can have significant impacts on water quality.\n  West Virginia University--not one of those liberal universities in \nNew England--a West Virginia study in 2012 found that mountaintop coal \nmining has adverse impacts on surface and groundwater quality. The \nCongressional Research Service, nonpartisan, said, since 1992, almost \n1,200 miles of streams were buried by surface coal mining practices.\n  The cumulative effects of such surface coal mining operations \ninclude, number one, deforestation, which has been linked to harming \nthe aquatic community; two, accelerated sediment and nutrient \ntransport; and, three, increased algae production.\n  Surface mining has also been responsible for most of the huge \nflooding in central Appalachia because, when you disturb natural \nstreambeds, cover them with mine spoils, destroy the vegetation, all \nthe topography is different.\n  Virginia Tech has been working with the coal industry for over 30 \nyears to mitigate these effects, to reclaim the streams and lands that \nhave been disturbed, and a lot of progress has been made. But we can \nand should do all that we can to protect our critical headwater and \nsmall streams before the impacts occur.\n  Water monitoring found that Kelly Branch Mine in Wise County, \nVirginia,\n\n[[Page H312]]\n\ndumped toxic pollutant selenium into streams at levels far above the \nState water quality standards and without a permit to allow such \npollution.\n  As a result of a citizen suit, Southern Coal Corp. has since agreed \nto do the environmental cleanup, but we shouldn't need the lawsuits \nwhich too often lead to the bankruptcies of the coal companies.\n  Lawsuits like this make it unsurprising that a group of researchers \nfrom West Virginia University--again--and Washington State University \npublished a study in 2011 on the association between exposure to \nmountaintop removal mining and the increased rate of birth defects in \ncentral Appalachia.\n  This again gets back to callous disregard for the people who live in \ncentral Appalachia. These people have been paying for the externalized \ncosts of mountaintop removal for far too long, and local communities \nhave been suffering life-threatening health problems and a damaged \necosystem.\n  This is why, with Congressman Lowenthal and Congresswoman Esty, we \noffered an amendment to ensure that this bill paid attention to the \nnegative health impacts. Unfortunately, the amendment was not made in \norder. But we can't continue to ignore this.\n  Adjusted for every other factor, overwhelming scientific evidence \nlinks the practice of surface coal mining with elevated rates of \nserious health problems, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and \npulmonary disease, and overall mortality rates are about 20 percent \nhigher in the coalfields than the national average.\n\n  The ecological integrity of the streams is an indicator of the human \ncancer mortality rates. So the folks that live near these streams are \nmuch more likely to die and die young.\n  This bill destroys the proposed protection for the people who live in \nsouthwest Virginia and coalfields across the country.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote against the STREAM Act. \nThe people of Appalachia deserve better.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, in response to a statement that was just \nmade, let me point out that Johns Hopkins researchers--maybe one of the \nleading medical institutions in our country--found that ``no increased \nrisk of birth defects was observed from births from mountaintop mining \ncounties after adjustment for or stratification by hospital of birth.''\n  So there are other issues going on that do affect the health in these \nareas. But you can't blame it on mountaintop mining, at least not \naccording to Johns Hopkins.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. \nLummis), who is a valuable member of the Committee on Natural \nResources.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Chairman, if you have been listening to this debate thus far, you \nwould believe that we are only talking about mountaintop mining.\n  Well, I want to assure you the bill that I support that is on the \nfloor today is also trying to protect non-mountaintop mining because \nthe rules that have been proposed by the Obama administration apply to \nall coal miners.\n  They apply to non-mountaintop mining as well, including mining in my \nState of Wyoming and the mining that can occur in the State of Montana, \nto my north, that has enormous undeveloped coal reserves.\n  My State of Wyoming has been the number one coal-producing State in \nthis Nation since 1986, for 30 years. The reclamation of those mines is \nstate of the art.\n  If you go to the top of the tipples at those mines and look around, \nyou cannot tell, if you are an untrained eye, whether the land has been \nmined and reclaimed or undisturbed and un-mined.\n  It is because the quality of reclamation that is required by the \nState of Wyoming is so state of the art that the water is clean, the \nland is reclaimed, the wildlife returns. In fact, the wildlife prefers \nto graze on the land that has been reclaimed, as opposed to the land \nthat has not been mined.\n  States have proven that they can regulate and return properties to a \ncondition that Americans can be proud of and know that we will be safe. \nYet, the States have been shut out of this regulatory process.\n  Legislation which we are discussing today, the STREAM Act, would \nallow and restore States their rightful place in this discussion.\n  Where the expertise lies is in the States. They are the ones that \nshould be included in the crafting of any Federal legislation and, in \nmy view, should be left to the States where the expertise lies and \nwhere the differences between mining on non-mountain property and a \nmountain property can be properly addressed.\n  Applying this stream buffer rule, which the administration proposes, \nto non-mountaintop mines is absurd. I would further assert that the \nexpertise to deal with mountaintop mining lies in the States where that \nmining is currently occurring.\n  I thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. I have seen some of the operations in the great State of \nWyoming. Isn't it true that the reclaimed and restored land does not \nhave the invasive species that we have unfortunately seen in this \ncountry in recent decades?\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Curbelo of Florida). The time of the \ngentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.\n  So without the invasive species in the restored land, you could \nalmost say, couldn't you, that the land is better than it was before?\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Reclaiming my time, the answer is yes, for several \nreasons. It is because the mix of grasses that are used to reseed the \nland that has been mined and reclaimed is a mix of grasses that \nprovides for the health that allows for grasses that don't naturally \nclump, grasses that spread out, to be on the reclaimed land.\n  So when it rains, you don't have the kind of running off of the \ntopsoil that would occur if the grasses are the type of grasses that \ntend to clump, instead of cover the ground uniformly.\n  So that is one of the reasons why the reclaimed land actually is a \nbetter trap for water. As we know, when water seeps into the ground, \nthe ground naturally filters the water. So it allows for less runoff of \ntopsoil and allows for the rain to seep into the ground.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has again expired.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. I yield the gentlewoman from Wyoming an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. The soil itself is a natural filter for this water. \nThese are the kind of things that States' experts know, and their \nexpertise should be inserted into any rulemaking process.\n  That is part of the reason that I support the STREAM Act. I support \nmy colleagues from the East and appreciate their attention to this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I would like to talk in response to some of \nthe points raised by my esteemed colleagues from the other side about \nthe doom and gloom of job loss numbers that they presented. I believe \n70,000 jobs will be lost with the proposed rule or we just heard also \npossibly 80,000 direct mining jobs might be lost.\n  These are, indeed, frightening numbers. Unfortunately, they are not \ncredible and not based upon any kind of evidence. Those estimates which \nwe are hearing come from a study that was paid for by the National \nMining Association, and those numbers are the same, that 70- or 80,000, \nas the total number of coal mining jobs currently in the United States, \naccording to the Energy Information Administration.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  In fact, the National Mining Association study that we have heard \nabout projects up to 52,000 coal mining job losses in Appalachia as a \nresult of the administration's proposed rule. There are less than \n50,000 coal miners in that entire region today, so apparently this rule \ncreates jobs before it costs jobs.\n  We shouldn't be surprised that the industry would come up with such \ninflated numbers. After all, they don't need to be accurate. They just \nneed to scare people, much in the same way as the American public was \ntold that the Affordable Care Act is going to destroy an untold number \nof jobs, except that\n\n[[Page H313]]\n\nwe have now added 14 million private sector jobs since that act was \nsigned into law.\n  Today we should be extremely skeptical of industry scare tactics. \nActually, the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the stream protection rule \nfound, in fact, not 70,000, not 80,000, but there would be a net loss \nof only 10 jobs. This is a small price to pay for cleaner water and \nhealthier communities.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In response to my good friend and colleague Representative Lowenthal, \nI would like to say that just in today's Wall Street Journal, Arch Coal \nrevealed that it has declared bankruptcy. They are one of the top coal \nproducers in this country. I would say that the loss of jobs and this \nadministration's war on coal is actually a staggering and frightening \nphenomenon, and that is why we need the STREAM Act.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia \n(Mr. Jenkins).\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. I thank the chairman.\n  I rise today in support of the pending legislation, H.R. 1644, the \nSTREAM Act.\n  Appalachia is suffering. Years of burdensome regulations from this \nadministration have had a devastating impact on coal. West Virginia \nminers, families, and businesses are paying the price.\n  Since 2012, according to The Wall Street Journal, 27 coal mining \ncompanies in Appalachia have filed for bankruptcy. In just the past 4 \nyears, we have seen 7,000 coal miners lose their jobs in West Virginia. \nWhy? Because each and every day, President Obama's EPA and the Office \nof Surface Mining are regulating coal mines out of business and putting \nminers on the unemployment line.\n  Coal miners are the heart and soul of communities in West Virginia, \nand the significant layoffs we are experiencing are simply \nheartbreaking. The President, the EPA, and the OSM continue to ignore \nthe economic pain they are inflicting.\n  The stream buffer zone rule, which the STREAM Act would halt, is yet \nanother example of unnecessary regulation, one that will increase \nenergy costs for American families and businesses.\n  The OSM's new stream buffer zone rule will lead to thousands more job \nlosses in West Virginia and across the Nation. An independent study \nfound it would eliminate at least 40,000 direct coal mining jobs on top \nof the 42,000 indirect jobs and other jobs that have been lost just \nsince 2011. Even OSM's own analysis estimates that this rule would \nresult in the loss of thousands of jobs. That does not include the \nthousands of jobs that depend on coal indirectly: our Nation's small \nbusinesses, equipment manufacturers, transportation, and others.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is unacceptable. It is also the reason why I \nhelped secure a provision in the omnibus that mandates that OSM work \nwith the States. I support the STREAM Act, and I encourage its passage.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 8\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Colorado has 9\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, and I would like to respond to my colleague's comments about \nthe lack of any health impacts of mountaintop mining, quoting a study \nfrom Johns Hopkins University about the lack of any identifiable birth \ndefects that are correlated with coal mining or mountaintop mining.\n  I would like to again read from the Science article of January 8, \n2010, called ``Mountaintop Mining Consequences,'' a collaborative \neffort of scientists from the University of Maryland; from Duke \nUniversity; from the University of Minnesota; from West Virginia \nUniversity; from Wake Forest University; from Miami University, Oxford, \nOhio; from the University of California at Berkeley; from the \nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; and from the same Johns \nHopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland. They found their results on \nthe potential for human health impacts were this: adult \nhospitalizations for chronic pulmonary disorders and hypertension are \nelevated as a function of county level coal production, as are rates of \nmortality, lung cancer, and chronic heart, lung, and kidney diseases. \nThat is what the scientists have found that are the result of a \npotential for human health impacts.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support H.R. \n1644. I think it is really important that sometimes we actually talk to \npeople who work in coal country, people who live in coal country, \npeople who have generationally been part of coal mining.\n  Too often I come to this floor in America's House and I hear all \nthese different things that are going on. If you want to talk about \nhealth, let's talk about the health of our community. Let's talk about \nthe tens of thousands of jobs that will be lost because of more \nregulations.\n  We know that commodity prices will fluctuate. The one thing we know \nfor sure is that regulation will not. It will forever put a price tag \non this product that will make it impossible for it to compete on the \nopen market. Yet we will sit here and we will talk about things that \nreally aren't true, and we will say it in a manner that we say this is \nso bad, this product is so horrible, do you realize what it is doing? \nAnd my answer is, yes, I do. It employees tens of thousands of \nAmericans.\n  These are not, by the way, Republican jobs. These are Democrat jobs \nfor the most part. These are American jobs. These are red, white, and \nblue jobs. This is about a product that has been the workforce of \nAmerican energy. This makes it possible for America to compete anywhere \nin the world because of low energy costs.\n  I would just ask my friends, while it may become a political issue \nand it may seem like it is a great talking point, you need to walk in \nthose communities. You need to go into those schools. You need to go \ninto those towns. You need to go into those homes. You need to go into \nthose mines. You need to look into the faces and the eyes of the people \nwho bring this tremendous product out of the ground and tell them what \nthey have been doing generationally is horrible for the country. You \nneed to tell them that the way they have been making a living, the way \nthey have been putting a roof over the heads of their children, the way \nthey have been putting food on the table for their kids, the way they \nhave been putting clothes on their backs, and the way they have been \npreparing for their future is bad; you have acted terribly in doing \nthis, and we need ought to spank you.\n\n  Really minor adjustments--475 modifications. That is not minor; that \nis major. That makes the cost of this product go off the charts. It \ndoesn't matter that it changes anything. This is one promise the \nPresident kept.\n  When he was a candidate running for this office, he said: If you want \nto continue to make power, make electricity, by using coal-fired power \nplants, you can do that, but I will bankrupt you.\n  He has kept that promise. Promise made, promise kept. He has turned \nhis back on over a quarter of a million people who depend on coal for \ntheir livelihood. He has turned his back on an America that is looking \nto take advantage of gifts that were given to us by God--natural \nresources.\n  We have not turned our back on health; we have not turned our back on \nthe future of our children; but what we also will not do is we will not \nturn our back on onerous regulations that do nothing to make it better \nfor our people.\n  All we are asking for is to take a really good look at this. The \nstream protection rule, that doesn't make sense. The Clean Power Plan \ndidn't make sense. It makes sense to some because it will put them out \nof business to say: All right. Fine. We need to do this to really hurt \nthese folks.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. It really comes down to this. We are at a \ncrossroads in this country. We have to present really bold visions of \nwhere we\n\n[[Page H314]]\n\nthink the country should be going. We need to talk about policies that \nare going to make America stronger. We need to talk about policies that \nput Americans back to work. We need to talk about policies that the \nAmerican people can look at and say: Do you know what? There is a clear \ndifference. There is a new day coming for America. There is a new way \nto run the government. There is a new way to look at regulations and \nunderstand that these aren't helping; they are hurting.\n  I would just ask all of my colleagues very strongly to support H.R. \n1644. Do the right thing for America. Forget about whether to wear a \nred shirt or a blue shirt. Think about the red, white, and blue that we \nstand for every day.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I would just like to respond to some of the attacks from the other \nside that are supporting the STREAM Act that the administration's \nstream protection rule is really an attempt to destroy jobs, it is \nreally part of, as one of my colleagues has said, the war on coal. But \nnothing could be further from the truth. What we are talking about are \ncommonsense protections for communities.\n  Contrary to the Republican chorus that there is a war on coal, let me \nread to you, Members, that the Energy Information Administration \nestimates that U.S. coal production for 2014 was up 14 million short \ntons from 2013, and that this production growth is going to continue \nthrough 2030. While coal exports are predicted to drop in the short \nterm, they are going to reach historic high grounds around 2030.\n  We are not talking about destroying these communities. We are talking \nabout allowing these communities to thrive, to be healthy, to protect \nthe valleys, to protect the streams, to protect the ecology, to protect \nthe public health, and to allow us to have mountaintop mining, but safe \nand healthy mountaintop mining. That is what we are talking about.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague, Mr. \nLamborn.\n  This is a very important issue. I would like to thank my colleague, \nMr. Mooney, for sponsoring this piece of legislation that not only \nimpacts his home State of West Virginia and the other coal-producing \nStates in the Midwest, but also my home State of Illinois.\n  Coal production in my home State is a significant driver in our \nState's economy, particularly the part of the State that I represent. I \nwould not be here today, Mr. Chairman, without what coal has meant to \nmy hometown of Taylorville in my home county of Christian County.\n  I saw in the mid-nineties what a signature on a piece of paper right \nhere in Washington, D.C., can do to destroy a local economy. In \nIllinois alone, today, coal jobs employ nearly 5,000 workers. Just a \nfew short years ago, that was many more. The industry contributes $2 \nbillion to our State's economy.\n  Unfortunately, this proposed stream protection rule is another \nexample of this Obama administration waging war on coal. By their own \nestimates, OSM claims this rule would kill 7,000 coal jobs. That is \n2,000 more than exist in the State of Illinois today. Through \nindependent analysis, it shows job losses may be even more in the tens \nof thousands.\n  This rule is not only going to hurt coal miners, but also those in my \ndistrict and others that work at coal-fired power plants. It is going \nto hurt consumers. It is going to hurt the poorest of the poor in this \ncountry, who are going to have to pay higher rates when base load \ngeneration facilities that burn coal go offline.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  These coal-fired power plants, Mr. Chairman, provide some of the best \npaying jobs in my district. Where are they going to go to find work \nwhen this administration's war on coal takes their jobs away?\n  I have advocated for important language in working with my colleagues \nMr. Mooney, Mr. Lamborn, Bill Johnson from Ohio, Jim Renacci, and \nothers. We want to make sure that we have the States sign off on this \nOSM stream protection rule before the Federal Government can come in \nand take those coal mining jobs away.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is clear that this administration's war on coal \nisn't going to stop today. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close as soon as the \nopposing side has closed.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  In closing, I would like to read a few lines from a letter that was \nsent from a coalition of 35 national and local groups which are \nstrongly opposed to this bill.\n  They write:\n  ``The proposed stream protection rule is essential to protect the \nwaters in mining regions and to ensure that communities will have \nviable economies after the resource is extracted and mining ceases.''\n  They go on to point out that mountaintop removal mining is \n``responsible for the destruction of over 500 mountains and \napproximately 2,000 miles of stream channels across central Appalachia. \nThis form of coal mining devastates both the thriving natural \necosystems of the Appalachian Mountains as well as entire communities \nof residents who have lived on their homesteads for generations.''\n  They conclude:\n  ``Please oppose the STREAM Act, and allow the proposed stream \nprotection rule to proceed without congressional interference so that \ncommunities living in the shadows of mining sites can have safe water \nresources.''\n  I also have a letter of opposition from the United Auto Workers and \neight other organizations, which state:\n  ``This bill would put costly and unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles \ninto the already overburdened regulatory process with the sole intent \nof ensuring that coal companies can continue to destroy streams and \ncoal wastes. We urge you to vote against this legislation both to \nprotect mining communities and to reject attempts to delay and \nfrustrate improved regulatory protections.''\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge the opposition to H.R. 1644.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In my closing remarks, I would like to highlight the findings of an \neconomic impact analysis of the draft stream buffer zone rule, released \nin 2015, issued against the Obama administration regulation. The study \nwas done by the ENVIRON International Corporation.\n  ENVIRON found that 64 percent of the Nation's coal reserves would be \nsterilized, or frozen, resulting in an annual loss in value that ranges \nbetween $14 billion to $29 billion.\n  The proposed rule hits longwall mining particularly hard, causing a \ndecrease of 47 to 85 percent in recoverable longwall coal reserves. \nLongwall mining is considered the safest, most efficient, and most \nprofitable type of underground mining.\n  Sterilizing so much of the Nation's coal reserves will have a \nsignificant impact on employment, ranging from a loss of 40,000 to \nabout 77,000 direct jobs and 112,000 to 280,000 indirect jobs from \nthose businesses and industries that provide goods and services to the \nmining sector.\n  These jobs are high-paying, family-wage jobs, with excellent \nbenefits, including health care. The economic impact to the coal-\nproducing States and counties will be staggering.\n  The STREAM Act instills sanity into the Office of Surface Mining's \nrulemaking process by requiring transparency in the scientific products \nused by OSM in any rulemaking that they have. It narrowly focuses the \nstream buffer zone rule to actual stream buffer zones and not 474 other \nregulations.\n  It also allows States with the expertise in regulating the Nation's \ncoal mines to participate in the assessment of the effectiveness of the \nexisting rule. Finally, it reins in OSM's overreach into areas outside \nof its statutory jurisdiction.\n  Mr. Chairman, there are two great ironies in this whole war on coal \nby the administration. Actually, it is a war on the American people. It \nis a war on working families because it not only costs high-paying \njobs, but it drives up\n\n[[Page H315]]\n\nthe cost of energy. When you drive up the cost of energy, that takes \nmoney out of people's pockets, and they have less money left over to \ntake care of their families and to provide for their futures.\n  If the war on coal by this administration were successful, not only \nwould you have those negative impacts, but many of the \nenvironmentalists would just create another war.\n  There is already one major group that says, ``Oh, we don't even like \nnatural gas,'' which is being touted as the replacement for coal. They \ndon't even like that.\n  There will be some other reason to which they will find objection \nwith regard to whatever takes coal's place, would that day ever come.\n  When you run the numbers, the environmental impact of getting rid of \ncoal completely for electrical generation would have a negligible \nimpact on any future impact on the global climate.\n  Let's pass the STREAM Act as it protects jobs, it protects rural \ncommunities, and it protects the American taxpayer. I ask that my \ncolleagues support this important piece of legislation and vote for its \nfinal passage.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the STREAM Act, \nwhich is a dangerous and unnecessary bill that would delay the \nfinalization of the Department of Interior's Stream Protection Rule. \nThis critical rule will improve methods for monitoring and preventing \ndamage to surface and groundwater from mountaintop removal coal mining.\n  Surface mining in the steep slopes of Appalachia has disrupted the \nbiological integrity of an area about the size of Delaware, buried \napproximately 2,000 miles of streams with mining waste, and \ncontaminated downstream areas with toxic elements. Because of this \ndangerous practice, people have been drinking the byproducts of coal \nwaste from mountaintop removal for more than two decades. Rather than \nclean and clear water running out of their faucets, the people of \nAppalachia are left with orange or black liquid instead.\n  The health problems caused by exposure to these chemicals and heavy \nmetals include cancers, organ failure, and learning disabilities. Not \nonly that, but there are multiple cases of children suffering from \nasthma, headaches, nausea, and other symptoms likely due to toxic \ncontamination from coal dust. This is environmental injustice.\n  The people of Appalachia should have the right to send their children \nto a school not threatened by billions of gallons of coal slurry; the \nright to preserve the streams and valleys that have been part of their \nway of life; and the right to protect their own land, no matter how \nmuch coal might be underneath.\n  I have consistently introduced legislation, the Clean Water \nProtection Act, which would put a stop to mountaintop removal mining, \nand I plan to reintroduce the bill in the beginning of this year. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose the legislation before us today that will \nonly perpetuate the dangerous practice of mountaintop removal mining.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose \nof amendment under the 5-minute rule the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, recommended by the Committee on Natural Resources, printed \nin the bill.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 \nprinted in House Report 114-395.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I believe that this amendment is really \ntechnical in nature. It does two things.\n  First, we ensure that the legislation does not infringe on copyright \nlaws.\n  According to the largest private publishers of scientific research, \ngovernment-funded studies will be made publicly available ``where the \ngovernment has funded the publication of a private sector, peer-\nreviewed article or where the author of the article is a government \nemployee . . . we do not dispute that any such article couldn't be made \npublicly available.''\n  We are addressing that concern that was raised during the markup of \nthis bill.\n  Second, we identified a technical error in a U.S. Code citation and \ncorrected it.\n  I ask for a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime in opposition to the amendment even though I am not opposed to it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, this amendment makes a small change to \nsection 2 to make the bill somewhat more palatable to scientific \npublishers.\n  So I will not oppose it, but it does nothing to actually improve the \nbill itself nor the requirement surrounding the advance publication of \nscientific data.\n  Today we received a letter from the Union of Concerned Scientists \nthat says they are strongly opposed to H.R. 1644.\n  The scientists write: ``This proposal is just another attempt of what \nis becoming an old and tired song, an attempt to cloak an effort to \nblock commonsense regulations in the guise of transparency.''\n  They continue: ``The amended version improves the original bill by \nexempting certain types of data from public disclosure. However, the \nlanguage is so vague it will make it very difficult for scientists \ndoing federally funded research to know whether or not the data they \nhave spent years collecting may be prematurely disclosed before they \ncan publish their own studies. At the very least, this discourages \nscientists from doing any crucial research that may be required to be \npublicly disclosed.''\n  They conclude: ``If passed, H.R. 1644 would inhibit the Department of \nthe Interior's ability to carry out its science- and evidence-based \nresponsibility to protect human health and the environment. We strongly \nrecommend a `no' vote on H.R. 1644.''\n  I agree with the scientists on this one.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the Member for not opposing this \namendment, and I ask that we vote ``yes'' on it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Kildee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in House Report 114-395.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 5, line 3, before the period, insert ``or improve \n     drinking water quality''.\n       Page 8, line 16, before the period, insert ``, unless such \n     a rule will improve drinking water quality''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Kildee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, first of all, the underlying bill is an \nattempt to delay the implementation of the stream protection rule, an \nimportant rule that protects our Nation's rivers, our streams, and the \nnearby communities from the effects of mountaintop removal coal mining.\n  My amendment would not allow any rule that improves drinking water \nquality to be delayed. Ensuring that we protect our streams and \nrivers--often important sources of drinking water--is of vital \nimportance.\n  Listen, I know firsthand something about what happens when \nregulations are not strong enough to protect drinking water.\n  Today, in my hometown of Flint, safeguards for better drinking water \ncould have prevented the entire city and upwards of 10,000 children \nunder the age of 6 from being exposed to dangerous levels of lead.\n  Lead is a deadly neurotoxin that is especially harmful to young \nchildren. It can permanently lower the IQ, increase disruptive \nbehavior, and stunt neurological development.\n  These children in my hometown, many of whom already have great \nhurdles to overcome because of the misfortune of the ZIP code into \nwhich they were born--communities of very high poverty--now must endure \nanother blow to their futures due to the decisions that were outside of \ntheir control and the lack of effective protection of their drinking \nwater.\n  No other community should ever face that same danger, the danger of \nhaving their children literally poisoned by unsafe, contaminated \ndrinking water. My amendment will ensure important protections for \nother communities.\n  Look, I have seen my community live through this. They continue to \nlive through it. We should be doing everything we can not to weaken \nprotections for drinking water, but to strengthen them to prevent this \nfrom ever happening anywhere else.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page H317]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, my heart goes out to my friend and colleague \nfrom Flint, Michigan. I share in the difficulties that they are \nsuffering now in that city because of the water supply. I know that his \nintention is to do everything he can--and I appreciate his work--to \nhelp the people of his district, especially when it comes to water \nsupply. I appreciate that.\n  I do have to point out that the issue that was raised there is not a \nmining issue. It is from other sources. It is pollution from pulp and \npaper mills, and it is not a mining issue.\n  Getting back to this amendment, I do have to point out that already \nunder the law, permitted mines must already adhere to safe drinking \nwater standards and are very heavily regulated by the EPA. The problem \nwith the OSM, Office of Surface Mining, is that they are taking over--\nit is bureaucratic mission creep--they are taking over some of the EPA \nfunctions. Among other good things that the STREAM Act does is it \nprevents OSM from going down that road, and it leaves clean water \nissues under the jurisdiction of the EPA.\n  So we just need to make sure that the government agencies stick to \nwhat they know best. The STREAM Act does that. Water quality is really \nnot an issue when it comes to nonmine issues.\n  I would ask for opposition to this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, let me first thank the gentleman for his \nkind words and his concern over my hometown. It is an extraordinarily \ndifficult situation.\n  Sadly, it is actually the creation of a series of decisions by our \nState government to switch from the freshest, cleanest water on the \nplanet, the Great Lakes, to the Flint River in order to save a few \ndollars, and then the failure of the Michigan Department of \nEnvironmental Quality to enforce even the minor protections that it has \navailable to it.\n  The reason I am offering this amendment and the reason that I offer \nit on this particular piece of legislation is that, in my hometown, it \nwas led and it was a bad set of decisions made by an emergency \nfinancial manager. In another community, it may be another source.\n  My view--and the reason I offer this amendment--is that we ought to \ndo everything within our power in this Congress to make sure that we \nprotect our environment and particularly protect drinking water. I \nbelieve my amendment would do that. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Cartwright\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in House Report 114-395.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. ABANDONED MINE LAND ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION.\n\n       Title IV of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act \n     of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1231, et seq.) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 416. ABANDONED MINE LAND ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION.\n\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, amounts \n     that would otherwise be provided under title IV to States \n     certified under section 411(a) shall, subject to \n     appropriations, be distributed to the States and Indian \n     tribes for the purpose of promoting the economic \n     revitalization, diversification, and development in \n     economically distressed communities adversely affected by \n     discharge from abandoned mine lands.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chair, my amendment seeks to return abandoned \nmine lands funding to its originally intended focus, which is to \nsupport the communities that are struggling due to their legacy of \nmining.\n  This funding, roughly $600 million over 10 years, will assist \nstruggling coal communities in diversifying their economies, increasing \nhuman capital development, and stimulating economic growth. The funding \nfor this investment in mining communities comes from States that have \nbeen certified by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and \nEnforcement as having already reclaimed their abandoned mines.\n  These States are, therefore, receiving money from a program dedicated \nto helping communities deal with the impact of mining, but the Federal \nGovernment has certified that they have already dealt with those \nimpacts. In fact, one State took $10 million of this funding to \nrenovate a basketball arena.\n  Meanwhile, States in Appalachia are facing the combined calamity of a \ncollapsing coal industry and the environmental legacy of over a century \nof mining.\n  In Scranton, Pennsylvania, for example, that legacy includes 65 \nmillion gallons of acid mine runoff every day. Every day, there are 65 \nmillion gallons of acid mine runoff flowing into the river. Across \nnortheastern Pennsylvania, there are thousands of miles of streams \nimpacted by mine drainage, many of which are totally devoid of aquatic \nlife.\n  On top of these environmental impacts, the decreased demand for \nAppalachian coal has devastated communities and workers who have built \ntheir lives and built their families around the coal industry. This \namendment is for them and to help rejuvenate these small communities \nacross Appalachia and in other regions.\n  Nearly all the biggest coal companies in the United States are \nteetering on the brink of collapse. Several have been removed from the \nNew York Stock Exchange due to their valuations falling too low. Just \nyesterday, Arch Coal, one of the biggest coal companies in the country, \nfiled for bankruptcy.\n  For the families that depend on these jobs, these benefits, and these \npensions, we have to act. We cannot be dispassionate bystanders as the \nrug is pulled out from under these communities. They deserve our \nsupport.\n  Now, this amendment recognizes the fact that coal helped to build \nthis country, coal spurred the industrial revolution and powered us \nthrough two world wars. The communities of Appalachia that proudly dug \nthe coal that powered America through the 20th century have earned the \nsupport they need to diversify their local economies, and that is what \nthis amendment works toward.\n  The sponsors of the underlying bill, the STREAM Act, purport to be \nconcerned about jobs in the Appalachian regions. If that is their \nconcern, then they should also support my amendment, which will create \njobs in the communities that need them most and continue to have to \nspend money on reclaiming abandoned mines.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues--and especially those of you \nwho represent mining areas, as I do--to vote ``yes'' on this amendment \nto revitalize historic mining communities.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the \nCartwright amendment to the STREAM Act.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Montana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chair, we in the coal-producing States in the West do \npay the majority of AML fees every year, a reminder that Montana and \nWyoming have more coal than anyone else in the world. Yet, this \nlanguage would rip away funding of the AML from our coal-certified \nStates like Montana, but also the tribes. The great Crow Nation depends \non these funds.\n  How can you justify ripping and robbing certified States that pay the \nmajority of the AML funds and tribes away? What does it do? It rips \naway money that is used for restoration and protects small communities.\n  Montana has been in the business of mining for over 100 years. We \nhave over\n\n[[Page H318]]\n\n6,700 known abandoned mines and mill sites across our State, and we \nhave worked hard to reclaim many of these areas. Yet, removing the \nfunds from those small communities poses a threat.\n  Governor Bullock, a Democrat, has also expressed his deep concerns \nabout ending these payments and asked all of the Montana delegation, \nwhich there are three of us, to help safeguard this valuable program \nfor the good of all Montanans and the great Crow Nation.\n  This amendment is disguised as a solution. It doesn't offer a \nsolution. The underlying idea of it is to kill the coal industry. We \nhave seen time and time again excessive overreach, not based on \nscientific data, but based on an agenda; and the agenda is to kill \ncoal.\n  In Montana, we love coal. In Wyoming, our neighbor to the south, we \nunderstand that coal drives our economy. It helps fund our schools, our \nbridges, our roads, and our community.\n  I stand by Montana and I stand by the great Crow Nation and urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis).\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, this is absolutely illustrative of the old \nadage: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. If it \nstops moving, subsidize it.\n  So here is the deal: This country started mining a lot of coal, so \nthe Federal Government taxed it in 1977 through SMCRA, the Surface \nMining Control and Reclamation Act. They put a big tax on coal by the \nton, not the Btus, by the ton.\n  Then the coal companies and the coal industry kept moving, and now \nthey want to regulate it. In fact, this administration wants to \nregulate it out of existence and has said so. Rules are being proposed \nto regulate the coal industry out of existence. So that is the keep-\nmoving part. Well, they are being very successful at regulating the \ncoal industry out of existence.\n  Now, we are to step three. If it stops moving, subsidize it. That is \nwhat the amendment we are discussing would do. It is saying the coal \nindustry is on its knees, not acknowledging that they are the ones that \nput it there. Then they are saying: So let's take money for all of \nthose coal jobs that are being lost due to their policies and let's \nsubsidize it. Let's give them economic development money. Further, \nlet's give it to the administration in Washington to sprinkle about to \nwhom they think it should go to, rather than letting the States that \nare producing this coal have a fraction of the money that is being \nproduced from their States. This is the Federal Government's mentality \nrun amok.\n  This is something that Ronald Reagan talked about when he said: If it \nmoves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. If it stops moving, \nsubsidize it.\n  These people don't want subsidies. They want their jobs. They want \ntheir communities. They don't want subsidies from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  That said, the omnibus bill that we just passed last month had $90 \nmillion for economic development in areas that are losing jobs due to \ncoal policies. For crying out loud, we have lost our minds.\n  I urge you to oppose the Cartwright amendment.\n  Mr. ZINKE. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chair, with all due respect--and I do have ample \nrespect for my colleague from Wyoming--I will say this: Taxing it is \nnot the issue here. Regulating it is not the issue here. Subsidizing it \nis not the issue here. We are talking about money that has already been \nallocated. In fact, Wyoming itself is slated to get $53.8 million. The \npoint here is that this is money that is going to States that are \nalready certified as having properly finished their mine reclamation.\n  The proposal of this amendment is to take that money--it is not new \ntax, it is not new regulation, it is not a new subsidy--it is just take \nthat money and spread it out among the States that are still reclaiming \ntheir mines, including northeastern Pennsylvania and all of \nPennsylvania. We are talking about taking it from the four States that \nhave been certified by the Federal Government as having completed their \nmine reclamation and spreading it out among the States that have not \ndone so completely at this point and continue to work on it.\n  Further, this is money that is not being taken from the tribes. I am \nnot sure where that idea came from. It is money that is given to the \nStates, not the tribes. Therefore, it makes sense to send it to the \ncommunities where the mines are still causing trouble and are still \nbeing reclaimed.\n  Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the Cartwright amendment to H.R. \n1644.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nwill be postponed.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n\n            Amendment No. 4 Offered by Ms. Sewell of Alabama\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 \nprinted in House Report 114-395.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 5, line 3, before the period insert ``or cause or \n     significantly contribute to the development of negative \n     chronic or long-term health conditions''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentlewoman \nfrom Alabama (Ms. Sewell) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple and \nstraightforward. Moreover, I do not believe it conflicts with the \nintent of this legislation.\n  Alabama has a long and rich history of coal production that provides \nmy constituents and Americans across the country with affordable and \nreliable energy as well as good-paying jobs.\n  As a representative of Alabama, I am a strong supporter of an all-of-\nthe-above energy strategy. I support the development and use of \nrenewable energy like wind and solar as well as the traditional sources \nof energy like coal. Coal is very important in my State.\n  However, I also believe that it is Congress' responsibility to ensure \nthat energy is produced in a way that does not adversely impact the \nlong-term safety or health of my constituents. That is why I have \noffered this amendment to H.R. 1644.\n  This amendment makes an important addition to the exception clause in \nsection 2 of the bill. It simply ensures that rules will not be delayed \nif such a delay would cause or significantly contribute to the \ndevelopment of a negative, chronic, or long-term health condition.\n  We have an obligation as representatives of the people to ensure that \nregulations are not only sensible but also pragmatic. They must also \nnot be threatened by the policies and regulations, those things that \ndirectly affect the public health. I believe all of my colleagues share \nthis belief. I know that my Republican colleagues share my concern for \npublic health.\n  The legislation already includes an exception clause that says a rule \ncannot be delayed if it would pose an imminent and severe threat to \nhuman life. I strongly support this clause, but it is not enough to \nsimply protect the public from imminent and severe health effects.\n  Cancer and lung disease are illnesses that are chronic and often not \ndeveloped except over years. We should also ensure that the public's \nlong-term health and well-being is protected.\n  This is a commonsense amendment that will protect the public health. \nI urge all of my colleagues to vote for it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page H319]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, although this is a very well-intended \namendment, the purpose of the section of the bill affected by this \namendment is already to ensure that good science is used in the \ndevelopment of the rules by making the scientific products on which the \nrule is based publicly available for review and already provides for an \nemergency exemption if the delay in the publication of a rule during \nthis public review will pose ``an imminent and severe threat to human \nlife.'' An imminent and severe threat to human life, that is already \naddressed in the text of the bill. Mr. Chairman, I believe that this is \nunnecessary.\n  We also have protection under the existing Surface Mining Control and \nReclamation Act, SMCRA. It is to ``establish a nationwide program to \nprotect society and the environment from the adverse effects of surface \ncoal mining operations.''\n  The law and the proposed bill that is before us today already are \ndesigned to help protect human health and the environment. So although \nthis is a well-intended amendment, it is unnecessary, given this \nbackground.\n  Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, I think \nthat the plain reading of the bill, the bill itself, talks about \nimminent and imminent threat. It doesn't necessarily deal with long-\nterm effect.\n  My commonsense amendment would just make sure that any rules that \nactually affect public health that is chronic in nature and long term \nwould also be covered with the exception.\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I am from a pro-\ncoal State, but I also think it is really important to be pro-public \nhealth. I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Sewell amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Alabama \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings \nwill now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 114-395 on \nwhich further proceedings were postponed, in the following order:\n  Amendment No. 2 by Mr. Kildee of Michigan.\n  Amendment No. 3 by Mr. Cartwright of Pennsylvania.\n  Amendment No. 4 by Ms. Sewell of Alabama.\n  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any \nelectronic vote after the first vote in this series.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Kildee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a \nrecorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan \n(Mr. Kildee) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which \nthe noes prevailed by voice vote.\n  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Under the rule, the Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nSmith of Nebraska) having assumed the chair, Mr. Simpson, Acting Chair \nof the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported \nthat that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. \n1644) to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 \nto ensure transparency in the development of environmental regulations, \nand for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 583, he \nreported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the \nCommittee of the Whole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on the amendment to the amendment \nreported from the Committee of the Whole?\n  If not, the question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. KILDEE. I am opposed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Kildee moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1644 to the \n     Committee on Natural Resources with instructions to report \n     the same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendment:\n       Page 5, strike line 3 and insert ``either an imminent or \n     long-term threat to human life or increase the incidence or \n     prevalence of lung cancer, heart or kidney disease, birth \n     defects, or heavy metal contamination in communities in the \n     vicinities of mountaintop removal coal mining projects.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, this final amendment to the bill will not \nkill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will \nimmediately proceed to final passage as amended.\n  The bill is yet another attempt to delay the issuance of new and \nupdated regulations to protect our streams, our rivers, and our \ncommunities from mountaintop coal mining. These safeguards are \nimportant for protecting the health and safety of the drinking water in \ncommunities and of children living near mountaintop removal coal \nmining.\n  Mr. Speaker, my motion would prevent the stream protection rule from \nbeing delayed if there is an increase in the incidence or prevalence of \nlung cancer, heart or kidney disease, birth defects, or heavy metal \ncontamination in these communities.\n  We cannot allow the underlying bill to further delay important \nprotections of public health. I know, firsthand, what happens when \nprotections are not strong enough to prevent heavy metals, mainly lead, \nfrom contaminating drinking water. I have seen thousands of kids in my \nhometown of Flint, Michigan, poisoned by lead-contaminated water.\n  Let me repeat: Today, in the 21st century, thousands of children \nbeing poisoned by lead in their drinking water due to the lack of \neffective enforcement.\n  For 14 months, in my hometown of Flint, children, citizens have been \nexposed to drinking water with very high levels of lead. These kids, \nespecially, will face consequences.\n  This is not a problem without victims. Children will face cognitive \ndifficulties, developmental problems, behavioral issues, all because in \nMichigan our Governor appointed an emergency financial manager to take \nover the city of Flint, and without any concern for health or the \nwelfare of the people who live there, simply to save a few dollars, \nswitched the city of Flint, not by the city itself, but the State of \nMichigan switched the city of Flint from Lake Huron to the Flint River \nas its primary drinking water source.\n  That highly corrosive river water led to lead leaching into the water \nsystem and, for 14 months, going into the bodies of people in my \nhometown, into children, all because of ineffective, lackluster \nenforcement of protections built into the law.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  These kids in my hometown have a right to expect that the water \ncoming through the faucet is safe for them to drink, and the Department \nof Environmental Quality in Michigan was warned--warned--by the EPA, \nwarned by a researcher from Virginia Tech who came to Flint to study \nthe water, and warned by a local pediatrician who saw elevated lead \nlevels in the children's blood in Flint, Michigan.\n  What was the State's response? To try to discredit those claims that \nthere were elevated lead levels, to actually--believe it or not--tell \nthe people of the city of Flint that those researchers are wrong and \nthey should just relax. That is what they were told. Relax.\n  This is the 21st century. We ought to have in place adequate \nprotections to\n\n[[Page H322]]\n\nmake sure that drinking water is safe. What has been the response, even \nnow in my own hometown in the State of Michigan? There have been some \nnews conferences, but from July, when the State was first made aware of \nthis, until today, the State has yet to step in to even supply bottled \nwater, relying on the generosity of corporations, of labor unions, and \nof citizens, neighbors helping neighbors.\n  Unfortunately, I think they see this more as a public relations \nproblem than as a public health emergency. This is what happens when we \ndon't recognize the importance of regulation to protect public health. \nThis is what happens when we weaken protections for drinking water for \nour environment and for our land.\n  Is this really what we want to do? Or don't we have an obligation to \ndo everything in our power to protect the people back home, to protect \nchildren from this terrible, terrible kind of contamination?\n  The steps that we are taking today that are on the floor of the House \nwill simply be one more step to weaken those sorts of protections. My \nmotion to recommit would correct that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to please join me. Protect our \npeople, protect our land, and protect our kids. Join me in supporting \nthis motion.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I urge us to reject this motion. It is only \ngoing to delay passage of this excellent piece of legislation. We just \nrejected a very similar amendment moments ago, and that was a \nsubstantive amendment. This is a procedural--not even a substantive--\namendment.\n  The bill does three great things, and that is why we need to pass the \nbill. It promotes transparency and scientific integrity. It requires an \nindependent third-party review of the proposed OSM, Office of Surface \nMining Bureau, rule. And it prevents OSM from regulatory overreach. So \nfor those three important reasons, we should pass this bill.\n  When it comes to health in particular, let me read a sentence from \nthe text of the bill: ``This subsection shall not apply if a delay in \nthe publication of a rule will pose an imminent and severe threat to \nhuman life.''\n  So we do already address health. It is covered in the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge a rejection of the motion to recommit and the \npassage of H.R. 1644.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 5-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5-\nminute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered; and the motion to \nsuspend the rules and pass H.R. 757.\n  This is a 5-minute vote.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 186, \nnoes 237, not voting 10, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 41]\n\n                               AYES--186\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blum\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Castro (TX)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Cleaver\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeFazio\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Fattah\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Gutierrez\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Hinojosa\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jackson Lee\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the \ndistinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States.\n  (Applause, the Members rising.)\n  The PRESIDENT. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, \nmy fellow Americans:\n  Tonight marks the eighth year I have come here to report on the State \nof the Union, and for this final one, I am going to try to make it a \nlittle shorter. I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa. I \nhave been there. I will be shaking hands afterwards if you want some \ntips.\n  I understand that because it is an election season, expectations for \nwhat we will achieve this year are low. But, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate \nthe constructive approach that you and other leaders took at the end of \nlast year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working \nfamilies. So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan \npriorities like criminal justice reform and helping people who are \nbattling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse. So who knows, we \nmight surprise the cynics again.\n  But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals \nfor the year ahead. Don't worry, I have got plenty, from helping \nstudents learn to write computer code to personalizing medical \ntreatments for patients. And I will keep pushing for progress on the \nwork that I believe still needs to be done: fixing a broken immigration \nsystem, protecting our kids from gun violence, equal pay for equal \nwork, paid leave, and raising the minimum wage. All these things still \nmatter to hardworking families. They are still the right thing to do, \nand I won't let up until they get done.\n  But for my final address to this Chamber, I don't want to just talk \nabout next year. I want to focus on the next 5 years, the next 10 \nyears, and beyond. I want to focus on our future.\n  We live in a time of extraordinary change--change that is reshaping \nthe way we live, the way we work, our planet, and our place in the \nworld. It is change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but \nalso economic disruptions that strain working families. It promises \neducation for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects \nterrorists plotting an ocean away. It is change that can broaden \nopportunity or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the \npace of this change will only accelerate.\n  America has been through big changes before: wars and depression, the \ninflux of new immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, and \nmovements to expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who \ntold us to fear the future, who claimed we could slam the brakes on \nchange, who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or \nidea that was threatening America under control; and each time, we \novercame those fears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to \nthe ``dogmas of the quiet past.'' Instead, we thought anew and acted \nanew. We made change work for us, always extending America's promise \noutward to the next frontier, to more people. Because we did, because \nwe saw opportunity where others saw peril, we emerged stronger and \nbetter than before.\n  What was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a \nnation--our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our \ndiversity, and our commitment to rule of law--these things give us \neverything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to \ncome.\n  In fact, it is in that spirit that we have made progress these past 7 \nyears. That is how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in \ngenerations. That is how we reformed our healthcare system and \nreinvented our energy sector. That is how we delivered more care and \nbenefits to our troops coming home and our veterans, and that is how we \nhow we secured the freedom in every State to marry the person we love.\n  But such progress is not inevitable. It is the result of choices we \nmake together, and we face such choices right now. Will we respond to \nthe changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation and \nturning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with \nconfidence in who we are, in what we stand for, and the incredible \nthings that we can do together?\n  So let's talk about the future and four big questions that I believe \nwe as a country have to answer, regardless of who the next President is \nor who controls the next Congress.\n  First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and \nsecurity in this new economy?\n  Second, how do we make technology work for us and not against us, \nespecially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate \nchange?\n  Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without \nbecoming its policeman?\n  And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what is best in us \nand not what is worst?\n  Let me start with the economy and a basic fact: the United States of \nAmerica, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the \nworld.\n  We are in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job \ncreation in history: more than 14 million new jobs, the strongest 2 \nyears of job growth since the 1990s, an unemployment rate cut in half. \nOur auto industry just had its best year ever. That is just part of a \nmanufacturing surge that has created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the \npast 6 years. We have done all this while cutting our deficits by \nalmost three-quarters.\n  Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling \nfiction. Now, what is true and the reason that a lot of Americans feel \nanxious is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes \nthat started long before the Great Recession hit and changes that have \nnot let up. Today technology doesn't just replace jobs on the assembly \nline, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global \neconomy can locate anywhere, and they face tougher competition. As a \nresult, workers have less leverage for a raise, companies have less \nloyalty to their communities, and more and more wealth and income is \nconcentrated at the very top.\n  All these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs, \neven when the economy is growing. It has made it harder for a \nhardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young \npeople to start their careers, and tougher for workers to retire when \nthey want to. Although none of these trends are unique to America, they \ndo offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard \nshould get a fair shot.\n  For the past 7 years, our goal has been a growing economy that also \nworks better for everybody. We have made progress. But we need to make \nmore. Despite all the political arguments that we have had these past \nfew years, there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree.\n  We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the \neducation and training they need to land a good-paying job. The \nbipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and \ntogether we have increased early childhood education, lifted high \nschool graduation rates to new highs, and boosted graduates in fields \nlike engineering.\n  In the coming years, we should build on that progress by providing \npre-K for all, offering every student the hands-on computer science and \nmath classes that make them job-ready on day one, and we should recruit \nand support more great teachers for our kids.\n  We have to make college affordable for every American because no \nhardworking student should be stuck in the red. We have already reduced \nstudent loan payments to 10 percent of a borrower's income, and that is \ngood. But now we have actually got to cut the cost of college.\n  Providing 2 years of community college at no cost for every \nresponsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I am going \nto keep fighting to get that started this year. It is the right thing \nto do.\n  But a great education isn't all we need in this new economy. We also \nneed benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. \nIt is not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in \nAmerica\n\n[[Page H326]]\n\nwho are going to work the same job in the same place with a health and \nretirement package for 30 years are sitting in this Chamber.\n  For everyone else, especially folks in their 40s and 50s, saving for \nretirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. \nAmericans understand that, at some point in their careers in this new \neconomy, they may have to retool and they may have to retrain. But they \nshouldn't lose what they have already worked so hard to build in the \nprocess.\n  That is why Social Security and Medicare are more important than \never. We shouldn't weaken them. We should strengthen them. For \nAmericans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile \nas everything else is today.\n  That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It is \nabout filling the gaps in employer-based care so that, when you lose a \njob or you go back to school or you strike out and launch that new \nbusiness, you will still have coverage.\n  Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far. In the process, \nhealthcare inflation is slow. Our businesses have created jobs every \nsingle month since it became law.\n  Now, I am guessing we won't agree on health care anytime soon. But \nthere should be other ways parties can work together to improve \neconomic security. Say a hardworking American loses his job. We \nshouldn't just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance; we \nshould make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business \nthat is ready to hire him. If that new job doesn't pay as much, there \nshould be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay \nhis bills. Even if he is going from job to job, he should still be able \nto save for retirement and take his savings with him. That is the way \nwe make the new economy work better for everybody.\n  I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling \npoverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a \nhand up. I would welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can \nall support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don't \nhave children.\n  But there are some areas where we just have to be honest. It has been \ndifficult to find agreement over the last 7 years. A lot of them fall \nunder the category of what role the government should play in making \nsure the system is not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest \ncorporations. It is an honest disagreement, and the American people \nhave a choice to make.\n  I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. \nI think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed and \nthere is red tape that needs to be cut.\n  But, after years now of record corporate profits, working families \nwon't get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big \nbanks or Big Oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody \nelse's expense. Middle class families are not going to feel more secure \nbecause we allow attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered.\n  Food stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis. \nRecklessness on Wall Street did. Immigrants aren't the principal reason \nwages haven't gone up. Those decisions were made in the boardrooms \nthat, all too often, put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. It \nis sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying \ntaxes through offshore accounts.\n  The point is, I believe that in this new economy workers and startups \nand small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should \nwork for them. I am not alone in this. This year, I plan to lift up the \nmany businesses which have figured out that doing right by their \nworkers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for \ntheir shareholders, and I want to spread those best practices across \nAmerica. That is a part of a brighter future.\n  In fact, it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also \nour most creative. This brings me to the second big question we as a \ncountry have to answer: How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to \nmeet our biggest challenges?\n  Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn't deny \nSputnik was up there. We didn't argue about the science or shrink our \nresearch and development budget. We built a space program almost \novernight, and, 12 years later, we were walking on the Moon.\n  That spirit of discovery is in our DNA. America is Thomas Edison and \nthe Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. America is Grace \nHopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. America is every immigrant \nand entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley, racing to \nshape a better future. That is who we are, and over the past 7 years we \nhave nurtured that spirit.\n  We have protected an open Internet and have taken bold new steps to \nget more students and low-income Americans online. We have launched \nnext-generation manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an \nentrepreneur everything that he or she needs to start a business in a \nsingle day.\n  But we can do so much more. Last year, Vice President Biden said that \nwith a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked \nwith this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of \nHealth the strongest resources that they have had in over a decade.\n  So, tonight, I am announcing a new national effort to get it done; \nand because he has gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over \nthe past 40 years, I am putting Joe in charge of mission control. For \nthe loved ones we have all lost, for the families that we can still \nsave, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for \nall.\n  What do you say, Joe? Let's make it happen.\n  Medical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment \nwhen it comes to developing clean energy sources. Look, if anybody \nstill wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. \nYou will be pretty lonely because you will be debating our military, \nmost of America's business leaders, the majority of the American \npeople, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around \nthe world which agree it is a problem and intend to solve it.\n  But even if the planet wasn't at stake, even if 2014 wasn't the \nwarmest year on record--until 2015 turned out to be even hotter--why \nwould we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce \nand sell the energy of the future?\n  Listen, 7 years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean \nenergy in our history. Here are the results: in fields from Iowa to \nTexas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier conventional power. On \nrooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of \nmillions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more \nAmericans than coal in jobs that pay better than average.\n  We are taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and \nstore their own energy, something, by the way, that environmentalists \nand tea partiers have teamed up to support. Meanwhile, we have cut our \nimports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent and cut carbon pollution \nmore than any other country on Earth.\n  Gas under two bucks a gallon ain't bad either.\n  Now we have got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier \nenergy sources. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the \nfuture, especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. We do them \nno favor when we don't show them where the trends are going.\n  That is why I am going to push to change the way we manage our oil \nand coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose \non taxpayers and our planet. That way, we put money back into those \ncommunities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work in building \na 21st century transportation system.\n  None of this is going to happen overnight, and, yes, there are plenty \nof entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the \njobs we will create, the money we will save, and the planet we will \npreserve, that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids \ndeserve, and it is within our grasp.\n  Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is \nlinked to the rest of the world. That is why the third big question \nthat we have to answer together is how to keep America\n\n[[Page H327]]\n\nsafe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-\nbuild everywhere there is a problem.\n  I told you earlier all of the talk of America's economic decline is \npolitical hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our \nenemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. Let me tell you \nsomething. The United States of America is the most powerful nation on \nEarth--period. It is not even close. We spend more on our military than \nthe next eight nations combined.\n  Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. \nNo nation attacks us directly or our allies because they know that is \nthe path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher \nthan when I was elected to this office; and when it comes to every \nimportant international issue, people of the world do not look to \nBeijing or Moscow to lead. They call us. So it is useful to level set \nhere, because when we don't, we don't make good decisions.\n  Now, as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I \nknow this is a dangerous time, but that is not primarily because of \nsome looming superpower out there, and it is certainly not because of \ndiminished American strength. In today's world, we are threatened less \nby evil empires and more by failing states.\n  The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out \nfor a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. \nEconomic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in \nsignificant transition. Even as their economy severely contracts, \nRussia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria, client \nstates that they saw slipping away from their orbit. The international \nsystem we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with \nthis new reality.\n  It is up to us, the United States of America, to help remake that \nsystem. And to do that well, it means that we have got to set \npriorities.\n  Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after \nterrorist networks. Both al Qaeda and, now, ISIL pose a direct threat \nto our people because in today's world, even a handful of terrorists \nwho place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of \ndamage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside \nour country. Their actions undermine and destabilize our allies. We \nhave to take them out.\n  But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is \nworld war III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the \nback of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages, \nthey pose an enormous danger to civilians. They have to be stopped, but \nthey do not threaten our national existence. That is the story ISIL \nwants to tell. That is the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We \ndon't need to build them up to show that we are serious, and we sure \ndon't need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie \nthat ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world's largest \nreligions. We just need to call them what they are: killers and \nfanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed. That is \nexactly what we are doing.\n  For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 \ncountries to cut off ISIL's financing, disrupt their plots, stop the \nflow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With \nnearly 10,000 airstrikes, we are taking out their leadership, their \noil, their training camps, and their weapons. We are training, arming, \nand supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and \nSyria.\n  If this Congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send \na message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military \nforce against ISIL. Take a vote.\n  But the American people should know that, with or without \ncongressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists \nbefore them. If you doubt America's commitment--or mine--to see that \njustice is done, just ask Osama bin Laden. Ask the leader of al Qaeda \nin Yemen who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the \nBenghazi attacks who sits in a prison cell. When you come after \nAmericans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have long \nmemories, and our reach has no limit.\n  Our foreign policy has to be focused on the threat from ISIL and al \nQaeda, but it can't stop there. For even without ISIL, even without al \nQaeda, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the \nworld: in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, in parts of Pakistan, in \nparts of Central America, in Africa and Asia. Some of these places may \nbecome safe havens for new terrorist networks. Others will just fall \nvictim to ethnic conflict or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees.\n  The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our \nanswer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb \ncivilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn't pass muster \non the world stage.\n  We also can't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls \ninto crisis, even if it is done with the best of intentions. That is \nnot leadership. That is a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood \nand treasure that ultimately will weaken us. It is the lesson of \nVietnam; it is the lesson of Iraq; and we should have learned it by \nnow.\n  Fortunately, there is a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined \nstrategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America \nwill always act--alone, if necessary--to protect our people and our \nallies.\n  But on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work \nwith us and make sure other countries pull their own weight. That is \nour approach to conflicts like Syria, where we are partnering with \nlocal forces and leading international efforts to help that broken \nsociety pursue a lasting peace.\n  That is why we built a global coalition with sanctions and principled \ndiplomacy to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. As we speak, Iran has rolled \nback its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the \nworld has avoided another war.\n  That is how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Our \nmilitary, our doctors, our development workers, they were heroic. They \nset up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind \nus and stamp out that epidemic. Hundreds of thousands, maybe a couple \nmillion, lives were saved.\n  That is how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, \nprotect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in \nAsia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America, which will then \nsupport more good jobs here in America.\n  With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region. We do. You \nwant to show our strength in this new century? Approve this agreement. \nGive us the tools to enforce it. It is the right thing to do.\n  Let me give you another example. Fifty years of isolating Cuba had \nfailed to promote democracy. It set us back in Latin America. That is \nwhy we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and \ncommerce, and positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban \npeople. So if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in \nthe hemisphere, recognize that the cold war is over. Lift the embargo.\n  The point is American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice \nbetween ignoring the rest of the world, except when we kill terrorists, \nor occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership \nmeans a wise application of military power and rallying the world \nbehind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as \na part of our national security, not something separate, not charity.\n  When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in \nhistory to fight climate change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries, \nbut it also protects our kids. When we help Ukraine defend its \ndemocracy or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the \ninternational order we depend on. When we help African countries feed \ntheir people and care for the sick, it is the right thing to do, and it \nprevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores.\n  Right now we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS. That is \nwithin our grasp. And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing \nwith malaria, something I will be pushing this Congress to fund this \nyear.\n  That is American strength. That is American leadership. That kind of \nleadership depends on the power of our\n\n[[Page H328]]\n\nexample. That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at \nGuantanamo. It is expensive. It is unnecessary. It only serves as a \nrecruitment brochure for our enemies. There is a better way.\n  That is why we need to reject any politics that targets people \nbecause of race or religion. Let me just say this: This is not a matter \nof political correctness. This is a matter of understanding just what \nit is that makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our \narsenal. It respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way \nwe respect every faith.\n  His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot that I \nam standing tonight that ``to imitate the hatred and violence of \ntyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.''\n  When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow \ncitizens, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid is called names, that \ndoesn't make us safer. That is not telling it like it is. It is just \nwrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to \nachieve our goals. It betrays who we are as a country.\n  ``We the People.'' Our Constitution begins with those three simple \nwords, words we have come to recognize mean all the people, not just \nsome, words that insist we rise and fall together, that that is how we \nmight perfect our Union.\n  That brings me to the fourth, and maybe the most important, thing I \nwant to say tonight. The future we want, all of us want--opportunity \nand security for our families; a rising standard of living; a \nsustainable, peaceful planet for our kids--all that is within our \nreach. But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen \nif we can have rational, constructive debates. It will only happen if \nwe fix our politics.\n  A better politics doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. This \nis a big country with different regions, different attitudes, different \ninterests. That is one of our strengths, too.\n  Our Founders distributed power between States and branches of \ngovernment and expected us to argue, just as they did, fiercely over \nthe size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, \nover the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.\n  But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. \nIt doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all \nmotivated by malice. It doesn't work if we think that our political \nopponents are unpatriotic or are trying to weaken America. Democracy \ngrinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic \nfacts are contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us.\n  Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the \nattention. Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person \nfeels their voice doesn't matter, that the system is rigged in favor of \nthe rich or the powerful or some special interest.\n  Too many Americans feel that way right now. It is one of the few \nregrets of my Presidency, that the rancor and suspicion between the \nparties has gotten worse instead of better. I have no doubt a President \nwith the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the \ndivide, and I guarantee I will keep trying to be better so long as I \nhold this office.\n  But, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task--or any \nPresident's--alone. There are a whole lot of folks in this Chamber, \ngood people who would like to see more cooperation, would like to see a \nmore elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the imperatives \nof getting elected, by the noise coming out of your base.\n  I know. You have told me. It is the worst kept secret in Washington. \nAnd a lot of you aren't enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor. \nBut that means, if we want a better politics--and I am addressing the \nAmerican people now--it is not enough to just change a Congressman or \nchange a Senator or even change a President. We have to change the \nsystem to reflect our better selves.\n  We have got to end the practice of drawing our congressional \ndistricts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other \nway around. Let a bipartisan group do it.\n  I believe we have got to reduce the influence of money in our \npolitics so that a handful of families and hidden interests can't \nbankroll our elections. If our existing approach to campaign finance \nreform can't pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to \nfind a real solution, because it is a problem. And most of you don't \nlike raising money. I know. I have done it.\n  We have got to make it easier to vote, not harder. We need to \nmodernize it for the way we live now. This is America. We want to make \nit easier for people to participate. Over the course of this year, I \nintend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that.\n  But I can't do these things on my own. Changes in our political \nprocess, in not just who gets elected, but how they get elected, that \nwill only happen when the American people demand it. It depends on you. \nThat is what is meant by a government of, by, and for the people.\n  What I am suggesting is hard. It is a lot easier to be cynical, to \naccept that change is not possible and politics is hopeless and the \nproblem is all the folks who are elected don't care, and to believe \nthat our voices and our actions don't matter.\n  But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with \nmoney and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could \nsend a young soldier to war, allow another economic disaster, or roll \nback the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans \nhave fought, even died, to secure.\n  And then, as frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to \nfall back into our respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who \ndon't look like us, pray like us, vote like we do, or share the same \nbackground. We can't afford to go down that path. It won't deliver the \neconomy we want, it will not produce the security we want, but most of \nall, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.\n  So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer \none party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as \nhard as you could against it, our collective future depends on your \nwillingness to uphold your duties as a citizen. To vote. To speak out. \nTo stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, \nknowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere stood \nup for us.\n  We need every American to stay active in our public life, and not \njust during election time, so that our public life reflects the \ngoodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single \nday.\n  It is not easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise \nthat a little over a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, \nI will be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by those voices \nof fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness that have \nhelped America travel so far, voices that help us see ourselves not \nfirst and foremost as Black or White or Asian or Latino, not as gay or \nstraight, immigrant or native born, not Democrat or Republican, but as \nAmericans first, bound by a common creed, voices Dr. King believed \nwould have the final word, voices of unarmed truth and unconditional \nlove.\n  And they are out there, those voices. They don't get a lot of \nattention. They don't seek a lot of fanfare. But they are busy doing \nthe work this country needs doing.\n  I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours. I \nsee you, the American people. And in your daily acts of citizenship, I \nsee our future unfolding.\n  I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts \nto keep his company open and the boss who pays him higher wages instead \nof laying him off.\n  I see it in the DREAMer who stays up late at night to finish her \nscience project, and the teacher who comes in early, maybe with some \nextra supplies that she bought, because she knows that that young girl \nmight someday cure a disease.\n  I see it in the American who served his time and made bad mistakes as \na child, but now is dreaming of starting over, and I see it in the \nbusiness owner who gives him that second chance; the protester \ndetermined to prove that justice matters, and the young cop walking the \nbeat, treating everybody with\n\n[[Page H329]]\n\nrespect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe.\n  I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his \nbrothers, the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon, and \nthe community that lines up to cheer him on.\n  It is the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the \nfather whose love for that son overrides everything he has been taught.\n  I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote \nas long as she has to, the new citizen who casts his vote for the first \ntime, the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count, \nbecause each of them, in different ways, knows how much that precious \nright is worth.\n  That is the America I know. That is the country we love. Clear-eyed. \nBig-hearted. Undaunted by challenge. Optimistic that unarmed truth and \nunconditional love will have the final word.\n  That is what makes me so hopeful about our future. I believe in \nchange because I believe in you, the American people. And that is why I \nstand here as confident as I have ever been that the state of our Union \nis strong.\n  Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.\n  (Applause, the Members rising.)\n  At 10 o'clock and 10 minutes p.m., the President of the United \nStates, accompanied by the committee of escort, retired from the Hall \nof the House of Representatives.\n  The Assistant to the Sergeant at Arms escorted the invited guests \nfrom the Chamber in the following order:\n  The members of the President's Cabinet; the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court; the Dean \nof the Diplomatic Corps.\n  The SPEAKER.
