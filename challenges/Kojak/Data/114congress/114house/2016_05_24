The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, my \ncongressional office in Titusville Pennsylvania, participated in a \nbridge naming service for Lieutenant Colonel Michael McLaughlin of \nTionesta, Forest County, located in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional \nDistrict. Thanks to the efforts of State Representative Kathy Rapp, the \nbridge was renamed the Lt. Col. Michael McLaughlin/AMVETS Post 113 \nMemorial Bridge.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Michael McLaughlin was actually born in Germany, \nbut raised in Forest County. He graduated from the West Forest High \nSchool in Tionesta, and later attended Clarion University. It was there \nhe became an ROTC cadet, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in \n1982.\n  Starting his military career in the Army Reserves, Lieutenant Colonel \nMcLaughlin went on to earn a master's degree from the University of \nPittsburgh, and later became the president of his own company in \nMercer, Pennsylvania, all while serving in the Pennsylvania Army \nNational Guard. Throughout his service, he was highly honored, earning \nmany ribbons and medals throughout his 26 years of service.\n  Unfortunately, Lieutenant Colonel Michael McLaughlin was killed in \nthe line of duty on January 5, 2006, in Ramadi, Iraq, as the result of \na suicide bomber. He was just 44 years old, and left behind his wife \nand two daughters.\n  McLaughlin was honored posthumously with the Purple Heart and the \nCombat Action Badge. He was the first field grade officer of the \nPennsylvania Army National Guard to die in action since World War II.\n  I was proud to see members of Lieutenant Colonel Michael McLaughlin's \ncommunity come together to honor him with this bridge naming. It is so \nfitting that it came in May, the same month as Memorial Day, when we \nhonor the men and women who lost their lives in service to our great \nNation.\n  I am the proud father of an Army soldier. America's servicemen and -\nwomen are very important to me. With Memorial Day coming up on Monday, \nI want to not only recognize the sacrifice of men and women such as \nLieutenant Colonel McLaughlin who have given the ultimate sacrifice, \nbut all of the members of our Armed Forces serving across the globe and \nall of our Nation's veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2965-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2965-H2966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CLIMATE CHANGE AND NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Westmoreland). The Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, as the world hurdles toward an era where \nclimate change impacts our everyday life, we must recognize the \nconsequences of our inaction.\n  Secretary Hagel said it best when he stated: ``Climate change is a \nglobal problem. Its impacts do not respect national borders.''\n  Despite this, we continue to live in a bubble of denial. It is \nabundantly clear that climate change is rapidly altering the world \naround us, contributing to higher temperatures, changing seasonal \npatterns, and driving the loss of species and habitats.\n  The scientific evidence demonstrating the realities of climate change \nis vast and ever-growing. Just this week, NASA reported that April 2016 \nwas the warmest April ever recorded. In fact, NASA said there is a ``99 \npercent chance that 2016 will be the hottest year ever recorded.''\n  If this proves to be true, 2016 will beat our previous record holder, \n2015. And 2015 beat our previous record holder, 2014. Sensing a trend \nhere?\n  Earth's changing temperature does not just threaten the existence of \nplants and animals: climate change also affects our national security \nat home and abroad. As a Member of the House Intelligence Committee, I \nam briefed weekly on our most pressing and urgent threats, and it is \nabundantly clear that climate change is one of those threats.\n  Climate change is what we consider a threat multiplier, meaning it is \nexacerbating many of the challenges we confront around the world today, \nand will produce new challenges for us in the future. As a global power \nwith strategic interests around the world, climate change is immensely \nimportant to us because of the impact it has on the regional stability \nof our allies.\n  Internationally, climate change is already causing humanitarian \ndisasters and resource scarcity that accelerates instability, \ncontributes to political violence, and undermines weak governments. \nExamples of these repercussions are being seen around the world today. \nClimate change-induced drought in the\n\n[[Page H2966]]\n\nMiddle East and Africa is leading to conflicts over food and water, \nescalating longstanding regional and ethnic tensions into violent \nclashes. Rising sea levels are putting people and food supplies in \nvulnerable coastal regions at risk, threatening to displace countless \npeople.\n  The increasing scarcity of resources in regions across the globe is \nstressing governments that are trying to provide basic needs for their \ncitizens. In already volatile regions of the world, these are highly \ndangerous conditions that can enable terrorist activity and exacerbate \nrefugee crises. As these threats around the world continue to multiply \ndue to climate change, the U.S. is forced to extend our limited \nresources in humanitarian aid and military security to more locations \nin an effort to keep the peace, protect our interests and allies, and \navoid major conflicts.\n  It is not just the wonky scientists and policymakers that are \nsounding the alarm. The Department of Defense declared that the threat \nof climate change will affect the Pentagon's ability to defend the \nNation and poses immediate risk to U.S. national security. The CIA and \nthe Department of State have already identified climate change as a \nnational security challenge, yet Congress continues to refuse to act on \nthis issue.\n  We are already experiencing the impacts of climate change from \nsuperstorms in the U.S. to devastating droughts in the Middle East. As \nclimate change continues to strain economies and societies across the \nworld, it will only create additional resource burdens and impact the \nway our military executes its missions, forcing our military to spend \nmore on crisis prevention, humanitarian assistance, and government \nstabilization.\n  This is why we have to act now. It is time for my colleagues to \nrealize that the debate is over and that now is the time to deal with \nthe very real consequences of climate change. As President Obama said: \n``To make collective decisions on behalf of a common good, we have to \nuse our heads. We have to agree that facts and evidence matter. And we \ngot to hold our leaders and ourselves accountable . . . ''\n  While we can't reverse climate change, we can work with our partners \naround the world to slow the process, assist in adaptation, and protect \nour national security interests. The health and security of future \ngenerations depends on our actions today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2966-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE OF AMERICAN RESOURCES IN AFGHANISTAN NEEDS TO \n                                  STOP\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Jones) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I am again on the floor--I don't know how \nmany times I have been on the floor--to talk about the waste, fraud, \nand abuse in Afghanistan. It just keeps going on and on.\n  Last week there was a great article--I don't think it was really \ngreat, but a very disturbing article--in The Washington Post, and the \ntitle was ``Afghanistan Paid 11,000 Militants to Lay Down Their Arms. \nNow the Money Has Run Out.'' It was the American taxpayer who paid the \nmilitants to stop fighting and killing Americans.\n  Somewhere along the way this doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. \nWe, the American taxpayers, have been paying fringe Taliban fighters \nnot to fight for years. The article explained that there is little \naccountability of how that money is spent and where. We do not even \nknow if paying fringe Taliban fighters not to fight is working. \nFurther, committed Taliban fighters get money from other sources and \nstill get money from the American taxpayer, and they are there to kill \nAmericans. Somewhere along the way this just makes no sense at all.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record my letter to Speaker Ryan about \nthe great work of John Sopko, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan \nReconstruction.\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 2016.\n     Hon. Paul D. Ryan,\n     Speaker of the House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker, During the Easter District Work Period, I \n     read an Associated Press article about your support for \n     numerous spending cuts to the FY 2017 budget in order to \n     secure additional votes. While I support such efforts, it \n     remains difficult for me to comprehend why congressional \n     leadership continues to support the waste, fraud, and abuse \n     in Afghanistan.\n       After over 14 years, and over $800 billion dollars, the \n     waste is more obvious today than ever before. I have enclosed \n     two articles for your review that detail the severity of the \n     situation. First is a USA Today story regarding Mr. John \n     Sopko's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee \n     that details the mysterious case of ``Schrodinger's goats,'' \n     in which $6 million was spent on nine male goats meant to \n     start a cashmere industry in Afghanistan, and whose status as \n     dead or alive cannot be confirmed. Second is an NBC story, \n     ``12 Ways Your Tax Dollars Were Squandered in Afghanistan'' \n     which, unfortunately, is only a small sample of the waste.\n       Surprisingly, many in the Republican Party question why the \n     American public is so frustrated with our leadership. A \n     cursory look at the multitude of reports of the wasted \n     billions of dollars in Afghanistan should easily rationalize \n     the American people's frustration. Adding Afghanistan \n     spending to the chopping block will go a long way toward \n     gaining the support of the American people and restoring \n     fiscal sanity to Washington, DC. Nothing is changing in \n     Afghanistan--it continues to be the graveyard of empires and \n     with a growing debt surpassing $19 trillion, I believe that \n     America is heading for the graveyard.\n       Mr. Speaker, I also encourage you to personally meet with \n     Mr. John Sopko, the Special Inspector General of Afghanistan \n     Reconstruction (SIGAR). The valuable work of SIGAR has \n     uncovered billions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse in \n     Afghanistan, which we must stop.\n       Thank you for your continued leadership and consideration \n     of this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Walter B. Jones,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, in the letter to Mr. Ryan, I ask him, the \nSpeaker of the House, if he would find 45 minutes in the very busy \nschedule that he has to meet with John Sopko. I have been in meetings, \nboth formal and informal, with John Sopko, and other Members of \nCongress have, and his group, known as SIGAR, have given full reports \nevery year for the past few years to talk about the failure of our \npolicy in Afghanistan. I don't know why we in Congress continue to fund \nAfghanistan. It is nothing but a waste of life and money, and it needs \nto stop.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is true now that we have fewer Americans killed in \nAfghanistan, but they still are being killed and wounded. I have a \nposter beside me that I have carried down to my district in North \nCarolina, as well as here in the House. For every one American that \ndies, I write a letter to the family. I have sent over 11,000 letters \nto families in this country. I started this when we had the war in \nIraq, on which I failed to vote my conscience. I bought the \nmisinformation from the Bush administration, and I voted to send our \ntroops to Iraq.\n  This picture is of a little girl standing there with her hand holding \nher mother's hand, with her finger in her mouth kind of wondering why \nher daddy is in a flag-draped coffin. This will continue to go on. \nThere will be families across this Nation until we pull out of \nAfghanistan. Let Afghanistan take care of its own problems. We cannot \nbuy friendship in Afghanistan.\n  I close with this, Mr. Speaker. It was said many, many years ago \nabout Afghanistan that Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. With \nour $19 trillion debt, there will soon be a headstone in Afghanistan \nthat says: ``USA.'' It is time to get out of Afghanistan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2966-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2966-H2967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                OLDER AMERICANS MONTH AND SENIOR HUNGER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate the contributions of our \nseniors during Older Americans Month this month, I rise to draw \nattention to an issue that often goes overlooked in our communities, \nand that is the terrible problem of hunger among aging adults.\n  Food insecurity among seniors has doubled since 2001, and is expected \nto increase significantly as the baby boomer generation ages. Today, \nfood insecurity impacts 5 million seniors across the country, forcing \nthem to make impossible decisions between food, medical care, home \nheating, and other necessities.\n\n[[Page H2967]]\n\n  We know that hunger is a health issue, and that is especially true \namong seniors over the age of 60. Research from Feeding America \nsuggests that, compared to their food-secure neighbors, seniors \nsuffering from hunger are 60 percent more likely to experience \ndepression, 53 percent more likely to report a heart attack, 52 percent \nmore likely to develop asthma, and 40 percent more likely to report an \nexperience of congestive heart failure.\n  Baby boomers spend twice as much on health care as young adults do. \nEnsuring seniors have access to nutritious food is vitally important. \nWe know that seniors have unique nutritional needs, and I am pleased to \nsee scientists collaborating to create nutritional guidance for \nseniors.\n  Researchers at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on \nAging at Tufts University, with support from the AARP Foundation, \nrecently unveiled an updated MyPlate for Older Adults graphic to help \nseniors visualize what foods cover the nutritional needs that make up a \nhealthy plate for adults their age. The new icon also encourages them \nto follow healthy eating patterns.\n  I was pleased to join scientists from Tufts as well as \nrepresentatives of AARP last week at a briefing on Capitol Hill to \nunveil the new MyPlate icon and educate congressional staff on the \nimportance of senior nutrition.\n  But if we want to ensure seniors have access to nutritious foods, we \nmust also ensure that they have the ability to afford fruits, \nvegetables, and other healthy options. One critical step we can take \ntoward the goal of ending senior hunger is closing what is referred to \nas the ``senior SNAP gap.''\n  While millions of our parents, grandparents, teachers, and friends \nare facing hunger, only a fraction of low-income seniors eligible for \nfood assistance through SNAP are accessing the benefits, presumably \nbecause of the stigma associated with assistance, or because seniors \nare unaware they qualify for benefits.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Many seniors also suffer from limited mobility or may have issues \ncompleting benefit applications, which can be complex and very time-\nconsuming. In fact, seniors are more likely than any other age group to \nbe eligible for SNAP, but they are not enrolled to receive the \nbenefits.\n  That is why I am pleased to see so many advocacy organizations using \nOlder Americans Month to call attention to the issue of senior hunger. \nThrough their hashtag Solve Senior Hunger campaign, Feeding America and \nother antihunger and -aging organizations across the country are \nreaching out to seniors and their loved ones to raise awareness and \nensure that those seniors who are eligible to receive SNAP benefits are \nconnected to the appropriate resources.\n  We should do all we can to help solve senior hunger by talking to our \nfamily members and friends about senior hunger and by partnering with \nleaders in our communities who work to improve access to nutritious \nfood for senior populations.\n  During my years in Congress, I have had the opportunity to visit food \nbanks and other organizations in my district that are working to end \nhunger among seniors. Last year I had the privilege of spending a day \nwith a Meals on Wheels program that is based in Northampton, \nMassachusetts, which is part of my congressional district. I helped to \nprepare and deliver meals and had the opportunity to speak with seniors \nwho were served through this incredible program.\n  Members of Congress have an important role in ensuring our Nation's \nseniors don't go hungry. I encourage all of my colleagues to spend time \nwith similar programs in their districts.\n  Congress must adequately fund programs like Meals on Wheels, which \nprovides nutritious food to seniors, and reject harmful cuts to SNAP, \nwhich will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us: \nchildren, seniors, and the disabled.\n  That hunger is still a big problem in America, the richest country in \nthe history of the world, and it should make us all ashamed. But, in \nworking together, we have the power to end hunger now, especially among \nour senior population. Let's act now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2967-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2967-H2968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               VENEZUELA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the ongoing crisis \nin Venezuela due to the incompetence of its leader, Nicolas Maduro. No \nmatter what Maduro says, the crisis is his fault, not the fault of the \nU.S., not the fault of the Organization of American States. Maduro and \nhis corrupt cronies are the ones to blame for this disaster--no one \nelse.\n  While the Obama administration has sometimes tried to concede to the \nMaduro regime, it has only been reciprocated with no real positive \nchange or any way forward by Maduro. Even now, the U.S. Embassy in \nCaracas has had to suspend appointments for Venezuelans who seek first-\ntime tourist and business visas due to staff shortages that it blames \non Maduro.\n  This is just the tip of the iceberg, Mr. Speaker. For a country that \nis rich in oil reserves, it is the sign of incompetence and corruption \nthat Venezuela is struggling with empty grocery stores, shortages of \nmedicine, high inflation, and a plummeting economy.\n  Now Maduro is trying desperately to receive assistance from other \ncountries to save his corrupt regime. India has offered medicine in \nexchange for Venezuelan oil, and China may offer loans to Venezuela in \nexchange for oil. But these attempts are possibly too late, and \nVenezuela may not be able to survive this incredible economic downward \nspiral.\n  To put it simply, Mr. Speaker, Venezuela is on the verge of total \ncollapse, and what an impact that will have throughout our hemisphere. \nIt is not a matter of if. It is a matter of when.\n  On top of that, Venezuela is also facing medical shortages that have \nbecome a humanitarian crisis. Recently, a group of Venezuelan \nlegislative members were in D.C., meeting with us to ask for \nhumanitarian assistance for their people and for medical supplies to \ntake care of the sick in Venezuela.\n  Now, these members are the opposition of Nicolas Maduro, but they \nknow that Maduro doesn't care about helping the people, so they are \nrising up to the chore.\n  The Venezuelan Medical Federation has asked the Maduro regime to \naccept humanitarian aid in order to handle the massive shortages of \nmedicine in the country, a request that has not been agreed upon by \nMaduro. The Venezuelan Neurology Society reported that the shortage of \nmedicines for neurological conditions has reached around 90 percent.\n  The Venezuelan National Assembly has declared a humanitarian health \ncrisis that includes the lack of 872 essential medications. In April, \nthe Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional reported that the Venezuelan \nPharmaceutical Federation declared that the shortage of medicines in \npharmacies has reached 85 percent.\n  The lack of medicine, Mr. Speaker, impacts people from all walks of \nlife, from the elderly, to the sick, to the mentally ill, to the \nchildren who cannot receive lifesaving care.\n  Individuals with serious illnesses have to go from pharmacy to \npharmacy, looking for the medicines. If they don't find them, they \neither have to leave the country or try to smuggle the medicines in \nthrough the underground black market. The situation in Venezuela can \nalso quickly become more violent and even more dangerous if the crisis \nis not resolved quickly.\n  Maduro has issued emergency decrees, even though the National \nAssembly rejected it, that will help him consolidate even more of his \npower. Power? Maduro doesn't care about the food and medicine for the \npeople. All he cares about is having more power.\n  Last week Venezuela launched its biggest military exercise. Who is \ninvading Venezuela? Why did he do it? To scare the population and to \nshow the Venezuelan people his military might so as to prevent any \nprotests by the people. At the same time, the Venezuelan National \nAssembly has called for its own country to be suspended from the \nOrganization of American States.\n  The crisis in Venezuela must wake up others in the region. The new \nleaders of Argentina and Brazil are needed to bring the Southern Cone \ntogether in the name of regional stability.\n\n[[Page H2968]]\n\n  Where is the leadership in the United States? President Obama has yet \nto add more names of human rights violators in Venezuela. Adding names \nwould prevent them from coming to the United States. This is a list \nthat is based on a law that I passed along with my Senate colleague, \nSenator Marco Rubio. That law is going to expire, and we need to extend \nit a few more years because those rights are being violated every day.\n  I talked about the economic hardships, but let's talk about the \npolitical and human rights violations that are going on every day in \nMaduro's Venezuela--they are committed by the Maduro regime--including \nthe unconscionable imprisonment of Leopoldo Lopez and scores of pro-\ndemocracy activists.\n  The dire situation in Venezuela, Mr. Speaker, is out of control. \nLet's see what we can do because the Venezuelan people deserve better \nthan a corrupt Maduro.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2968-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Judy Chu) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, the month of May is \nrecognized as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, an important time \nto celebrate our Nation's rich cultural diversity as well as the many \naccomplishments and contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific \nIslanders all across our country.\n  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are now the fastest growing \nracial group in the country, and today more immigrants come from Asia \nthan from any other region in the world.\n  As chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, or \nCAPAC, I have seen these growing numbers reflected here in Congress, \nwhere we now have 14 Asian American and Pacific Islander Members of \nCongress, which is a historic high.\n  We have also seen these numbers reflected in the diversity of our \nFederal workforce as well as in the Federal judiciary, where we have \nmore than tripled the number of Asian Pacific American judges who serve \non the Federal bench.\n  This includes the historic nomination of Sri Srinivasan to the U.S. \nDistrict Court of Appeals, which is extremely notable because it is the \ncourt from which many U.S. Supreme Court Justices have risen, and we \nknow that it is only a matter of time before we have our first Asian \nAmerican Supreme Court Justice.\n  In addition to working to diversify our Federal workforce, we in \nCAPAC have the privilege to advocate for the priorities and concerns of \nAsian Pacific Americans on a broad range of issues, from combating \nracial profiling, to keeping immigrant families together through \ncomprehensive immigration reform, to ensuring that all Americans can \naccess the ballot box and have a voice in our democracy.\n  Today far too many in the Asian Pacific American community are being \nprofiled because of the way they look or the religion they practice, \nand whether they are Chinese Americans who are being singled out for \neconomic espionage or are Muslim or Sikh Americans who are wrongfully \nperceived as terrorists, we know that profiling creates a culture of \nsuspicion that not only breeds mistrust, but that also endangers the \nlives and livelihoods of innocent Americans.\n  Take the recent case of a Chinese American scientist who was wrongly \ntargeted as a spy for China. One terrible morning, Professor Xiaoxing \nXi woke up to see guns pointed at him and 12 FBI agents arresting him \nin front of his wife, two daughters, and the whole neighborhood. They \ndragged him off to jail, accused him of being a spy for China, and \nthreatened him with 80 years in jail. It turned out that the FBI agents \nwere wrong. So they dropped all charges, but not before ruining \nProfessor Xi's life.\n  We have also seen this happen in the case of Sherry Chen, a \nhydrologist at the National Weather Service of Ohio, who was arrested \nin front of her coworkers and was accused of being a spy for China, \nonly to have her case dismissed.\n  Asian American scientists and engineers, who have worked hard to get \ntheir advanced degrees and be successful in their careers, now live in \nfear that they, too, may be next.\n  As CAPAC's chair, I have made it a priority to fight back against \nthese injustices. We have met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch to \ndemand answers to these cases. We have held press conferences, have \nwritten letters, and have questioned the FBI and the Department of \nJustice during congressional hearings. We know we must speak up.\n  In fact, we need only to look at the horrors of what happened to \ninnocent Japanese Americans who were imprisoned during World War II to \nknow what can happen when we remain silent. That is why it is so \nimportant for diverse communities to have a voice in our democracy.\n  Today the ability for us to make a difference is enormous, and we in \nCAPAC are working hard to ensure that Asian Americans and Pacific \nIslanders have access to the ballot box through our efforts to restore \nthe Voting Rights Act.\n  Nationally, Asian Pacific Americans have doubled our voter \nregistration numbers over the last decade from 2 million to 4 million \npeople, and, by 2040, we will have doubled even those numbers. We are \nthe sleeping giant. In fact, Asian Pacific Americans have gone from \nbeing marginalized to being the margin of victory.\n  As we celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month this May, let \nus remember not only the many contributions of the Asian American and \nPacific Islander community, but also the challenges that we must \ncontinue to confront in order to ensure that all Americans, regardless \nof race, ethnicity, religion, or language ability, can achieve the \nAmerican Dream.\n  Happy Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2968-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2968-H2969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LATINO EMERGENCY COUNCIL'S 10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Denham) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Latino Emergency \nCouncil as we celebrate their tenth-year anniversary. Since their \nfounding in 2006, they have provided exemplary service in promoting \nemergency preparedness and communication with the Latino community in \nStanislaus County, California.\n  The LEC was conceived in the fall of 2005 as a partnership between \nthe Stanislaus County Hispanic Leadership Council, El Concilio, and the \nCounty of Stanislaus. The initial goal was to formalize a communication \nchannel with leadership from the Latino community and the Stanislaus \nCounty Office of Emergency Services in the event of an emergency.\n  The organization is a leader in emergency communication response as \nwell as in personal emergency preparedness. The LEC distributes \nemergency preparedness information throughout the community in \nnonemergency situations and offers training to the community as a means \nof building community capacity and self-reliance in emergency \nsituations.\n  The LEC has assisted in multiple emergency responses, such as the \nH1N1 swine flu outbreak, heat emergencies, the West Nile virus, and \ncold weather situations.\n  They also participate in multiple disaster exercises, translate vital \ninformation into Spanish, provide training for underserved community \nmembers, and perform outreach throughout Stanislaus County by \ndistributing tens of thousands of pieces of literature in Spanish.\n  Organization members also travel to the FEMA Region IX office in \nOakland, California, and in Washington, D.C., and advocate for \nemergency preparedness capacity in the Latino community.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring and in recognizing the Latino \nEmergency Council for their service and outstanding contributions to \nthe Latino community as they celebrate their tenth-year anniversary. \nThey are an example of how amazing things can be done when people come \ntogether with passion and purpose to make change in the local \ncommunity.\n\n[[Page H2969]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2969-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1030\n                                THANKFUL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Cohen) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today is my birthday, and I chose to take \nthis opportunity to address Congress and the American people on things \nI am blessed with and thoughtful about.\n  First, of course, are my parents, who are no longer alive, but they \ngave me a great education and gave me a lot of love. My mother got the \nopportunity to see me get elected to Congress, and when I did, she \nsaid: What does that make me? I told her it made her the queen that she \nhas always been. She passed about 5 years ago, so she hasn't been able \nto see these other years.\n  I am thankful to my mother, my father, and my grandfather, but \nespecially to my great-grandfather, Simon, who left Lithuania with \nnothing in about 1884 and came to this country. If he wouldn't have \ntaken that bold step to leave his homeland without anything at all, I \nprobably would have been born into some union that would have led to my \nbeing killed in the Holocaust.\n  Simon was a great man, and this was a great country that accepted \nhim. We have bills dealing with immigration, and I think about Simon \nleaving Lithuania and giving me the opportunity to be here.\n  I am most thankful for my constituents for giving me this opportunity \nto serve in Congress. I love my job. I have been in politics all my \nlife. I got elected for the first time when I was just 27 years old, \nand I am a lot older than that today.\n  My constituents have blessed me. My district is the most African \nAmerican district in the United States of America, and the issue of \nrace and my religion--I am Jewish, which makes me a minority in my \ndistrict--do not come up any longer. I have not lost a precinct in the \nDemocratic primary because I have the best constituents in America who \ndon't see religion and don't see race, but they simply see somebody who \nworks hard at their job and votes their interests and tries to make \nMemphis more prosperous, more healthy, and more just. And I will always \ndo that.\n  I thank my constituents for giving me the opportunity to serve here, \nwhich was always something I longed for. I served in the State senate \nfor a long time. I ran for Congress once before and lost. And I used to \nlook at this building and think, ``I didn't get there; I didn't make \nit.'' I got a second chance, and the District Nine residents gave me \nthat chance. I will be finishing my 10th year this year.\n  To serve with the men and women I serve with in this Congress, we get \na lot of abuse, and some people don't think we do a good job. Sometimes \nI don't think we do a good job. I will tell you that the people in \nCongress, the men and women, are all good men and women. They are \nlikeable people. That is why they get elected. They are all winners. \nThey may have a different perspective on what is right for this \ncountry, but they come here dedicated, and they work hard and they try \nto represent their district and make things better for the people in \ntheir district. I am thankful for each of you, Democrats and \nRepublicans, for the opportunity to serve with you in this great Hall \nand to serve America.\n  I thank District Nine, and I thank all my friends and my parents for \ngiving me this opportunity and giving me life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2969-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ANNIVERSARY OF THE JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nMissouri (Mrs. Wagner) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 1-year anniversary \nof the signing of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. We are \ngrateful for the accomplishments of the legislation over the past year. \nThe JVTA has reinvigorated our Nation's commitment to fighting sex \ntrafficking.\n  The legislation sought to undercut demand for sex trafficking by \nholding buyers and advertisers of trafficking accountable for their \nchoices. Under the SAVE Act--my legislation that was signed into law as \npart of the JVTA legislative package--we have given prosecutors the \ntools they need to fight these Web sites and businesses that support \nhuman trafficking by knowingly advertising victims for profit.\n  Right now, tens of thousands of demented online advertisements are \nopenly selling children into sexual enslavement. Predators in our \ncommunities are going online and having children delivered to their \nhotel rooms as easily as they would a pepperoni pizza. Today, human \ntrafficking is moving from the streets to the Internet, making it more \naccessible and more insidious. The SAVE Act fights this sick explosion \nof trafficking on the Internet.\n  The SAVE Act is already demonstrating that it is an indispensable \ntool to attack online trafficking. Backpage.com and other exploitive \nWeb sites, which enable human traffickers by allowing them to post ads \nselling the bodies and the souls of our children, are angry that the \nU.S. is now holding the advertisers of human trafficking accountable.\n  Backpage.com claims that their ability to post children for sex \nonline is a matter of free speech. It is not a matter of free speech, \nMr. Speaker. It is a flagrant violation of the dignity and the basic \nconstitutional rights of these abused and vulnerable children. \nFacilitating the purchase of children for sex is not a right; it is a \ncrime, and it is a crime of the most heartless and evil proportions.\n  In December 2015, backpage.com filed a lawsuit against the SAVE Act \nin the United States District Court of the District of Columbia, and \nthey specifically named me, Ann Wagner, in their case. They are suing \nus because the SAVE Act has upset their pocketbooks and hindered them \nfrom making money off human trafficking sales. I take it as a huge \nsuccess that we are finally moving in the direction where adults, Web \nsites, and businesses that exploit victims of human trafficking cannot \nprofit and will not be given a free pass for their despicable crimes.\n  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act creates a legal framework \nto ensure that those who sell children and young women for sex, those \nwho buy children for sex, and those who profit from human trafficking \nwill be held accountable for their choices. But this law will be \nrendered useless until the Department of Justice moves to fully \nimplement it. To our knowledge, the Department has not opened any new \ninvestigations to target advertisers of trafficking.\n  The JVTA clarifies those who solicit and patronize victims of \ntrafficking can and should be prosecuted as sex trafficking offenders \nunder 18 U.S. Code section 1591. Failing to prosecute buyers \nperpetuates demand for trafficking and allows offenders to abuse our \nchildren with impunity.\n  But while buyers have been arrested over the past year, we have seen \nvery few convictions. Exactly how many convictions? We don't know \nbecause the Department of Justice has not released this information. We \ndo know that many buyers have inexplicably been allowed to walk.\n  America's children are not objects to be bought and sold and abused \nby predators. They are children who we, as adults, have the duty to \nfiercely, fiercely protect.\n  We are also waiting on the Department of Justice to levy a $5,000 \nassessment on convicted human traffickers, convicted buyers who exploit \nvictims, and offenders of similar crimes. We passed the JVTA 1 year \nago, but the Department has neglected to assess the vast majority of \nthese offenders--perhaps all of these offenders--despite a number of \nrelated convictions.\n  These fines are meant to help populate the Domestic Trafficking \nVictims' Fund to provide assistance for victims of trafficking and \nchild pornography and develop prosecution programs. We are waiting on \nthe Department of Justice to establish and populate this fund to get \nsurvivors the services that they need.\n  In short, there is much work to be done and we will not just walk \naway. It is our most fundamental responsibility to fight to protect our \nmost vulnerable from sexual enslavement. This is our most basic duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2969-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2969-H2970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TSA FUNDS DIVERTED\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. DeFazio) for 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H2970]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, as I speak here today on the comfortable \nand uncrowded floor of the House of Representatives, all across \nAmerica, people are standing in lines like cattle, waiting 60 minutes, \n90 minutes, sometimes longer, missing their flights to get through \nairport security. It didn't have to be this way.\n  We do a lot of things around here that are kind of not quite on the \nup-and-up, and one of them was a deal at the end of 2013 December, \nessentially when Americans are celebrating the holidays and not paying \na lot of attention. Congress cut one of those year-end budget deals to \nfund the whole government and theoretically reduce the deficit.\n  Now, my friends on the Republican side are totally averse to dealing \nwith the deficit through any sort of revenues: can't raise revenues, \ncan't make hedge fund managers on Wall Street pay taxes like other \nAmericans because that would be bad; can't deal with overseas \nloopholes, corporations reincorporating in tax havens so they won't \nhave to pay money here, even though they are based here and operate \nhere. We can't deal with any of those issues.\n  They snuck into that bill a little fee, yeah, just a little tiny fee. \nThey raised the fee for aviation security.\n  So why are things so bad today? If they just raised the fee in \nDecember of 2013, raising an extra $1.2 billion--B, as in billion--a \nyear for aviation security, why are the lines so long?\n  Well, guess what. They raised the fee, and they diverted the money. \nSo airline passengers are paying more for their tickets ostensibly for \naviation security to keep them safe and maybe to mitigate some of their \ninconvenience of standing in line, but the Republican majority chose to \ndivert that money to deficit reduction and other things--$1.25 billion \ndollars this year.\n  Now, I heard the head of the union for the screeners on the radio \nthis morning. He said we need 6,000 more workers. And they said, well, \nGod, how much is that going to cost? Six thousand, how could you \npossibly afford that?\n  Guess what. It would cost a heck of a lot less than $1.2 billion to \nhire 6,000 more screeners so Americans didn't have to stand in 2-hour \nlines and miss their flights.\n  What is wrong with this place? Why can't we be on the up-and-up.\n  If you raise a tax on people to pay for aviation security, both to \nmake them safe and to make it more convenient and predictable, spend \nthe money making it more safe, making it more convenient, and making it \nmore predictable. Don't divert the money to illusory deficit reduction \nor other things around here. That is incredible.\n  So all Congress has to do is say: Hmm--of course, I voted against the \nbill, but the large majority who did--we were wrong. We shouldn't have \nraised the fees on airline passengers. We shouldn't have diverted the \nmoney. We shouldn't have starved TSA from the funds they need to hire \nmore people, both to deal with baggage and lines. Up above and below, \nwe have got problems in both places with lack of staffing.\n  Now, we will just blame the management of TSA. Oh, it is the \nmanagement. It is the management. Don't look over here, because we are \ntaxing the passengers and we are spending the money over here, not on \nsecurity. That is why people are standing in line today.\n  I hope this place gets honest and says: Let's change the law and \nlet's spend the money, the taxes the passengers are paying, on aviation \nsecurity and eliminate the excessive waits in lines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2970-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2970-H2971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NDAA AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Byrne) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. \nRussell) offered an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act \nregarding religious freedom. Many of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have attempted to use this amendment as a wedge in an effort \nto divide the American people. I want to take a few minutes to discuss \nthe truth and the facts about its impact.\n  In September of 1789, the First Congress considered demands made by \nmany participants in the State conventions which called for ratifying \nthe U.S. Constitution. In response to many of those concerns, Congress \napproved, by a voice vote, the First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution and sent it to the States for ratification. The States \nratified it in December of 1791.\n  The first two clauses of the First Amendment address religious \nfreedom. The first prohibits an establishment of religion so that \ncitizens would not be forced to support a national church, as was the \ncase in Great Britain.\n  The second clause prohibits any government act that inhibits the free \nexercise of religion by a citizen, thereby assuring that the government \ncannot dictate religious beliefs or interfere with citizens as they \npractice and live out their faith.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Historically, we have a proud tradition of Republicans and Democrats \nworking together to protect free exercise under the First Amendment. A \ngreat example of this is the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which \npassed this House by a voice vote in 1993.\n  Unfortunately, basic principles of free exercise are under attack \ntoday. In response, Mr. Russell's limited amendment would extend \nreligious liberty protection to four categories of government \ncontractors.\n  It is important to note that one doesn't lose constitutional rights \nif he or she seeks to become a contractor of the government. Hence, \ncontractors are protected in the free exercise of their religious \nbeliefs and practices. The Russell amendment makes explicit these \ncontractors' rights to such protection in the employment of people who \nwork for them.\n  So let's look at the Russell amendment. It states: ``Any branch or \nagency of the Federal Government shall, with respect to any religious \ncorporation, religious association, religious educational institution, \nor religious society that is a recipient of or offeror for a Federal \ngovernment contract, subcontract, grant, purchase order, or cooperative \nagreement, provide protections and exemptions consistent with sections \n702(a) and 703(e)(2) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . . . and section \n103(d) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 . . . ''\n  Again, note that the Russell amendment is limited to these four \ncategories of religious entities, and it does not apply to other \nprivate entities or individuals.\n  Mr. Speaker, the 1964 Civil Rights Act is a landmark civil rights law \nwhich bans discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, \nor national origin. Title 7 of the act deals with discrimination in the \nworkplace. Section 702 specifically protects the four categories of \nreligious employers listed in the Russell amendment.\n  Hence, the Russell amendment extends to these four categories of \nreligious entities when they are working for or attempt to work for the \ngovernment, the same religious liberty rights they have had for over 50 \nyears when operating in the private sector. This approach is neither \nnew nor novel.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 extends many of the same \nrights granted under the 1964 act to people with disabilities. Section \n103(d) of that act allows the four categories of religious entities to \ngive ``preference in employment to individuals of a particular \nreligion'' and to require that ``all applicants and employees conform \nto the religious tenets of such organization.''\n  Again, the Russell amendment extends to these four categories of \nreligious entities the same religious liberty rights they have had for \nover 25 years when operating in the private sector to when they are \ndoing business in the government.\n  The opponents of the Russell amendment say it provides for \ndiscrimination against the LGBT community. A simple review of the \namendment and the underlying statutes demonstrates an absence of any \nreference to LGBT persons. Indeed, the Russell amendment is narrowly \ndrawn to apply only to the four categories of religious entities in \ntheir employment of individuals to carry out their work. Any service or \nproduct produced by such an entity in a government contract would have \nto\n\n[[Page H2971]]\n\nbe provided to whomever the government requires, and that, obviously \nand appropriately, will include those in the LGBT community.\n  Mr. Speaker, if the Russell amendment is discriminatory, then so is \nthe First Amendment, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the 1964 \nCivil Rights Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  If allowing a religious entity to employ persons who share its \nbeliefs is discriminatory, then so are all these other Congresses. It \nis inaccurate to portray the Russell amendment as anything other than a \nnarrowly drawn effort to protect religious freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2971-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NEW ENGLAND COMPOUNDING CENTER TRAGEDY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Bishop) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention \nto a public health atrocity that is being ignored by the current \nadministration and the current administration's continued failure to \nensure justice for American citizens.\n  As many Members in this body will recall, in 2012, the New England \nCompounding Center manufactured and distributed nonsterilized \ninjections to clinics and hospitals around the Nation. After receiving \nthose injections, more than 750 people nationwide developed fungal \nmeningitis. To date, 76 people have died as a result.\n  As you can see by the illustration to my left, this is a nationwide \nissue. The epicenter, however, of the outbreak was in Michigan's Eighth \nDistrict, which I proudly represent. More than 200 people became sick, \nand 15 people died after receiving the tainted injection from a clinic \nin our district.\n  Because of the reckless disregard for the health and safety of the \nrecipients of these drugs, the Department of Justice secured 131 \nconvictions against 14 individuals, including 25 counts of second \ndegree murder against the two main defendants for the deaths occurring \nin seven States.\n  Although this outbreak happened almost 4 years ago, the consequences \nare still very real today. Just the other week I was approached by a \ngentleman whose wife had died as a result of a lethal injection she \nreceived. It was, of course, heart-wrenching to hear the agony he went \nthrough and continues to deal with after losing his best friend and \nwife to this terrible tragedy.\n  Whether it is someone who has lost a loved one or a victim now living \nwith chronic pain and sickness or a family member caring for an ill \nvictim, this is a national tragedy, and the people need to be heard.\n  Not only have the day-to-day lives of these victims been \nirretrievably altered, they have also been financially ruined. Just to \ngive you an idea, copays on some of the drugs for the treatments \nrequired for this illness are up to $5,000 per month, and despite \nmultiple bipartisan requests from Members of both this body and the \nSenate, the Department of Health and Human Services has rejected all \nrequests to waive rights to collect on Medicare liens they have placed \non the settlement issued last year. That means that victims will get \nvery little from their compensation funds. In fact, to this date, they \nhave received not a dime.\n  Not only that, Mr. Speaker, but now the Obama administration, through \nthe Office of Management and Budget, has blocked the ability of victims \nto get compensation from the Antiterrorism and Emergency Assistance \nProgram, otherwise known as the AEAP for short. The AEAP was created \nutilizing funds from the Federal crime victims fund, a fund \nspecifically set aside to compensate victims of crimes. The fund gets \nits resources from not taxpayer dollars, but through a special \nassessment on convicted criminals. They get it through criminal fines, \npenalties, and forfeited bail bonds.\n  Without any explanation, a bureaucrat at the Office of Management and \nBudget has blocked the decision of a Senate-confirmed Assistant \nAttorney General to compensate victims of this act which the Department \nof Justice has recognized as criminal.\n  These are innocent Americans whose lives have been destroyed by \ncriminals who will never meet them, will never feel their pain, hear \nthe pain in their voices, will never see the irreversible damage they \nhave caused. But, Mr. Speaker, I see it, and the 17 other colleagues of \nmine who have signed this bipartisan letter to the Office of Management \nand Budget see it, too.\n  Justice must be served. If the Attorney General won't speak up to \nadvocate for justice, as secured by the hardworking Assistant Attorneys \nGeneral on this case, and the administration won't reverse its \ndecision, then the citizens of this country and the victims and their \nfamilies deserve to know why they have been denied justice.\n  As a former prosecutor myself for my local community, I understand \nfull well that victims of crimes need an advocate to stand up for them. \nNothing--and I mean nothing--will reverse the harm that has been caused \nby this act. But at the very least, we must ensure justice for the \npeople, and we must hold those responsible accountable for their \nactions. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2971-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Unfortunately, the inspector general's recent report found \nthat this agency is failing Americans in a very dangerous way. How so?\n  The Social Security Administration is including your Social Security \nnumber on the documents it mails. That means any lost or stolen letter \nfrom Social Security endangers the security of a beneficiary's \nidentity.\n  This bad practice needs to stop now, and as the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Social Security, I am working to fix it. In fact, this \nweek I will introduce the Social Security MAIL Act. It is a commonsense \nsolution to a problem that shouldn't exist.

Mr. Speaker, why does it seem like no one at an airport \nsecurity checkpoint has been delegated with that awesome, yet \nshockingly absent, power of common sense? Why is the 80-year-old granny \nin a wheelchair being harassed? Why is the U.S. military servicemember \nin uniform with a military ID on military orders having his or her \ntoothpaste confiscated?\n  As the management and resource allocation issues rise that are \nplaguing the bureaucracy at the TSA, red flags are going up with the \npeak travel season nearly upon us. Some airline passengers report wait \ntimes of as long as 2 or 3 hours to get through security.\n  Long lines will only get longer if the TSA doesn't pursue a course \ncorrection, that of coordinating with airport authorities and airlines \nto ensure that staffing levels match peak travel times.\n  If you have four lanes being occupied and if you have a long wait, \nmaybe you should occupy some more of the available security lanes. \nAllow law enforcement to do its law enforcement duties to free up more \nscreeners to screen.\n  Airlines can do their part by knocking off the madness with the \nhidden baggage fees. The trick might help fill seats on planes, but it \nis resulting in more people taking their baggage through security.\n  By the way, the TSA doesn't have a funding issue. Last year this \nCongress gave it more than it asked for.

Mr. Speaker, last week we learned that the Republican \npresumptive nominee, Donald Trump, actually rooted for the collapse of \nthe housing market just before the Great Recession wrecked our economy.\n  In 2007, before the crash, Donald Trump said he was excited about the \nhousing market crash because ``I've always made more money in bad \nmarkets than in good markets.''\n  Today we don't know if he made money or not because, unlike \nPresidential candidates for decades, Donald Trump refuses to release \nhis income tax returns. In fact, there is one report that suggests that \nhe paid no income taxes in 1 year.\n  Even worse, his own company, Trump Mortgage, actually pushed people \ninto subprime mortgages. Millions of people lost their homes in the \nhousing crisis, and 8.4 million Americans lost their jobs, but Donald \nTrump was the winner.\n  He is doing what he does best--putting himself above everybody else. \nHe does not want to make America great.

Mr. Speaker, the first freedom mentioned in our \nConstitution is the free exercise of religion. The Founders understood \nthe universal right to seek God in accordance with one's conscience \nand, also, that many sought refuge on these shores because of religious \npersecution.\n  Pilgrims, Puritans, Quakers, Catholics--these were just some of the \ngroups who fled persecution. In the old country, in the old days, \nexercising one's faith could result in lost business opportunities and \nother forms of discrimination. Some faced imprisonment and even death. \nThe Founders knew that history and sought to guarantee that this new \nFederal Government would not allow such injustice.\n  Regrettably, Mr. Speaker, today we are seeing laws, rules, executive \norders, and court rulings at different levels of government force some \npeople to choose between following their consciences and pursuing their \nlivelihoods. Such a choice is exactly what the penal laws of 18th \ncentury Ireland presented to Catholics in that country: abandon your \nfaith or face severe hardship.\n  Forcing such a choice is at odds with explicit, fundamental, \nconstitutional liberties and basic human rights.

He rooted for that bubble to burst.\n  Well, the crash of the housing market devastated my hometown of Las \nVegas, which was one of the hardest hit in the country. Thousands lost \ntheir homes, and 71 percent of homes were underwater, some by over 50 \npercent. Bank foreclosures put families on the street who had already \nlost their jobs and their savings.\n  Slowly we are coming back, though.

We have set up a glide path to get us to 100 \npercent spending of the funding by 2025, and each year we have a target \nto get closer to that goal.\n  This week, we are voting on the energy and water appropriations bill \non the floor, and I want to thank the leadership of the Appropriations \nCommittee--Chairmen Rogers and Simpson and Ranking Members Lowey and \nKaptur--for recognizing the importance of port spending targets.\n  This year $1.2 billion is set to go back to our ports and our port \ncommunities, making it the third year in a row that we have hit our \ntarget.

This type of alarmist rhetoric is what \nwe have come to expect from liberal pundits and the media, but science \ndoesn't back the columnist's claims.\n  Extreme weather events are not getting weirder.

He then \nchanged the name before it went out of business.\n  It is also being sued by many of its students, who paid up to \n$35,000, thinking, as it said in the informercials, that Trump had \nhandpicked the instructors. But according to Donald Trump's own \ndeposition, he never selected the instructors for the program. In fact, \nhe hadn't even met most of them and didn't even know who they were. \nThat is why, in 2014, a New York judge found Donald Trump personally \nliable for operating the company without the required business license.\n  Look, what a track record: losing money, forcing subprime loans on \nAmericans and taking money from hardworking Americans, and then going \nout of business with his fake university company. This is Donald \nTrump's record of failure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind Members to refrain \nfrom engaging in personalities toward presumptive nominees for the \nOffice of President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2974-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AMERICAN STROKE MONTH\n\n  (Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize May as American \nStroke Month.\n  800,000 Americans suffer a stroke every year, with more than 300,000 \nstroke survivors living in Illinois today. Stroke research and \nrehabilitation plays a critical role in helping these 300,000 survivors \nreturn to work and lead fulfilling lives.\n  A strong congressional response to stroke is crucial for the hundreds \nof thousands of stroke victims, their families, and their friends each \nyear.\n  My friend and colleague Senator Mark Kirk overcame unbelievable \nadversity and returned to work representing Illinois in the United \nStates Senate after suffering a life-threatening stroke. His \nperseverance has been a personal inspiration, and through his Battle \nBuddies group, he has become an inspiration to countless stroke \nsurvivors in Illinois and around the country.\n  Senator Kirk's Battle Buddies group is raising awareness of the fact \nthat nearly 80 percent of all strokes can be prevented through healthy \nlifestyle choices and maintaining low blood pressure. By simply \nrecognizing the signs of stroke and taking action, people can save a \nlife and greatly minimize long-term damage.\n  This month, I ask all my colleagues to join me in raising awareness \nfor this important issue and ensuring that stroke survivors have the \nabsolute best quality of care possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2974-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ROOTING AGAINST FAMILIES\n\n  (Mr. RYAN of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, back in 2005, '06, '07, '08, '09, and \n'10, in Ohio, we saw a housing crisis unlike anything we had ever seen \nbefore. We saw almost 400,000 people in Ohio, families, lose their \nhome. We saw over 400,000 job losses. We saw a 16 percent decrease in \nhousing values in Ohio.\n  All the while, hundreds of miles away, perched in the gold-plated \ntowers of the Trump building in New York City, there was a billionaire \nsaying: I hope this happens. I hope the housing market collapses. I \nhope people get thrown from their homes. I hope they file bankruptcy \nbecause that will be good for me.\n  Shame. Shame that we have a major leader of a major party rooting \nagainst families in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in Florida, in Colorado. \nShame on you, Mr. Trump.

The \nbranch specializes in small track-type tractors and mini hydraulic \nexcavators, providing these products to customers throughout North and \nSouth America and Europe.\n  This award illustrates the continued success of Georgia in attracting \nnew businesses.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the \ncourage and leadership of Chief Keith Smith, or ``Smitty,'' as many \naffectionately called him. He was a dedicated firefighter, a leader in \nthe truest sense of the word, and a devoted husband, father, and \ngrandfather. Sadly, Chief Smith passed away recently after a battle \nwith cancer.\n  A lifelong Hoosier, Smitty spent nearly five decades as a firefighter \nin the Indianapolis area. He led the Indianapolis, Westfield, and \nCarmel departments as fire chief during his long career. He retired in \n2012 a highly decorated and widely respected leader who, in retirement, \ncontinued to champion and advocate for firefighter education and \nmentorship.\n  In 2000, I was honored to work with Chief Smith to put on the 2001 \nWorld Police and Fire Games in Indianapolis. His remarkable leadership \nand passion for leading others was truly inspirational.\n  I feel fortunate to have known him, and I know his legacy lives on \nthrough the many lives he saved, the men and\n\n[[Page H2975]]\n\nwomen he led, and, most importantly, his family, whom he loved dearly.\n  I offer my deepest condolences to Keith's family, especially his \nwife, Cindy, and all the firefighters who mourn his loss and cherish \nhis memory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2975-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    GET THE VA WORKING FOR VETERANS\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, one of the most important bills signed into \nlaw during the last couple of years was a measure to reform the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to give our veterans choices.\n  This law was adopted in response to a national scandal over \noutrageous wait times at the VA, secret wait lists, and 40 veterans who \ndied while waiting to receive care. In Oakland, the VA regional office \ndiscovered over 13,000 initial benefit claims that dated back to the \n1990s tucked away in a file cabinet.\n  The widespread dysfunction and mismanagement of the VA is \nunacceptable. Our veterans deserve better.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I was shocked by the recent comments made \nby VA Secretary Bob McDonald, who made references to Disneyland in an \ninterview about how long veterans must wait in line to see a doctor.\n  Veterans attempting to schedule medical appointments are not there \nfor entertainment. Indeed, they are on a roller coaster as to whether \nthey are even going to have an appointment when they show up a few days \nlater. They are in need of basic healthcare services that they have \nrisked their lives for.\n  In my district, I have heard from many veterans who have had their \nappointments canceled and have experienced significant obstacles in \naccessing their healthcare benefits.\n  It is clear that there are veterans all across the country who are \nnot satisfied with the VA, and the only way to get the VA working for \nveterans is with accountability and strong congressional oversight.\n  Indeed, the glowing reports we get from VA officials are a \nfantasyland of the nontruth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2975-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2975-H2981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1230\nPROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 2576, TSCA \nMODERNIZATION ACT OF 2015, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 897, \n                REDUCING REGULATORY BURDENS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. WOODALL.

During consideration \nof this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, you heard the Reading Clerk read. Sometimes it is tough \nto follow what we do up there in the Committee on Rules. I would remind \nfolks that rules.house.gov has the copy of the rule, and folks can get \ninto all of the details. I am real proud of the work that we did up \nthere yesterday. I am glad to be down here on the floor today \nrepresenting it.\n  House Resolution 742, Mr. Speaker, is a standard rule for \nconsideration of a House amendment to the Senate-amended H.R. 2576. \nThat is the Toxic Substances Control Act Modernization Act. It also \nprovides a closed rule for consideration of H.R. 897, the Zika Vector \nControl Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, the year was 1976. That was the last time the Congress \nand the White House dealt in a serious way with the Toxic Substances \nControl Act. In fact, that is when the bill was first passed.\n  For the intervening four decades, science has changed, technology has \nchanged, consumer demands have changed, and yet the way that we \nregulate these chemicals has not. And it is not for lack of trying.\n  For Pete's sake, Mr. Speaker, long before I arrived in this Chamber 5 \nyears ago, Members were trying to find an agreement on how to deal with \nthe Toxic Substances Control Act, how to update that for late 20th \ncentury or early 21st century technology.\n  In fact, the late Senator Lautenberg, Mr. Speaker, was probably the \nlargest champion for this reform that we had on either side of Capitol \nHill. He passed away 3 years ago next week. Three years ago next week, \nmany thought that the opportunities we had to succeed here passed away \nwith him.\n  Despite the headlines, Mr. Speaker, that read that gridlock controls \nWashington, D.C., despite the 1-minutes that you hear down on the \nfloor, Mr. Speaker, where it is their fault and it is their problem or \nit is his fault and it is his problem, there really are a serious group \nof Members on both sides of this Capitol who want to get the people's \nbusiness done. What we have today is one of those efforts, an effort 40 \nyears in the making that culminates here today.\n  It happened with a lot of serious, hard work on both sides of the \nHill, Mr. Speaker. It happened because folks didn't give up when people \nsaid it couldn't be done. It happened because nobody said: It is my way \nor the highway. But they said: How can I work with folks who may \ndisagree with me in order to reach an end that is going to be better \nfor the folks that I serve back home?\n  We have that product today, Mr. Speaker. In fact, I have it right \nhere. It is also available. It is the Rules Committee print. It is \navailable at rules.house.gov if folks want to give it a read.\n  I won't confess it is a short read. I won't even suggest that it is \nan exciting read. But what I will suggest is it is the product of \nnegotiation and consensus building.\n  You may remember, Mr. Speaker, that when we first dealt with this \nissue on the House side, it passed 398-1--398-1. It passed by unanimous \nconsent on the Senate side. Now here we are today, having bridged those \ntwo bills. Mr. Speaker, that is the TSCA legislation.\n\n[[Page H2976]]\n\n  The Zika Vector Control Act, Mr. Speaker, is designed to bring those \npest control technologies that we have, those pest control \nopportunities that we have, to bear in the name of public health as \nsoon as safely possible.\n  Mr. Speaker, for years the EPA has had in its understanding of how to \nregulate in this country that, as long as it had already certified a \npest control as being safe, they did not have to go back and run it \nthrough the Clean Water Act approval process as well.\n  The law of the land, strictly speaking, says, yes, you need to do \nthat. Folks thought it was duplicative. They hadn't been doing it.\n  This bill today clarifies that. It says: For Pete's sake, the law of \nthe land is the law of the land. You ought to follow the law of the \nland. The law of the land ought to bring solutions to market as quickly \nand safely as we possibly can.\n  Mr. Speaker, we get one bite at this apple. We get one bite at Zika \ncontrol. We get one bite at making this a public health risk that does \nnot balloon here in the United States of America. This bill gives us an \nopportunity to put our best foot forward in terms of pest control.\n  Forty years, Mr. Speaker. For 40 years we have been working as House \nMembers, as Senate Members, as Republicans, as Democrats, trying to \nlook for the next effort to make sure that the chemicals we use in \neveryday household products are as safe as they can be, as viable as \nthey can be--40 years, Mr. Speaker--and that process culminates here \ntoday.\n  This is a rule that all Members can support, and I would encourage \nthem to do exactly that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 \nminutes. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  My friend from Georgia mentioned a Web site a couple times. I want to \nmake sure that you are aware, Mr. Speaker, of \ndemocrats.rules.house.gov. That is the Web site that tells what is \nreally going on in the Committee on Rules and in the House.\n  Democrats.rules.house.gov talks about the fact that there are more \nclosed rules in this Congress than any Congress that precedes it. What \ndoes that mean? It means that Republicans have chosen to allow fewer \namendments and have had more rules that allow more bills with no \namendments than in any prior Congress. That is the kind of facts, Mr. \nSpeaker, that we want to bring to your attention on \ndemocrats.rules.house.gov, an excellent Web site.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also want to rise today--this is the last rule that I \nwill have the opportunity to manage in conjunction with our current \nDemocratic staff director, Miles Lackey, who, after 25 years of public \nservice, will be leaving at the end of this week.\n  As a member of the Committee on Rules, I have deeply enjoyed the \nopportunity to work with Mr. Lackey these last several years. Really, \nthere are few who know the institution and its rules as well as Miles \nLackey, and I personally will miss him.\n  Mr. Lackey is a graduate of the University of North Carolina at \nChapel Hill. He joined the House of Representatives staff back in 1987. \nIn addition to his work in the House, he has been chief of staff to two \nUnited States Senators and a senior official in the Clinton White \nHouse. He has contributed to many pieces of landmark legislation over \nthe last three decades.\n  I join my colleagues in wishing him well as he begins his new \nadventure on the staff at the historic Trinity Church, an Episcopal \nparish in New York City.\n  I want to express my profound gratitude, Mr. Speaker, for having had \nthe opportunity to work with somebody of Mr. Lackey's caliber, as I \njoin my colleagues in wishing him well in his future adventures.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also rise in opposition to the rule and the first of \nthe two underlying bills, the Zika Vector Control Act, H.R. 897. It has \nchanged its name. It is now called the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act \nof 2015.\n  What it should be called, perhaps, is the Pesticide Trojan Horse Act, \nwhich would be a more apt name for what this bill actually does, which \nI will talk about in a minute.\n  The second bill that is covered under this rule is the TSCA \nModernization Act, which is the product of years of negotiations. It \ncertainly has both bipartisan support as well as bipartisan opposition.\n  It has problems especially regarding State preemption, which I will \ntalk about, as well as several important attributes that have solved \nissues that have been facing our country with regard to chemical \nregulation for some time.\n  Now, first, with the first bill, we have a bill that, apparently, the \nRepublicans thought they could change the name of and then bring to the \nfloor again. They figured, presumably, that with ``Zika'' in the title \nit would be harder to vote against.\n  In reality, this bill has very little to do with the Zika epidemic. \nIt is really another attack on the Environmental Protection Agency and \nthe Clean Water Act. It is really just a pesticide industry Trojan \nhorse bill.\n  I am very disappointed that we are considering a rule on this bill \nwhen there is a very real threat of Zika on our shores. There are \nalready many Americans who have encountered Zika abroad, been infected, \nand have returned to our country. It is only a matter of time, Mr. \nSpeaker, especially with the changing climate, that Zika will be \nendemic and will be spread in our own country by mosquitoes.\n  I had the opportunity to visit the Centers for Disease Control \nfacility in Fort Collins, Colorado, in my district. In the CDC facility \nin Fort Collins, they conduct all of the vector-borne illness research \nfor the CDC. That is the nexus of vector-borne illness.\n  What does that mean? It means diseases that are spread by ticks and \nmosquitoes and fleas, everything from Lyme disease to Rocky Mountain \nspotted fever, in this case, Zika.\n  The CDC had been tracking Zika for some time. For close to a decade \nthey knew that Zika existed. However, when it spread in South America \nand the link was recently made to birth defects, it jumped to the top \nof their agenda.\n  Unfortunately, they lack the abilities they need and the resources \nthey need to try to find an effective way to eradicate Zika and provide \na vaccination against Zika that would then be made globally available.\n  That is the kind of Zika bill the Democrats would like to bring \nforward. It is the kind of Zika bill that Americans expect from a \npublic health perspective. It is the kind of Zika bill that will save \nlives and prevent a public health catastrophe.\n  I think there is a better way to do business on the floor of the \nHouse of Representatives. It wasn't too long ago that our new Speaker \nwas touting dedication to regular order, but here we are again dealing \nwith secretive, smoky backroom deals with very little time given to \nopen, transparent discussion or amendments.\n  As you can see at democrats.rules.house.gov, there have been a record \nnumber of closed bills in this Congress. Last night in the Committee on \nRules, we had a partisan vote where the Democrats sought to open up \nthis rule for amendments and the majority unanimously--the Republicans \nall sided together--shot down any chances for real discussion. \nUnfortunately, the Republicans are preventing an open discussion of \nideas.\n  They also know the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act--that is the \npesticide bill or the Zika bill, whatever you call it--won't become \nlaw, but they are deciding to bring up yet another partisan attack on \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, somehow saying that actions to \nkeep us safe from harmful pesticides is what has anything to do with \nZika or public health.\n  In fact, the EPA is acting to protect public health by regulating \ntoxic pesticides that not only can hurt humans, but can damage our \nenvironment.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  I am glad to see we are finally having a busy week on the floor of \nthe House. But the fact is one of these bills was already defeated on \nsuspension last week, and we have so much work to do. There are only 24 \ndays of business in the House of Representatives before Congress gets \nsent home for a summer break. It shows me that we can use our time \nbetter. We can pass immigration\n\n[[Page H2977]]\n\nreform, we can address our Nation's infrastructure, we can prevent the \ntax incentives that encourage corporations to offshore jobs, and we can \nreform our broken tax system.\n  There is a lot that we could be doing during these limited 24 days \nbesides passing a Trojan horse for the pesticide industry. We have a \nlist of must-do items before July, as well. Congress has to pass an FAA \nreauthorization. We need to pass comprehensive immigration reform. It \nwon't get any better if Congress doesn't act. We need to address the \nstudent debt crisis and make college more affordable.\n  Mr. Speaker, I--and I believe the American people--would like to see \nall of these things happen before Congress gets another day or week or \n2 months off, as Congress is expected to get in just 24 days.\n  TSCA reform is long overdue. The law is 40 years old. It has never \nreally been updated, frankly, throughout its history. It has failed at \ncontrolling toxic substances, as the title has indicated it was \nsupposed to do.\n  I am glad to see that a bipartisan, bicameral compromise was struck, \nwhich, for the most part, will strengthen the reform in a way that will \nprotect our communities and public health.\n  There is a broad range of support for the bill, from supporters in \nthe environmental community to labor, to the EPA, to industry groups. \nHowever, there are some serious concerns that I think we should take \ninto account, particularly around an issue very near and dear to my \nheart: State preemption.\n  For the last 40 years, the EPA has had their hands tied in trying to \nregulate chemicals, which is why TSCA is considered to be the least \neffective environmental law out there. This bill will make it more \neffective and give it some more teeth. But to get any improvement on \nthis law wouldn't take much raising of the bar, as it was the least \neffective environmental law out there.\n  The current law requires a cost-benefit analysis by the EPA which is \nfar too high a bar to meet when it comes to protecting our children's \nsafety. When we are talking about chemicals, we need to focus on \nhealth. And that is what this bill does. It requires that a minimum \nsafety threshold be met by new chemicals before they are able to enter \nthe marketplace. It makes sense.\n  It specifically focuses on the health of vulnerable populations like \nchildren and pregnant women who are at elevated risk of chemical \nexposure, which the current law does not.\n  Most astonishing about the current law is it actually grandfathered \nin over 60,000 chemicals in 1976. Today they are joined by hundreds of \nthousands of additional chemicals and many household products and \nindustrial uses. This legislation would require safety reviews for all \nchemicals currently in use that people are exposed to.\n  As an example of how ludicrous the current system is, of the 62,000 \nchemicals on store shelves before 1976, the EPA only has studies on a \nfew hundred. That means there are over 61,000 chemicals currently on \nstore shelves that the EPA has not done any study on their \nenvironmental impact or human health impacts.\n  Even more ridiculous, the EPA's attempted ban on asbestos was struck \ndown in 1991, due to the EPA having such a high standard for \nunreasonable risk. Yet we know asbestos has killed 107,000 people. It \ncouldn't be banned under the current law, even when the EPA tried. This \nlaw will make the burden lower and, consequently, our make communities \nsafer by reviewing far more chemicals.\n  I should add that the asbestos issue has largely been dealt with by \nliability and litigation--court cases that have lasted decades. If we \ncould have a regulatory system that prevents unsafe chemicals from \nbeing brought to the market and sold, it will also save hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in legal fees and awards that would ensue if the \nchemicals were brought to market and actually harmed people.\n  So in addition to preventing the harm, these types of safety \nregulations can actually save both plaintiffs and defendants, both \ncompanies and consumers, significant amounts of resources.\n  To review these chemicals, the EPA will need funding. This bill \ncollects a fee for new and existing chemicals, which is important to \nmake the program work. The implementation of this new framework will be \nextremely important for TSCA to work.\n  There are several other positive aspects of the bill, but the other \nsignificant one I want to mention is that it reduces the use of animals \nfor chemical testing, which is why I am proud to say the Humane Society \nhas endorsed the bill.\n  Unfortunately, however, it is not all good news. There are some \nnegative aspects to the bill that I was hoping we would have the \nopportunity to address through amendment, but due to this very closed \nprocess, we have not.\n  There are problems with provisions limiting the States' ability to \nact in an aggressive and proactive manner. There are many States around \nthe country that have or are working to enact strong provisions to \nprotect their residents from exposure to dangerous chemicals.\n  So, again, in the absence of a meaningful Federal system, many States \nhave taken it upon themselves to protect their citizens from harmful \nchemicals.\n  The argument here is, now that the Federal Government does it, we can \nhave some kind of preemption. I personally would like to see the \nability of State governments to go above and beyond the Federal \nregulations without being cumbered by this issue of preemption. Now, it \nis a nuanced preemption. I am going to talk a little about it.\n  There have been some improvements to the State preemption language \nover the last few weeks and compromises written. As drafted, States \nwill not have has much flexibility to protect their residents from \nunsafe chemicals as they do today. And that is absolutely true, and it \nis very unfortunate.\n  This so-called preemption pause period means that States seeking to \nprotect the public from unsafe chemicals may have to wait up to 3 years \nfor the EPA to finish its review. There are also concerns with the \nability of the EPA to regulate imported products.\n  So I believe there was an opportunity to do even more to protect the \nhealth of American people and our environment under this bill.\n  With regard to State preemption standards, the bill can actually take \nus backward by preventing thoughtful health and safety standards at the \nState level. But in other ways, by empowering the Federal Government \nand finally putting teeth in TSCA, it is a good step forward.\n  So I urge Members to balance the important new authority the EPA is \nreceiving with the negative parts of the bill around State law \npreemption. I know this bill will have both bipartisan support and \nopposition.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I sometimes wonder why folks have such a negative \nopinion of Congress. And then sometimes I listen to my colleagues speak \nand I understand why folks back home have a negative opinion of \nCongress--because the folks who serve in this institution seem to have \na negative opinion of Congress.\n  I would say to my friend from Colorado, I am not thrilled about \neverything in TSCA reform either. Generally speaking, when it takes 40 \nyears to get something done; generally speaking, when Democrats ran the \nentire show and they failed to get it done, and when Republicans ran \nthe entire show, they failed to get it done; generally speaking, those \nare really hard things to get done.\n  It takes serious, serious people working serious, serious hours, \nstruggling with serious, serious issues to come to a conclusion. And \ncandidly, Mr. Speaker, if I loved everything in this bill, I would \nwonder why we didn't get it done sooner. The easy things have already \nbeen done. All that is left for us are the hard things. Candidly, we \nhave a good team on the field to do those hard things.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope when we get into the debate on the underlying \nbill, you are not just going to hear from the Republican chairman of \nthe committee about the good work here, but you are going to hear from \nthe Democratic ranking member about the good work done here.\n\n[[Page H2978]]\n\n  I am hoping you are not just going to hear from the Republican \nsubcommittee chairman about the good work here, but that you are going \nto hear from the Democratic ranking member on the subcommittee about \nthe good work here because that is how this bill came before us.\n  Mr. Speaker, there has been a discussion of partisanship. I hold in \nmy hand a report from the Congressional Research Service. That is the \nnonpartisan, academic research arm of the United States Congress. The \ntitle of this report is ``Congressional Efforts to Amend Title I of the \nToxic Substances Control Act,'' the House-and Senate-negotiated bill.\n  I agree with my friend from Colorado. If he and I were to sit down \nhere and be able to write the bills ourselves--not just this one, but \nall of the bills ourselves--we would come up with some really great \nsolutions; oftentimes, different solutions from the ones that are \npresented on the floor.\n  But the reason no amendments are allowed to this bill is because we \nhave been working on it for 40 years because we couldn't agree. We \nalready passed a bill in the House. They already passed a bill in the \nSenate. They were different bills. We had to come together and agree on \nthe same language.\n  Now, to all of my friends who would like to offer their great ideas \nhere at the eleventh hour, I would just tell you there were times \nbefore the eleventh hour that those ideas could have been offered, \nthere were opportunities before the eleventh hour to come together. \nThis is the final language. We don't want amendments to the final \nlanguage.\n  I believe in an open process. I believe in an amendment process. I am \nproud that this is a closed rule on this topic because the amendments \nand the process have gone on in the past. This is the final product \nhere today. That is TSCA, Mr. Speaker.\n  Now, the Zika Vector Control Act. My friend from Colorado, again, \ndescribes smoke-filled backroom deals when he describes this bill.\n  Again, why do folks have such a negative opinion about what we do?\n  One man's smoke-filled backroom deal is another man's 30 years of \ncommon practice. That is right. This is the bill that codifies what the \nEPA has been doing for 30 years. This codifies what the EPA, under \nDemocratic administrations and Republican administrations, has already \nbeen doing.\n  They got sued, Mr. Speaker. Folks sued them and said: Hey, we don't \nthink you are doing it right. We don't think that is what the rules \nallow.\n  So what did the EPA do?\n  The EPA came out with a rulemaking process and said: Just to make it \nclear, this is the way we think we can best protect the public health.\n  They got sued again. And the court said: No, EPA, you can't make \nthose decisions. Yes, you have been doing it for 30 years, but no, you \ncan't make those decisions. Congress needs to make that decision.\n  So what did Congress do?\n  We made that decision, and that bill is before us here today.\n  It is not a smoke-filled backroom deal, Mr. Speaker. It is light-of-\nday, common sense, common practice, trying to align the laws of the \nland with the expectations of our constituencies back home.\n  Absolutely, Mr. Speaker, every day of the week we could show up in \nthis institution and we could run out somebody about something that is \nnot going the way it is supposed to go. But together, we are succeeding \ntoday where previous Republicans and previous Democrats have failed. \nTogether, we are succeeding today where previous Congresses found it \ntoo hard. Together, we are about the business that our constituents \nsent us here to do.\n  This is not a day to denigrate the institution, Mr. Speaker. This is \na day to celebrate those things that we are able to do when we come \ntogether in the best traditions of the United States House.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Georgia's remarks have very little to \ndo with anybody who is denigrating the institution. I think he \nprofoundly misunderstands the reason that the American people think \nthat Congress isn't doing its job.\n  Let's talk about what Congress is doing. Today it is great. We are \nworking. We are debating. We will probably be here until midnight.\n  Well, guess what?\n  After 3 more days of work, on Thursday, Congress will actually go on \nan 11-day vacation. It is working until Thursday, and then an 11-day \nvacation. We then come back in June, and I think Congress works for 12 \ndays. Of course, in July, I think Congress works an amazing 8 or 9 days \nout of the entire month. August, zero days.\n  So what the American people expect is for us to be here hammering \naway at these issues 5 days a week, 6 days a week, and, if necessary, 7 \ndays a week. That is the kind of work ethic that I brought to the \ncompanies that I worked for. When I was starting companies, I was \nworking hard. Whether it was 5 days a week or 6 days a week, we worked \nas long as we needed to to get the job done. And that is the opposite \nof the work ethic of this Congress, because there are enormous tasks \nthat this Congress is not doing.\n  This Congress hasn't worked at all towards balancing the budget. \nThere are deficits of close to half a trillion dollars, thanks to the \nRepublican tax-and-spend Congress. This Congress hasn't done a thing to \nfix our broken immigration system. Not a thing. It hasn't passed a \nsingle immigration bill in the entire Congress.\n  Let's stay here rather than go on vacation for 11 days. Let's make \ncollege more affordable for American families. Let's reduce the \ndeficit. Let's fix our broken immigration system and secure our \nborders.\n  Those are the kinds of things I would be proud of as a Member of a \nCongress. I would be proud to be here 5 days a week working hard on \nthose issues. I would be proud to compromise and work with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to create a work product that the \nAmerican people would be confident with and, of course, would increase \nthe confidence of the American people in this institution and both the \nRepublicans and Democrats who have the honor to serve in it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGene Green).\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my Colorado colleague \non the Rules Committee for allowing me to speak.\n  I rise to oppose this rule but in support of the amendment to H.R. \n2576, the TSCA Modernization Act.\n  This bipartisan, bicameral legislation will reform our Nation's \nbroken chemical safety law for the first time since 1976 and directly \naddresses the Toxic Substance Chemical Act's fundamental flaws.\n  Congress has worked on reforming TSCA for over a decade, and, as a \nmember of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I have personally been \nworking on fixing the statute since 2008.\n  Though not perfect, the proposal before the House today is, in the \nwords of President Obama's administration, ``a clear improvement over \ncurrent TSCA and represents a historic advancement for chemical safety \nand environmental law.''\n  The most notable improvements in the bill are replacing the current \nTSCA's burdensome safety standard with a pure, health-based standard--\nthat makes sense--explicitly requiring the protection of vulnerable \npopulations like children, pregnant women, and workers at chemical \nfacilities like the district I represent; requiring a safety finding \nbefore new chemicals are allowed to go onto the market; giving EPA new \nauthority to order testing and ensure chemicals are safe, with a focus \non the most risky chemicals.\n  This legislation responds to the concerns of industry to provide \nregulatory certainty for the job creators throughout our economy.\n  This legislation is a win for our congressional district in Eastside \nHouston and Harris County, home to one of the largest collection of \nchemical facilities in our country.\n  The reforms contained in this proposal have protections for the \nworkers at our chemical plants, the fence line communities next to \nthese plants, and benefit chemical manufacturers who will have \ncertainty in a true, nationwide market.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in \nsupporting this\n\n[[Page H2979]]\n\namendment and help pass the first major environmental legislation in a \nquarter of a century.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a little bit about the worst of these two \nbills that we are considering under this rule, a bill that has very \nlittle or even perhaps no Democratic support, a bill that nearly 150 \nhealth, environmental, and fishing groups have made their opposition \nto. That is the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act.\n  It came up last week and failed. They had rebranded it last week as \nthe Zika Vector Control Act. Now they are removing the pretense that \nsomehow this deals with Zika and are just renaming it the Reducing \nRegulatory Burdens Act. This is the insecticide Trojan horse bill.\n  This is really a changing game where it is the same bill week after \nweek. It failed last week, and they are bringing it back under a \ndifferent procedure this week.\n  Last week, apparently, they tried to use the threat that the Zika \nvirus has posed to attack a very important law that actually protects \nour health and the health of our environment.\n  Now, of course, vector control, mosquito control, tick control, et \ncetera, is a very important part of managing any health crisis. But \nthis bill really isn't about that. It is a thinly veiled ploy to \nundermine the Clean Water Act.\n  Certain pesticides are considered by the EPA to be pollutants because \nthey are. They kill fish. They kill birds. They hurt people.\n  This bill would eliminate the regulatory step of requiring a permit \nto use these dangerous pesticides near water, effectively undercutting \nour primary means of protecting our water system.\n  Once again, if you want to use a pesticide that is considered by the \nEPA to be a pollutant near a water source--a river or a lake--you have \nto apply for a special permit. As part of that procedure, you talk \nabout what precautions are made to make sure that it doesn't \ncontaminate the water supply.\n  Under this bill, were it to become law, you would no longer have to \nreceive a permit and it endangers the water supply.\n  Coming from the great State of Colorado, we always like to say that \nwater is for fighting over. We value our precious water resources for \nagriculture, for our residents, and for our environment.\n  Anything that risks contaminating it is absolutely detrimental to our \ninterests as a State. That is why so many sportsmen and fishermen have \nalso come out against this bill. Zika is the enemy, not the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. We have our priorities all mixed up.\n  The Centers for Disease Control is not asking for this bill. The \nentity charged with battling Zika is not. This is just a backdoor \nattack on the EPA. Public health experts are not asking for this bill.\n  This bill removes the EPA's ability to regulate pesticide application \nthat is intended to protect water supply when pesticides can, in fact, \nbe one of the worst threats to a community's water, especially for \nvulnerable mothers and newborns.\n  Instead of wasting our time with red herrings like this bill, we \nshould be talking about how we can support the world-class research and \ndoctors we have and need to tackle the threat that Zika poses.\n  So far, Zika has been found in 30 countries throughout the Western \nHemisphere. As we head into the summer months, the number of Zika cases \nwill only increase.\n  Evidence has indicated Zika is linked to microcephaly, which causes a \nbaby's head to develop smaller than normal, which is going to have \ndevastating implications for potentially an entire generation in \ncountries that have been hit hardest by Zika. And, of course, we fear \nwhen it reaches our shores.\n  There are already cases in the U.S. The CDC is monitoring almost 300 \npregnant women for cases of microcephaly. We need to prepare for the \neventuality that, unless we act, which this bill does not do, there \nwill be more people infected with Zika.\n  We need to work quickly and aggressively to mitigate the lasting \neffect. The President has a proposal to do that. The President has \nrequested $1.9 billion to address Zika.\n  I am offering an amendment to bring up legislation that would provide \nthis funding if we defeat the previous question.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up legislation that fully funds the \nadministration's effort to mount a robust response to the growing Zika \ncrisis instead of just paying lip service to this public health \nepidemic through cleverly named bills that keep changing their names \nand very short-term funding commitments.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I hope that we defeat the previous question. \nThat will allow the President's proposal to actually defeat Zika to \ncome forward for a vote.\n  This month I had the opportunity to visit the Division of Vector-\nBorne Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control in Fort Collins. Now, \nthe Division of Vector-Borne Diseases is an HHS-funded laboratory that \nstudies vector-borne diseases, including Zika.\n  They are an important part of the fight against Zika. We should be \nsupporting their efforts, not wasting precious floor time on a bill \nthat literally endangers our waters, our environment, and our health. \nAdequate preparation for and, ultimately, a vaccination for Zika will \nsave lives.\n  The House needs to act. We need to defeat this previous question. \nThat is why we should be voting on comprehensive Zika legislation, not \nlegislation that is a Trojan horse for the insecticide industry that \nundermines clean water and the health of our children.\n  Whether it is the impact on the water ecosystem or the fact that \nwater treatment plants spend millions of dollars to clean up surface \nwater from pesticides, Congress has an obligation to fight to keep our \nwaters clean so that pregnant women, children, and all Americans can be \nhealthy.\n  That is why we need to vote this bill down. That is why we need to \ndefeat the previous question, to actually bring up a real Zika bill to \naddress this public health crisis before more families are affected.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the \nprevious question and vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, before I go through all of the things the gentleman from \nColorado got wrong, I want to talk about what he got absolutely right, \nwhich is that this institution is going to miss Miles Lackey when he \nleaves at the end of this week.\n  We are going to have more time to talk about Miles' contribution \nhere. But folks like Mr. Lackey we don't need here on the easy days. We \nneed them here on the hard days. We don't need them here to get the \nlittle things done. We need them here to get the mammoth things done.\n  We have a lot of mammoth things left on the calendar, and it is going \nto be harder to make those happen in your absence, Mr. Lackey. It has \nbeen a great, great joy serving with you these 5\\1/2\\ years, and I \nappreciate your commitment to this institution.\n  We are what we are here, Mr. Speaker, because of the commitment of \nindividual Members, individual staffers, individual constituents back \nhome, who will not allow us to fail. The two bills that we have before \nus today are examples of exactly that.\n  It is hard to cut through the rhetoric sometimes, Mr. Speaker. If we \nwent up to the gallery right now, Mr. Speaker, and polled folks about \nwhether or not this Zika Vector Control Act had failed on the floor of \nthe House, whether we had brought this to the floor and it had failed, \nI suspect everybody up there would say: Absolutely it failed. I have \nbeen hearing about it all morning.\n  The truth is, Mr. Speaker, because it is Washington, D.C., and \nsometimes the rules don't work here like they do elsewhere, the \ndefinition of failure in this House means that it got 262 votes\n\n[[Page H2980]]\n\n``yes'' and 159 votes ``no.'' Let's make that clear.\n  The bill that we are voting on today that is, apparently, the \ncontroversial of the two, is the one that last week when we voted on it \ngot 262 bipartisan ``yes'' votes and 159 solely partisan ``no'' votes.\n  Now, why is that true, Mr. Speaker? Why can a bill get 262 votes, a \nclear majority of this institution, and not pass? Well, because it was \non the suspension calendar, that calendar used for completely \nnoncontroversial bills to try to move things to conclusion faster.\n  Why is this a completely noncontroversial bill, Mr. Speaker? Because \nthis has been the practice of the land for three decades, because this \nhas been the EPA's intention for three decades, because this has been \nthe EPA's goal through its rulemaking process.\n  But courts being what courts are, EPA couldn't get the finality on \nwhat it wanted to do by itself, so it needs Congress' approval.\n  I am in favor of that, Mr. Speaker. I celebrate that. Thank goodness \nwe finally found an Agency downtown in this one very isolated \ncircumstance that doesn't think it can just do whatever it wants to do \nwithout Congress' approval.\n  I am glad we have come together today to give it that approval--262 \n``yes'' votes, bipartisan; 159 ``no'' votes, partisan--to codify what \nhas been the practice of the land in the name of safety, in the name of \nclean water, in the name of trying to do the very best we can for our \nconstituents back home.\n  I am proud that this bill is a part of this rule today, and I hope \nthe House will move it quickly forward.\n  The second bill that we are talking about, Mr. Speaker, is the TSCA \nbill, the Toxic Substances Control Act. TSCA is what folks call it in \nthe industry.\n  Not a single amendment is being allowed today, Mr. Speaker. Why? \nBecause we have already done the amending, because we have already done \nthe negotiating, because we have already done the heavy lifting that \nwas required to do what no Congress and no White House has been able to \ndo since 1976, the heavy lifting that was started 10 years ago and \nfolks could not get it across the finish line.\n  We have a group of men and women here today, Mr. Speaker, of House \nMembers and Senate Members today, of Republicans and Democrats today, \nwho wouldn't take ``no'' for an answer.\n  It is outrageous that we would regulate chemical safety in 2016 in \nthe exact same way we contemplated it in 1976. It is outrageous, but it \nis hard. It is hard to bring people together.\n  It is easy to tear people apart, Mr. Speaker. I can come down here. I \ncan lay down the fire and brimstone. We can tear folks apart. That is \neasy.\n  We have all been on those home improvement projects, Mr. Speaker. It \nis tearing out the drywall that is fun. Putting it back up is hard.\n  Today we are in the construction business. We are in the building \nbusiness. We are in the bringing people together and making possible \nwhat folks thought was impossible.\n  My friend from Colorado is right, Mr. Speaker. Every day is not the \nsame here in the U.S. House of Representatives. Some days are better \nthan others. This is a good day.\n  This is a good day not because there is something special about this \nparticular day of the week, Mr. Speaker, but because it is the \nculmination of days, weeks, months, and years of folks fighting hard \nfor what they believed in, folks fighting hard for what their \nconstituents sent them here to do, folks fighting hard for what they \nthought was right and finding a way to come together and making a \ndifference for the American people.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I hold here in my hand a Statement of Administration \nPolicy, the President urging Congress to move this bicameral, \nbipartisan compromise to his desk for his signature.\n  This isn't a day about show; this isn't a day about politics; this \nisn't a day about a November election. This is a day about making a \ndifference for the folks who sent us here. With the passage of this \nrule and the passage of this bill, we will do together what others \nfound too hard to accomplish.\n  I am proud of that, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 742, the special order of business \ngoverning consideration of H.R. 897, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens \nAct of 2015, included a prophylactic waiver of points of order against \nits consideration, and it was described as such in House Report 114-\n590. The waiver of all points of order now includes a waiver of clause \n9 of rule XXI which requires the chair of each committee of initial \nreferral to disclose a list of congressional earmarks, limited tax \nbenefits, or limited tariff benefits to be printed in the Congressional \nRecord prior to its consideration. However, it is important to note \nthat one of the two committees of initial referral submitted the \nrequired statement and the second committee is expected to submit the \nrequired statement prior to the bill's consideration.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n      An Amendment to H. Res. 742 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     5044) making supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2016 \n     to respond to Zika virus. The first reading of the bill shall \n     be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration \n     of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to \n     the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among \n     and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of \n     the Committee on Appropriations and the chair and ranking \n     minority member of the Committee on the Budget. After general \n     debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the \n     five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in \n     the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of \n     the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report \n     the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been \n     adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without \n     intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or \n     without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and \n     reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then \n     on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately \n     after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of \n     rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 5044.\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee\n\n[[Page H2981]]\n\n     on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hardy). The question is on ordering the \nprevious question.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2981-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 2016.\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I \ncall up House Resolution 743 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 743\n\n       Resolved, That (a) at any time after adoption of this \n     resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule \n     XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the \n     Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of \n     the bill (H.R. 5055) making appropriations for energy and \n     water development and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield \nthe customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. \nSlaughter), a good friend of mine from the Rules Committee, pending \nwhich I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration \nof this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Washington?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported a rule, House Resolution 743, providing for consideration of \nan important piece of legislation, H.R. 5055, the fiscal year 2017 \nEnergy and Water Development Appropriations bill. The rule provides for \nthe consideration of H.R. 5055 under a modified open rule, allowing for \nconsideration of all amendments that are germane to the bill and \nconform to House rules.\n  Mr. Speaker, the fiscal year 2017 Energy and Water Development bill \nappropriates annual funding for national defense nuclear weapons \nactivities, the Army Corps of Engineers, various programs under DOE, \nand other related agencies.\n  Over the past few years, we have seen increasing threats to our \nnational security, historic droughts in many regions of the United \nStates, the importance of water, and the need for greater energy \nsecurity and independence. This legislation addresses all of these \nissues, as well as many others, and invests in efforts to promote a \nmore secure and prosperous future for our Nation.\n  With ever-changing global security threats from Russia and Iran to \nterrorist groups like ISIL and al Qaeda, national security continues--\nas well it should--to be a top concern for many Americans. Now it is \nmore vital than ever that the U.S. maintain our nuclear security \npreparedness, and this legislation takes important steps to ensure our \nnuclear weapons stockpile is modern, secure, stable, and available. It \nprovides a total of $12.9 billion for DOE's nuclear weapons security \nprograms. That is a $327 million increase above the 2016 level. And \nthis funding will uphold the Nation's nuclear deterrence posture, \nmaintain the safety and the readiness of our weapons stockpile, and \nallow the U.S. to meet any nuclear threat.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5055 also addresses the need for reliable water \nresources. As we have seen from the severe droughts that have impacted \nmany Western States, accessibility to safe and adequate water resources \nis critical to our local communities. In my home State of Washington, \nwe have seen historic droughts over the past few years, with serious \nwater supply shortages that have impacted the agriculture, energy, and \nmanufacturing sectors as well as many families and small businesses \nthat rely on an adequate and stable supply of water.\n  Additionally, Washington and much of the Western United States have \nexperienced catastrophic wildfire seasons over the last 2 years, with \nWashington enduring back-to-back years of record-setting fires which \nhave been fueled by a lack of rainfall and extremely arid conditions. \nThis legislation contains funds for the Department of the Interior and \nthe Bureau of Reclamation to help manage, develop, and protect the \nwater resources of Western States. Further, the measure includes \nseveral new provisions to help Western communities by providing relief \nfrom the onerous and excessive Federal regulations that have \nexacerbated this situation.\n  Energy independence is paramount to the future of our country, and \nthe fiscal year 2017 Energy and Water Development bill invests in an \nall-of-the-above energy strategy in order to promote a more secure and \nprosperous future for our Nation. Under the legislation, funding is \nallocated for DOE energy programs, and the bill prioritizes\n\n[[Page H2982]]\n\nand increases funding for the programs that encourage U.S. economic \ncompetitiveness and help advance the goal of greater domestic energy \nproduction and security.\n  This bill provides funds for research and development to advance \ncoal, natural gas, oil, and other fossil energy technologies which will \nhelp the U.S. make better use of our rich national energy resources and \nhelp keep energy costs low. Additionally, nuclear energy research, \ndevelopment, and demonstration activities are increased.\n  Mr. Speaker, while this bill includes funding for many activities \nthat are critical to our country's future, it also appropriates funds \nto address an important issue from our past, and that is the cleanup of \nour country's defense nuclear sites that supported our previous nuclear \nweapons production. These sites played a critical part in our country's \nability to win World War II as well as the cold war by producing the \nbasic and complex materials used in the fabrication of nuclear weapons.\n  It just happens that the largest of these sites is the Hanford \nNuclear Reservation, which is located in my central Washington State \ndistrict. It produced plutonium for nuclear weapons development both \nduring and after World War II. There are many similar sites across the \ncountry where the Federal Government has a moral and a legal obligation \nto clean up the remaining contaminated facilities and hazardous nuclear \nwaste.\n  A key component of our defense environmental cleanup efforts is the \navailability of a viable nuclear repository where this waste can be \nstored. As you know, Mr. Speaker, Yucca Mountain is the country's only \nlegal and permanent nuclear repository, though for years there have \nbeen efforts to kill the use of this site, efforts that would hinder \ndefense nuclear cleanup for decades and would waste the Federal \nGovernment's $15 billion investment in this repository. This \nlegislation continues congressional efforts to support Yucca Mountain \nby providing funding for the nuclear waste disposal program and funds \nfor the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to continue the adjudication of \nDOE's Yucca Mountain license application. Additionally, the bill denies \nthe administration's funding proposals for non-Yucca nuclear waste \nactivities.\n  Another component of this measure is strong support for our national \nlaboratories, such as the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory located \nin Washington's Fourth Congressional District. These labs perform \ncritical research on cybersecurity, develop high-performance computing \nsystems, and advance the next generation of energy sources which lay \nthe groundwork for a more secure energy future, helping to reduce the \nNation's dependence on foreign energy and ensuring continued economic \ngrowth.\n  Finally, H.R. 5055 includes many conservative policy priorities that \nare critical to combating the administration's efforts to undermine \neconomic growth through excessive and burdensome regulations. The bill \neffectively prohibits the EPA and the Corps from implementing the \nwaters of the United States rule and any changes to Federal \njurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. It also restricts the \napplication of the Clean Water Act in certain agricultural areas. There \nis also language prohibiting the administration from changing the \ndefinition of ``fill material'' and ``discharge fill material.'' From \nthe beginning, the WOTUS rule has been an unprecedented Federal power \ngrab that expands Federal regulation over ponds, over streams, and over \nirrigation ditches in the middle of cropland, giving the EPA \nunprecedented say over what farmers can or cannot do with their land. \nThis bill takes the important step of prohibiting funding for the \nimplementation of this deeply misguided rule which would have \ndevastating economic consequences for farmers, for ranchers, for small \nbusinesses, and for communities across our country.\n  Additionally, the legislation protects Americans' constitutional \nSecond Amendment rights by including language that allows law-abiding \nAmericans to possess firearms on Army Corps of Engineers public lands. \nIn places in my district, these public lands are used heavily by the \ncommunity.\n  The bill includes language that I offered along with Congressman \nGosar of Arizona to prevent the removal of any Federal dams, protecting \nthe critical flood control and the hydropower benefits provided by \nthese facilities. Hydropower is a key resource throughout the West, and \nwe must prevent misguided attempts to shut down these dams.\n  Finally, it continues a restriction from fiscal year 2016 to prevent \nany funds from being used to start or enter into any new nuclear \nnonproliferation contracts or agreements with Russia.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good rule that provides for the consideration \nof H.R. 5055, the fiscal year 2017 Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations Act.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  This is a responsible measure that supports the U.S. national \nsecurity, safety, and economic competitiveness; advances an all-of-the-\nabove energy strategy; and makes strategic investments in \ninfrastructure and water resources projects--balancing these critical \npriorities while still maintaining tight budget caps. These efforts \nwill help promote a more secure and prosperous future for our Nation, \nwhich is why I urge all of my colleagues to support the rule and \nsupport the underlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank my colleague from Washington for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, every year, the House comes together to allocate funds \nfor programs across the country. From keeping our waters clean to \nmanaging our nuclear arsenal, they all need funding.\n  Under H.R. 5055, the Energy and Water Development and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act, some programs see shortfalls and others \nwindfalls. Balancing these competing priorities is a herculean effort, \nand I want to commend Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur \nbecause they have worked so much in tandem to help bring good bills to \nthe floor.\n  First, the bill provides robust funding for the Army Corps of \nEngineers, and includes strong funding for the Harbor Maintenance Trust \nFund, which keeps our Nation's ports and harbors dredged, maintained, \nand operational. As the cochair of the Great Lakes Task Force, I know \nthe Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund is an essential component to keeping \nlocal economies on the shores of the Great Lakes thriving. We owe a \ngreat deal to the Great Lakes. We are, along with Canada, the \nprotectors of 20 percent of the fresh water on the planet, providing \ndrinking water for both Canadians and United States citizens. We owe it \nto the great thing that we have inherited there, called the Great \nLakes, to protect them.\n  Also included in the bill is increased funding for much-needed \nnuclear cleanup. The bill provides funding to clear contamination from \npast nuclear weapons research and production activities, creating \nusable land and adding to the safety and well-being of our communities.\n  However, I do remain concerned about the funding levels for our \nNation's scientific research. We should be meeting the President's \nrequests, and even adding to them for research funding. The agencies \nthat are covered by this bill are not adequate to really meet the needs \nof our Nation's scientific research and help us to make up for lost \nground and reclaim our global leadership, not pulling on the reins.\n  One of those programs funded is in my hometown of Rochester, New \nYork. We are a photonics hub, Mr. Speaker--one of the best in the \nworld--and we have recently been named an innovative manufacturing \nfacility in Rochester. Let me tell you what kind of excellent research \nthat we are doing up there and what great things we are already capable \nof doing.\n  About 12 engineers, who had previously worked at Eastman Kodak on 35-\nyear-old repurposed Kodak equipment, made the components of the night \nvision goggles that took down Osama bin Laden. That same small company \nwith 250 employees also made the laser beams that the Navy SEALs used \nto take down the Somali pirates holding Captain Phillips. That was on \n35-year-old equipment. Imagine what they could do if we were able to \nhelp them get new machines. Rochester is also famous with Eastman Kodak \nbecause the Norden bombsight was made\n\n[[Page H2983]]\n\nthere, which was a great contributor into the winning of World War II.\n  It is awfully important that we recognize what has happened there now \nand make sure that we can keep it going. In many cases it is falling \napart, and we need much more help for it.\n  I am grateful for the money for the laser lab because it not only is \nmoving research along, but it is responsible for checking on the \nsupplies that we have of nuclear weapons to make sure that they are in \ngood condition without having to do live testing.\n  There are bright spots in the bill, but there are some harmful policy \nriders that stand in the way of strong investments.\n  These policy riders include one that would prevent the Army Corps of \nEngineers from clarifying which waters are protected by the Clean Water \nAct by locking in a widely acknowledged state of confusion about the \nscope of the law's pollution control programs. While it sounds nice to \nlet everybody just do all of the runoffs that they want into the Great \nLakes, the algae pollution problem caused by runoff of pesticide \ncontrol and other things that are in the water have caused us a great \ndeal of pain up there. That is not a very good idea either in \nstewardship or for our future. But the runoff of pesticides and other \nthings that they do certainly needs more attention than we are getting. \nI think in this bill we are going in the wrong direction on that.\n  Another rider would prevent the Corps from using funds to regulate \nindustry waste, locking in loopholes for polluters, and leaving many of \nthe waterways vulnerable to harmful pollution. We know better than \nthat, too. We know that it is not smart. Remember, many of those are \nthe water that we drink.\n  Also, I know that my colleague mentioned the one that he liked, the \nhighly partisan and controversial rider that would allow guns to be \ncarried on all Corps of Engineers land. Given the number of Americans \nkilling each other on a daily basis with guns--and one week about 2 \nweeks ago, four toddlers, who got ahold of guns that were unsecured, \nkilling themselves--more guns on more lands is not my idea of the way \nthat we should be looking at it. I am very much concerned that we don't \nwant to live in a country--that I think we are becoming--where people \ncan leave home to go to work, or to the theater, or to school, and you \ndon't have the assurance, as we all grew up with, that you are going to \nbe safely coming back home. Guns are a descendant of pioneers. The idea \nof having everybody have a gun--there are 330 million Americans and 320 \nmillion guns--that seems to me to be a pretty one-sided equation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to agree with the \ngentlewoman from New York. I certainly, too, appreciate the bipartisan \neffort that was put into this bill on the part of both Chairman Simpson \nas well as Ranking Member Kaptur. They did an excellent job, which is \nillustrated in both the committee and the subcommittee. This \nlegislation passed on a voice vote. That is a demonstration of great \nbipartisan support, and certainly speaks well to this committee doing \nexcellent work together.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nCarter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman \nNewhouse and the Rules Committee, as well as Chairman Simpson and the \nEnergy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee, for their leadership and progress made on this year's \nEnergy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations bill.\n  H.R. 5055, the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, is a step forward in updating our Nation's \nwaterborne infrastructure and energy needs.\n  The First District of Georgia is home to a unique set of resources, \nwith two large ports, various wetlands and islands, and the State's \nentire coastline. Whether it is the Savannah Harbor Expansion Program, \nthe growth of the Port of Brunswick, or the unique characteristics \ninvolved with wetlands permitting, the Energy and Water Appropriations \nbill has a significant impact on the citizens of the First \nCongressional District of Georgia.\n\n  The Port of Savannah is the second busiest East Coast port, and is \nrapidly expanding, growing at a substantial rate year after year. The \nPort of Brunswick is the third busiest roll-on/roll-off cargo port in \nthe country. These ports are the economic engines of Georgia and for \nthe Southeast, reaching as far as the Midwest in cargo imported and \nexported out of their facilities.\n  H.R. 5055 is vital to ensuring that projects like the Savannah Harbor \nExpansion Project continue on time so our Nation's economy continues to \ngrow.\n  I would like to thank the gentleman, the Rules Committee, and the \nEnergy and Water Development and Related Agencies Subcommittee for \ntheir continued devotion to this cause.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNevada (Ms. Titus).\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I am here to discuss provisions in the \nunderlying bill that relate to the State of Nevada--provisions that are \nidentical to language in last year's bill to try and restart the failed \nYucca Mountain nuclear waste dump just outside my Congressional \nDistrict.\n  First, with all due respect, let me correct my friend across the \naisle. Yucca Mountain is not a defense repository. It is a commercial \nnuclear power plant repository. Let's be clear about that.\n  Second, a recent Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement by the \nNRC confirmed what we in Nevada have known for decades: Yucca Mountain \nis not a secure repository that would seal dangerous waste safely for a \nmillion years. It is, instead, a proposal based on bad science and \nfaulty assumptions.\n  Specifically, the NRC confirmed that the site is not secure, that it \nwill leak, and that radiation will travel for miles through underground \nwater sources to farming communities in the Amargosa Valley on its way \nto Death Valley National Park.\n  But before the radioactive material can leak out of the ground, it \nfirst has to be shipped, using untested procedures by truck and by rail \nthrough nearly every State and every Congressional District in the \nlower 48. These shipments will occur for decades, passing homes and \nschools, parks and hospitals, churches and farms. They will pass \nthrough the heart of my Congressional District, along the famed Las \nVegas strip where 42 million people come every year to work and play.\n  We need to stop the Yucca Mountain boondoggle once and for all, and \nturn, instead, to recommendations from the Blue Ribbon Commission on \nNuclear Waste, including my legislation, the Nuclear Waste Informed \nConsent Act.\n  Congress must either accept this reality and work towards actual \nsolutions, or we can continue this charade every appropriations season, \nwhereby language to fund Yucca shows up in bills so politicians can \ncontinue to collect checks from the nuclear energy industry.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I do want to thank the gentlewoman from New York for her comments as \nthey relate to the moral and legal obligation of the Federal Government \nto continue the nuclear waste cleanup that we have all over this \ncountry.\n  And then the gentlewoman from Nevada certainly has voiced some \nconcerns that we have heard before that are important to the people in \nthe State of Nevada.\n  Let me just remind everyone that we are under a modified open rule. \nIf there are changes to this bill, every Member in this body has an \nopportunity to provide amendments to this bill. Under a modified open \nrule, everything is on the table. If that is something that she can get \nthe support of the majority of the people on this floor, then that is \ncertainly something that she can take out of this bill.\n  But I have another opinion, another viewpoint. I have been to Yucca \nMountain. I don't know that there is a perfect place in the universe to \nstore nuclear waste, but Yucca Mountain, to me, seems to be about as \nclose to perfect as you can find. In that mountain, we have 1,000 feet \nof rock above where the waste would be stored, and you have 1,000 feet \nof rock below where that storage situation would be. And I\n\n[[Page H2984]]\n\nshould remind the body that Yucca Mountain is the country's only legal \nand permanent nuclear repository. It is for both commercial as well as \ndefense waste, and it is a critical component of our efforts to clean \nup the defense nuclear waste created during and after World War II.\n  While I appreciate the gentlewoman's differing opinion, she does have \nthe opportunity to offer amendments, and I would encourage her to do \nthat.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I \nwill offer an amendment to the rule to bring up comprehensive \nlegislation that provides the resources needed to help the families in \nthe city of Flint, Michigan, recover from the water crisis.\n  The Families of Flint Act, authored by Mr. Kildee, would provide for \nlong-term investments in infrastructure and care for children affected \nby the crisis.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Kildee) to discuss our proposal.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for offering this \namendment and for yielding to me.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so we \ncan immediately bring up H.R. 4479, which, as described, is the \nFamilies of Flint Act.\n  We all know this story. Many Members have heard me talk about it here \non the floor of the House before. But in short, the city of Flint had \nbeen a struggling community already because of the loss of jobs.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Then the State of Michigan just a few years ago cut one of the three \nessential elements to keep that city running--State revenue sharing--\nwhich threw the city into a financial crisis. The State's response: \nappoint a financial manager, an emergency manager, to take over the \ncity government, to suspend democracy, and, essentially, to act in \ndictatorial form.\n  One of the decisions that that emergency manager made was to move the \ncity from using Great Lakes water as its primary drinking water source \nto using the Flint River--a highly corrosive river--just to save money, \nand they did save money. The corrosion from that water, untreated, \ncaused lead to leach into the pipes in Flint and into the homes of \n100,000 people.\n  There are consequences to that decision. The lives of children--the \nlives of people in Flint--are permanently affected by that. There are \n9,000 children under the age of 6 who could potentially bear scars of \nthis poisoning for the rest of their lives and have their development \naffected.\n  Lead is a neurotoxin. It affects brain development, and its impact is \npermanent. But, with help, people can overcome the effects of this kind \nof lead exposure.\n  The failure by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and \nthe terrible mistakes made by the emergency manager cannot be undone. \nThe effect can't be changed.\n  What we can do is make it right for the people of Flint. We can \nprevent another exposure. The Kildee-Upton bill, which I worked on with \nmy friend from across the aisle, Mr. Upton, would do that.\n  Just preventing the next Flint isn't enough. We have to make it right \nfor the people of Flint and provide them justice.\n  The Families of Flint Act would do that. It would provide immediate \nrelief in making sure that they have clean drinking water. It would \nprovide support to get rid of those lead service lines and improve the \nwater distribution system so that this does not happen again.\n  Importantly, the Families of Flint Act would also provide ongoing \nsupport for those families in Flint and give them the kind of health \ncare they need to overcome the effect of lead exposure in the \nmonitoring of their health.\n  Especially, it would provide for kids, who should have every \nopportunity to overcome the effect of lead exposure, by basically \nproviding to those 9,000 children the same thing that any of us would \ndo for our own children if they had a developmental hurdle to \novercome--providing the kind of behavioral support and the kind of \nenrichment opportunities that many of these kids, because they are born \ninto poverty in Flint, don't have access to. This would provide that \nfor them to make sure that they have a chance to overcome this terrible \ncrisis.\n  Justice for the people of Flint will come in many forms. Some people \nhave resigned. Some have been fired. Some have been criminally charged. \nNone of that does any good for the people of my hometown unless we also \ndo what we can to restore to them the opportunity that the kids in \nFlint and that the families in Flint--like any other American--expect \nto have for their kids.\n  Justice comes in lots of forms. Our job in Congress is to make sure \nwe seek justice for the people in our country. When one community, one \ngroup of folks, is struggling, facing a disaster, facing the biggest \nchallenge that the community has ever faced, it is our duty, our job, \nour responsibility, to come together to help them.\n  The Families of Flint Act would do that by providing Federal help \nthat would be required to have State support equal to what the Federal \nGovernment provides. Basically, rather than litigating who is at fault, \nwe would fix the problem and realize that the people who live in Flint \nhave a right to have their Federal Government step up for them.\n  Even if it were primarily the State's responsibility for what took \nplace, they are citizens of the United States just like they are \ncitizens of Michigan. When they face the greatest crisis that they have \never had, they have every right to expect that Congress itself would \nact to provide for them the relief to get through this disaster.\n  We have done it in other cases. There are times when we all come \ntogether as Americans. This is one of those times. Congress must act. \nCongress should do its job. By defeating the previous question, we can \nbring up the Families of Flint Act and do that.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I would just inquire of the gentlewoman \nfrom New York if she has any further speakers.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and \nI am prepared to close.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  We have today an opportunity to fund groundbreaking, cutting-edge \nresearch all across the country, to protect our precious environment, \nand to support the Army Corps of Engineers. Yet the addition of several \nharmful, dangerous policy riders will inhibit those goals and have no \nplace in the appropriations process.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the \nprevious question and to vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the good gentlewoman from New York.\n  Mr. Speaker, the rule we have considered provides for the \nconsideration of a very important piece of legislation that will \nprotect our country from security threats; that will ensure we have a \nmodern, safe, and reliable U.S. nuclear weapons program; that will \npromote an all-of-the-above energy strategy; and that will make \ncritical investments in water resources and infrastructure projects. \nThe funds appropriated for national security needs, improvements in our \nNation's infrastructure, domestic energy development, and growing our \neconomy will benefit all Americans.\n  This bill is a responsible measure that supports U.S. national \nsecurity, energy research, water resource development, and economic \ncompetitiveness, balancing these critical priorities while maintaining \ntight budget caps.\n  In the current fiscal climate, where our national debt is approaching \na staggering $20 trillion, many difficult decisions had to be made by \nthe committee in drafting this measure, and I believe we have a bill \nthat preserves fiscal responsibility, advances sound\n\n[[Page H2985]]\n\nconservative and progrowth economic policies, and prioritizes funding \nfor our country's most pressing needs.\n  The past few years have seen the U.S. face growing security threats \nabroad, highlighting the need to keep our country at the pinnacle of \nnuclear security preparedness as well as the importance of investing in \ndomestic energy production that takes much-needed steps towards energy \nindependence.\n  In the Western United States, Americans have endured severe droughts \nand catastrophic wildfires, which have drastically restricted the \navailability of water and have devastated ground infrastructure. This \nlegislation addresses these issues as well as many others, and it \ninvests in efforts to promote a more secure and prosperous future for \nour Nation.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the 2017 Energy and Water Development and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act also includes much-needed conservative \nreforms and policies to counter the administration's issuance of one \ncrippling regulation after another, hindering our domestic energy \ndevelopment and security and undermining overall economic growth.\n  H.R. 5055 prohibits the EPA and the Army Corps from implementing the \nexcessive WOTUS rule, which would vastly expand Federal jurisdiction \nover our water resources. It prevents any changes to Federal authority \nunder the Clean Water Act and impedes efforts to apply the Clean Water \nAct in certain agricultural areas, such as farm ponds and irrigation \nditches.\n  The legislation blocks efforts to remove Federal dams, and it \nprotects Americans' Second Amendment rights by allowing for the \npossession of firearms on Army Corps lands. Finally, it continues a \npolicy from last year that restricts any funds from being used to enter \ninto any new nuclear nonproliferation contracts or agreements with \nRussia.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill responsibly funds infrastructure, water, and \ndefense programs that are critical to our national security, to our \nsafety, and to our economic competitiveness, all while making tough \nchoices to ensure that taxpayers' funds are spent wisely.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the rule's adoption and invest in a \nsecure and prosperous future for our country by passing the 2017 Energy \nand Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.\n  The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:\n\n    An Amendment to H. Res. 743 Offered by Ms. Slaughter of New York\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     4479) to provide emergency assistance related to the Flint \n     water crisis, and for other purposes. The first reading of \n     the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against \n     consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be \n     confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally \n     divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority \n     member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. After general \n     debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the \n     five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in \n     the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of \n     the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report \n     the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been \n     adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without \n     intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or \n     without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and \n     reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then \n     on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately \n     after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of \n     rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill:\n       Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 4479.\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be \nfollowed by 5-minute votes on adoption of House Resolution 743, if \nordered; ordering the previous question on House Resolution 742; \nadoption of House Resolution 742, if ordered; and the motion to suspend \nthe rules and pass H.R. 5077.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 233, \nnays 174, not voting 26, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 231]\n\n                               YEAS--233\n\n     Abraham\n     Aderholt\n     Amash\n

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand insert extraneous material on H.R. 2576.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Illinois?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2576, the Frank R. \nLautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, a bipartisan, \nbicameral bill to update the way our Nation assesses and manages the \nrisks posed by chemicals and the products that contain them.\n  This is sweeping legislation, Mr. Speaker, with monumental benefits \nfor virtually every man, woman, and child in the United States. The \nculmination of a multiyear, multi-Congress effort, this legislation on \nthe floor today will mark the first consequential update of the Toxic \nSubstances Control Act, or TSCA, in 40 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I talked at a graduation event over the weekend, and I \nsaid this in the Rules Committee last night. In 1976, I was graduating \nhigh school. That was the year we wore plaid bell-bottoms, silk shirts, \nplatform shoes, and I had an Afro. It was not a pretty sight.\n  Much like the bill, the Toxic Substances Control Act, well \nintentioned, was not a pretty sight.\n  When TSCA was enacted in 1976, it was not meant to examine all \nchemical manufacturing and uses, but, rather, to create a backstop of \nprotection when potential dangers were otherwise not being addressed.\n  In the nearly four decades since then, concerns have mounted over the \npace of the EPA's evaluation of chemicals, the ability of the Agency to \nmeaningfully use its existing authority, and whether the law permits \ncertain regulatory actions.\n  In short, Mr. Speaker, there is a widespread acknowledgment and \nunderstandable concern that nobody is well served by the current law.\n  This absence of workable Federal standards has also fostered a \npatchwork of State regulations. While well intentioned, these State \nactions have ultimately led to public confusion and a marketplace that \nhas become increasingly uneven, unpredictable, and incompatible with \neconomic and regulatory realities.\n  To stem the tide of uncertainty and protect Americans in every State, \nalmost 1 year ago this Chamber passed legislation to bring TSCA into \nthe 21st century by an overwhelming 398-1 vote and 6 months later our \nfriends in the other body moved their own package of bipartisan TSCA \nreforms.\n  While both efforts were broadly supported, the House and Senate bills \nwere quite different in size and scope. These differences left many \nissues that needed to be resolved, requiring many hours of complex \ndiscussions and difficult decisions to get us where we are today.\n  The end result of that work is a vast improvement over current law \nand a careful compromise that is good for consumers, good for jobs, and \ngood for the environment.\n  So what does the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st \nCentury Act actually do?\n  The bill gives the EPA more direct tools to obtain testing \ninformation on chemical substances, an improvement over the lengthy \nprocess they now face.\n  It restructures the way existing chemicals are evaluated and \nregulated, allowing a purely scientific evaluation to guide those \ndecisions.\n  It clarifies the treatment of trade secrets submitted to the EPA and \nensures that the Agency uses only high-quality science in their \ndecisionmaking.\n  It updates the collection of fees needed to support the EPA's \nimplementation of TSCA.\n  Finally, it organizes the Federal-State regulatory relationship in a \nway that promotes interstate and global commerce while recognizing the \nefforts already taken by several States.\n  I look forward to this afternoon's debate. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this landmark legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation named after the \nlate Senator Frank R. Lautenberg from New Jersey, a great friend of \nmine and a longtime environmental champion.\n  The Toxic Substance Control Act, or TSCA, has not been updated since \nit was adopted 40 years ago. For decades we have known that the law is \nbroken. So this legislation is long past due, and I hope that it will \nsoon become law.\n  Had the law worked effectively from the beginning, we might never \nhave had BPA in baby bottles or toxic flame retardants in children's \npajamas and in our living room couches. Workers may have also been \nprotected from exposure to asbestos decades ago.\n  Let me stress that last point. In 1989, after more than 10 years of \nstudy and analysis, the EPA banned asbestos under TSCA, but the ban was \noverturned by the courts because of serious flaws in the statute and \nserious limitations on the EPA's authority.\n  That court decision came down 25 years ago. Imagine the lives that \ncould\n\n[[Page H3026]]\n\nhave been saved and the injuries that could have been prevented if that \nban had stood.\n  Now, reforming this law is about preventing injuries and saving \nlives. It is about protecting vulnerable populations: infants, \nchildren, workers, the elderly, and communities that are \ndisproportionately exposed to toxic chemicals.\n  It is about getting dangerous chemicals like lead, mercury, and \nasbestos out of our consumer products, out of commerce, and out of the \nenvironment.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today is a step forward in reaching \nthis important goal. Let me briefly describe some of the improvements.\n  This bill would make it easier for the EPA to require testing of \nchemicals by allowing them to act through orders instead of \nrulemakings.\n  It will also make it easier for the EPA to regulate chemicals by \nremoving procedural hurdles in current law and providing more resources \nthrough user fees.\n  It will ensure that new chemicals are reviewed and regulated, if \nnecessary, before they go on the market, and it will improve \ntransparency by requiring manufacturers to substantiate their claims \nthat information should be protected as confidential business \ninformation.\n  These are all major improvements over current law, but this is a \ncompromise bill. It is not the bill that Democrats would have written \nif we were in the majority. I understand that some of my colleagues \nwill oppose this legislation today, and I certainly respect their \nposition.\n  On the substantive side, the bill could make it harder for the EPA \nand citizens to use some of the tools that have proven effective under \ncurrent law, including significant new use rules and citizen petitions. \nI would have preferred to leave those tools intact, but, hopefully, the \nnew tools we are giving the Agency will more than make up for those \nchanges.\n  We also work to reduce the role of animal testing in ensuring that \nchemicals in commerce are safe. While there has long been broad \nagreement that animal tests should be a last resort, I had concerns, as \ndid others, that past versions of this bill would keep necessary \nscience out of the EPA's hands.\n  I am pleased that the language has been improved and now states \nexplicitly that scientific studies should not be kept from the EPA once \nthey are done. If the studies are done, animals are not helped by \nkeeping the data from the EPA.\n  Now, on the issue of preemption, which is so important to so many of \nmy colleagues, including myself, the bill creates a significant new \ntype of preemption which many call pause preemption.\n  Under the bill, States will be barred from acting when the EPA starts \nevaluating a chemical instead of when Federal regulations are in place. \nThis is unprecedented and has raised significant concerns from many \nMembers, myself included.\n  In recent weeks, House Democrats have secured several important \nchanges to reduce the impact of pause preemption. Some were included in \nthe Rules Committee print that was filed on Friday, and some were \nincluded in the manager's amendment that was filed yesterday.\n  I just want to briefly describe these changes.\n  First, we have made changes to ensure that States would have lead \ntime and notice before EPA begins to study a chemical so that they can \npropose or finalize restrictions before the pause begins. Those changes \nparticularly benefit States that act through regulation as opposed to \nlegislation.\n  Second, we worked to exclude from the pause the first group of \nchemicals that the EPA will review. Since the EPA must begin those \nreviews in the next 6 months, States will not have lead time to finish \ntheir work on those chemicals. This change helps States that are \ncurrently working on restrictions for chemicals that are likely to be \ntop EPA priorities.\n  Third, we were able to exclude top-priority chemicals from the pause \nif the manufacturer of the chemical requests EPA review. This change is \ncomplicated, but important. Without this change, manufacturers would be \nable to abuse the system and seek EPA review as a way to cut off a \npending State action.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, we clarified the scope of preemption in order \nto make clear that States are only preempted from regulating the uses \nthat the EPA has studied or regulated.\n  In total, these changes are enough to allow me to support the bill.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank three of my colleagues who worked \ntirelessly over the last week to get these changes included in this \nfinal bill.\n  First is our Environment and the Economy Subcommittee ranking member, \nPaul Tonko. I also want to thank Leader Pelosi and our whip, Mr. Hoyer. \nAll three of them played an integral part in strengthening the package \nbefore us today.\n  I am happy to support this bill to move forward with more protection \nfor public health, for the environment, for vulnerable populations, and \nfor vulnerable communities.\n  While this is a compromise bill, it is a long overdue step forward in \nprotecting families and communities from toxic chemicals.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Upton), the chairman of the full committee.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, today really does mark a milestone, a \nmilestone for our majority, a milestone for this Congress, and a \nmilestone for the American people, as we make great strides to update \nour Nation's chemical safety laws.\n  Folks said it could not be done, especially with Republicans in \nCongress and a Democratic President. This was a multiyear effort that \ndates back to at least the last Congress. But we took the time, and we \ndid the hard work.\n  We put in countless hours of discussions and negotiations virtually \nevery weekend, and it paid off. This legislation will have monumental \nimpacts for commerce, the environment, and public health.\n  In 1976, under the leadership of Michigan's great President Jerry \nFord, TSCA was a novel approach to regulating interstate commercial \nactivity to address unreasonable risks presented by a chemical.\n  It was not meant to examine every piece of chemical manufacturing and \nuse, but, rather, to provide a backstop of protection when suspicions \nabout dangerous chemicals were not being addressed.\n  In the nearly 40 years since TSCA's enactment, there have been \npersistent concerns about the pace of the EPA's work on chemicals, the \nability of the Agency to meaningfully use its existing authority, and \nwhether the statute prevents certain regulatory efforts.\n  Over the last 3 years, the House Energy and Commerce Committee has \nconducted nine hearings, all on the aspects of TSCA. We learned that \nthere is public confusion about chemical-specific safety claims. We \nlearned that people think that the EPA should clear up that confusion \nand be more diligent on risky chemicals.\n  Finally, we learned that companies and workers were disadvantaged in \na domestic and global marketplace where conflicting regulatory \nstandards, indeed, hamper trade.\n  Within the last decade, a variety of factors, including the EPA's \nslow pace in regulating chemicals already on the market, have led to \nseveral new State chemical control statutes.\n  Some States have passed laws ranging from specific chemical \nrestrictions to general chemical labeling requirements, like Prop 65 in \nCalifornia. Meanwhile, some retailers have called out for an objective \nscientific assessment of chemicals in consumer products.\n  Almost a year ago our committee unanimously reported this bill and \nthe House passed it 398-1. In December, the Senate approved a package \nof TSCA reforms. The Senate's bill was quite different from the House, \nbut the compromise agreement--this one--includes many of the Senate \npolicy details.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  The resolution before us gives EPA more direct tools in obtaining \ntesting information on chemical substances, specifying key points in \nthe evaluation and regulatory process where EPA may order testing. In \naddition, the compromise text reduces animal testing required under \nTSCA. It restructures the\n\n[[Page H3027]]\n\nway existing chemicals are evaluated and regulated. The bill clarifies \nthe treatment of trade secrets submitted to EPA.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Ribble). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. The resolution specifies that EPA must protect trade \nsecrets submitted to it for a renewable period of 10 years. The \nresolution also creates a new system to claim, substantiate and \nresubstantiate, review, and adjudicate requests for protection of trade \nsecrets.\n  Finally, it organizes the Federal-State regulatory relationship in a \nway that makes sense for promoting interstate and global commerce, but \nalso recognizes the efforts taken by a number of States. The amendment \nmakes accommodations for some existing State requirements and tort \nactions as well.\n  Today, we have a landmark, bipartisan, bicameral agreement that makes \nsubstantial changes to the existing law. This resolution is supported \nby a broad coalition of stakeholders, ranging from environmental and \npublic health groups to large and small industrial organizations. It is \nworthy of every Member's support.\n  Before I close, I want to say a word of thanks to my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, Frank Pallone and Paul Tonko. I know the \nlast couple of weeks have not exactly been a picnic--a few ants, et \ncetera--but they know that this is a better bill because of their \ninvolvement. But the real impetus behind this whole project has been \nJohn Shimkus. What a guy. Without his leadership, we simply never would \nhave reached this point.\n  Also, I want to thank the dedicated and hardworking staff who \ntirelessly worked to get us where we are today: Dave McCarthy, Jerry \nCouri, Tina Richards, and Chris Sarley. I thank them all. At times it \nmay not have been a labor of love, but we have got a finished product \nthat will indeed make a difference.\n  This bill is good for jobs. It is good for consumers. It is good for \nthe environment. It is the most meaningful and impactful update to \nissues involving the environment and the economy that we have made in \nmany decades, and soon it will be law. The President will sign it, and \nhe will be grateful for all of our hard work, dedication, and \nlegislative achievement that every one of us can be proud of.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Tonko), the ranking member of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey, our \nranking member, for yielding.\n  It is with regret that I must stand here today in opposition to this \nbill to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act. We have negotiated in \ngood faith for many months to try to reach an agreement to fix EPA's \nchemical program. While there are some positive aspects of this bill, \nultimately, I believe it falls short.\n  Before I go into detail about my concerns, I want to express my \nappreciation for the work that has been done by both the majority and \nminority colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee. I want to \ncommend the staffs, in particular those with whom I worked most closely \nfrom the minority side.\n  As we just heard from Chairman Upton, the Senate passed a version in \nDecember of last year, after we had voted nearly unanimously to support \nour version of the bill. There are improvements over the bill passed by \nthe Senate in December with this measure.\n  I want to be clear that, in some ways, this bill will improve current \nlaw: EPA gains new authorities and resources; the regulatory bar to \ntesting is lowered, allowing EPA to acquire more information about \nchemicals; the least burdensome standard that essentially has prevented \nEPA from regulating chemicals even when there was overwhelming evidence \nof harm has been removed; one of our Caucus' top priorities, expediting \nthe review of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substances, or \nPBTs, was largely retained; and the bill requires the EPA to consider \nthe most vulnerable populations.\n  But for every positive step to protect public health and the \nenvironment, there are numerous steps back that undermine those goals. \nFor example, this bill weakens one of the few parts of TSCA as it \nstands today that actually works, Significant New Use Rules, or SNURs.\n  EPA can require companies to provide notice of new uses of a chemical \nbefore a company can manufacture or import it. A chemical that might be \nsuitable for industrial uses should not necessarily be in consumer \nproducts. This bill would make it more difficult to require \nnotification and, therefore, to track chemicals being used in new ways \nor in imported products.\n  Also, there is language on a negotiated rulemaking to limit reporting \nrequirements for inorganic byproducts, a concept that was not in either \nthe House or Senate bills but seems to have been stuck into this \nversion somehow.\n  The section on nomenclature represents an improvement over the Senate \nbill, but I still have concerns. This is just one of a number of \nseemingly benign provisions that are included to create loopholes that \nundermine the public health and environmental protection goals of TSCA.\n  The bill retains the Senate's resource-intensive prioritization \nprocess that largely duplicates the work EPA has done already to \nidentify chemicals of concern and place them on the work plan.\n  Finally, there has been a lot of talk about the preemption section. \nCurrently, States are able to restrict a chemical unless EPA decides to \nimpose its own restrictions. Preemption has not often been an issue \nbecause EPA has rarely acted, but States today--today--have a number of \noptions when it does happen. They can coenforce restrictions, apply for \na waiver, or ban the chemical. Under this bill, States lose those \nrights to ban a chemical, and a waiver would be more difficult to \nobtain than under current law.\n  Without a working Federal program, it has fallen upon States to lead \nthe fight to get the most harmful chemicals out of commerce, and they \nhave proven to be successful. They have been the champions, the driving \nforce.\n  I understand there are Members from States that have not acted to \nregulate chemicals. Please do not think this provision does not apply \nto you as well. When States are able to act aggressively, as they have, \nthey can move industry and they can move EPA to act, which benefits our \nentire Nation.\n  Unfortunately, this bill includes provisions that would severely \ninhibit States' ability to act. In January, 14 State attorneys general \nexpressed their concerns with the preemption section. Those concerns \nwere reiterated as recently as last week by some seven State \nenvironmental commissioners. Their concerns largely revolved around \nwhat has become known as pause preemption. During the pause period when \nEPA is evaluating a chemical, up to 3.5 years, States are prohibited \nfrom acting.\n  Last year's House-passed version did not--did not--include the pause. \nWhile we accepted that States would be preempted when EPA makes a final \ndetermination about a chemical's risks, it would be unprecedented to \nprevent a State from acting before then.\n  Overall, and very problematically, the Senate's State preemption \nframework is largely unchanged. We know a deal was struck in the Senate \na few weeks ago, but I believe it is more accurate to call it a deal on \nprioritization, not preemption, because EPA would have to spend more \ntime going through the unnecessary prioritization process. During this \nnew window of time, States could rush to try to act before the pause \nkicks in.\n  We have heard from a number of States that act by legislative action \nrather than regulations. They have told us that 12 to 18 months is \nsimply not sufficient. The reality is, in most cases, States will not \nhave enough opportunity to protect their citizens from harmful \nchemicals during the years it can take for EPA to do its own \nevaluation.\n  Let us call the pause exactly what it is: unnecessary and precedent \nsetting. It may be decades before we see the health benefits of this \nbill, but I fear it is only a matter of time before more and more bills \ncome to the floor that prevent State regulation before a final Federal \nagency action. I can't help but ask: Will we rue the day that we gave\n\n[[Page H3028]]\n\na nod of approval to the pause preemption concept?\n  It is a terrible policy, and we should not encourage it. It opens the \ndoor to unwelcome and dangerous precedent.\n  The core tension of my evaluation of this bill is to balance between \nnew Federal authorities and new restrictions on States. On balance, I \ndo not believe that the modest improvements to the Federal program--not \nto mention the carve-outs for certain industries, many of which are \nunnecessarily broad--are sufficiently positive to warrant these new \nrestrictions.\n  You have heard during this debate that our system is broken and that \nthe improvements, of which there are some, are better than nothing, \nwhich is what we have now for existing chemicals. But better than \nnothing is a very low bar. I think we can and should do better. The \npublic deserves better.\n  I have no doubt that people on both sides of this debate genuinely \nwant to ensure people are protected from dangerous and toxic chemicals. \nI do not begrudge my colleagues who choose to support it. However, the \nRecord must reflect that this bill is not without its flaws or its \ncontroversies.\n  We must have a strong, national chemical program to protect American \nfamilies and workers. But the States can and should be strong partners \nin this effort. This bill severely constrains the States' role in this \neffort. Ultimately, I am not convinced that the program that will be \nput into place by this bill justifies the unprecedented limitations of \nStates' authorities.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), the vice chair of the full committee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I do rise in support of the amendments \nto H.R. 2576, and I congratulate Chairman Shimkus on the wonderful job \nhe has done.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) for \nthe purpose of a brief colloquy to clarify one important element of the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is my understanding that this bill reemphasizes \nCongress' intent to avoid duplicative regulation through the TSCA law. \nIt does so by carrying over two important EPA constraints in section 9 \nof the existing law while adding a new, important provision that would \nbe found as new section, 9(b)(2).\n  It is my understanding that, as a unified whole, this language, old \nand new, limits the EPA's ability to promulgate a rule under section 6 \nof TSCA to restrict or eliminate the use of a chemical when the Agency \neither already regulates that chemical through a different statute \nunder its own control and that authority sufficiently protects against \na risk of injury to human health or the environment, or a different \nagency already regulates that chemical in a manner that also \nsufficiently protects against the risk identified by EPA.\n  Would the chairman please confirm my understanding of section 9?\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. The gentlewoman is correct in her understanding.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the chairman. The changes you have worked \nhard to preserve in this negotiated bill are important. As the EPA's \nearly-stage efforts to regulate methylene chloride and TCE under TSCA \nstatute section 6 illustrate, they are also timely.\n  EPA simply has to account for why a new regulation for methylene \nchloride and TCE under TSCA is necessary since its own existing \nregulatory framework already appropriately addresses risk to human \nhealth. New section 9(b)(2) will force the Agency to do just that.\n  I thank the chairman for his good work.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVermont (Mr. Welch).\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Number one, the starting point for analysis of this law is the \ncurrent law. The current law is a mess. It is the Wild West out there \nwhen it comes to regulating chemicals. There are 85,000 chemicals that \nare on the market that have never been tested, and bad things are going \nto happen. This law changes that. The EPA is now going to have \nauthority to regulate and review these substances as to their health \nand safety.\n  Number two, it requires a safety finding before a new product goes on \nthe market.\n  Number three, it replaces the cost-benefit analysis for a health-only \nanalysis. When it comes to health and safety, that is absolutely \nessential. It is not about the cost. The cost in human terms and to \ncommunities when you have let something go by for accounting reasons, \nas opposed to looking vigilantly at health and safety, is not the way \nto go. It is a very good change.\n  Next, it protects vulnerable populations: children, pregnant women, \nand especially workers who are in plants where these products are used.\n  Finally, it makes the companies come clean with what information they \nhave that allows regulators to come to a conclusion. That is very \nimportant.\n  The preemption issue is a concern. In Vermont, we have had a very \nactive Republican and Democratic Governor, a very active Agency of \nNatural Resources secretary, and very, very active and aggressive \nattorneys general. They are concerned about this. But there is, in this \nlegislation, flexibility so that Vermont is going to continue to have \nthe ability to act to protect its citizens, and I am confident they \nwill.\n  If the EPA is going to put a product on a list that they are going to \nstart reviewing, we are going to get a heads-up in Vermont, as every \nState is, of about 9 months. I have confidence in the Vermont General \nAssembly, in the Vermont Governor, in the Vermont attorney general, and \nin the Vermont secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources to do what \nis required to protect the public health and the public safety.\n  So no law is perfect, but in this institution, we have had a hard \ntime passing laws that we all know need to get done. I thank all the \npeople who have been involved.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).\n  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for this very \nsensible legislation. I appreciate his efforts in leading a bipartisan \neffort to reform U.S. chemical safety law that is decades in the \nmaking.\n  I particularly thank him for securing amendments to section 9 of the \nTSCA law that remain in the negotiated text. These amendments \nreemphasize and strengthen Congress' intent that TSCA serve as an \nauthority of last resort for the regulation of a chemical when another \nauthority under EPA's jurisdiction, or another Federal agency, already \nregulates the chemical and the risk identified by EPA.\n  As a unified whole, TSCA now makes clear that EPA may not promulgate \na rule under section 6 of TSCA to restrict or eliminate the use of a \nchemical when:\n  Number one, the agency either already regulates that chemical through \na different statute under its own control, like the Clean Air Act, and \nthat authority sufficiently protects against a risk of injury to human \nhealth or the environment; or\n  Number two, a different agency already regulates that chemical in a \nmanner that also sufficiently protects against the risk already \nidentified by EPA.\n  Mr. Speaker, in light of yet another regulatory overreach in the \nrulemaking at EPA, the new amendments to section 9 of TSCA are a \nwelcome reform with the intent that it will help restrain the agency's \nunnecessary activities. These are commonsense, but important, \nprotections given what EPA is likely to pursue.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Gene Green), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the \namendment to H.R. 2576, the TSCA Modernization Act. That is an \nabbreviation for the Toxic Substances Control Act.\n  This bipartisan, bicameral legislation will reform our broken \nchemical safety law for the first time since 1976, and directly \naddresses TSCA's fundamental flaws. This legislation is a win-\n\n[[Page H3029]]\n\nwin for our district in East Houston and Harris County, Texas, home to \none of the largest collection of chemical facilities in the country. \nThe reforms contained in this proposal will enhance protections for the \nworkers in our chemical plants, the fence-line communities next to \nthese facilities, and will benefit chemical manufacturers who will have \ncertainty in a true, nationwide market.\n  Congress has worked on reforming TSCA for over a decade, and I \npersonally have been working on fixing the statute since 2008. Though \nnot perfect, the proposal before the House today is, in the words of \nthe Obama administration, ``a clear improvement over current TSCA and \nrepresents a historic advancement for both chemical safety and \nenvironmental law.''\n  Let me quote also from the United Steelworkers:\n  ``Overall, the amendments to H.R. 2576, the `TSCA Modernization Act,' \ndo not result in a bill we would have written. However, there are \nsignificant improvements over current law, including a fix of the 1991 \n`asbestos decision' that crippled the Environmental Protection Agency's \n(EPA's) ability to act. Now EPA must use a health-only standard to \nevaluate chemicals and reserve cost-benefit analysis for determining \nrestrictions of harmful chemicals. Additionally, the bill includes \nincreased EPA authority to review chemicals, a fee structure to fund \nthe program, and protection of vulnerable populations, including \nworkers.''\n  Again, that is from the United Steelworkers.\n  The most notable improvements in the bill are replacing current \nTSCA's burdensome safety standard with a pure, health-based standard; \nexplicitly requiring the protection of vulnerable populations, like \nchildren, pregnant women, and workers at the plants; requiring a safety \nfinding before new chemicals are allowed to go to market; and giving \nEPA new authority to order testing and ensure chemicals are safe, with \na focus on the most risky chemicals.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. This legislation responds to the concerns of \nindustry to provide regulatory certainty for job creators throughout \nour economy and has the support of the Environmental Defense Fund, the \nHumane Society, the March of Dimes, and the National Wildlife \nFederation, along with the machinists union and the building trades.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in \nsupporting this amendment, and help pass the first major environmental \nlegislation in a quarter century.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the \nHouse amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2576, the Frank R. \nLautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act.\n  This legislation would combine the policy priorities from H.R. 2576 \nand S. 697 into a bipartisan bill that would modernize the Toxic \nSubstances Control Act of 1976.\n  Recognizing the need to ensure that chemicals are safely made and \nused, Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act 40 years ago. \nThis law made protecting human health and the environment a priority in \nthe chemical manufacturing process. However, the Toxic Substances \nControl Act has not been updated since its inception, and is in dire \nneed of reform. Policies based on this 40-year-old law are disjointed, \nconfusing, and often contradictory for both manufacturers and \nconsumers.\n  Modernizing the Toxic Substances Control Act would allow for adoption \nof uniform, science-based chemical safety policies. Manufacturers will \nhave the regulatory certainty they need to develop new and safe \nproducts, and consumers can shop with confidence.\n  This version of the bill also protects intellectual property rights \nof chemical manufacturers, many of which have invested millions of \ndollars in research and development.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill that greatly \nimproves a landmark consumer and environmental protection law.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, can I inquire as to how much time remains \non both sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 14 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Illinois has 16 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nColorado (Ms. DeGette), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nOversight and Investigations.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Frank R. \nLautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act.\n  We have been talking a lot about the, admittedly, very arcane details \nof this bill. I want to talk for a minutes about how this bill is going \nto impact the families of America.\n  Think about someone you know and love who will probably start a \nfamily in the next decade. I think of my own two daughters who are in \ntheir 20s. That future parent will be very excited about the arrival of \na child. The parents will create a nursery in their home for their new \nbaby, a space that is clean, warm, and safe.\n  Well, they think it is safe. But right now, under current law, that \nrocking chair in the corner could be covered with toxic flame \nretardants. The fresh paint on the walls could contain harmful volatile \norganic compounds. The rug beneath the crib probably has been treated \nwith formaldehyde, which is a carcinogen. Parents and children should \nnot have to worry whether the most basic, everyday things they do are \ntoxic to their health.\n  TSCA has been a flawed piece of legislation since it passed in 1976. \nNobody liked it--the environmental community, the chemical industry, or \nthe parents of America. We need to bring some certainty to the \nregulation of the tens of thousands of chemicals that we have out \nthere, and that is what this bill will do.\n  Did you know that under this bill, for the first time, EPA will have \naccess to the information it needs on a chemical? For the first time, \nEPA will regulate the worst chemicals out there, like arsenic? For the \nfirst time, the EPA will have deadlines for review so that Americans \nare protected from dangerous chemicals as soon as practicable? And for \nthe first time, Americans will know exactly what is out there in \ncommerce?\n  For the first time, every nursery in America will be clean, warm, and \nsafe. That is what America deserves.\n  Is this bill perfect?\n  No. But it is what we are expected to do as Members of the House and \nSenate, Democrats and Republicans--protect the safety of our children \nand generations to come.\n  I really want to thank my colleagues. I want to thank Mr. Pallone and \nMr. Tonko on our side of the aisle. I want to thank the rock star, Mr. \nShimkus, who I have been working with, along with Mr. Green, since 2007 \nto bring this to reality.\n  This truly is a great day for the families of America, and I am \nreally proud that we are able to get this done. I hope my colleagues \nwill look at the bill in totality; I hope you will see how, finally, we \nare going to be able to actually regulate these chemicals; and I hope \nyou will vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip, who has been extremely \nhelpful in the last few days in dealing with this legislation.\n  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, which \nis the product of much negotiation--which is an understatement, I \nthink--in an effort to find consensus.\n  Congress first enacted the Toxic Substances Control Act 40 years ago \nto protect Americans from the risks posed by chemicals in commerce. It \nhas not been reauthorized since. Since its original enactment, the law \nhas become outdated, and efforts to modernize it have been ongoing for \nseveral years with great difficulty. Under current law, it has become \nhard for the EPA to ban even substances that are known to cause cancer, \nsuch as asbestos.\n\n[[Page H3030]]\n\n  The bill before us today is a breakthrough after a significant amount \nof work. It represents a compromise that, while not perfect, as \neveryone has noted, is a great improvement over current law. And it \nwill help the EPA protect Americans from harmful, toxic substances and \nsafeguard our environment.\n  This bill will require the EPA to evaluate both existing and new \nchemical substances against a new risk-based, scientific safety \nstandard that includes specific considerations for populations more \nvulnerable to chemical exposure, such as children, seniors, and \npregnant women. It also ensures that the EPA can order testing \nimmediately for substances suspected of placing Americans at risk.\n  This bill improves public transparency of chemical information, \nprovides for clear and enforceable deadlines to review prioritized \nchemicals, and takes action to mitigate any identified risk.\n  In short, this is a bill that reflects the kind of compromise across \nthe aisle we ought to be seeing more of in this House. It is fittingly \nnamed after Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, who spent his \ncareer working to make this law more functional.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. HOYER. I want to first thank the person in my office who worked \nfar harder than I did. I just took her phone calls and talked to Mr. \nPallone and talked to Mr. Shimkus from time to time. Mary Frances Repko \nis one of the hardest working staff members. Mr. Speaker, I want to \nthank Mary Frances for the work that she did to get us to where we are. \nIt is not perfect, as she and I agree, but it is a bill that will be \nbetter than what we have.\n  I want to thank, of course, Ranking Member Pallone; my dear friend, \nChairman Upton; my friend, John Shimkus, the chairman of the committee; \nand Mr. Tonko, who is not for this bill. He worked hard to get it to \nthis place. He didn't get there, but he worked hard on that effort.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It is \na work product that has been sincerely achieved by people of goodwill, \nand it is adjudged by the President of the United States and the \nadministration and by the director of the administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency as a significant and important step \nforward. That is a good deal for the American people.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, this body has never passed a law that denied States the \nability to act before there is a Federal standard in place. What we are \nperpetrating today with this vote is a first.\n  Instead of being preempted to act once an established EPA standard is \nin place, States are prevented from pursuing critical protections for \ntheir communities from dangerous chemicals the moment the EPA decides \nto review the chemical, not when the EPA has created a new regulation.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  By allowing for this so-called pause preemption, we will create an \nalmost 3-year limbo period in which a chemical under review is \nessentially unregulated by either State or Federal laws.\n  Meanwhile, the public is subjected to potentially dangerous \nchemicals. This is unheard of in our existing consumer protection legal \nstandards, and it will be to the detriment of the American people.\n  However, I do commend the efforts of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee to take on this Herculean task of updating the existing \nregulatory regime and reaching a compromise package.\n  However, I regret that this compromise comes at the expense of the \nrights of the States to protect the health, safety, and welfare of \ntheir citizens.\n  We should not be preventing local governments from exerting their \nbasic duty to take proactive steps that will protect our communities, \nour environment, and the public health.\n  Federal regulations serve as a floor, not as a ceiling, and States \nshould be permitted to pursue laws that fill gaps in existing Federal \nregulations.\n  Pause preemption not only increases uncertainty and delay to the \nrulemaking process, but it further limits communities' abilities to \nseek redress through our courts when they find themselves the victims \nof dangerous and unregulated chemicals.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, lastly, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nfor their tremendous work on this bill and for the time and energy \nspent by their staffs.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I would just inform my colleague that I \nhave no additional speakers.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. I have no other speakers, and I will close after the \ngentleman from New Jersey has closed.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  So many people have been involved on our staffs in this bill over the \nlast several years, certainly prior to the time that I was the ranking \nmember.\n  I want to, in particular, thank Jackie Cohen. Jackie is sitting here \nto my right. She, more than anybody else, worked on this bill and made \nit possible to bring this bill to fruition. I think she knows more \nabout TSCA than anybody else I know; so, I want to thank her in \nparticular.\n  I also want to thank Jean Fruci, Rick Kessler, Tuley Wright, Timia \nCrisp, and Alexander Ratner. From Mr. Tonko's staff, I want to thank \nBrendan Larkin and Clinton Britt.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is named the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical \nSafety Act for the 21st Century. One of the things that was so \nimportant to me in the process of negotiating this bill was that it \nwould live up to Senator Lautenberg's legacy.\n  Senator Lautenberg was always a mentor to me. I worked on his first \ncampaign back in 1982. He was always looking out for the little guy. \nOne of the most important things to him in that respect was health and \nsafety because he always felt that the primary function of the Federal \nGovernment was to protect people's health and safety.\n  One of the biggest things that was important to him was what I call \nthe right to know. He always felt, if we passed laws that allowed \npeople to know what they were facing in the health and environment \nsphere, that that would be good because they or even their \norganizations that they might be involved with on an activist level \nlocally--citizen groups--would have the ability, if you will, to \neffectuate and carry out those laws through their own efforts.\n  I think one of the greatest regrets that he had was that, when you \ndealt with toxic chemicals over the time that he was in the Senate--he \nwas the longest serving Senator, actually, in New Jersey history--he \nwas never able to say what chemicals were dangerous and, basically, \ngive people the right to know about toxic chemicals.\n  I think that this is an important part of his legacy, and I am very \nproud to say that today we can support a bill that is named in his \nhonor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Before us today on the floor, as you have heard, is a bipartisan, \nbicameral agreement that substantially improves the safety of chemicals \nthat are used by everyone every day.\n  As you have heard, while this is not the bill that a lot of people \nwould have written if they had had their own way, the reality is that \nthis is how the legislative process is supposed to work.\n  I think it is very instructive as we go back to our districts and do \nthe ``Schoolhouse Rock!'' on how a bill becomes a law. There is a great \ndynamic that is in play. That is what happened here, and that is what \nbrings us to the floor today.\n  This bill represents a balanced and thoughtful compromise that makes \nlong-needed improvements to an outdated and ineffective law. The \nlegislation before us is supported by a broad\n\n[[Page H3031]]\n\ncoalition of stakeholders that ranges from environmental and public \nhealth groups to large and small industrial organizations.\n  It has the support of the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nChamber of Commerce, the American Cleaning Institute, the National \nAssociation of Chemical Distributors, the Society of Chemical \nManufacturers & Affiliates, and the American Chemistry Council. There \nis a list of 143 different groups that have come out in support of this \nbill. It is worthy of our support as well.\n  I want to thank the staff who worked very hard to get us here today: \nChris Sarley, in my office; Dave McCarthy; Jerry Couri; Tina Richards; \nour head chief of staff of the committee, Gary Andres; along with, of \ncourse, Chairman Fred Upton, who allowed all of these people to be at \nour disposal to get this work done.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have with us in the Chamber legislative counsel. \nThese are the unknown heroes, the people who actually get the late \nphone calls, who try to help us figure out the language that we are \ntrying to work with.\n  Tim Brown and Kakuti Lin are here. They have my gratitude and my \nthanks. In an era when we kind of question Federal employees and their \ncommitment to excellence and work ethic, they are good examples of what \npeople really do many times.\n  Thank you very much for your work.\n  I also want to give a nod to the great work done by the House \nDemocratic staff. You are loyal adversaries, and I believe we will \ncontinue to be so, but we were able to do well in this process.\n  I thank the Senate Republicans on Mr. Inhofe's staff and the Senate \nDemocrats' staff, from Senator Udall's, Senator Boxer's, Senator \nMarkey's, and Senator Merkley's offices, who all put in long hours and \nweekends for several months to get this multiyear effort done.\n  It has been a multiyear effort, starting since I became chairman of \nthe committee. And you have seen Gene Green come down and Diana \nDeGette, who worked diligently with me in the last Congress.\n  I also want to mention that the spiritual leader of this, kind of, \nwas Bonnie Lautenberg, who I know called us numerous times. Behind \nevery great man there is a greater woman. I think Bonnie Lautenberg \nkind of falls into that category, and I know she is very happy with our \nsuccess today.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I said in my opening remarks, this bill is good for \nconsumers, it is good for jobs, and it is good for the environment. It \nis imperative that we pass this bill and get it signed into law without \ndelay.\n  This is graduation time throughout our country--a lot of commencement \nexercises--and we are always reminded that, really, ``commencement'' \nmeans beginning.\n  So even though we are kind of getting to the end of the legislative \nprocess of the law, the real test will be the commencement by the EPA \nin our trying to enact this law and in seeing if it does everything \nthat we say it will do.\n  It is our job on our committee to continue to do oversight to make \nsure that the things we think are doing well are doing well and that \nthe things that need improvement we look at. You have my support in \ndoing that oversight and overview of this new law as it moves forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 742, the previous question is ordered.\n  The question is on the motion to concur by the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Shimkus).\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX and the \norder of the House of today, further proceedings on this question will \nbe postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H3031-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3031-H3046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ZIKA VECTOR CONTROL ACT\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GIBBS.

Is there objection \nto the request of the gentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 742, I call up \nthe bill (H.R. 897) to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to clarify \nCongressional intent regarding the regulation of the use of pesticides \nin or near navigable waters, and for other purposes, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  It has been 1 year since the first alerts about the Zika virus were \nissued in Brazil. Since then, the virus has been spreading north.\n  Many nations to our south have spent the better part of that year in \nfighting to stop the spread of Zika. It has already affected Puerto \nRico and other U.S. Territories as the virus spreads by contact between \npeople.\n  So far, we have been fortunate to avoid any transmission of Zika by \nmosquitos inside the United States, but that might change soon. Last \nweek the Director from the National Institutes of Health announced that \nmosquitos carrying the Zika virus could be arriving in the United \nStates as soon as June.\n  The World Health Organization has declared Zika to be a worldwide \nhealth\n\n[[Page H3032]]\n\nemergency, and burdensome Federal regulation should not get in the way \nof addressing a potential emergency in the United States, especially \nsince we have the ability to prevent the spread of mosquitos carrying \nthe virus before they mature.\n  The Zika virus is a serious health threat to pregnant women. It can \ncause birth defects, like microcephaly and a paralyzing neurological \ncondition. As of May 11, the CDC reported that there were 503 cases of \nZika in the United States and 701 cases in U.S. Territories and 113 \npregnant women were reported to have Zika.\n  Last week this body acted to send additional funds to the Department \nof Health and Human Services to fight the spread of Zika. We should be \ninvesting in research and development to find a treatment and a vaccine \nfor Zika.\n  We also have the ability to make it easier for States and local \ngovernments to stop the spread of this mosquito-borne disease.\n  Unfortunately, a duplicative and unnecessary permitting regulation is \nmaking it more difficult for cities, municipalities, and mosquito \ncontrol districts to spray for mosquitos.\n  Because of a bad court decision, time and money that should be spent \non eradicating mosquitos will be spent on bureaucratic paperwork \ninstead.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  In 2011, a decision by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in The \nNational Cotton Council of America v. United States Environmental \nProtection Agency reversed 60 years of commonsense regulation by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and imposed national pollutant \ndischarge elimination system permitting on pesticide use. That case \nupended a 2006 Environmental Protection Agency rule that codified EPA's \n35-year-long interpretation of the law.\n  The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, also known \nas FIFRA, regulated pesticides for 60 years before the enactment of the \nClean Water Act in 1972, and FIFRA regulated and improved pesticides \nfor decades after the Clean Water Act.\n  EPA had, for over 80 years, held that the application of a pesticide \nfor its intended purpose and in compliance with the results of FIFRA is \nnot a discharge of a pollutant under the Clean Water Act, and, \ntherefore, no NPDES permit is required, but the court decided \notherwise.\n  In vacating the EPA's longstanding rule, the Sixth Circuit \neffectively legislated from the bench, negating reasonable agency \ninterpretations of the law. The court undermined the traditional \nunderstanding of how the Clean Water Act interacts with other \nenvironmental statutes and expanded the scope of the Clean Water Act \nfrom the bench and pushed further regulation into areas and activities \nnot originally intended by Congress or interpreted by the EPA.\n  As a result, Federal and State agencies are expending vital funds to \ninitiate and maintain Clean Water Act permitting programs governing \npesticide applications, and a wide range of public and private \npesticide users face increased financial and administrative burdens in \norder to comply with the duplicative permitting process--but the NPDES \npermit and its cost comes with no additional environmental protection.\n  My colleagues across the aisle like to call this Groundhog Day, and I \nagree. We have seen previous public health emergencies that could have \nbeen prevented by the removal of the unnecessary NPDES permit. Despite \nthis, many on the other side of the aisle continue to support this \nregulatory burden.\n  Last week, some of my colleagues circulated a letter that stated \nobtaining the NPDES permit was just a ``modest notification and \nmonitoring requirements,'' but the organizations that must apply for it \ntell a different story. NPDES compliance costs and fears of potentially \ndevastating litigation associated with complying with the new NPDES \nrequirements are forcing States, counties, and mosquito control \ndistricts and other pest control programs to reduce operations and \nredirect resources in order to comply with the regulatory requirements.\n  I include in the Record this statement from the American Mosquito \nControl Association on the NPDES burden. This statement discusses many \nexamples of this burden across the country, including how the local \nvector control managers in Oregon have explained repeatedly the \nnegative impacts the permit is having on mosquito control.\n\n    American Mosquito Control Association Statement on NPDES Burden\n\n       From the perspective of the agencies charged with \n     suppressing mosquitoes and other vectors of public health \n     consequence, the NPDES burden is directly related to \n     combatting Zika and other exotic viruses.\n       For over forty years and through both Democratic and \n     Republican administrations, the EPA and states held that \n     these permits did not apply to public health pesticide \n     applications. However, activist lawsuits forced the EPA to \n     require such permits even for the application of EPA-\n     registered pesticides including mosquito control.\n       AMCA has testified numerous times to establish the burden \n     created by this court ruling. The threat to the public health \n     mission of America's mosquito control districts comes in two \n     costly parts:\n\n\n                        Ongoing Compliance Costs\n\n       Though the activists contend that the NDPES permit has \n     ``modest notification and monitoring requirements'' the \n     experience of mosquito control districts is much different.\n       Initially obtaining and maintaining an NPDES comes at \n     considerable expense. California vector control districts \n     estimate that it has cost them $3 million to conduct the \n     necessary administration of these permits.\n       The Gem County Mosquito Abatement District in Idaho has \n     testified that their staff spends three weeks per year \n     tabulating and documenting seasonal pesticide applications \n     associated with permit oversight. Additionally, they have had \n     to invest in a geographic information software program that \n     cost 20% of the district's annual operating budget to \n     maintain this information. That software has no other \n     function than serving the unnecessary NPDES permit.\n       In Congressman DeFazio's district in Oregon, the local \n     vector control managers have explained the negative impacts \n     the permit was having on their districts. The managers of \n     those districts have met with Rep. DeFazio's staff repeatedly \n     in Washington D.C. over the past several years regarding the \n     burden NPDES is having on mosquito control in Oregon.\n       The funds to operate districts like those in Oregon, \n     California, Idaho and across the country come from taxpayers \n     for the purpose of mosquito control, but are being diverted \n     into this bureaucratic oversight function.\n       The fact that the existence of the permit has no additional \n     environmental benefit (since pesticide applications are \n     already governed by FIFRA) makes these taxpayer diversions \n     from vector control unconscionable.\n       So why would the activist organizations be so adamant that \n     these permits be mandatory for public health pesticide \n     applications . . .?\n\n\n                    Exposure to Activist Litigation\n\n       . . . Because it leaves municipal mosquito control programs \n     vulnerable to CWA citizen lawsuits where fines to mosquito \n     control districts may exceed $37,500/day.\n       Under FIFRA, the activists would need to demonstrate that \n     the pesticides caused harm or were misapplied (because our \n     pesticides are specific to mosquitoes and used in low doses \n     by qualified applicators that would be extremely difficult).\n       However, the CWA 3rd Party Citizen Suit Provision allows \n     for any third party to sue a government entity. Additionally, \n     the CWA does not require actual evidence of a misapplication \n     of a pesticide or harm to the environment, but rather simple \n     paperwork violations or merely allegations of errors in \n     permit oversight.\n       Gem County Mosquito Abatement District was the subject of \n     one of these activist lawsuits utilizing the 3rd Party \n     Citizen Suit Provision. It took ten years and the grand total \n     of an entire year's annual operating budget ($450,000) to \n     resolve that litigation against that public health entity.\n       These ongoing compliance costs and threat of crushing \n     litigation directly refute any activist statements that \n     ``Clean Water Act coverage in no way hinders, delays, or \n     prevents the use of approved pesticides for pest control \n     operations.''\n       The existence of this unnecessary requirement for mosquito \n     control activities is directly related to our ability to \n     combat the vectors related to Zika. It diverts precious \n     resources away from finding and suppressing mosquito \n     populations.\n       The American Mosquito Control Association urges rapid \n     action to address this burden.\n\n  Mr. GIBBS. Benton County, Washington, Mosquito Control District \ncalculated their compliance with the NPDES permit cost them $37,334. \nThey spent over $37,334 doing paperwork to secure the Federal and State \npermits. This money was used to update maps to secure the permit. They \nspent money on the permit fees; they spent this money on software to \nhelp with the reporting requirements for the permit; and they spent \nthis money on countless requirements associated with the permit. None \nof that over $37,000 was spent on spraying for mosquitos.\n  Benton County estimates they could have treated 2,593 acres of water \nwhere\n\n[[Page H3033]]\n\nmosquitos breed, or they could have paid for over 400 virus lab tests, \nor they could have hired three seasonal workers. But Benton County was \nforced to spend over $37,000 to comply with the redundant Federal \npermit.\n  The Gem County Mosquito Abatement District in Idaho has testified \nthat their staff spends 3 weeks per year tabulating and documenting \nseasonal pesticide applications associated with permit oversight. \nAdditionally, they have had to invest in software that costs 20 percent \nof the district's annual operating budget to maintain this information. \nThat software has no other function than serving the unnecessary NPDES \npermit.\n  Mosquito control districts in California estimate that it has cost \nthem $3 million to conduct the necessary administration for their NPDES \npermits.\n  Millions of dollars have now been spent on permitting and compliance \nrather than eradicating mosquitos. On top of the cost of the permit, it \nalso opens up permit holders to the threat of citizen lawsuits where \nfines may exceed $35,000 a day. Citizen lawsuits under the Clean Water \nAct have a much lower threshold, and the simple allegation of permit \nerrors and paperwork violations can take mosquito control districts to \ncourt.\n  Gem County Mosquito Abatement District was subjected to one of these \nlawsuits, which took 10 years and $450,000 to resolve the litigation. \nThis is equal to their entire annual operating budget. We know that the \nNPDES permits are delaying, hindering, and preventing the use of \nlifesaving EPA-approved pesticides right now.\n  In 2012, the first year that this duplicative permitting went into \neffect, the number of cases of West Nile virus jumped from 712 to 5,674 \ncases in the United States. In response to those West Nile outbreaks, \nmany States and communities were forced to declare public emergencies. \nThis allowed them to use the lifesaving pesticides to control mosquitos \nwithout the delay caused by the NPDES permitting process. But they were \nonly able to do this after they declared an emergency: West Nile had \ninfected the community; they declared an emergency, and they could \nspray without having to get any permits. Congress should not be forcing \nStates, cities, and mosquito control agencies to put their own \nresidents, especially pregnant women, at risk of contracting Zika.\n  H.R. 897 will enable communities to resume conducting routine \npreventive mosquito control programs by providing a limited and \ntemporary exemption for pesticides that are authorized by FIFRA and \nused in compliance with its label under EPA guidance. The EPA already \nreviews, approves, and regulates the use of these pesticides under \nFIFRA. Exempting them from NPDES permitting is a simple fix to a very \nbad court decision that added unnecessary red tape.\n  H.R. 897 was drafted very narrowly to address only the Sixth Circuit \nCourt's decision and gives States and local entities that spray to \ncontrol mosquito populations the certainty and the ability needed to \nprotect public health. EPA even provided technical assistance in \ndrafting this bill so it can achieve these objectives.\n  Well over 150 organizations representing a wide variety of public and \nprivate entities and thousands of stakeholders support a legislative \nresolution of this issue. Just to name a few, these organizations \ninclude the American Mosquito Control Association, the National \nAssociation of State Departments of Agriculture, the National Water \nResources Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the \nNational Farmers Union, Family Farm Alliance, the National Rural \nElectric Cooperative Association, CropLife America, Responsible \nIndustry for a Sound Environment, the Agricultural Retailers \nAssociation, and the National Agricultural Aviation Association.\n  I thank Chairman Shuster for his leadership at the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee as well as Chairman Conaway and Ranking Member \nPeterson on the Agriculture Committee for their leadership on this \nissue.\n  This is a responsible, commonsense bill that will help ensure public \nhealth officials aren't fighting Zika with their hands tied behind \ntheir back.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise again in strong opposition to H.R. 897. To be clear, H.R. 897 \nwas not created to respond to Zika.\n  Now, I hear my colleague's information in regard to all that has \nhappened with the EPA and all the budget items. I suggest that we start \nlooking at increasing the budget for EPA so they can do a better job.\n  Insofar as herbicides and pesticides, I have a lot of information \nfrom my own experience in California, where it has created a Superfund \nthat has taken many years and will take many more to create.\n  Up until 2 weeks ago, the so-called Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act \nwas drafted to relax our laws protecting public health to reduce the \npaperwork burdens on commercial pesticide spraying operations. If you \nwill notice, most of them were people in the spraying business, in the \nag business, and it is to their advantage. What about the public \ninterest? This will be the fourth time in 3 years that we will vote \nagainst the legislation.\n  To be clear, a great number of waterbodies in the U.S. are already \nimpaired or threatened by pesticides; yet for some reason, our \nRepublican majority wants it to be easier for companies to add more of \nthese pesticides to our waters, yet not report these additions nor \nmonitor, for any reason, immediate health impacts that may result.\n  I am very concerned about the effect these pesticides have on the \nhealth of our rivers, on our streams, and especially on the drinking \nwater supply of all our citizens, including pregnant women.\n  Last week, the majority argued that even though this bill would \nexempt pesticide applications from the Clean Water Act, public health \nwould not be impacted because FIFRA labeling requirements would remain \nin place. However, FIFRA labeling does not address the volumes of \npesticides being directly or indirectly applied to our rivers, lakes, \nand streams on an annual basis.\n  In many cases, we simply do not know the quantities and location of \nthe pesticides being added to our waters because this data is not \ntracked by Federal or State regulators. And if we don't know what is \nbeing added to our waters, we cannot accurately be looking for the \npotential human health or environmental impacts of these pesticides. In \nfact, the only way we often learn of a problem is in examples like the \ngentleman from Oregon cited on the floor: massive fish kills or other \nenvironmental catastrophes. It is reckless to rely on a system of \ncatastrophes or massive die-offs to identify where problems may be \nlurking.\n  Proponents of this legislation also argue that this legislation would \nprotect the health of pregnant women and their children. How so? I \nthink it is important to note that it could hurt both.\n  However, this legislation does nothing demonstrable to prevent the \nspread of Zika in the United States. What I fear, however, is that this \nlegislation will relax standards for pesticide application to the point \nwhere even more waterbodies become impaired or threatened by \npesticides.\n  Madam Speaker, we know there are significant health risks associated \nwith exposing pregnant women and young children to pesticides. Let me \nname a few: birth defects, neurodevelopmental delays and cognitive \nimpairments, childhood brain cancer, autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, \nendocrine disruption. That is just to name a few.\n  To be clear, the bill under consideration today will make it easier--\nI will say it again, easier--to contaminate our drinking water supplies \nwith pesticides known or suspected to pose health risks. The majority \nwill say that FIFRA ensures these chemicals are safe. What the majority \ncannot say definitely, however, is that continued exposure to these \nchemicals over and over in the same watershed is also safe.\n  Peer-reviewed science suggests that there are impacts, and that \nevidence should be enough for us to be cautious. If my choice is \ncautious use of pesticides to protect public health or the elimination \nof the paperwork requirement, I believe protection of health is more \nimportant.\n  Furthermore, according to The Washington Post, of the 544 reported \ncases of Zika in the United States, nearly all of\n\n[[Page H3034]]\n\nthem involve people who have contracted the disease when they traveled \nto a country where the disease is prevalent. While a handful of the 544 \ncases of Zika may have involved sexual transmission of the virus, no \none has acquired the disease from mosquitos in this country--I repeat, \nno one. Let me repeat that. No one has reported acquiring the Zika \nvirus from a mosquito in this country.\n  We cannot and should not eliminate the role of the Clean Water Act in \nthe regulation of pesticides. Over the past 5 years, this regulatory \nprocess has been reasonable and has been workable for pest operations \nand ag interests alike. It needs to be retained.\n  Madam Speaker, I oppose this bill. I urge my colleagues on both sides \nto vote ``no.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to reiterate, when I introduced this bill back in 2011, 5 \nyears ago, the Director of the EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs under \nthis current administration said this:\n  ``When used properly, pesticides provide significant benefits to \nsociety, such as controlling disease-causing organisms, protecting the \nenvironment from invasive species, and fostering a safe and abundant \nfood supply. FIFRA's safety standard requires EPA to weigh these types \nof benefits against any potential harm to human health and the \nenvironment that might result from using a pesticide.''\n  He went on to say:\n  ``Under FIFRA, the Agency''--the EPA, in this case--``can impose a \nvariety of risk mitigation measures--ranging, for example, from changes \nto how the pesticide is used to prohibition of specific uses or \ncancellation of all products containing a particular active \ningredient--that ensure the use of the pesticide will not cause \nunreasonable adverse effect on the environment. When we are concerned \nabout the risks arising from pesticides in water, we may require a \nreduction in application frequency or rates, a prohibition of certain \napplication methods, the establishment of no-spray buffer zones around \nwaterbodies, a requirement that limits use only to trained and \ncertified applicators, or other restrictions.''\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  The important point to remember here, the EPA has full regulatory \nauthority under FIFRA to ensure that the pesticide did not cause \nunreasonable adverse effects on human health or in the environment, \nincluding our Nation's waters.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nRodney Davis).\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my good \nfriend, Chairman Gibbs, for his effort in putting this commonsense \nlegislation forward.\n  Madam Speaker, we all come here to this House floor, and we work \ntogether in a bipartisan way to address many important issues that \naffect Americans. We have worked closely together with many of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the floor today to help our veterans, \nto help rebuild our roads and our infrastructure, and I do believe we \ncan work together to stop the spread of the Zika virus.\n  This is a commonsense piece of legislation that isn't asking to get \nrid of EPA rules and regulations. It is asking to simply suspend them \nduring this crisis period. I want to tell you why. My colleague, Mr. \nGibbs, mentioned earlier that this is the result of a court case that, \nin 2006, actually created a duplicative and costly regulatory process \nthat many of our small communities and small businesses are still \ntrying to fight when they are dealing with spraying for mosquitoes.\n  Now, mosquito abatement has changed a lot since I was younger. I can \nremember my parents and my friends' parents sending us out to ride our \nbikes behind the fogger.\n  We wouldn't do that anymore now, would we, Madam Speaker?\n  Because we now see more rules and regulations. FIFRA, the policies \nthat have been enacted by the EPA have shown that maybe that is not the \nsmart thing to do.\n  We have processes in place. The very same agency that tells us what \nis safe and what is not when looking at spraying for mosquitoes that \nmay or may not carry diseases like West Nile and Zika, how to safely \nuse them, but the same agency has put together a process for Illinois, \na 35-page document showing us how to get a permit to spray for \nmosquitoes if you are a small business, if you are a small community, \nand these 35 pages, these regulatory requirements, we are asking to \nsuspend so we can deal with the Zika virus that we now know is mosquito \nborne. This 35-page permit had 6 entire pages dedicated to definitions \nand acronyms. Section 7, the recordkeeping portion alone includes three \nseparate levels of recordkeeping, depending on the size of the annual \ntreatment area, and it does it in there as some permittees are also \nsubject to annual reporting requirements as well.\n  Madam Speaker, the farmers in my district are spending too much time \nto try to abate this disease on their own to help so many in our \ncommunities, and I am afraid they may say: Enough. Let's figure out how \nsomeone else is going to do it.\n  That doesn't help us solve the problem of eradicating the Zika virus. \nThat is the reason why this bill that will suspend this process is so \nnecessary right now.\n  I would urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to take a \nlook at this commonsense approach and do what Mr. Gibbs is doing. Let's \nwork together. Let's ensure that we can stop a permit process like this \nto deal with something so important to so many families. Unfortunately, \nthe longer we talk in this institution, Madam Speaker, the less is done \nto stop the spread of the Zika virus in this country, in our States, \nand in our districts.\n  Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Gibbs for this commonsense piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Oh, what I could tell you about the vector control. \nI served on the board for a few years, and what I know is something \nelse, but, unfortunately, most of the proponents are people who benefit \nfrom the pesticide application. So I take exception, where is the \npublic interest in this?\n  Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. \nDeFazio).\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  First off, we have to give the chairman a report card, and I am going \nto give him an A-plus for persistence. This is the fifth time this \nlegislation will have been on the floor of this House. Of course, it is \nthreatened by a veto should it ever pass the Senate, but it won't, so \nA-plus for persistence.\n  I will give him an A for creativity because this is the same bill \nfive times under four different guises. First it was for West Nile. \nOkay. Then it was the Pest Management and Fire Suppression Flexibility \nAct. So when we had West Nile, they called it a West Nile bill. When we \nwere having a bad fire year, they called it a Fire Suppression \nFlexibility Act. Then they were honest, and they said it is the \nReducing Regulatory Burdens Act, the piece of paper, the report you \nhave to file after you apply the pesticides. So at least that was, from \ntheir side, honest. But then now it is the Zika Vector Control Act, \nrenamed 2 weeks ago.\n  Zika is a serious problem. Of course, on their side, they are \nrefusing to put forward an adequate budget to partner with communities \nwho want to do mosquito reduction and control efforts, but that is a \nstory for another day, and it is a different committee. But that would \nbe a real thing we could do.\n  Here are a couple of points. Zika is very bad for pregnant women and \nis also implicated in Guillain-Barre syndrome in both males and females \nand other potential links to other diseases. Really, really bad stuff. \nWe have to get ahead of it. We also know that pesticides and herbicides \nare bad for pregnant women.\n  So is the current state of affairs such that vector control districts \ncan't go out right now today and apply pesticides to deal with a \npotential Zika with tiger mosquitoes and Aedes aegypti?\n  No. Actually, they can. Under the law, they can go out and apply \nwhatever they think would be effective. They just need, within 30 days, \nto send a form--a form, a piece of paper--available online to the EPA \nsaying what they applied and where they applied it.\n  Now, why would we care about that?\n\n[[Page H3035]]\n\n  Well, because we are worried about loading up drinking water with \nstuff that is harmful to pregnant women and to babies and to other \nliving things, just like the 90,000 steelhead that were killed in my \ndistrict. All we are saying is we would like to keep track, and then \nwhen we see certain concentrations in certain areas, we will actually \ntest the water.\n  Your local water authority does not routinely test--for the most \npart, very few--for pesticides and herbicides, but if they knew a bunch \nhad been dumped upstream, they might want to do that, or the EPA might \nwant to follow up and do some testing. So what we are saying is we \ndon't want to know. We don't want to know what, where, how this stuff \nwas applied.\n  Now, the horrible burden of submitting an online form, this horrible, \nhorrible, horrible burden has led to: No, well, we heard last time \nthere may have been an aerial applicator who didn't apply something \nbecause of this regulatory burden, or maybe because they had misapplied \nit, or maybe the wind was blowing too hard.\n  Who knows?\n  We don't know. That was one anecdotal report. But from the 50 States \nassembled and the EPA, there are no documented instances of delays or \nprevention of necessary application of pesticides or herbicides because \nof the reporting requirement to EPA so we will know what, when, where, \nand how this stuff was applied.\n  So the gentleman gets an A-plus for persistence, an A for creativity, \nbut, unfortunately, a D for dangerous in terms of what this legislation \nwould lead to.\n  I include in the Record the Statement of Administration Policy. I \nwill put the whole thing in the Record, but the administration does not \nagree with that truncated quote talking about how important this is or \nsomething from someone at EPA. ``H.R. 897 would weaken environmental \nprotections under the Clean Water Act by exempting pesticide spraying \nfrom the currently required pesticide general permit.'' General permit. \n``Creating a new statutory exemption to the permit is unnecessary'' \nbecause the permit itself ``was explicitly crafted to allow immediate \nresponses to declared pest emergencies, thereby allowing vector control \nmethods to be applied to the possible influx of disease-carrying \nmosquitoes.''\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n H.R. 897--Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2015--Rep. Gibbs, R-OH, \n                           and two cosponsors\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 897, Reducing \n     Regulatory Burdens Act of 2015, recently rebranded as the \n     Zika Vector Control Act. H.R. 897 would weaken environmental \n     protections under the Clean Water Act by exempting pesticide \n     spraying from the currently required Pesticide General \n     Permit. Creating a new statutory exemption to the Permit is \n     unnecessary, as it was explicitly crafted to allow immediate \n     responses to declared pest emergencies, thereby allowing \n     vector control methods to be applied to the possible influx \n     of disease-carrying mosquitos.\n       In fact, most mosquito control districts and Federal and \n     State agencies already have authority under the Pesticide \n     General Permit to apply mosquitocides as needed to respond to \n     Zika virus concerns and do not require any additional \n     authorization under the Permit. In rare circumstances where a \n     mosquito control district did not seek prior coverage under \n     the Permit, emergency provisions of the Permit are available \n     that allow instant authorization to spray without the need \n     for prior notification.\n       The Administration is committed to taking necessary steps, \n     as quickly as possible, to protect the American people from \n     the Zika virus. Rebranding legislation that removes important \n     Clean Water Act protections for public health and water \n     quality is not an appropriate avenue for addressing the \n     serious threat to the Nation that the Zika virus poses.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). The time of the gentleman \nhas expired.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentleman.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. So the current state, there is nothing going on here \nexcept this sort of myth that this is a huge impediment to agricultural \npractices in this country. This is being pushed by the Farm Bureau.\n  There is joint jurisdiction between the Committee on Transportation \nand Infrastructure and the Committee on Agriculture. The Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure, despite this bill being on the floor \nfive times, has held zero--zero; count them, zero--hearings on this \nissue. We wouldn't want to hear from experts.\n  There was a joint hearing with the Committee on Agriculture. \nUnfortunately, we were not allowed to have a witness. Only the pro-\nreform, so-called repeal pesticide-herbicide, witnesses were allowed to \ntestify. There has been no deliberation on this issue. There is a great \nmythology around it.\n  It is a very sad day to use a potential national health crisis to put \nthrough a lame bill that has gone through five times, which isn't going \nto pass the Senate. If it did, it will be vetoed.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, I just want to address a few comments that \nwere just made. I believe the witness that he was referring to was the \nhead of the EPA under this administration. So that wasn't their \nwitness, I guess. I don't know. It seems odd to me.\n  Funding. We passed a funding bill out last week, over $600 million to \ngo to the end of this fiscal year, September 30. My side of the aisle \nis committed to appropriating more money, if need be, during the \nregular appropriation process for the next fiscal year starting October \n1.\n  Regarding the fish kill, we had a discussion on this last week. It is \nvery unfortunate when there is a fish kill, but we looked into this and \nconcluded that even if this fish kill had happened back--I don't know--\nin 1996, I believe, the NPDES permit, if it was in place, would not \nhave prevented the fish kill, would not have resolved it.\n  What we found out from the EPA's own investigation from the Office of \nPesticide Programs was that the fish incident was the result of misuse \nof the pesticide. The EPA goes on to report that with the various \nspecies of salmon and steelhead analyzed, if the pesticide had been \napplied in accordance with all the label requirements and under FIFRA \nand EPA requirements, they wouldn't have had the Oregon fish kill. So \ncompleting the NPDES permit paperwork and paying for permit fees \ndoesn't prevent fish kills or improve water quality. It just adds cost \nand takes money away from fighting mosquitoes in this case.\n  At this time I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nNewhouse).\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio \nfor yielding and also for his hard work on this important piece of \nlegislation. Coming from mosquito country, I am very much interested in \nthis legislation.\n  Madam Speaker, passing the Zika Vector Control Act is a step that we \nmust take today that will have a major impact on preventing the spread \nof the Zika virus as well as many other deadly mosquito-borne \nillnesses.\n  Right now the Centers for Disease Control is advising Americans to \nadopt the most commonsense method to avoid contacting Zika, and that is \npreventing mosquito bites. Since a vaccine does not exist, we need to \nprevent bites in the first place.\n  Our Nation's mosquito control districts are on the frontline of \nreducing mosquito populations that not only carry Zika, but other \ndangerous diseases such as West Nile virus. I can just tell you that I \nhave a personal friend who passed away from West Nile, and I also know \nseveral people in my community whose lives have been changed forever by \ninfection from West Nile. Dengue fever and various forms of \nencephalitis are huge problems also.\n  The legislation being offered today by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nGibbs) offers a simple, commonsense fix to one of the biggest burdens \nof our mosquito control districts. For more than 40 years, both \nDemocrat and Republican administrations alike have not required \nmosquito control districts to seek a permit for treating mosquitoes \nsince the EPA already approves every pesticide and every applicator \nbeing used.\n  However, several years ago, EPA required another permit in addition \nto the approval processes chemicals and applicators already go through. \nThis duplicative permitting is very costly. The State of California \nalone--the gentlewoman's State--spends $3 million annually on these \nduplicative permits. That is $3 million less in resources to combat \nmosquitoes. To make matters worse, mosquito control districts now face \nincreased legal uncertainty due to these new permits.\n\n[[Page H3036]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  One district in my State informed me that they now set aside fully 20 \npercent of their budget for potential legal challenges related to the \npermits. Now, that is 20 percent of their budget that is not going to \ncombat mosquitoes. To me, that is an example of government red tape at \nits worst, and it is putting lives at risk. So I would disagree with my \nfriend from Oregon that it does reduce the amount of control that we do \nsee.\n  Opponents of this legislation say that this will place our waters at \nrisk. But, Madam Speaker, nothing can be further from the truth. \nAppropriate regulation already exists. All of the pesticides being used \nhave already been approved by the EPA for safe use. The only risk to \npublic health that will come from this legislation would be not to pass \nit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Not passing this bill will continue to unnecessarily \nexpose millions of Americans to Zika and other mosquito-borne diseases \nand will restrict resources for those desperately trying to keep the \nAmerican people safe.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record several news \neditorials from coast to coast, including one from The New York Times \nthat refers to this legislation as a ``pretext to weaken environmental \nregulations'' and ``a ruse to benefit pesticide manufacturers and \nfarmers who find the regulation burdensome.''\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 19, 2016]\n\n                   Stealing From Ebola to Fight Zika\n\n                        (By the Editorial Board)\n\n       Nobody should be surprised when the present House of \n     Representatives, dominated by penurious reactionaries, \n     produces a stingy response to a danger that calls for \n     compassionate largess. But for sheer fecklessness it's hard \n     to top the House's response this week to the Zika virus. The \n     salient feature is that in providing money to fight one \n     health menace, it steals from other funds meant to fight an \n     even more dangerous threat--the Ebola virus.\n       In February, President Obama asked Congress for $1.9 \n     billion to help fight Zika, a virus that can cause severe \n     birth defects and has been linked to neurological disorders \n     in adults. Transmittable by mosquitoes and through sex, Zika \n     broke out last year in Brazil and has since spread to the \n     United States and other countries. Experts fear there could \n     eventually be hundreds of thousands of infections in Puerto \n     Rico, where nearly half the population lives below the \n     poverty line, with possibly hundreds of babies affected. \n     States in the American South with large mosquito populations \n     are also at particular risk.\n       On Thursday, the Senate voted for $1.1 billion in emergency \n     funds for research, vaccine development, mosquito control \n     efforts and other programs The bill does not provide as much \n     money as public health agencies like the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention say they need, but it is a decent \n     start.\n       The House bill approved Wednesday would provide just over \n     half that--$622 million. Further, the House insisted that \n     even that sum be offset by cuts to other programs, including \n     those aimed at Ebola. That makes no sense. It would \n     shortchange critical efforts to strengthen public health \n     systems in Africa in order to prevent a resurgence of Ebola, \n     which killed more than 11,000 people, and other diseases.\n       The money in the House bill would be available only until \n     the end of September, when the fiscal year ends. That cutoff \n     seems to assume that Zika will no longer be a problem by \n     then, an absurdly risky line of reasoning that most health \n     experts do not accept. Cutting off funds that early would \n     also severely hamper the effort to create a Zika vaccine, \n     which is expected to take more than a year to develop and \n     test.\n       Some ultraconservative House Republicans have said that \n     they do not consider Zika a major health crisis. Perhaps they \n     have yet to see (or, more distressingly, they deliberately \n     ignore) the photographs of babies born with small heads \n     because of the virus. Or perhaps they do not think of this as \n     an emergency worthy of their attention because those babies \n     were not born in the United States or to their constituents.\n       Perversely, while not doing much to contain the virus, some \n     House members have seized upon it as a pretext to weaken \n     environmental regulations. Republicans have introduced a bill \n     that would allow businesses to spray pesticides on or near \n     waterways without first notifying regulators, as now required \n     by law. Once called the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act, the \n     bill was recently given a more ominous name, the Zika Vector \n     Control Act, the idea being that with Zika lurking around the \n     corner, local governments should be able to use pesticides \n     more easily.\n       The bill, rejected on Tuesday under a rule that required a \n     two-thirds majority in favor, could come up again under a \n     rule requiring only a simple majority. In any case, it's a \n     ruse to benefit pesticide manufacturers and farmers who find \n     the regulation burdensome. The Environmental Protection \n     Agency says that in emergencies, spraying can occur without \n     prior notification. The House seems incapable of seeing that \n     Zika is a real threat, not a device to satisfy its anti-\n     regulatory zeal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From HeraldNet, May 19, 2016]\n\n                 Advance Senate's Zika Funding Package\n\n                    (By the Herald Editorial Board)\n\n       Even more annoying than the whine of a mosquito has been \n     the U.S. House Republicans response to the Zika virus.\n       In February, President Barack Obama made an emergency \n     request for $1.9 billion to fund vaccine research, mosquito \n     control efforts and other work to timely address the growing \n     threat from Zika.\n       Now prevalent in South and Central America and threatening \n     to move into some southern U.S. states, the mosquito-borne \n     virus is not typically fatal and in most cases results in \n     only mild symptoms. But its threat is much greater for \n     pregnant women and the children they carry. The virus can \n     cause birth defects when pregnant women are infected by \n     mosquitoes or through sexual contact with an infected person. \n     The most common birth defect is microcephaly, which results \n     in infants with abnormally small heads and reduced brain \n     development. But researchers also are investigating Zika's \n     possible association with neurological disorders in adults, \n     including Guillain-Barre syndrome.\n       An estimated 500 people in the continental U.S. have \n     contracted the virus, almost all during travel abroad. But \n     another 700 in Puerto Rico and other U.S. Territories have \n     been infected by mosquitoes, including more than 100 pregnant \n     women.\n       When neither the Senate nor the House moved quickly enough \n     to provide funding, the White House instead diverted $510 \n     million that had been allocated to research and fight the \n     Ebola virus, with the hope that Congress would eventually \n     approve the Zika request and allow the restoration of the \n     Ebola funding.\n       This week, the Senate responded, first with a bipartisan \n     proposal by Florida's senators, including former Republican \n     presidential candidate Marco Rubio, to fund the president's \n     full $1.9 billion request. When that failed to attract enough \n     Republican votes, the Senate approved a compromise negotiated \n     by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, and Sen. Roy Blunt, R-\n     Missouri, that will allocate $1.1 billion.\n       Murray would have preferred legislation to fund the \n     president's full $1.9 billion request, a spokeswoman said, \n     but as she has before, Washington's senior senator worked \n     across the aisle to find a solution that would win passage. \n     In answer to charges that the president had requested a \n     ``slush fund'' Blunt said in a New York Times story that the \n     package had been trimmed back to address the emergency and \n     will finance research and response through September 2017.\n       Such responsible compromise is less certain in the House, \n     where Republicans are expected to vote soon on a package that \n     provides only $622 million, much of it again diverted from \n     Ebola work.\n       That's too little and threatens further delay and a loss of \n     progress on Ebola. While the Ebola epidemic in West Africa is \n     no longer out of control, the disease continues to flare, \n     most recently in Guinea and Liberia.\n       But adding a maddening itch to that mosquito bite of a \n     funding package is a bill that the House is expected to vote \n     on next week. The Zika Vector Control Act sounds promising, \n     as if the threat is being taken seriously. But House \n     Republicans, as reported by The Hill, have only renamed and \n     changed the effective date for legislation proposed last year \n     that seeks to weaken federal Clean Water Act standards that \n     have little to do with Zika.\n       Formerly titled the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act, the \n     rechristened legislation would prohibit the Environmental \n     Protection Agency from requiring permits to spray pesticides \n     near bodies of water, if the pesticide is federally approved \n     and the application has been approved by the state.\n       Prior federal approval of a particular pesticide doesn't \n     guarantee that its use near a body of water is safe or even \n     effective. Lifting environmental protections--and risking a \n     threat to public health from a lack of oversight on toxic \n     chemicals--is not going to further the fight against Zika.\n       The White House has threatened to veto the House proposal \n     on Zika funding but appears ready to accept the $1.1 billion \n     Senate package. The House should adopt the Senate package \n     quickly to advance work that is needed now on a potentially \n     devastating health threat.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From the Hill, May 17, 2016]\n\n               GOP Repurposes EPA Pesticide Bill for Zika\n\n                           (By Timothy Cama)\n\n       House Republicans are renaming a bill that fights \n     environmental regulations on pesticides and reframing it to \n     fight the Zika virus.\n       The House is planning to vote Tuesday on the Zika Vector \n     Control Act, which up until late last week was known as the \n     Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act.\n\n[[Page H3037]]\n\n       With the national spotlight on Zika, and the GOP under \n     harsh criticism for not taking bold action against the virus, \n     Republicans are using the anti-Environmental Protection \n     Agency (EPA) regulation bill to show they care about the Zika \n     fight.\n       ``EPA regulations under the Clean Water Act actually make \n     it harder for our local communities to get the permits they \n     need to go and kill the mosquitoes where they breed by \n     sources of water,'' House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) \n     told reporters Tuesday.\n       ``So this is an important bill as part of a package to make \n     sure that we're combating Zika.''\n       Along with an appropriations bill to redirect $622 million \n     toward fighting Zika and away from Ebola, Republicans say \n     they're taking the virus seriously.\n       Zika can cause severe birth defects for newborns if the \n     mother gets infected while pregnant. Symptoms are more minor \n     for adults and other patients.\n       The pesticide bill, introduced last year by Rep. Bob Gibbs \n     (R-Ohio), would prohibit the EPA from requiring permits to \n     spray pesticides near bodies of water as long as the \n     application has been approved by a state and the pesticides \n     themselves are federally approved.\n       A spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-\n     Calif.) blasted the renaming as ``dishonest.''\n       ``In a brazenly political act, the Republican leadership is \n     trying to mask gutting the Clean Water Act as having \n     something to do with fighting Zika,'' Drew Hammill said in a \n     statement.\n       ``This bill has nothing to do with Zika and everything to \n     do with Republicans'' relentless special interest attacks on \n     the Clean Water Act,'' he said. ``It will do nothing to stem \n     the growing threat of the Zika virus.''\n       Rep. Peter DeFazio (Ore.), the top Democrat on the House \n     Transportation Committee, said in a letter to colleagues \n     Monday that the bill ``has absolutely nothing to do with \n     preventing the spread of Zika or protecting public health.''\n       He further argued that the legislation is unnecessary, and \n     the Clean Water Act ``in no way hinders, delays, or prevents \n     the use of approved pesticides for pest control operations.'' \n     The Transportation Committee has jurisdiction over the bill \n     through its authority on the Clean Water Act.\n       Democrats want the GOP to approve President Obama's request \n     for $1.9 billion in new funding to fight Zika.\n       But Dallas Gerber, a spokesman for Gibbs, said the \n     reframing is entirely appropriate, since the bill would allow \n     more spraying to kill the mosquitoes that carry Zika.\n       ``It's an appropriate addition to the fight against Zika,'' \n     Gerber said. ``When people are taking up a lot of their time \n     on [National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System] permits, \n     that's money and time that's being spent on paperwork and \n     administration, not on spraying.''\n       Gerber confirmed that other than the title and a new \n     expiration date, the bill has not changed since it was known \n     as the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act.\n       The House vote Tuesday will be under suspension of rules, \n     requiring a two-thirds majority to pass. The bill previously \n     passed the House in 2014 under a standard majority vote.\n\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Ruiz).\n  Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member DeFazio and Ranking \nMember Napolitano for bringing attention to this issue and for giving \nme time to speak.\n  I rise today to oppose the so-called Zika Vector Control Act, \notherwise known as the pesticide Trojan horse bill.\n  Madam Speaker, I am disappointed. I am disappointed that, as this \nbody fails to fully fund a meaningful effort to combat the spread of \nthe Zika virus, the Republican majority is using the legitimate concern \nabout Zika to advance its special interest agenda.\n  This Trojan horse was first called the Reducing Regulatory Burdens \nAct of 2015 and was only recently named the Zika Vector Control Act to \nplay on fears over the Zika virus. The fact is the majority has been \npushing the text of this legislation for years under whatever name \nhappens to be convenient at the time. Each time they rename the bill, \nthey merely find a different problem to manipulate to serve their same \nagenda.\n  Let's be frank, this bill has nothing to do with combating Zika. \nVector control agencies already have the authority to apply pesticides \nin emergency situations, like combating the Zika virus epidemic, to \nprevent the spread of infectious diseases without the need to apply for \na permit.\n  Instead of protecting the public's health, this bill actually does \naway with critical compliance oversight provisions that allow us to \ntrack when and where harmful pesticides are used. Without the ability \nto track where harmful pesticides are used, we are less able to prevent \ntheir negative impact or properly act when a mistake is made or when a \nharmful pesticide is inappropriately used.\n  I know, as a physician and public health expert, that pesticides can \nhave a serious and harmful impact on human health, particularly for \nwomen and children, and for vulnerable populations who live and work \nwhere pesticides are often sprayed. Harmful pesticides can cause \ninfertility, cancer, birth defects, and lifelong developmental delays.\n  This bill guts the oversight compliance that gives doctors like me \nthe tools they need to track and identify the cluster of symptoms \ncaused by harmful pesticides.\n  Madam Speaker, the pesticide Trojan horse bill is a farce, a disguise \nthat can only leave our communities, our farm workers, and our drinking \nwater at risk of contamination from harmful pesticides.\n  If passed, this legislation could harm the public's health. It will \nexpose already vulnerable populations to greater risk, without \nproviding a single dime in funding or scrap of authority that doctors \nand scientists actually need to combat the spread of Zika.\n  The pesticide Trojan horse bill is just another instance of political \ngamesmanship in Congress that could have a disastrous impact on public \nhealth. Instead of actually working to control the spread of one public \nhealth crisis, this bill could make another public health problem even \nworse.\n  Rather than spending our time on this bill that does nothing to \nstrengthen Zika prevention efforts across the country, we should be \nworking to pass legislation to fully fund efforts to contain and stop \nthe virus before we adjourn.\n  We need to put people above partisanship and solutions above \nideology. I have said this time and time again: it is time for Congress \nto do its job.\n  We must vote against this pesticide Trojan horse bill and for full \nfunding that will fully combat the spread of Zika, not the partial \nfunding bill that shortchanges American families, which Republicans \nhave recently passed in the House, before it is too late.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, we know that since this court decision, there has been \nmosquito control districts, municipalities, that have delayed the \npreventative mosquito control programs, and then they have waited until \nepidemic proportions, epidemic levels, especially of the West Nile \nvirus, which is what happened with Zika.\n  We just heard that you can have emergency provisions. It doesn't \nmatter. You can still do it. Well, even with the emergency provisions, \nwith this court decision in place, they have forgotten that the NPS \npermit emergency provisions have extensive compliance costs that go \nalong with that provision.\n  The emergency provisions do not ease the threat of third-party \nlawsuits in the event a State, Federal, or local government declares an \nemergency. Pesticide applicators are required to file notice of intent \nno later than 15 days after the beginning of the application that \nprovides a detailed description of the application and includes the \nrationale supporting the determination.\n  A user that fails to file the correct paperwork--this is key--can \nstill be found in violation of the Clean Water Act and fined up to \n$37,000 a day. Now, you heard me say earlier we have got mosquito \ncontrol districts where that is their entire annual budget.\n  Timely paperwork does not protect the mosquito control districts from \nlegal disputes from the third party that argues the appropriate \nmeasures that were not taken to avoid potential adverse effects and \nimpacts.\n  So it is just ridiculous to think that it is okay, delay your \npreventative programs, but then when you have epidemic proportions of \nmosquitoes with West Nile or Zika, declare an emergency. Go ahead and \nspray, but if you don't file your paperwork under the Clean Water Act, \nyou will get fined $37,000 a day.\n  So guess what happens?\n  We don't control the mosquitoes and protect the public.\n  Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support for H.R. \n897 from the American Mosquito Control Association--by the way, I think \ntheir interest is more than just their self-interest; I think it is the \ninterest of the\n\n[[Page H3038]]\n\ngeneral public--the Pesticide Policy Coalition, and the National \nAgricultural Aviation Association.\n                                             The American Mosquito\n\n\n                                          Control Association,\n\n                                                     May 16, 2016.\n     Hon. Bob Gibbs,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Gibbs: The American Mosquito Control \n     Association, in concert with mosquito control agencies, \n     programs and regional associations throughout the United \n     States, want to express our enthusiastic support for passage \n     of HR 897 the Zika Vector Control Act clarifying the National \n     Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES) permitting \n     issue facing our public health agencies.\n       Each year, over one half million people die worldwide from \n     mosquito-transmitted diseases. In the U.S. alone, the costs \n     associated with the treatment of mosquito-borne illness run \n     into the millions of dollars annually.\n       This amendment addresses a situation that has placed \n     mosquito control activities under substantial legal jeopardy \n     and requires ongoing diversion of taxpayer-supported \n     resources away from their public health mission. Though the \n     NPDES was originally designed to address point source \n     emissions from major industrial polluters such as chemical \n     plants, activist lawsuits have forced US Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) to require such permits even for the \n     application of EPA registered pesticides, including \n     insecticides used for mosquito control. These permits are \n     mandated despite the fact that pesticides are already \n     strictly regulated by the EPA under the Federal Insecticide, \n     Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).\n       Currently, mosquito control programs are vulnerable to \n     lawsuits for simple paperwork violations of the Clean Water \n     Act (CWA) where fines may be up to $35,000 per day for \n     activities that do not involve harm to the environment. In \n     order to attempt to comply with this potential liability, \n     these governmental agencies must divert scarce resources to \n     CWA monitoring. In some cases, smaller applicators have \n     simply chosen not to engage in vector control activities.\n       Requiring NPDES permits for the discharges of mosquito \n     control products provides no additional environmental \n     protections beyond those already listed on the pesticide \n     label, yet the regulatory burdens are potentially depriving \n     the general public of the economic and health benefits of \n     mosquito control. This occurs at a time when many regions of \n     the country have seen outbreaks of equine encephalitis, West \n     Nile virus, dengue fever and the rapidly spreading new threat \n     of the Zika and chikungunya viruses.\n       This negative impact on the public health response and \n     needless legal jeopardy requires legislative clarification \n     that the intent of the CWA does not include duplicating \n     FIFRA's responsibilities. HR 897 seeks to achieve that goal \n     and we strongly encourage its passage via any legislative \n     vehicle that enacts its clarifying language into law.\n       Thank you for your strong leadership on this important \n     public health issue.\n       Adams County (WA) Mosquito Control District, American \n     Mosquito Control Association, Associated Executives of \n     Mosquito Control Work in New Jersey, Atlantic County Office \n     of Mosquito Control, Baker Valley Vector Control District. \n     Benton County (WA) Mosquito Control District, Columbia \n     Drainage Vector Control District, Davis County (UT) Mosquito \n     Abatement District, Delaware Mosquito Control Section, \n     Florida Mosquito Control Association, Gem County (ID) \n     Mosquito Abatement, Georgia Mosquito Control Association, \n     Idaho Mosquito and Vector Control Association, Jackson County \n     (OR) Vector Control District, Klamath Vector Control \n     District, Louisiana Mosquito Control Association, Magna \n     Mosquito Abatement District, Manatee County (FL) Mosquito \n     Control District.\n       Matthew C.

However, activist lawsuits forced the EPA to \n     require such permits even for the application of EPA-\n     registered pesticides including mosquito control.\n       AMCA has testified numerous times to establish the burden \n     created by this court ruling. The threat to the public health \n     mission of America's mosquito control districts comes in two \n     costly parts:\n\n\n                        Ongoing Compliance Costs\n\n       Though the activists contend that the NDPES permit has \n     ``modest notification and monitoring requirements'' the \n     experience of mosquito control districts is much different.\n       Initially obtaining and maintaining an NPDES comes at \n     considerable expense. California vector control districts \n     estimate that it has cost them $3 million to conduct the \n     necessary administration of these permits.\n       The Gem County Mosquito Abatement District in Idaho has \n     testified that their staff spends three weeks per year \n     tabulating and documenting seasonal pesticide applications \n     associated with permit oversight. Additionally, they have had \n     to invest in a geographic information software program that \n     cost 20% of the district's annual operating budget to \n     maintain this information. That software has no other \n     function than serving the unnecessary NPDES permit.\n       In Congressman DeFazio's district in Oregon, the local \n     vector control managers have explained the negative impacts \n     the permit was having on their districts. The managers of \n     those districts have met with Rep. DeFazio's staff repeatedly \n     in Washington D.C. over the past several years regarding the \n     burden NPDES is having on mosquito control in Oregon.\n       The funds to operate districts like those in Oregon, \n     California, Idaho and across the country come from taxpayers \n     for the purpose of mosquito control, but are being diverted \n     into this bureaucratic oversight function.\n       The fact that the existence of the permit has no additional \n     environmental benefit (since pesticide applications are \n     already governed by FIFRA) makes these taxpayer diversions \n     from vector control unconscionable.\n       So why would the activist organizations be so adamant that \n     these permits be mandatory for public health pesticide \n     applications . . .?\n\n\n                    Exposure to Activist Litigation\n\n       . . . Because it leaves municipal mosquito control programs \n     vulnerable to CWA citizen lawsuits where fines to mosquito \n     control districts may exceed $37,500/day.\n       Under FIFRA, the activists would need to demonstrate that \n     the pesticides caused harm or were misapplied (because our \n     pesticides are specific to mosquitoes and used in low doses \n     by qualified applicators that would be extremely difficult).\n       However, the CWA 3rd Party Citizen Suit Provision allows \n     for any third party to sue a government entity. Additionally, \n     the CWA does not require actual evidence of a misapplication \n     of a pesticide or harm to the environment, but rather simple \n     paperwork violations or merely allegations of errors in \n     permit oversight.\n       Gem County Mosquito Abatement District was the subject of \n     one of these activist lawsuits utilizing the 3rd Party \n     Citizen Suit Provision. It took ten years and the grand total \n     of an entire year's annual operating budget ($450,000) to \n     resolve that litigation against that public health entity.\n       These ongoing compliance costs and threat of crushing \n     litigation directly refute any activist statements that \n     ``Clean Water Act coverage in no way hinders, delays, or \n     prevents the use of approved pesticides for pest control \n     operations.''\n       The existence of this unnecessary requirement for mosquito \n     control activities is directly related to our ability to \n     combat the\n\n[[Page H3039]]\n\n     vectors related to Zika. It diverts precious resources away \n     from finding and suppressing mosquito populations.\n       The American Mosquito Control Association urges rapid \n     action to address this burden.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Pesticide Policy Coalition\n\n                Setting the Record Straight on H.R. 897\n\n       H.R. 897 is bi-partisan, would augment state and local \n     governments' ability to combat Zika-carrying mosquitoes, \n     eliminate costly and unnecessary duplicative permit \n     regulations and thereby increase the number of trained \n     applicators deployed each season to fight mosquitoes, and \n     would continue to ensure the nation's waterways are protected \n     against adverse impacts on human health, the environment, or \n     drinking water. The dual regulation of pesticide applications \n     under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act \n     (FIFRA) and the Clean Water Act (CWA) National Pollutant \n     Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program is onerous and \n     does not create additional environmental benefits.\n       It is our hope that we can make our case to you via this \n     letter and win your support should the issue come up again \n     under regular order. The burdens imposed by duplicative Clean \n     Water Act requirements will remain a costly impediment to \n     mosquito control, and therefore to Zika control, unless \n     Congress addresses them in this legislation.\n       During last week's floor debate, a significant amount of \n     misleading and false information was used by those opposed to \n     H.R. 897. It's time to set the record straight:\n       Extensive review of pesticides is required for approval/\n     registration under FIFRA. All pesticides undergo a rigorous \n     review process before being approved for use by the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Only those mosquito \n     control products (larvacides and adulticides) that are EPA-\n     approved and registered are available for use to control \n     mosquitoes. EPA's registration process includes extensive \n     review of studies/data relating to possible health and \n     environmental effects of pesticides. EPA specifically \n     examines the possible risk of the intended use and potential \n     non-target organism impacts and effects on water quality. \n     FIFRA requires that when a pesticide is used according to the \n     label, use ``will perform its intended function without \n     unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; and when \n     used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized \n     practice it will not generally cause unreasonable adverse \n     effects on the environment''. Any pesticides in use for \n     mosquito control have met this standard and when applied in \n     accordance with the FIFRA label should not harm the \n     environment/water quality.\n       Previous bills were passed in the House. Contrary to \n     statements made during the May 17 floor discussion, there has \n     been consistent bi-partisan support for this legislation in \n     the House. The history of previous legislative activity is \n     summarized briefly here:\n       H.R. 1749 (109th Congress): No votes were held during the \n     109th Congress. A House Agriculture Committee hearing took \n     place on 09/29/05. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Butch Otter \n     (R-Idaho), and had 77 co-sponsors, including over 20 House \n     Democrats.\n       H.R. 872 (112th Congress): The bill had 137 co-sponsors, \n     including over 20 House Democrats, and passed the House by a \n     vote of 292 to 130. Yes votes include 57 House Democrats.\n       H.R. 935 (113th Congress): The House Agriculture and \n     Transportation & Infrastructure Committees approved H.R. 935 \n     by voice vote. The House passed H.R. 935 under regular order \n     by a vote of 267 to 161.\n       The Oregon fish kill incident would not have been prevented \n     by a Clean Water Act NPDES Pesticide General Permit. \n     Statements made on the House floor in reference to a fish \n     kill involving 92,000 steelhead in Oregon's Talent Irrigation \n     District occurred several decades ago in 1996. This incident \n     was litigated in the Headwaters v. Talent Irrigation District \n     2001 Ninth Circuit decision that triggered debate over CWA \n     regulation of pesticide applications. Not only have \n     regulatory requirements under FIFRA evolved since that time, \n     the Talent incident, and others like it, were later \n     attributed to misuse of the pesticide acrolein, a herbicide \n     used to control aquatic weeds in irrigation canals. In a 2003 \n     EPA Office of Pesticide Programs Report analyzing the \n     potential risks posed by acrolein use for several species of \n     Pacific salmon and steelhead, in reference to the fish kill \n     incidents, EPA states ``[w]here sufficient information has \n     been provided, it appears that the fish incidents are as a \n     result of misuse. The form of misuse is that water was \n     released from the irrigation canals too early. In some cases \n     this was because the gate valves were not properly closed or \n     that they leaked, in other cases the applicator opened them \n     intentionally, but too soon. In one case, boards that helped \n     contain the irrigation canal water may have been removed by \n     children playing.'' EPA goes on in the report to address each \n     of the various species of salmon and steelhead analyzed and \n     repeatedly states ``[i]t is very unlikely that acrolein would \n     affect the [steelhead or salmon species] if it is used in \n     accordance with all label requirements.'' Completing NPDES \n     Pesticide General Permit paperwork and paying a permit fee \n     does not prevent fish kills, nor does it improve water \n     quality. Pesticide applications in accordance with FIFRA \n     pesticide labels will avoid adverse environmental impacts, \n     including fish kill incidents.\n       USGS reports on decades old pesticide data do not reflect \n     impacts of present day use in accordance with FIFRA. During \n     the House floor discussion, one Member referred to a ``2016 \n     USGS Report'' that includes water quality impairment data \n     that states provide to EPA as showing ``more than 16,000 \n     miles of rivers and streams, 1,380 bays and estuaries, and \n     370,000 acres of lakes in the United States are currently \n     impaired or threatened by pesticides.'' Unfortunately, the \n     U.S. Geological Service (USGS) continues to use outdated \n     data analyzing pesticide occurrence in U.S. streams dating \n     back to 1992-2001. This does not accurately capture the \n     pesticides that are presently approved for use in the U.S. \n     Further, USGS acknowledges that it's ``analytical methods \n     were designed to measure concentrations as low as \n     economically and technically feasible. By this approach . \n     . . pesticides were commonly detected at concentrations \n     far below Federal or State standards and guidelines for \n     protecting water quality. Detections of pesticides do not \n     necessarily indicate that there are appreciable risks to \n     human health, aquatic life, or wildlife. Most of the 75 \n     products actually studied were not detected or detected \n     very infrequently.\n       In the Fact Sheet for recent draft 2016 PGP reissuance, EPA \n     points out that during the past four years of pesticide use \n     reporting under the PGP ``EPA found that of the 17 pesticide \n     active ingredients identified on the relevant [CWA] 303(d) \n     lists as causes of water quality impairment, 7 of these \n     pesticides have been cancelled, and others have significant \n     restrictions. Based on annual report data, none of the \n     impairments caused by pesticides in PGP states for the 303(d) \n     reported years were for pesticides applied under the PGP in \n     those respective states.'' This current information is a more \n     accurate representation of pesticides currently being used \n     across the country to combat mosquitos and aquatic weeds \n     etc., and strong evidence that none of these applications are \n     causing impairments to water quality.\n       Irrespective of the Clean Water Act NPDES Pesticide General \n     Permit, applicators must comply with federal regulations \n     require record-keeping requirements; failure to comply can \n     result in civil and criminal penalties. Under the law, \n     applicators are required to keep detailed records of the type \n     of pesticide, location, time/date, target pests, amount \n     applied, and method/location of any pesticide disposal. Any \n     applicator who ``fails to comply with the provisions of this \n     rule may be subject to civil or criminal sanctions.''\n       In addition, under FIFRA, pesticide registrants are \n     required to report any knowledge of incidents or problems \n     encountered as a result of the pesticide's use. Specifically, \n     ``if at any time after the registration of a pesticide the \n     registrant has additional factual information regarding \n     unreasonable adverse effects on the environment of the \n     pesticide, the registrant shall submit such information to \n     the Administrator.''\n       H.R. 897 does not eliminate Clean Water Act protections for \n     the nation's waterways. This bill provides relief from \n     duplicative regulation of pesticide applications under FIFRA \n     and the Clean Water Act Section 402 NPDES Program. Nothing in \n     the legislation would inhibit EPA and states from the \n     continued implementation of the suite of Clean Water Act \n     programs that are governed by other portions of the Act, \n     including establishing and updating water quality standards/\n     criteria and issuing total maximum daily loads (TMDLs). H.R. \n     897 simply eliminates the need for obtaining a Clean Water \n     Act NPDES permit for pesticide applications that are already \n     regulated under FIFRA in a manner that protects against \n     adverse environmental impacts. In EPA testimony before the \n     House Transportation & Infrastructure, Subcommittee on Water \n     Resources and Environment, Ben Grumbles, former EPA Assistant \n     Administrator for Water, stated ``there are other tools under \n     [the CWA] that we fully intend and continue to use in \n     coordination with State and local water quality officials \n     through the water quality standards programs, through \n     criteria, through pollution reduction and TMDL programs. \n     Those are still in place. If you are lawfully applying a \n     pesticide, and it is a direct application to waters of the \n     U.S., or if it is an application to control pests over or \n     near waters of the U.S., you don't need a Clean Water Act \n     permit.''\n       NPDES Pesticide General Permits divert state and federal \n     resources away from other Clean Water Act program activities. \n     The federal and state resources required to administer the \n     Pesticide General Permit program detracts from other agency \n     priorities. In 2011 testimony before a joint hearing of the \n     House Committee on Agriculture, Subcommittee on Nutrition and \n     Horticulture and Transportation and Infrastructure, \n     Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, Dr. Andrew \n     Fisk, then President of the Association of State and \n     Interstate Water Pollution Control Administrators (now known \n     as ACWA), stated, ``[t]he general permits being developed \n     must work for over 360,000 (estimated) new permittees brought \n     within the purview of the NPDES program by the National \n     Cotton Council court. Adding sources to the NPDES program \n     carries with it regulatory and administrative burdens for \n     states beyond merely developing and then issuing permits. It \n     goes without saying that a meaningful environmental \n     regulatory program is more than a paper exercise. It is not \n     just a permit. EPA and states must provide technical and \n     compliance assistance,\n\n[[Page H3040]]\n\n     monitoring, and as needed, enforcement. These 360,000 new \n     permittees do not bring with them additional federal or state \n     funding.''\n       The threat of CWA liability depletes resources available to \n     combat mosquitos. NPDES permitting requirements bring with \n     them the vulnerability for CWA citizen suits. Mosquito \n     control authorities have to set aside resources to defend \n     against potential litigation that could otherwise be used to \n     combat mosquitos and protect public health. In comments on \n     the recent 2016 draft PGP reissuance, the Benton County \n     Mosquito Control District in Washington state commented: The \n     absence of lawsuits does not mean that Mosquito Control \n     Districts (MCD's) have not been affected by the additional \n     liability brought on by the NPDES permit requirement. Benton \n     County Mosquito Control sets aside 20 percent of our annual \n     budget in case we are party to a Clean Water Act related \n     lawsuit The federal facilities in my district are managed by \n     the Army Corps of Engineers, and due to the increased \n     liability that has been put on them, we (the applicator) have \n     been asked to report to their agency on a weekly basis. \n     This is an example of the unseen, ongoing administrative \n     costs of the permit.\n       Similarly, according to the American Mosquito Control \n     Association (AMCA), ``California vector control districts \n     estimate that it has cost them $3 million'' to conduct \n     administration for NPDES PGPs. A few states away in Idaho, \n     the Gem County Mosquito Abatement District was forced to \n     spend ten years and $450,000 (which is the District's entire \n     annual budget) to resolve an activist lawsuit. The lawsuit \n     was brought under the CWA's 3rd Party Citizen Suit Provision, \n     which doesn't even require evidence of a misapplication of a \n     pesticide or harm to the environment, but can still result in \n     tying up funds that would otherwise be used to fight \n     mosquitoes. AMCA estimates that the total diversion of \n     taxpayer funds nationwide to unnecessary NPDES-PGP compliance \n     is $3 million annually. This does not include additional \n     costs incurred by other commercial applicators performing \n     public health spraying services to municipalities, home \n     owners associations and the like.\n       Each of these problems would be fixed with the passage of \n     H.R. 897, greatly increasing the funds available for \n     governments to fight public health-threatening mosquitoes.\n       Municipal water works remove any harmful traces of \n     pesticides from drinking water. Studies by USGS, EPA and \n     states demonstrate that detectable traces of pesticides in \n     source waters rarely exceed human health benchmarks. Public \n     drinking water systems must meet Maximum Contaminant Levels \n     (MCL) set by EPA for dozens of chemicals that may be present \n     in source waters. This includes commonly used pesticides and \n     their breakdown products. These standards are legally \n     enforceable and another layer of regulation that mitigates \n     potential human health risks from pesticide products.\n       NDPES PGP requirements limit the number of applicators able \n     to perform timely pesticide application services. As a \n     result, some applicators are shutting down their application \n     businesses due to risk of frivolous lawsuit or PGP paperwork \n     costs. Leonard Felix of Olathe Spray Service Inc. in \n     Colorado, who testified in front of the House Small Business \n     Committee, shut down his mosquito spraying operation because \n     of the paperwork costs and for fear of frivolous lawsuits. \n     Dean Mclain, owner and operator of AG Flyers in Torrington, \n     Wyoming, has similarly ceased mosquito control services.\n       Making the same point, John Salazar, Commissioner of the \n     Colorado Department of Agriculture and former T member \n     testified in 2011 to the T committee that ``. . . the small \n     businesses and public health entities that represent the \n     majority of those required to obtain permits under this \n     decision will face significant financial difficulties.'' He \n     added ``If Congress does not act, I fear agricultural \n     producers and other pesticide users will be forced to defend \n     themselves against litigation. I might also add that this \n     uncertainty would likely increase the costs to state \n     regulators. . . . Depending on the increase in the cost of an \n     application service or the difficulty to comply with all \n     elements of the permit, there may be those who choose to not \n     make pesticide applications at all.''\n                                  ____\n\n                                             National Agricultural\n\n\n                                         Aviation Association,\n\n                                                     May 23, 2016.\n     Hon. Bob Gibbs,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, \n         Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. \n         Senate.\n       Dear Chairman Gibbs: I am writing in support of H.R. 897, \n     the Zika Vector Control Act. This legislation would eliminate \n     a major unfunded mandate and regulatory hurdle that decreases \n     our nation's ability to combat threatening mosquitoes that \n     carry Zika and other viruses.\n       Following the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit \n     case National Cotton Council, et at, v. EPA, et al., \n     pesticide users have been required to obtain a Clean Water \n     Act National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) \n     pesticide general permit (PGP) from the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) or delegated states before spraying \n     for mosquitoes.\n       The development of the PGP, processing of permit \n     applications by the states, and application process to obtain \n     the permit is very costly for state and local governments and \n     pesticide applicators in the private sector.\n       Additional paperwork costs required under the NPDES PGP and \n     the citizen action suit provision under the Clean Water Act \n     results in frivolous litigation and hinder businesses that \n     could otherwise perform necessary public health work. These \n     stewards of public health face increased legal costs that \n     require a reduction of valuable resources for mosquito \n     abatement needed by small towns and big cities. This \n     duplicative regulation has forced local governments to spend \n     extremely large percentages of their mosquito abatement \n     budgets on these NPDES permits. Costly federal red tape is \n     making it financially impossible for some entities to spray \n     for mosquitoes.\n       In the private sector, our members like Leonard Felix of \n     Olathe Spray Service Inc. in Colorado, are being forced to \n     shut down their mosquito abatement operations because of the \n     costs of NPDES PGPs and potential associated lawsuits. Dean \n     Mclain, owner and operator of AG Flyers in Torrington, \n     Wyoming, has similarly ceased mosquito control services. In \n     other words, NPDES PGP requirements have reduced the number \n     of small applicators able to perform mosquito abatement. \n     Since small applicators make up 30 percent of America's \n     mosquito abatement businesses, these requirements \n     significantly reduce our nation's ability to fight Zika-\n     carrying mosquitoes.\n       The worst part about these requirements is that they don't \n     improve water quality. All pesticides that could be used \n     under an NPDES PGP are already currently being reviewed and \n     regulated by EPA under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, \n     and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). This means each pesticide has \n     undergone hundreds of millions of dollars in testing for \n     impacts to aquatic species and water quality, including \n     drinking water. There is no environmental or public health \n     benefit from the PGP requirement, and there is no risk in \n     creating an exemption from this requirement.\n       There is, however, a real public health threat with Zika-\n     carrying mosquitoes in the U.S. and this threat could be \n     exacerbated if H.R. 897 is not enacted because the \n     unnecessary and duplicative NPDES-PGP requirements have \n     grounded small business applicators that are a vital \n     component of public health spraying. The mosquitoes that are \n     known to carry Zika thrive and are developing as far north as \n     Maine. With these unnecessary regulatory barriers, local \n     governments will have fewer funds and applicators to fight \n     these pests.\n       By enacting H.R. 897, we can fight Zika and other dangerous \n     viruses without additional cost to the American taxpayers by \n     simply recognizing the duplicative permitting process for \n     pesticides. This legislation would permanently free up funds \n     for state and local governments to combat mosquitoes while \n     allowing mosquito abatement businesses to focus on hiring \n     employees instead of wrestling with regulatory red tape.\n       Thank you for combatting the spread of Zika, and for \n     protecting public health and small businesses with the Zika \n     Vector Control Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Andrew Moore,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 12\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining, and the gentleman from Ohio has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter in opposition to H.R. \n897 from 13 national environmental organizations. They are \nEarthjustice, League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Association, San \nFrancisco Baykeeper, Center for Biological Diversity, Clean Water \nAction, Defenders of Wildlife, Greenpeace, Beyond Pesticides, Southern \nEnvironmental Law Center, Sierra Club, and Friends of the Earth.\n\n     Re Oppose H.R. 897 (``Zika Vector Control Act'').\n\n                                                     May 16, 2016.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members \n     and supporters nationwide, we urge you to oppose H.R. 897 \n     (``Zika Vector Control Act''), which would eliminate Clean \n     Water Act safeguards that protect our waterways and \n     communities from excessive pesticide pollution. The Pesticide \n     General Permit targeted in this legislation has been in place \n     for nearly five years now and alarmist predictions by \n     pesticide manufacturers and others about the impacts of this \n     permit have failed to bear any fruit.\n       This bill is the same legislation that pesticide \n     manufacturers and other special interests have been pushing \n     for years. It will not improve nor impact spraying to combat \n     Zika virus, contrary to the new, last-minute title given to \n     the bill. The Pesticide General Permit at issue allows for \n     spraying to combat vector-borne diseases such as Zika and the \n     West Nile virus. According to the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency, the permit ``provides that pesticide \n     applications are\n\n[[Page H3041]]\n\n     covered automatically under the permit and may be performed \n     immediately for any declared emergency pest situations'' \n     (emphasis added).\n       Further, repealing the Pesticide General Permit--as this \n     damaging legislation seeks to do--would allow pesticides to \n     be discharged into water bodies without any meaningful \n     oversight since the federal pesticide registration law (the \n     Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)) \n     does not require tracking of such applications.\n       Now that the Pesticide General Permit is in place, the \n     public is finally getting information that they couldn't \n     obtain before about the types of pesticides being sprayed or \n     discharged into local bodies of water. All across the \n     country, pesticide applicators are complying with the \n     Pesticide General Permit to protect water quality without \n     issue.\n       Further, the Pesticide General Permit has no significant \n     effect on farming practices. The permit in no way affects \n     land applications of pesticides for the purpose of \n     controlling pests. Irrigation return flows and agricultural \n     stormwater runoff do not require permits, even when they \n     contain pesticides. Existing agricultural exemptions in the \n     Clean Water Act remain.\n       Nearly 150 human health, fishing, environmental, and other \n     organizations have opposed efforts like H.R. 897 that would \n     undermine Clean Water Act permitting for direct pesticide \n     applications to waterways. We attach a list of these groups \n     for your reference, as well as a one-page fact sheet with \n     more information on the issue.\n       The Pesticide General Permit simply lays out commonsense \n     practices for applying pesticides directly to waters that \n     currently fall under the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act. \n     Efforts to block this permit are highly controversial, as \n     evidenced by the attached list of groups opposed.\n       Please protect the health of your state's citizens and all \n     Americans by opposing H.R. 897.\n           Sincerely,\n         Earthjustice; League of Conservation Voters; Natural \n           Resources Defense Council; Pacific Coast Federation of \n           Fishermen's Associations; Sierra Club; San Francisco \n           Baykeeper; Center for Biological Diversity; Southern \n           Environmental Law Center; Clean Water Action; Defenders \n           of Wildlife; Greenpeace; Beyond Pesticides; Friends of \n           the Earth.\n\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, during the debate on H.R. 897 last \nweek, it was suggested that the recordkeeping requirements of the \nFederal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, or FIFRA, were \nequal to or exceeding those required under the Clean Water Act permit. \nWe checked with EPA and found a very different story.\n  First, contrary to suggestions otherwise, all private pesticide \napplicators are not required to keep any pesticide applications under \nFIFRA or its implementing regulations. Only commercial application of \nrestricted-use pesticides are required to keep application records \nunder FIFRA recordkeeping requirements.\n  Second, pesticide application records do not have to be filed with \nthe EPA, any State or tribal agency, or person. They are only required \nto keep and be maintained at a place where pesticides are used, and \navailable for inspection upon request by an authorized regulatory \nrepresentative.\n  Yet, in contrast to the clean water requirements, the FIFRA \napplication records are not publicly available. While in some States \napplicators can be required by State or regulation to lead to more \nrobust recordkeeping requirements, it is not accurate to say those are \nrequired under FIFRA.\n  So in sum, FIFRA requires far fewer pesticide applicators to keep any \nrecords, does not require that these records be filed with the Federal, \nState, or tribal regulatory agency, and does not make these records \npublicly available.\n  In my view, then, it is not accurate to say that the recordkeeping \nrequirements of FIFRA and the Clean Water Act are synonymous.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, just to respond a little bit, the EPA sets the label \nrequirements. It sets all the requirements for the certified \napplicators. And to apply a restricted pesticide, you have to be a \ncertified applicator.\n  Now, ironically, here, the EPA is the agency, the regulator, that can \nset what is restricted. In most cases what we are talking about here is \nthe pesticides being used to control mosquitoes and stuff are \nrestricted pesticides, and the certified applicators have to keep \nrecords. The regulators can come in and check those records. Those \nrecords consist of the date you applied the pesticide, the time of day, \nthe wind speed, the temperature, the humidity--all sorts of things--\nand, obviously, the location. And so the EPA controls this under FIFRA, \nand they can come in and require to see those records if there is a \nproblem, and they have absolute control of what is restricted and what \nis not restricted, and they can add to that list. They have full, broad \nability to do that under FIFRA under the current law.\n  So I want to make that known--that you don't go out and apply \nrestricted pesticides haphazardly. You just open yourself up to all \nkinds of legal problems and regulatory problems. It is an erroneous \nargument that that is going to happen.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Madam Speaker, I listened to the arguments, and I hope that, for the \nfifth time, this measure is opposed and rejected.\n  I think of California and its many rivers and streams that are \nheavily impacted by the pollution of pesticides and herbicides, and I \nurge my colleagues to consider that this could happen in their area, \ntoo.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 897.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, I really urge my colleagues to support this \nbill for several reasons. We need to make sure that we give our local \ncommunities and our States all the tools in that tool chest to fight \nthis virus because this could reach epidemic proportions this summer. \nIf we don't do that, it is on us.\n  What we tried to do here on this bill--viruses, they kind of run a \ncourse, and they go through that. We went through it with Ebola and \nother things. You have seen it with swine flu and other things.\n  During this virus running its course, we should do everything we can \nto try to mitigate the effects and the impact to the public's health \nand safety. So one thing we did in this bill is we put a 2-year sunset \nprovision. So on September 30 of 2018, this provision, H.R. 897, \nexpires. It sunsets.\n  So, really, to attack the issue here, while this disease runs its \ncourse--and, hopefully, it runs its course and we do the right thing \nand mitigate it by providing the resources to our local communities and \nour States to fight it; to provide for research, which we are doing in \nour bill that we passed last week; and, also, to give them the tools so \nthey can spend all the money they have on the mosquito control programs \nand not on administration and paperwork.\n  That court decision back in the mid-2000s was a bad court decision. \nIt added redtape and duplication and is delaying preventive programs \nfrom mosquito control. We know that. We have examples of that.\n  We saw the numbers of West Nile a couple of years ago just explode in \nWest Nile cases because those mosquito programs weren't doing what they \nwere supposed to be doing, because it is important to get in there and \nattack the issue early, kill the larvae before they grow mosquitoes.\n  So this is a commonsense bill that gives an additional tool to our \nlocal communities and States to fight that.\n  This argument that applicators go out and just haphazardly apply \npesticides and chemicals is just playing on people's emotions. It is \njust not true.\n  First of all, these pesticides aren't cheap. They are expensive, and \nwe try to use them in limited amounts to do the best thing.\n  Under FIFRA, a certified pesticide applicator, like I said, has to \ndocument everything they do, and those documents have to be made \nreadily available if their regulator--in this case, the EPA--comes in \nand says they want to see them.\n  So if there is an issue with some waterbody, they can come in and \nfind out. We saw that in that spill that was mentioned back in the \n1990s in Oregon. That was a spill. It was done by either incompetence \nor not by a certified applicator. We also got reports that certain \nirrigation gates were open. Things just didn't happen the way they were \nsupposed to happen.\n  The NPS permit would not have prevented that spill. We need to make \nsure\n\n[[Page H3042]]\n\nthat we do everything we can and give the tools to communities to \nprotect the environment, foster and protect public health, and not have \nto wait to do an emergency declaration and do aerial spraying and \neverything else.\n  Let's get those preventive programs going, and then we will give them \nthe resources to do that and head off this potential epidemic before it \noccurs and protect the safety of our citizens.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 897.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, I submit the following letters of support \nthat we received for the bill last week:\n  A letter from nearly 100 organizations supporting H.R. 897, \nincluding: the National Association of State Departments of \nAgriculture, the National Farmers Union, the Ohio Professional \nApplicators for Responsible Regulation, the Pesticide Policy Coalition, \nand the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.\n  The National Pest Management Association.\n  Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment.\n  The American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 2016.\n       Dear Member of Congress: The nearly one hundred undersigned \n     organizations urge your support for HR 897, the Zika Vector \n     Control Act, which the House will consider today under \n     suspension of the rules.\n       Pesticide users, including those protecting public health \n     from mosquito borne diseases, are now subjected to the court \n     created requirement that lawful applications over, to or near \n     `waters of the U.S.' obtain a Clean Water Act (CWA) National \n     Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit from \n     the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or delegated \n     states. HR 897 would clarify that federal law does not \n     require this redundant permit for already regulated pesticide \n     applications.\n       Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide \n     Act (FIERA), all pesticides are reviewed and regulated for \n     use with strict instructions on the EPA approved product \n     label. A thorough review and accounting of impacts to water \n     quality and aquatic species is included in every EPA review. \n     Requiring water permits for pesticide applications is \n     redundant and provides no additional environmental benefit.\n       Compliance with the NPDES water permit also imposes \n     duplicative resource burdens on thousands of small businesses \n     and farms, as well as the municipal, county, state and \n     federal agencies responsible for protecting natural resources \n     and public health. Further, and most menacing, the permit \n     exposes all pesticide users--regardless of permit \n     eligibility--to the liability of CWA-based citizen law suits.\n       In the 112th Congress, the same Reducing Regulatory Burdens \n     Act--then HR 872--passed the House Committee on Agriculture \n     and went on to pass the House of Representatives on \n     suspension. In the 113th Congress, the legislation--then HR \n     935--passed the both the House Committees on Agriculture and \n     Transportation & Infrastructure by voice vote, and again, the \n     House of Representatives.\n       The water permit threatens the critical role pesticides \n     play in protecting human health and the food supply from \n     destructive and disease-carrying pests, and for managing \n     invasive weeds to keep open waterways and shipping lanes, to \n     maintain rights of way for transportation and power \n     generation, and to prevent damage to forests and recreation \n     areas. The time and money expended on redundant permit \n     compliance drains public and private resources. All this for \n     no measureable benefit to the environment. We urge you to \n     remove this regulatory burden by voting ``YES'' on HR 897, \n     the Zika Vector Control Act.\n           Sincerely,\n         Agribusiness Council of Indiana; Agribusiness & Water \n           Council of Arizona;

H.R. 897 is scheduled to be \n     considered by the full House of Representatives tomorrow, May \n     17. H.R. 897 would suspend the need to obtain unnecessary and \n     burdensome permits, allowing our industry to better protect \n     you from the mosquitoes that transmit the Zika virus.\n       Zika is an emerging mosquito-borne virus that currently has \n     no specific medical treatment or vaccine. Zika virus is \n     spread through the bite of infected mosquitoes in the Aedes \n     genus, the same mosquitoes that carry dengue fever and \n     chikungunya. The Zika virus causes mild flu-like symptoms in \n     about 20 percent of infected people, but the main concern \n     among leading health organizations is centered on a possible \n     link between the virus and microcephaly, a birth defect \n     associated with underdevelopment of the head and brain, \n     resulting in neurological and developmental problems. The \n     World Health Organization (WHO) recently declared Zika virus \n     a global health emergency.\n       Currently, pest management professionals who apply even \n     small amounts of pesticides in and around lakes, rivers and \n     streams to protect public health and prevent potential \n     disease outbreaks are required to obtain an additional, \n     redundant and burdensome National Pollutant Discharge \n     Elimination System (NPDES) permit prior to application. Under \n     the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act \n     (FIFRA), all pesticides are reviewed and regulated for use \n     with strict instructions on the U.S. Environmental Protection \n     Agency (EPA) approved product label. A thorough review and \n     accounting of impacts to water quality and aquatic species is \n     included in every EPA review. Requiring water permits for \n     pesticide applications is redundant and provides no \n     additional environmental benefit.\n       Pest management professionals are on the front lines of \n     protecting the public, using a variety of tools, including \n     pesticides. Requiring pest management applicators to obtain \n     an NPDES permit to prevent and react to potential disease \n     outbreaks wastes valuable time against rapidly moving and \n     potentially deadly pests. Water is the breeding ground for \n     many pests.\n       The pest management industry strongly urges you temporarily \n     remove this regulatory burden and help us protect people\n\n[[Page H3043]]\n\n     throughout your community from mosquitoes that transmit \n     dangerous and deadly diseases, like Zika, by voting YES on \n     H.R. 897, the Zika Vector Control Act.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Responsible Industry for\n\n\n                                              a Sound Economy,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 2016.\n     Hon. Bob Gibbs,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Gibbs: Thank you for re-introducing the \n     H.R. 897. RISE (Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment) \n     is a national not-for-profit trade association representing \n     producers and suppliers of specialty pesticides including \n     products used to control mosquitoes and invasive aquatic \n     weeds.\n       For most of the past four decades, water quality concerns \n     from pesticide applications were addressed within the \n     registration process under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide \n     and Rodenticide Act (FIERA) rather than a Clean Water Act \n     permitting program. Due to a 2009 decision of the 6th Circuit \n     U.S. Court of Appeals, Clean Water Act National Pollution \n     Discharge Elimination System Permits (NPDES) have been \n     required since 2011 for aquatic pesticide applications. NPDES \n     permits do not provide any identifiable additional \n     environmental benefits, but add significant costs and \n     paperwork requirements which make it more expensive to \n     protect people from mosquitoes that can vector the Zika \n     Virus, West Nile Virus, Dengue Fever and other viruses. \n     Permits also make it more expensive to control invasive \n     aquatic plants that over take our waterways and impede \n     endangered species habitat.\n       H.R. 897 would clarify that duplicative NPDES permits are \n     not needed for the application of EPA approved pesticides. \n     The elimination of these permits will speed response to \n     public health and other pest pressures, save resources for, \n     states, municipalities, and communities. We support this \n     legislation look forward to working with you and your \n     colleagues to advance this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Aaron Hobbs,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     American Farm\n\n\n                                            Bureau Federation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 2016.\n     Hon.,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Members of Congress: Later this week, the House will \n     vote on legislation that clarifies congressional intent \n     regarding regulation of the use of pesticides for control of \n     exotic diseases such as Zika virus and West Nile virus, as \n     well as for other lawful uses in or near navigable waters. \n     The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) strongly supports \n     the Zika Vector Control Act of 2016'' and urges all members \n     of Congress to support this legislation.\n       AFBF represents rural areas nationwide that will be \n     impacted by the spread of dangerous exotic diseases like \n     Zika. The only control measure at this time is vector \n     control. Our members are aware that local mosquito control \n     districts face tight budgets and are concerned with the \n     operational disruptions and increased costs associated with \n     unnecessary and duplicative permitting requirements. Any \n     disruption in vector control will expose a large portion of \n     Farm Bureau members to mosquitos that may carry diseases like \n     Zika and West Nile virus.\n       We urge all committee members to vote in favor of the \n     ``Zika Vector Control Act of 2016.''\n       Thank you very much for your support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Zippy Duvall,\n                                                        President.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support of full \nfunding for the Zika Response Appropriations, because the House \nappropriations measure fell short of what is needed to aggressively \naddress the enormity of the Zika Virus threat to the Americas and the \nUnited States, with particular concern for Puerto Rico the House needs \nto act.\n  I thank President Obama for his leadership in requesting $1.9 billion \nto address the threat of the Zika Virus, and facing congressional delay \nhe took funds from Ebola response to prepare the nation to face the \nZika Virus threat.\n  Let us not forget--Ebola was on our doorstep last year before \nCongress acted and there are still Ebola hot spots that are occurring, \nwhich have to be addressed, but we now lack the resources to deal with \nthat ever present threat.\n  I am committed to doing everything I can to address the threat of \nZika Virus, but I am not supportive of tricks or misguided strategies \nto get legislation to the House floor in the name of Zika prevention \nthat will do too little; and funding that will abruptly end on \nSeptember 30, 2016.\n  As the founder and Chair of the Children's Caucus and a senior member \nof the House Committee on Homeland Security, I am acutely aware of how \ndangerous the Zika Virus is to women who may be pregnant or may become \npregnant should they be exposed to the disease.\n  Houston, Texas, like many cities, towns, and parishes along the Gulf \nCoast, has a tropical climate hospitable to mosquitoes that carry the \nZika Virus like parts of Central and South America, as well as the \nCaribbean.\n  For this reason, I am sympathetic to those members who have districts \nalong the Gulf Coast.\n  These Gulf Coast areas, which include Houston, the third largest city \nin the nation, are known to have both types of the Zika Virus carrying \nmosquitoes: the Aedes Aegypti and the Asian Tiger Mosquito; which is \nwhy I held a meeting in Houston on March 10, 2016 about this evolving \nhealth threat.\n  I convened this meeting with Houston, Harris County and State \nofficials at every level of responsibility to combat the Zika Virus and \nto discuss preparations that would mitigate it.\n  The participants included Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the National \nSchool of Tropical Medicine and Professor of Pediatrics at Baylor \nCollege of Medicine and Dr. Dubboun, Director of the Harris County \nPublic Health Environmental Services Mosquito Control Division who gave \nstrong input on the critical need to address the threat on a multi-\npronged approach.\n  The potential for the Zika Virus outbreaks in the United States if we \ndo not act is real, and the people on the front lines are state and \nlocal governments who must prepare for mosquito season, establish \ncommunity oriented education campaigns, provide Zika Virus prevention \nresources to women who live in areas where poverty is present, and \nenvironmental remediation of mosquito breeding near where people live.\n  The assumption that everyone has air conditioning; window and door \nscreens that are in good repair or present at all; does not take into \nconsideration the pockets of poverty that are present in every major \ncity including many towns, counties, parishes, and cities along the \nGulf Coast.\n  The 18th Congressional District of Texas, which I represent, has a \ntropical climate and is very likely to confront the challenge of Zika \nVirus carrying mosquitoes before mosquito season ends in the fall.\n  Dr. Dubboun, Director of the Harris County Public Health \nEnvironmental Services Mosquito Control Division stressed that we \ncannot spray our way out of the Zika Virus threat.\n  He was particularly cautious about the over use of spraying because \nof its collateral threat to the environment and people.\n  We should not forget that Flint, Michigan was an example of short-\nsighted thinking on the part of government decision makers, which \nresulted in the contamination of that city's water supply.\n  The participants in the meeting I held in Houston represented the \nsenior persons at every state and local agency with responsibility for \nZika Virus response.\n  The expert view of those present was that we need a unity of effort \nplan to address the Zika Virus in the Houston and Harris County area \nthat will include every aspect of the community.\n  The collective wisdom of these experts revealed that we should not \nlet the fear of the Zika Virus control public policy.\n  Instead we should get in front of the problem, then we can control \nthe Zika Virus from its source--targeting mosquito breeding \nenvironments.\n  The real fight against the Zika Virus will be fought neighborhood by \nneighborhood and will rely upon the resources and expertise of local \ngovernment working closely with State governments supported by federal \ngovernment agencies.\n  The consensus of Texas, Houston, and Harris County experts is that we \nmake significant strides to stay ahead of the arrival of mosquito \ntransmission of Zika Virus if we act now.\n  The CDC said that for the period January 1, 2015 to May 11, 2016, the \nnumber of cases are as follows:\n\n\n                           The United States\n\n  Travel-associated cases reported: 503; Locally acquired through \nmosquito bites reported: 0; Total: 503.\n  Pregnant: 48; Sexually transmitted: 10; Guillain-Barre syndrome: 1.\n\n\n                            U.S. Territories\n\n  Travel-associated cases reported: 3; Mosquito acquired cases \nreported: 698; Total: 701.\n  Pregnant: 65; Guillain-Barre syndrome: 5.\n  There are 49 countries and territories in our hemisphere where \nmosquito borne transmission of the Zika Virus is the primary way the \nvirus is spread include:\n  American Samoa; Aruba; Belize; Barbados; Bolivia; Brazil; Bonaire; \nCape Verde; Central America; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Curacao; \nDominica; Dominican Republic; El Salvador; Ecuador; Fiji; French \nGuiana; Grenada; the Grenadines; Guatemala; Guadeloupe; Haiti; \nHonduras; Islands Guyana; Jamaica; Martinique; Kosrae (Federated States \nof Micronesia); Marshall Islands; Mexico; Nicaragua; New Caledonia; the \nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, Panama; Papua New Guinea, Paraguay; Peru; \nSamoa, a U.S. territory; Saint Barthelemy; Saint Lucia; Saint Martin; \nSaint Vincent; Saint Maarten; Suriname; Tonga;\n\n[[Page H3044]]\n\nTrinidad and Tobago; U.S. Virgin Islands, Venezuela and particular note \nis made by the CDC by listing the 2016 Summer Olympics (Rio 2016) \nseparately.\n\n  As of May 11, 2016, there were more than 1,200 confirmed Zika cases \nin the continental United States and U.S. Territories, including over \n110 pregnant women with confirmed cases of the Zika virus.\n  The Zika virus is spreading in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, \nAmerican Samoa and abroad, and there will likely be mosquito-borne \ntransmission within the continental United States in the coming summer \nmonths.\n  The most important approach to control the spread of Zika Virus is \npoverty and the conditions that may exist in poor communities can be of \ngreatest risk for the Zika Virus breeding habitats for vector \nmosquitoes.\n  The spread of disease is opportunistic--Zika Virus is an \nopportunistic disease that is spread by 2 mosquitoes out of the 57 \nverities.\n  We should be planning to fight those 2 mosquitoes in a multi-pronged \nway with every resource we can bring to the battle.\n  Poverty is where the mosquito will find places to breed in great \nnumbers, but these mosquitoes will not be limited to low income areas \nnor does the disease care how much someone earns.\n  The Aedes Aegypti or Yellow Fever mosquito has evolved to feed on \npeople for the blood needed to lay its eggs.\n  This mosquito can breed in as little as a cap of dirty water; it will \nbreed in aquariums in homes; plant water catching dishes; the well of \ndiscarded tires; puddles or pools of water; ditches; and children's \nwading pools.\n  Although water may evaporate mosquito eggs will remain viable and \nwhen it rains again or water is placed where they are in contact with \neggs the process for mosquitos development resumes.\n  The enablers of Zika Virus are those who illegally dump tires; open \nditches, torn screens, or no screens; tropical climates that create \nheat and humidity that force people without air conditioning to open \nwindows or face heat exhaustion.\n  It might be hard for people who do not live in the tropical climates \nalong the Gulf Coast to understand what a heat index is--it is a \ncombination of temperature and humidity, which can mean that \ntemperatures in summer are over 100 degrees.\n  Zika Virus Prevention Kits like those being distributed in Puerto \nRico, which are vital to the effort there to protect women, will be \nessential to the fight against Zika Virus along the Gulf Coast.\n  These kits should include mosquito nets for beds.\n  Bed nets have proven to be essential in the battle to reduce malaria \nby providing protection and reducing the ability of biting insects to \ncome in contact with people.\n  Mosquito netting has fine holes that are big enough to allow breezes \nto easily pass through, but small enough to keep mosquitoes and other \nbiting insects out.\n  The kits should also include DEET mosquito repellant products that \ncan be sprayed on clothing to protect against mosquito bites.\n  Madam Speaker, there is no need to be alarmed, but we should be \npreparing aggressively so that this nation does not have a reoccurrence \nof what happened during the Ebola crisis--when the Federal government \nseemed unprepared because this Congress was unmoved by the science, \nuntil domestic transmission of the disease were recorded.\n  The Zika Virus is a neurogenic virus that can attack the brain tissue \nof children in their mother's womb.\n  The Zika Virus will be difficult to detect and track in all cases \nbecause 4 in 5 people who get the disease will have no symptoms.\n  We know that 33 states have one or both of the vector mosquitoes.\n  Dr. Peter Hotez said that we can anticipated that the Americas \nincluding the United States can expect 4 million Zika Virus cases in \nthe next four months and to date there are over a million cases in \nBrazil.\n  The virus has been transmitted through sexual contact.\n  We know that the evidence of the Zika Virus in newborns in the United \nStates may not become apparent until we are in the late fall or winter \nof next year.\n  The most serious outcome the Zika Virus exposure is birth defects \nthat can occur during pregnancy if the mother is exposed to the Zika \nVirus.\n  Infections of pregnant women can result in:\n  Still births;\n  The rate of Microcephaly based on Zika Virus exposure far exceeds \nthat number.\n  Microcephaly is brain underdevelopment either at birth or the brain \nfailing to develop properly after birth, which can cause:\n  Difficulty walking;\n  Difficulty hearing; and\n  Difficulty with speech.\n  Researchers and scientists at the CDC; NIH and HHS do not know how \nthe disease attacks the nervous system of developing babies.\n  They cannot answer what the long term health prospects are for \nchildren born with such a severe brain birth defect.\n  They have not discovered the right vaccine to fight the disease--\nwhich requires care to be sure that it is safe and effective especially \nin pregnant women or women who may become pregnant.\n  The do not know what plan will work and to what degree if a tight \nnetwork of mosquito control is established in areas most likely to have \nthe Zika Virus carrying mosquitoes.\n  How the Zika Virus may evolve over time and what they may mean for \nhuman health.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject anything less than full support of the \nPresident's request for $1.9 billion to fight the Zika Virus threat.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 742, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill, as amended.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. RUIZ. I am opposed in its current form, Madam Speaker.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Ruiz moves to recommit the bill H.R. 897 to the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure with \n     instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith \n     with the following amendment:\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 4. PROTECTING PREGNANT WOMEN AND CHILDREN FROM \n                   PESTICIDES KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TO CAUSE ADVERSE \n                   HEALTH IMPACTS ON PREGNANT WOMEN, FETAL GROWTH, \n                   OR EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT.\n\n       This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall not \n     apply to the discharge of a pesticide if there is evidence, \n     based on peer-reviewed science, that the pesticide is known \n     or suspected to--\n       (1) cause adverse health effects on pregnant women;\n       (2) cause adverse impacts to fetal growth or development; \n     or\n       (3) cause adverse impacts on early childhood development.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.\n  Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthe bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\n  Madam Speaker, I offer this amendment because I recognize the \ncritical need to protect women, infants, and developing children from \nthe harmful impact of pesticides.\n  The underlying bill, the so-called Zika Vector Control Act, is a \nfarce designed to play on public fears over Zika. It has nothing to do \nwith combating Zika.\n  In fact, Republicans have been pushing the text of the underlying \nlegislation for years under whatever name happens to be convenient at \nthe time.\n  Otherwise known as the pesticide Trojan horse bill, this legislation \nattempts to gut our ability to track and report when and where harmful \npesticides are sprayed.\n  Without oversight compliance, physicians and scientists are less able \nto track and identify the cluster of symptoms caused by pesticides \nwhich, in turn, reduces their ability to protect the public's health.\n  I know, as a physician and public health expert, that pesticides can \nhave serious toxic impacts on human health particularly for women and \nchildren.\n  Pesticides can endanger women and unborn children, cause malformation \nin infants, hinder early childhood development, endanger reproductive \nhealth, and cause cancer.\n  Madam Speaker, I speak as a physician, but I also speak as the son of \nfarm workers. The underlying bill could expose already vulnerable \npopulations to greater risks of contamination from pesticides. Farm \nworkers would be harmed by the unmonitored use of these harmful \npesticides.\n  No oversight of compliance can harm the public's health. That is why \nI am offering this commonsense amendment to protect the health safety \nof our communities and our women and children.\n\n[[Page H3045]]\n\n  Instead of actually working to control the spread of one public \nhealth crisis, the Zika virus, this bill could make another public \nhealth problem even worse.\n  Rather than spending our time on this bill that does nothing to \nstrengthen Zika prevention efforts across the country, we should be \nworking to pass legislation to fully fund efforts to contain and stop \nthe virus before we adjourn.\n  Madam Speaker, last week we voted on an inadequate and unconscionable \nZika funding bill that I opposed. That bill funded only one-third of \nthe request from public health experts.\n  In medicine, you don't just partially treat a patient. That is called \nmalpractice. You don't take out just a third of the cancer. You don't \njust give a third of the antibiotic dose for severe pneumonia.\n  Time is running out. It is past due, Madam Speaker, for you to do \nyour job, protect American families, and fully address the Zika virus \nthreat.\n  This underlying bill does not contain a dime in funding and no \nauthority to protect public health from the spread of the Zika virus. \nIt is an unnecessary bill because vector control agencies already have \nthe authority to use pesticides under a public health emergency like \nthe spread of the Zika virus epidemic.\n  So instead of pushing this Trojan horse, which could actually expose \nvulnerable communities to serious health risks, let's fully fund \nefforts to protect American families from Zika.\n  I urge you to vote ``yes'' to protect the health and safety of women \nand children in this country and to demand that we fully fund efforts \nto combat the spread of the Zika virus before it is too late.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the \nmotion to recommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, this motion to recommit is unnecessary. The \nunderlying bill, H.R. 897, eliminates the duplicative, expensive, and \nunnecessary permit process and helps free up resources for States, \ncounties, and local governments to better combat the spread of Zika. \nBut this motion, in effect, aims to undermine those efforts.\n  There are already adequate protections built in the FIFRA law. The \nFIFRA review process can restrict or deny. The process is rigorous and \nrequires the EPA to evaluate the human health and environmental effects \nof pesticides prior to allowing their use.\n  EPA goes through their process. If there is any risk to the \nenvironment or human health, a pesticide will not get registered with \nan approved label. There won't be a label. It is that simple. It will \nbe a restricted pesticide and won't be approved for use.\n  There are already enough protections in the current FIFRA law. So all \nthis redundancy is just plain unnecessary. So we need to move ahead and \nstop creating unnecessary roadblocks and use the products that we have \nto protect the public.\n  The argument about harming farm workers is just unbelievable, too, \nbecause EPA controls the label. If it is restricted pesticides--which \nEPA can make all pesticides restricted. It has to be a certified \napplicator.\n  So any farm worker has to be under the supervision of a certified \napplicator, and we have that in effect. So farm workers are not harmed \nfrom this. The FIFRA law is adequate.\n  H.R. 897 is a good bill that will help protect pregnant women and \nstop mosquitos before they spread the Zika virus to vulnerable \npopulations.\n  I strongly oppose the motion to recommit, and I urge my colleagues to \nvote ``no.''\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, and the order of the House of today, this 15-minute vote on the \nmotion to recommit will be followed by 5-minute votes on passage of \nH.R. 897, if ordered, and the motion to concur in the Senate amendment \nto H.R. 2576 with an amendment.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 182, \nnays 232, not voting 19, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 236]\n\n                               YEAS--182\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blum\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Cleaver\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeFazio\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Duncan (TN)\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Gutierrez\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Hinojosa\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

Pursuant to House Resolution 743 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 5055.\n  The Chair appoints the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1720\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 5055) making appropriations for energy and water development and \nrelated agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for \nother purposes, with Ms. Ros-Lehtinen in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson) and the gentlewoman from Ohio \n(Ms. Kaptur) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Idaho.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  It is my distinct honor to bring this fiscal year 2017 Energy and \nWater Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act before you \ntoday.\n  Before I go into the details, I would like to recognize the hard work \nof Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Lowey on this bill and in the \nappropriations process in our trying to get back to regular order.\n  I would also like to thank my ranking member, Ms. Kaptur. I \nappreciate her help and her hard work on this bill. This bill is a \nbetter bill because of her input on this legislation.\n  The bill provides $37.4 billion for the activities of the Department \nof Energy, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and \nother agencies under our jurisdiction. This is $259 million more than \nlast year's funding level and is $168 million above the budget request.\n  This is a responsible bill that recognizes the importance of \ninvesting in this Nation's infrastructure and national defense. As we \ndo each year, we work hard to incorporate priorities and perspectives \nfrom both sides of the aisle.\n  The administration's proposal to cut the programs of the Army Corps \nof Engineers by $1.4 billion would have led to economic disruptions at \nour ports and waterways silted in and would have left our communities \nand businesses vulnerable to flooding. Instead, this bill recognizes \nthe critical work of the Corps and provides $6.1 billion for those \nactivities. This includes $1.8 billion for flood and coastal storm \ndamage reduction projects. These projects prevented\n\n[[Page H3048]]\n\ndamages of $14.8 billion in 2014 alone. Harbor maintenance activities \nare funded at $1.26 billion, the same as last year, and $122 million \nmore than the fiscal year 2017 target. The bill makes use of all \nestimated annual revenues from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund.\n  The Department of Energy's nuclear weapons program is funded at $9.3 \nbillion, which is $438 million more than last year. This increase will \nsupport full funding for the stockpile life extension programs. It also \nincludes an additional $106 million above the request to address the \ngrowing backlog of deferred maintenance and $30 million above the \nrequest to upgrade the security infrastructure where nuclear weapons \nmaterial is stored. The recommendation for naval reactors is $1.4 \nbillion, an increase of $45 million, and includes full funding for the \nOhio-class replacement submarine.\n  A national energy policy can only be successful if it maintains \nstability while investing in a secure, independent, and prosperous \nenergy future. This bill makes balanced investments in a true all-of-\nthe-above energy strategy. This bill also takes a strong stand against \nthe regulatory overreach and extreme application of laws that have been \nthe hallmark of this administration.\n  The bill opposes the administration's actions with regard to the \nClean Water Act and includes three provisions that prohibit changes to \nthe definition of ``fill material,'' the definition of ``waters of the \nUnited States,'' and the permit requirement for certain agricultural \nactivities.\n  The bill also includes several provisions to ensure that the Bureau \nof Reclamation maximizes water deliveries in California to help \nalleviate the drought while sustaining senior water rights and \nmaintaining environmental protections.\n  This is a strong bill that will advance our national security \ninterests and our economy, and I urge everyone to support it.\n\n[[Page H3049]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH250516.001\n\n\n\n[[Page H3050]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH250516.002\n\n\n\n[[Page H3051]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH250516.003\n\n\n\n[[Page H3052]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH250516.004\n\n\n\n[[Page H3053]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to thank Chairman Simpson for his bipartisan approach in \npreparing this bill. I also thank Chairman Hal Rogers and Ranking \nMember Nita Lowey for their efforts throughout.\n  To our dedicated staff--Donna Shahbaz and Taunja Berquam, the \nRepublican and Democratic clerks, as well as the rest of the committee \nstaff: Matt Anderson, Angie Giancarlo, Loraine Heckenberg, and Perry \nYates--their countless long hours, late nights, weekends, and \nthoughtful insight are so critical to helping America prepare this \nlegislation.\n  This bill funds transformative programs that unlock America's full \neconomic potential, critical water resource projects, navigation and \nport operability, and breakthrough science advancements that are \nnecessary for America's strategic and competitive posture. This bill \nundergirds our national defense through superior weapons, naval reactor \nresearch, and nonproliferation activities--all priorities that unite \nrather than divide us.\n  Chairman Simpson worked hard to incorporate the interests of Members \nfrom both parties. As a result, the bill's funding reflects priorities \nfrom both sides of the aisle. The chairman's efforts resulted in a bill \nwhich, with respect to funding levels, is reasonable; although, the \ntrade-offs are not ideal.\n  The bill provides an increase of $259 million over the 2016 levels. \nIt allows for stronger investments in the Army Corps of Engineers for \ncritical projects in the Everglades and Great Lakes as well as \nadditional funding to address flooding in areas like Houston. Notably, \nfor the people of northern Ohio, the bill meets the need to comply with \nState law prior to the open lake disposal of dredged materials. The \nbill also provides robust funding for many areas at the Department of \nEnergy.\n  It is sad, however, that the majority would jeopardize this good \nstart by adding in ill-suited ideological or non-germane riders on the \nClean Water Act, guns on Army Corps' lands, National Ocean Policy, and \nthe California drought. I should not have to remind our majority \ncolleagues that similar provisions imperiled the passage of this bill \nin the past. In fiscal year 2016, nearly all of the Democratic Members \nof the House voted against this bill with far fewer poison pill riders. \nThe administration is on record with veto threats over nearly identical \nlanguage. As such, I cannot support this bill in its current form.\n  Every year, this important bill sets the path for America's energy \nfuture, and I am happy to note that, more than ever before, America's \ncourse is set toward the true north of energy independence. In 2015, \nAmerica produced 91 percent of the total energy consumed. This \nrepresents the 10th consecutive year of declining net energy imports. \nThis translates into freedom.\n  Significant strides toward America's energy security should be \napplauded, but we must not lose our momentum by resting on our laurels. \nTo finally free ourselves from our energy dependence, as well as to \ndrastically cut dangerous carbon emissions, we must strongly support \nthe Department of Energy's efforts to embrace the future.\n  I am disappointed by the $248 million cut, therefore, to the Office \nof Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which is leading the charge \ninto the new energy economy against stiff global competition from \nEurope and Asia. The solar energy account, in particular, yields \nserious benefits, with the solar industry projected to add 9.5 \ngigawatts of new energy this year--more than any other source. I am \nproud that my own district is active in this energy revolution, with \nFirst Solar, founded in Toledo, Ohio, the Nation's current leading \nsolar company.\n  Wind energy is also expanding in northern Ohio, where the Great Lakes \nhave the capacity to become the Saudi Arabia of wind, especially Lake \nErie. Cleveland is poised to install the first national offshore wind \nturbines in a freshwater environment, and that is appropriate, given it \nwas Cleveland where the first electric wind turbine was invented a \ncentury ago.\n  I would like to reiterate my concerns over the controversial riders \nthat threaten not only the ultimate enactment of this bill but also our \nmost precious resource--water. These provisions' inclusion does a \ndisservice in our work, particularly given the serious water challenges \nmany parts of our country face.\n  While I have concerns with the measure before us, I would like to \nexpress my deep appreciation for the chairman's hard work with us on so \nmany issues. The gentleman from Idaho has ensured that the Energy and \nWater Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee continues its \ntradition of bipartisanship, and he has been a gentleman throughout, as \nalways.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the chairman of the full \ncommittee that does a great job with this appropriations process.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Chair, I rise today to support this \nlegislation that invests $37.4 billion in bipartisan priorities: our \nnational security, critical infrastructure, and American energy \nindependence. In total, this is a $259 million increase above current \nlevels for these programs. This increase is directed almost entirely to \nour nuclear national security. With ever-changing threats that span the \nglobe, it is imperative that our Nation stays at the very pinnacle of \npreparedness. This funding will help ensure that our stockpile is \nmodern, secure, and ready to face any nuclear threat that may arise.\n  Another priority in the bill is the infrastructure that helps our \neconomy prosper. This includes robust funding for the Army Corps of \nEngineers, a total of $6.1 billion, which is $100 million above last \nyear's levels, and $1.5 billion above the President's request. This \nfunding will go to activities that have a direct impact on public \nsafety, that improve commerce and the movement of American products, \nand that support economic growth and job creation.\n  Lastly, Madam Chair, this bill advances an all-of-the-above energy \nstrategy that will help the Nation move ever closer to our goal of \nenergy independence. By investing in fossil fuels, nuclear, and other \nenergy sources, we can help keep consumer energy prices affordable and \nmake greater use of our domestic resources. This includes congressional \nefforts to support the Yucca Mountain nuclear repository for future \nuse.\n  In order to make these targeted investments, the bill cuts back in \nother lower priority areas. Renewable energy programs, which have \nreceived significant investments in recent years, were cut by $248 \nmillion from current levels.\n  The bill also prohibits tax dollars from being used for a harmful \nregulatory agenda that hampers our economy. This includes prohibiting \nfunds for the Army Corps of Engineers to make any changes to Federal \njurisdiction under the Clean Water Act, protecting American farmers and \nranchers and other job creators. The bill also protects coal and other \nmining operations from onerous efforts to change the definition of \n``fill material'' and ``discharge of fill material.''\n  In sum, this bill is an investment in the growth of our American \neconomy, supporting functioning and safe water resources and continued \nstrides toward energy independence.\n  I thank and congratulate Subcommittee Chairman Simpson, Ranking \nMember Kaptur, and the other members of the subcommittee for their hard \nwork on bringing this bill forward. I feel completely safe and \ncomfortable in the work when Chairman Simpson is doing the bossing.\n  I also want to acknowledge the dedicated staff that helped bring this \nbill before the House today.\n  I urge my colleagues to help promote a more secure and more \nprosperous future for our Nation and vote ``aye'' on the bill.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Mrs. Lowey).\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, before I begin, I would like to thank \nChairman Simpson, Ranking Member Kaptur, and Chairman Rogers for their \nwork on the bill.\n  The energy and water bill is the second bill we will consider on the \nfloor this year. Over and over again, the majority has promised a \nreturn to regular\n\n[[Page H3054]]\n\norder. Well, without a budget resolution and a full slate of 302(b) \nsuballocations, this promise has clearly not been kept.\n  The fiscal year 2017 Energy and Water Development bill would allocate \n$37.4 billion in discretionary funding, $260 million above the fiscal \nyear 2016 level and $168 million above the administration's request. \nWhile this allocation is an improvement, the majority's continued \ndysfunction jeopardizes Congress' ability to meet the significant \nchallenges we face, including many in the bill before us.\n  For instance, the bill does not adequately invest in infrastructure \ndevelopment. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates the \nUnited States must invest $3.6 trillion in our infrastructure to ensure \npublic health and safety, and yet the Army Corps of Engineers is funded \nat $6.089 billion, which is billions of dollars short of what we need \nto meet our infrastructure needs.\n  Additionally, this bill does not adequately fund programs to combat \nclimate change. To truly tackle the challenges posed by climate change, \nthe Federal Government must prioritize investments in research. Yet the \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy account would be reduced to \n$1.825 billion, a cut of $248 million, and $1.07 billion below the \nPresident's request. The Republican majority will continue to bury \ntheir heads in the sand and dismiss the science and consequences of \nclimate change instead of taking action to save our planet.\n  However, the most concerning aspect of this bill is the inclusion of \nmisguided and dangerous policy riders. An annual appropriations bill is \nnot the place to amend or significantly change the Clean Water Act or \nrestrict gun laws. These controversial riders, year after year, imperil \nthe appropriations process.\n  Yet this year's energy and water bill would impede an effective and \ntimely response to the continuing drought in California, permanently \nprohibit the Corps from changing the definition of ``fill material,'' \nwhich is an interest of mountaintop mining companies, permanently \nprohibit the Army Corps of Engineers from clarifying the definition of \nnavigable waters, expand the area in which guns can be carried on Corps \nof Engineers lands, and prevent implementation of the national ocean \npolicy. Neither Democrats in Congress nor President Obama will agree to \npoison pill riders that harm our environment or public health.\n  Unfortunately, this bill fails to address our Nation's infrastructure \nneeds, invest in job creation, and take appropriate action to combat \nclimate change.\n  Given inadequate funding levels and the presence of harmful riders, I \nurge my colleagues to oppose the bill.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Lance).\n  Mr. LANCE. Madam Chair, I rise today in strong support of this energy \nand water appropriations measure. The measure finally provides the \ncritical funding to complete the Rahway River basin flood risk \nmanagement feasibility study in New Jersey that will create a lasting \nsolution to protect the communities of Cranford, Kenilworth, Maplewood, \nMillburn, Rahway, Springfield, Union, and the surrounding areas from \nsevere flooding.\n  For years, these municipalities have pursued this project on its \ngreat merits, and I am proud to have been the champion of these \nmunicipalities on the Federal level. This is a critical role for \nFederal representatives effectively helping municipal, county, and \nState officials navigate the Federal Government and ensure efficient \nservices to the areas they represent. These municipalities have \nexperienced severe flooding from the Rahway River, and they deserve the \ncompletion of the study and the implementation of a plan that will \nprotect life and property.\n  I thank the Mayors' Council and local leaders for continuing to \nadvocate on behalf of their communities. I deeply thank Chairman \nSimpson and the Appropriations Committee for their thoughtful \nconsideration of the study and their leadership during this process.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the measure.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Honda), a very hardworking member of our subcommittee.\n  Mr. HONDA. Madam Chairwoman, I thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking \nMember Kaptur for their hard work on this bill. It is an honor to serve \nwith them on the subcommittee.\n  This bill contains many positive things that I support, like funding \nfor the Army Corps of Engineers' construction account and programs that \nprovide the Corps with critical oceans and weather data.\n  It also includes strong funding for energy storage technologies as \nwell as provisions that support increasing access to solar and \nrenewable energy and promote increasing energy efficiency through smart \nelectronics.\n  However, there are many cuts that are problematic, particularly those \nto the energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. We have an \nopportunity now to lead the world in innovating the next generation of \nenergy technologies, but we are hamstringing our ability to be \ncompetitive by underfunding critical energy programs\n  Furthermore, I oppose the prohibition on the Department of Energy and \nArmy Corps participating in marine and coastal planning efforts that \nare components of the National Ocean Policy. This provision is \nmisguided and reduces our ability to protect our oceans, Great Lakes, \nand waterways that support our Nation's blue economy.\n  Coordinated ocean planning that encourages collaboration between \nstakeholders and Federal agencies will help improve the management of \nour marine resources, and it is unwise to stop those conversations from \nhappening.\n  Finally, I would also oppose the rider which would prohibit the Army \nCorps from enforcing the ban on firearms at water resources development \nprojects. This provision unnecessarily creates an unsafe environment at \nthese sites. Corps rangers are not authorized to carry firearms, and \nthis provision also strips away the discretion that the Secretary of \nthe Army currently has to enforce or revise the policy on a case-by-\ncase basis.\n  Ultimately, appropriations bills are an exercise in setting spending \npriorities, and I disagree with many of the prioritizations that this \nbill makes. I hope we can work together as this bill moves forward to \ndevelop a bill that will invest in clean energy.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Chair, I just want to inquire how much time remains \non this side before we move forward.\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio has 19 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for the tireless \nwork that he has done on these appropriations.\n  I want to take a moment to thank another Representative, \nRepresentative David Valadao. It is rare to find a person so tirelessly \ndevoted to his constituents. Every time the House passes legislation to \naddress the drought crisis in California, David Valadao is at the \ncenter of it.\n  Like Congressman Valadao, I also represent the people of the Central \nValley of California. For too long, our constituents have been \nsuffering, so I am going to put this as simply as possible. We need \nwater.\n  California Republicans have tried for years--three Congresses now--to \nget a water bill signed into law to help the people of California. As \nthe drought worsened and its reach grew, we tried last year to get \nlegislation through the Senate that would help all the States in the \nWest facing drought conditions. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats opposed \nthe legislation and blocked it.\n  So we tried again. We added in provisions from my Republican \ncolleagues and provisions supported by our California Senators, ideas \nboth sides could support. We worked to make this bill as bipartisan as \npossible and focused on good policy. Again, our efforts were blocked.\n  But my constituents can't and won't take no for an answer. Water is \nnot a luxury. It is a necessity, and we need it now more than ever. And \nit is very clear how we can get more water.\n  Now, earlier this year, bureaucrats allowed water from storms to \nflush out into the ocean instead of capturing it for our communities. \nRegulations and bad laws are keeping water from the\n\n[[Page H3055]]\n\npeople who need it. We need more pumping, and we need more storage \ncapturing more runoff.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Too many times our Senate Democratic colleagues have ignored or \nblocked action to help the people of California. So today, the Senate \ncan no longer ignore it. They need to come to the table and negotiate \nwith us in conference.\n  After all, this should not be controversial. We were elected to serve \nour constituents, and our constituents need water.\n  My colleagues and I have come back again and again to find an \nagreement because, as El Nino passes and the drought continues, our \nhomes, our farms, and our people won't see relief until something is \ndone. Now is the moment.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Foster), who is a very hardworking member of the \nCommittee on Financial Services and the Committee on Science, Space, \nand Technology.\n  Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, this appropriations bill would underfund the \nOffice of Science by $272 million below the President's request for the \nnext fiscal year. Investments in the DOE Office of Science have long \nsupported American innovation and discovery science.\n  It is unwise and, in fact, impossible to ignore the value of our \nnational labs. They have helped us answer fundamental questions about \nhow our universe works, supported breakthroughs in medicine and \ndevelopments in industry that drive our economy. The Office of Science \nis not only an important investment in our future, it is a valuable \ninvestment in our economy.\n  Our national labs and the major user facilities housed at those labs \nare some of the greatest tools ever created for researchers and \nindustry. The direct economic benefit of Argonne and Fermilab in \nIllinois alone is estimated to be more than $1.3 billion annually. The \nindirect benefits of the technologies that they deliver is larger.\n  Those who seek to underfund and eliminate Federal programs often say \nthat the private sector can do it better, but when it comes to \nfundamental scientific research, that is simply not the case.\n  The Office of Science is responsible for building and maintaining \nresearch facilities which many private companies rely on but are too \nbig for any single business or university to develop. These user \nfacilities, such as the advanced photon source at Argonne National \nLaboratory, are a critical research tool to academics and industry \nalike. For example, AbbVie, recently won FDA approval for a new \nleukemia drug that was developed because of the groundbreaking \ncrystallography research done at Argonne's APS.\n  As other world powers are growing and challenging our position as a \nglobal leader in science and innovation, we cannot afford to let the \nnumber of American scientists and researchers or the quality of their \nresearch facilities diminish.\n  Madam Chair, we must continue to invest in American innovation and \nfully fund the research and development conducted through the DOE \nOffice of Science.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa).\n  Mr. COSTA. Madam Chair, I want to thank the chairman, Mr. Simpson, \nfor yielding me this time.\n  This legislation that is before us gives Congress a new opportunity \nto give California an ability in the water provisions that are \ncontained within this law that will help relieve the devastating \ndrought that has been impacting Californians both in the short term and \nin the long term.\n  In the absence of getting a comprehensive water bill passed into \nlaw--which I have not given up hope for, and my colleagues on both \nsides are still working on a bipartisan basis with Senator Feinstein--I \nhope my colleagues, in the meantime, will join me in supporting the \nprovisions in this bill that Congressman Valadao has been able to \nprovide that will, in fact, contain relief to the people of California \nwhom we represent and who have been most impacted by this drought.\n  Between December of last year and May of this year, hundreds of \nthousands of acre-feet went out to the bay, to the ocean, that could \nhave been provided for farms and farm communities in the valley, that \nwould have helped farmworkers and farmers. Unfortunately, that water \nwas lost.\n  The Federal Government cannot allow this to happen again. Congress \nmust pass this bill so that next year, if we do have the water during \nthe rain and snowy seasons between November and April of next year, we \nwill be able to capture that water desperately needed instead of \nallowing it to flow out to the ocean.\n  Even under the flawed biological opinions, these amendments make \nsense. I commend my colleagues for inserting them here.\n  I want to thank the chairman for yielding me this time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Chair, I rise for a couple reasons. One is to wish \nmy noble brother well back home. The other is to yield to the \ngentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) to enter into a colloquy.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Madam Chair, I thank Ranking Member Kaptur.\n  I rise today to speak about the importance of the funding of the \nOffice of Public Participation within the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, known fondly to us as the FERC, an office that has never \nbeen active despite prior authorization.\n  With the expansion of natural gas infrastructure in the Northeast and \nacross the country, it makes sense that we finally fund the Office of \nPublic Participation to better incorporate the voices of average \ncitizens in FERC proceedings and provide robust outreach efforts to \ncommunities and individuals that are impacted by energy projects.\n  Considering the broad authority that the FERC has over domestic \nenergy markets and its control over the approval of energy \ninfrastructure projects, average citizens simply do not have a \nsufficient public interest presence on the national level. With 27 \nStates offering an existing consumer advocacy office, it is imperative \nthat a similar national office be established within the FERC.\n  Constituents in my home State of New Hampshire are all too familiar \nwith feeling shut out of the FERC process. The recently withdrawn \nNortheast Energy Direct natural gas pipeline would have impacted 18 \nsmall towns across my district and into the neighboring district.\n  Due in large part to the organizing efforts of citizens within these \nsmall towns, the NED pipeline's application within FERC was withdrawn \nthis week, but this reality provides only momentary comfort because we \nall know that the FERC is in serious need of repair.\n  I understand that my Republican colleagues have interest in working \nto bring the Office of Public Participation to fruition and in making \nadditional structural changes to the FERC. I look forward to working \nclosely with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to move this \neffort forward.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Chair, I would commit to working with the very able \ngentlewoman from New Hampshire to see what progress we could make on \nthis very important issue.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I yield to the gentleman from Idaho.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I look forward to working with the \ngentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member, and our \ncolleagues on the Committee on Energy and Commerce to see if we can \nfind an appropriate path forward on this issue.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Gibson).\n  Mr. GIBSON. Madam Chair, let me express my gratitude to the chairman \nand the ranking member. I am here today to support the bill and to \nreally urge my colleagues to continue to work together so that we can \nmake progress on clean and renewable energy and energy efficiencies. I \noffer three points as to why.\n  First of all, it is important to us to be an independent nation. \nAfter four combat tours in Iraq, I am very eager to see us become \nenergy independent, and certainly that requires an all-of-the-above \nenergy strategy, including the renewable energy sources: solar power, \nwind, hydro, geothermal, biomass. All of these in upstate New York\n\n[[Page H3056]]\n\nare making a significant advance, and I want to see us continue to \nfacilitate this.\n  We are a country that can do hard things. We have shown that time and \nagain. We put a man on the Moon. We stood up to the Communist \nchallenge. We did so in part because of research, development, and \nprototyping. The investments we made were so critical to that, and we \nnot only won the cold war, but we also got the supercomputer, we got \nthe Internet, and we ushered in the information age.\n  I think if we make similar investments--and we will have an amendment \nhere shortly on ARPA-E. I appreciate what the chairman has done to \nsupport the program. I think this is very important. It would also \noffer jobs in my district and all throughout New York. This has been \nhelpful to jobs.\n  Finally, the environment, how important it is. We want to be good \nstewards of our resources. To me, a conservative, you are certainly \nprotecting all resources, including natural resources. To me, if \nconservation isn't conservative, well, then, words have no meaning at \nall.\n  So renewable energy sources and also the criticality of energy \nefficiencies, a kilowatt-hour saved is a kilowatt-hour produced. I know \nwe have made progress. I appreciate the work of the committee. I urge \nus to continue that and double our efforts going forward.\n  Finally, I will say that I appreciate what Ms. Kuster mentioned just \nmoments ago. This is a bill I look forward to working on with her. I \nthink it is a step in the right direction.\n  Thank you for your great work, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. HONDA. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, did the gentleman yield back his time?\n  Mr. HONDA. Yes, I yielded back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Let me just say that this is an important bill. It is an important \nbill for our economy, and it is an important bill for our defense.\n  I did want to say that I appreciate the staff and the hard work that \nthey have put into this legislation, trying to address the requests of \nmany Members. We have had something like--I can't remember the \nnumbers--2300 different requests from Members for this piece of \nlegislation, and we were able to address, in at least one form or \nanother, about 95 percent of those requests. The staff works very hard \nto make this a bill that all Members can support.\n  It has been a pleasure working with the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. \nKaptur). She is from Ohio. I am from Idaho. We come from different \nStates and have different perspectives and different points of view and \ndifferent interests many times, and it is fun to sit in our hearings \nbecause oftentimes she brings up issues that I would have never thought \nof as we have people before us testifying, and I hope I do the same \noccasionally, too, and all our members do that. That is what really \nmakes this process work.\n  That is why getting back to regular order and debating bills and \nmarking them up and going to conference, as the Speaker and leader and \nminority leader have tried to do here, is so important.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Carter of Georgia). All time for general debate \nhas expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  During consideration of the bill for amendment, each amendment shall \nbe debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the \nproponent and an opponent.

Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment that will help \nreduce the large backlog of important Army Corps of Engineers' \nprojects. This amendment transfers $1 million from the Department of \nEnergy's departmental administration budget to the Army Corps of \nEngineers' investigations account to bring it up to fiscal year 2016 \nenacted levels.\n  The investigations account funds the planning and environmental \nstudies required under the law for important Corps projects prior to \nconstruction.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  There is a backlog of worthwhile Corps projects throughout the \ncountry that are essential to improving water infrastructure for \ncommunities, improving ecosystem restoration, providing clean water, \nand expanding much-needed water storage. These projects are especially \ncritical to the drought-stricken communities in the West, and many \nother parts of the Nation.\n  The committee showed great insight in recognizing that the \nadministration's request for the Corps' investigation budget was much \ntoo low, stating in the committee report: ``Once again, the \nadministration's claims to understand the importance of infrastructure \nring hollow when it comes to water resource infrastructure investments. \nIn fact, if enacted, the budget request would represent the lowest \nlevel of funding for the Civil Works program since fiscal year 2004.''\n  At a time of historic drought and major water challenges, we \nshouldn't be reducing investigation dollars that will allow worthwhile \ncommunity projects to move forward.\n\n[[Page H3057]]\n\n  The committee has provided significant safeguards in the report to \nensure that the funds transferred by this amendment will go to planning \nfor the most viable projects and ``studies that will enhance the \nNation's economic development, job growth, and international \ncompetitiveness; are for projects located in areas that have suffered \nrecent natural disasters; or are for projects to address legal \nrequirements.''\n  Support for this amendment is definitive action we can take to \ndirectly support timely development of critical water infrastructure \nprojects.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the \ndistinguished chair and ranking member for their work on this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask for a positive vote on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at \nthe desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Carter of Georgia). The Clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 5, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $10,000,000)(increased by $10,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Illinois and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, America's navigation infrastructure is crumbling. Most \nof the locks and dams on the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois \nWaterway System were built in the 1920s and 1930s, and have far \noutlived their life expectancy. Unfortunately, we have not kept up with \nthe maintenance and upgrades necessary to ensure that they can \ntransport 21st century cargo that fuels and feeds the world.\n  Sixty percent of the grain exported from the United States goes \nthrough these locks and dams before hitting the global marketplace. But \ndelays at navigation locks continue to get worse, lasting as long as 12 \nhours at a given time. And while a 2003 study by the Illinois Farm \nBureau estimated these delays to cost midwestern farmers $500 an hour, \none can only assume how much more these delays cost today.\n  In the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, Congress authorized \nthe construction of seven new 1,200-foot locks along the Upper \nMississippi River and the Illinois Waterway System. This bill also \nauthorized the Navigation and Ecosystem Sustainability Program, or \nNESP, an important dual-purposed program that allows the Corps of \nEngineers to address both navigation and ecosystem restoration in an \nintegrated approach.\n  It is supported widely by industry as well as conservation groups. In \naddition, the Governors of five States, from both political parties--\nMinnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri--and more than 50 \nbipartisan Members of the House and Senate have expressed support \nadvancing NESP.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has taken few steps to implement \nNESP, and, once again, did not request any funding to continue pre-\nconstruction engineering and design activities for authorized lock \nprojects on the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway System. \nIf these pre-construction efforts are delayed further, we risk further \ndelays of these projects actually getting off the ground and moving \nforward at such time as the moneys for them are available.\n  With this amendment, we tell the Corps that enough is enough. It is \ntime to stop delaying the necessary work. We must ensure these \nconstruction projects are ready to go on day one.\n  I also want to thank my colleague, Darin LaHood, who was going to \ncome speak on this amendment, but I don't see him here. It started a \nlittle sooner, Mr. Chairman, than what we envisioned. But Mr. LaHood, I \nknow, would like to reiterate some of the comments I made. And he \nrepresents two of these locks that are included in this study.\n  Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Illinois has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I am going to try and \nstall until my colleague gets here.\n  I do want to say this amendment, this project, has wide bipartisan \nsupport. This is an opportunity for us to look at the global \nmarketplace and the products that go up and down the Mississippi River \nand the Illinois Waterway System. This is how we feed the world.\n  We have some of the most fertile and expensive farmland in Illinois, \nMissouri, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, and so many of these products \nthat use these systems are the ones that are exporting into the global \nmarketplace and also to Third World countries to feed those who need \nfood the most.\n  As a matter of fact, just a few weeks ago, my colleague, Mr. LaHood, \nand I toured some outdated facilities.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I am happy to hear the gentleman's deep interest in that \ncorridor of Illinois and Mississippi, and I would look forward to the \ngentleman's assistance on trying to prevent the Asian carp from moving \nfurther north in those channels and into the entire Great Lakes system, \ndestroying our natural fish population.\n  So I just wanted to put that on the record, and I thank the gentleman \nso much for showing an interest in both the infrastructure and the \nenvironmental restoration in those corridors.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Reclaiming my time, I would like to \nthank the gentlewoman, too. This is an opportunity to address both of \nthose issues.\n  Obviously, representing part of the Mississippi River, like I do, we \nhave seen the Asian carp problem firsthand. As a matter of fact, a \nplant opened in my district not too long ago to process Asian carp to \nbe able to get fish oil and fishmeal that is used for pet food and \nother commodities. Unfortunately, they didn't anticipate the smell.\n  So you can't really build a fish processing plant around homes. And I \nthink they figured that out. But we need ingenuous ideas and \nopportunities like that to be able to address that Asian carp problem, \nbecause it is an invasive species and we need to do everything we can \nin a bipartisan way to work together to put a stop to it entering the \nGreat Lakes or any other waterway.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I learned that, in the Peoria region, all \nthe natural fish have disappeared now as a result of the invasion of \nthe Asian carp there.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Reclaiming my time, I wouldn't say all \nthe natural fish, but I know that the Asian carp infestation has grown \nsubstantially more than what was envisioned when they were brought in.\n  Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman's time has expired.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).\n\n[[Page H3058]]\n\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                              construction\n\n       For expenses necessary for the construction of river and \n     harbor, flood and storm damage reduction, shore protection, \n     aquatic ecosystem restoration, and related projects \n     authorized by law; for conducting detailed studies, and plans \n     and specifications, of such projects (including those \n     involving participation by States, local governments, or \n     private groups) authorized or made eligible for selection by \n     law (but such detailed studies, and plans and specifications, \n     shall not constitute a commitment of the Government to \n     construction); $1,945,580,000, to remain available until \n     expended; of which such sums as are necessary to cover the \n     Federal share of construction costs for facilities under the \n     Dredged Material Disposal Facilities program shall be derived \n     from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund as authorized by \n     Public Law 10409303; and of which such sums as are \n     necessary to cover one-half of the costs of construction, \n     replacement, rehabilitation, and expansion of inland \n     waterways projects shall be derived from the Inland Waterways \n     Trust Fund, except as otherwise specifically provided for in \n     law: Provided, That the Secretary may initiate up to, but not \n     more than, four new construction starts during fiscal year \n     2017: Provided further, That the new construction starts will \n     consist of three projects where the majority of the benefits \n     are derived from navigation transportation savings or from \n     flood and storm damage reduction and one project where the \n     majority of the benefits are derived from environmental \n     restoration: Provided further, That for new construction \n     projects, project cost sharing agreements shall be executed \n     as soon as practicable but no later than August 31, 2017: \n     Provided further, That no allocation for a new start shall be \n     considered final and no work allowance shall be made until \n     the Secretary provides to the Committees on Appropriations of \n     both Houses of Congress an out-year funding scenario \n     demonstrating the affordability of the selected new starts \n     and the impacts on other projects: Provided further, That the \n     Secretary may not deviate from the new starts proposed in the \n     work plan, once the plan has been submitted to the Committees \n     on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress.\n\n\n              Amendment Offered by Mr. Clawson of Florida\n\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 3, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $50,000,000)''.\n       Page 46, line 16, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $50,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment to the \nEnergy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. \nI especially have full appreciation and admiration and respect for the \nchairman. I know he is going to go against me and this is going to get \nvoted down, but as both a leader and the chairman, I have full \nadmiration for what he does for our country, and he is an example to \npeople like me, by the way.\n  My amendment would move $50 million from the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve account into the Army Corps' construction account, which \nfinances our Nation's water infrastructure projects.\n  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve account, currently funded at $257 \nmillion, has increased by millions of dollars in each omnibus. This \nfunding is currently $68 million higher than it was back in the 2014 \nomnibus.\n  There is a management/cost question here because, at the same time \nthe costs have been going up at a significant level, the amount of oil \na barrel stored has stayed flat or gone down.\n  The American taxpayer is paying more and more every year, in a low \ninflation environment, mind you, for the same amount or less oil. I \njust think we ought to put the pressure on people to manage within \ntheir cost structure as opposed to asking the taxpayer to pay the \nincrease.\n  Moreover, I want the Army Corps' construction account to increase by \n$50 million because in South Florida we are suffering a year of \necological and economic disaster. It is an El Nino year, and the rains \nhave raised the levels of stagnant water in Lake Okeechobee beyond the \ncapacity of the Herbert Hoover Dike.\n  Consequently, unwanted fresh waters flow east and west down the St. \nLucie and Caloosahatchee Rivers, polluting the Gulf of Mexico. \nCountless fish and wildlife pay a price with their lives, and our \nfishermen and tourism industry pay a major economic price as well, \nwhile the cost structure of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve account \ngoes up.\n  As summer approaches, Lake Okeechobee water levels are, again, rising \ndangerously and we are about to have another ecological disaster. It is \non our doorstep, and it is not right. My people can hardly bear it.\n  So I say let's do the right thing and move $50 million more into the \nArmy Corps' construction account for projects that will help my \ndistrict and other districts around the country with similar projects.\n  To quote the conscience of our Congress, John Lewis, I think he would \nsay: let's make this place a little cleaner, let's make our environment \na little greener, and maybe our country a little kinder. Less money for \nSG costs, more money for fresh water and for our environment and for \nour economy.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, first, let me say that I appreciate the \ngentleman's kind words, and I am sympathetic to my colleague's interest \nin funding the construction account, including the flood and storm \ndamage reduction projects such as the Herbert Hoover Dike.\n  Unfortunately, because we no longer do earmarks, as Congress used to \ndo, moving $50 million into an account doesn't guarantee that project \nwould necessarily be done by the Army Corps of Engineers. It just \nincreases the total amount in that account. In fact, the underlying \nbill increases the construction funding by $856 million, or almost 80 \npercent above the budget request of the administration.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  For flood and storm damage reduction activity specifically, the bill \nmore than doubles the budget request. This includes a total of $392 \nmillion, for which the Herbert Hoover Dike could compete for additional \nfunding. Since the dike is a DSC1 dam safety project, I am sure it will \ncompete well for the work plan funds if it is able to use additional \nfunding in fiscal year 2017.\n  However, we must balance all the needs, and that means I cannot \nsupport a reduction in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve account. The \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve stores petroleum to protect the Nation from \nadverse economic impacts due to petroleum supply interruptions.\n  The funding in this bill is necessary for the operation and \nmaintenance of the Reserve as well as to address the backlog of \ndeferred maintenance at the Reserve. We must adequately fund these \nactivities to maintain our energy security.\n  For example, it does us no good to have this petroleum if we can't \naccess it in an emergency. For those reasons, even though I am \nsympathetic to what the gentleman is trying to do, I urge my colleagues \nto vote ``no'' on the amendment.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. As with the chairman of the subcommittee, I rise in \nreluctant opposition to this amendment. I like its intent, but not the \nmeans by which the able gentleman from Florida (Mr. Clawson) gets to \nhis bottom line.\n  I think our major objection on this side is cutting the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. While I do support the Corps' construction account--\nand, just for the Record, the account that we have proposed for \nconstruction is $855 million over the 2017 budget request and $83.3 \nmillion over what is being expended this time.\n  But we have a $60 billion backlog, $60 billion for what we need to do \nin the Corps throughout this country. So we have a problem there; so, I \nwould therefore oppose the amendment and recommend a ``no'' vote.\n  But maybe, in working with the gentleman, we can find ways in future \nyears to increase the overall account again. But I truly appreciate his \nleadership and his efforts on this important issue.\n\n[[Page H3059]]\n\n  I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments. Maybe at some \npoint in time this Congress will get back to the point where Members of \nCongress can actually direct what activities are being done and \nindividual projects in their districts because nobody knows their \ndistrict better than the Members of Congress do.\n  When we had earmarks in the past, admittedly, we went too far, did \nsome frivolous things, all that kind of stuff, and I understand why we \ninstituted an earmark ban. But sometimes we go too far in the other \ndirection. That pendulum sometimes swings too far in the other \ndirection.\n  Members of Congress ought to have a say in what is done in their \ndistricts. At this time that is hard to do, but I appreciate what the \ngentleman is trying to do.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. With all humility, I appreciate the increase \nin the projects and understand that you all are doing a great job.\n  You all have to understand that this is a disaster and everybody gets \ndisaster funding in our country but my district and my State.\n  So when there is a hurricane somewhere else, the President says it is \nemergency funding and everybody gets their money. But when it is an El \nNino year and all that dirty water comes down that river and my \ndistrict gets wiped out by it, the President doesn't do anything. We \ndon't do anything.\n  It is about to happen again in August. You all have to understand, \nfor my constituents, that lake is up high again and it is rainy season. \nWe are going to say, no, my bill is not going to get heard on the floor \nof the House, and my district is going to be underwater with dirty \nwater. There is going to be fish piled up on the beach, and we are \ngoing to be a Congress that hasn't done anything about it.\n  So I hear you all and understand and agree with it and appreciate it. \nBut we have to have a bias for action, in my view. So I am just going \nfor more.\n  I hope you all forgive me for wanting a recorded vote, but you all \nhave to understand my folks are suffering right now. I hope Members \nunderstand that. This is a big deal to us.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Clawson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n            Amendment Offered by Mr. Rice of South Carolina\n\n  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 3, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $2,241,850)''.\n       Page 50, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $2,241,850)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I would like to start by \nthanking Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur for their hard work \non this important legislation.\n  My amendment transfers $2.2 million from the Department of Energy, \nDepartmental Administration account, to the Army Corps of Engineers' \nconstruction account.\n  The intent of this amendment is for additional construction funds to \nbe used for the Army Corps' shore protection mission.\n  Shore protection projects are critical safeguards for life and \nproperty in coastal districts like mine, protecting millions of lives \nand billions of dollars of property.\n  These projects protect against storm surge, erosion, and flooding, \nwhich are all too common. Not only are our beaches an important safety \nbuffer, but they are also economic drivers.\n  The State of South Carolina knows this well after suffering the \ndevastating flood event associated with Hurricane Joaquin last October.\n  As a result of this major disaster, the authorized Myrtle Beach shore \nprotection project suffered damages of approximately 700,000 cubic \nyards of sand and $17 million. My amendment would protect projects \nacross the country like the Myrtle Beach project.\n  I want to thank the chairman for working with me in the wake of the \ndisaster on pertinent flood and storm damage accounts in this year's \nfunding bill.\n  I also want to thank the Army Corps for working with project sponsors \nfor inclusion in this year's work plan.\n  Two of the reaches of the project fit Public Law 84-99 emergency \ncriteria, resulting in a Corps recommendation of action. The Corps, \nwhile they recommended action, did not have available resources to \naddress both reaches this year, imposing a safety and property \nvulnerability in our area.\n  For that reason, I think it appropriate to increase the Corps' \nconstruction account to allow significant projects like the one in \nnorth Myrtle Beach, which lost 241,850 cubic yards of sand in October, \nto compete for funding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The Apalachicola, Chattahoochee, and Flint River system is a \ncritically important asset to the Southeastern United States' ecology, \neconomy, and heritage.\n  Unfortunately, it has also become a point of intense political \nfriction and lengthy, ongoing, and extremely costly litigation. I \nstrongly believe that, if we could get away from the politics and the \nlawsuits, we would have a much better chance of resolving this issue in \na way that brings us together rather than divides us.\n  That is why I am optimistic about the recent work of the \nApalachicola, Chattahoochee, and Flint Stakeholders, a diverse group of \nprivate citizens who live and work in the ACF Basin. They represent the \nwhole spectrum of stakeholders, public and private, from Florida, \nGeorgia, and Alabama.\n  They have been able to unite around the common mission of changing \nthe management of the ACF Basin to create a healthier economy and \nenvironment, which will benefit everyone, and they have made a number \nof recommendations to the Corps of Engineers to meet their goal of a \nsustainable ACF Basin.\n  The ACF Stakeholder group has identified significant gaps in \nfundamental, scientific, and technical knowledge needed to best manage \nthis natural resource. One of those recommendations is that the Corps \nconduct more basic scientific research on the entire river basin and \nbay.\n  My amendment is intended to provide a small amount of money to the \nCorps so that they can simply do more of that kind of research in the \nACF.\n  In short, there is a whole lot that we still don't know about how \nwater moves throughout the ACF Basin, and I believe it is simply common \nsense that, if we have better information about this unique natural \nresource, we, in turn, can manage it better for today and generations \nto come.\n  Let's follow the good example of the ACF Stakeholders and work \ntogether to get this done.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, although I am \nnot opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Idaho is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I will not oppose this amendment because \nit does not require the Corps to fund anything in particular.\n  We have had other similar amendments already tonight, and I would \njust like to remind my colleagues that these amendments--simply \nincreasing the funding level of a particular account, they do not \ndirect that funding to a particular activity.\n  If they did fund specific projects, those would be congressional \nearmarks that are no longer allowed. As we talked about on the last \namendment, frankly, that is something I would like to change myself, \nand I know that the ranking member would, also.\n  But since this amendment only changes the overall account level, I \nwill not oppose it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. GRAHAM.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 13, beginning on line 3, strike section 108.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is very simple: it strikes \nsection 108 of this bill. Section 108 would prevent the Army Corps of \nEngineers from updating the definitions of the terms ``fill material'' \nor ``discharge of fill material.''\n  These definitions underlie section 404 of the Clean Water Act which \ngoverns dredge and fill permitting, one of the most important \ncomponents of the act.\n  To freeze those definition in time, as section 108 does, ties the \nhands of the implementing agencies, despite evolving scientific \nunderstanding and current regulatory insights. Current and future \nadministrations must have discretion to implement key terms and clarify \nthem when needed.\n  The alternative puts our Nation's waters at risk.\n  My amendment would remove this anti-Clean Water Act rider.\n  When Congress first enacted the Clean Water Act, the section 404 \npermit process was supposed to be used for certain construction \nprojects, like bridges and roads, where raising the bottom elevation of \na water body or converting an area into dry land was unavoidable.\n  But under a 2002 rule change, the definition of ``fill material'' was \nbroadened to include ``rock, sand, soil, clay, plastics, construction \ndebris, wood chips, overburden from mining or other excavation \nactivities.''\n  The revised rule also removed regulatory language which previously \nexcluded ``waste'' discharges from section 404 jurisdiction, a change \nthat some argue allows the use of 404 permits to authorize certain \ndischarges that harm the aquatic environment.\n  The Clean Water Act section 404(b)(1) guidelines are not well suited \nfor evaluating the environmental effects of discharging hazardous \nwastes, such as mining refuse and similar materials, into a water body \nor wetland.\n  In sum, the net effect of the 2002 rule change was to alter the Corps \npermit process in ways that Congress had never intended.\n  It was not congressional intent to allow mining refuse and similar \nmaterial--some of it hazardous--to qualify as fill material and, \nthereby, bypass a more thorough environmental review and meet Federal \npollution standards.\n  Downstream water users have every right to be concerned that the \nsection 404 process fails to protect them from the discharge of \nhazardous substances.\n  Lower Slate Lake in Alaska is the perfect example. A permit allows \nthe discharge of toxic wastewater from a gold ore processing mill to go \nuntreated directly into the lake, despite the fact that the discharge \nviolates EPA's standards for the mining industry. Mining waste can \ncontain toxic chemicals known to pose health risks to humans and \naquatic animals. Continuing the practice of dumping this waste into our \nNation's streams and rivers is dangerous and irresponsible.\n  EPA estimates that 120 miles per year of headwater streams are buried \nwith the chemical-laden discharge as a result of surface mining \noperations under existing divisions of ``fill.'' Equally important, a \n2008 EPA study found evidence that mining activities can have severe \nimpacts on downstream aquatic life and the biological conditions of a \nstream. That same study found that 9 out of every 10 streams downstream \nfrom surface mining operations were impaired based on assessments of \naquatic life.\n  Mr. Chairman, this provision, section 108, is a preemptive strike \nagainst protecting our drinking water. Since there is no time limit on \nthis provision, it would not only block the current administration but \nany future administration from considering changes.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and strike \nsection 108 from this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nThe language in the bill is intended simply to maintain the status quo \nregarding what is fill material for the purposes of the Clean Water \nAct.\n  The existing definition was put in place through a rulemaking \ninitiated by the Clinton administration and was finalized by the Bush \nadministration. That rule aligned the definitions on the books of the \nCorps and the EPA so that both agencies were working with the same \ndefinition.\n  Changing the definition again, as some have proposed, could \neffectively kill mining operations across much of this country. For \nthat reason, I support the underlying language and would oppose this \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I support the gentleman's amendment to strike \nsection 108, and I thank Congressman Beyer of Virginia for offering it.\n  The provision the gentleman seeks to strike is one of three egregious \nattacks on the Clean Water Act, including locking in place a state of \nconfusion about the scope of pollution control programs and sacrificing \nwater quality for small streams and wetlands that contribute to the \ndrinking water of one in three Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Beyer amendment. Freshwater is a \nprecious resource, one which should be protected in the best scientific \nmanner possible.\n  I thank the gentleman from Virginia for doing something really \nimportant for the country through this amendment to clean up this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

Notwithstanding section 404(f)(2) of the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1344(f)(2)), none of \n     the funds made available by this Act may be used to require a \n     permit for the discharge of dredged or fill material under \n     the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et \n     seq.) for the activities identified in subparagraphs (A) and \n     (C) of section 404(f)(1) of the Act (33 U.S.C. 1344(f)(1)(A), \n     (C)).\n       Sec. 110.

Mr. Chairman, Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, \nCongressman Matt Cartwright, and I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 13, beginning on line 20, strike section 110.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, much like the previous discussion, our \namendment would simply strike section 110.\n  As it stands, section 110 would prevent the implementation of the \nClean Water Rule. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Army \nCorps of Engineers adopted the Clean Water Rule following a lengthy and \ninclusive public rulemaking process.\n  It restores the Clean Water Act protections to streams, wetlands, and \nother important waters of the United States.\n  Without the Clean Water Rule, the streams that provide drinking water \nsystems serving one in three Americans will remain at risk.\n  Almost everyone agreed that clarity was needed in light of the \nSupreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 that interpreted the regulatory \nscope of the Clean Water Act more narrowly than the agencies and lower \ncourts. Those cases created uncertainty about the scope of waters \nprotected under the Clean Water Act.\n  Calls for EPA to issue a rule even came from such organizations as \nthe National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the Western Business Roundtable, and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers.\n  Prohibiting the EPA from implementing this rule, as section 110 would \ndirect, would perpetrate this confusion. There are countless cases to \nreiterate this point.\n  For example, the EPA acknowledged enforcement difficulties in a case \nin which storm water from construction sites carried oil, grease, and \nother pollutants into tributaries to the San Pedro River, which is an \ninternationally recognized river ecosystem supporting diverse wildlife, \nbut where the waters in question flow only for part of the year.\n  The agency stated that it had to discontinue all enforcement cases in \nthis area because it was so time-consuming and costly to prove that the \nClean Water Act protects these rivers. So we need to end the confusion.\n  But, unfortunately, we are left with the Clean Water Rule not \ncurrently being enforced because of a Federal Court ruling that blocked \nits implementation while it is being litigated.\n  The Corps and the EPA will continue to make Clean Water Act \njurisdictional determinations based on the 2010 guidelines, as they did \nbefore the promulgation of the 2015 rule, doing the best they can with \nthe ambiguity that they are forced to work with. So this confusion will \ncontinue.\n  It needs to be said that opponents of the Clean Water Rule have it \nwrong. The rule respects agriculture and the law by maintaining all of \nthe existing exemptions for agricultural discharges and waters. It \nidentifies specific types of water bodies to which it does not apply--\nareas like artificial lakes and ponds, and many types of drainage and \nirrigation ditches. It does not extend Federal protection to any waters \nnot historically protected under the Clean Water Act, and it is fully \nconsistent with the law and the decisions of the Supreme Court.\n  I want to reiterate. The administration has created a strong, \ncommonsense rule to make clean water a priority by protecting the \nsources that feed the drinking water for more than 117 million \nAmericans, including 2.3 million Virginians. If we continue to block \nthe rule to protect clean water, at least 57 percent of Virginia's \nstreams and 20 million acres of wetlands nationwide will continue to be \nat risk.\n  American businesses need to know when the Federal Government has \nauthority and when it doesn't. Without updated guidance and the clarity \nit provides, businesses will often not know when they need Army Corps \nof Engineers' permits. This uncertainty could result in civil and \ncriminal liability and will certainly cost them extra money.\n  Overall, the Clean Water Act riders are part of an effort to return \nus to a time when we had no uniform, national, minimum clean water \nstandards, and States had conflicting policies or no policies to \nprotect the public. That was a time when rivers were so polluted they \ncaught fire and when responsible downstream States suffered the \nconsequences of lax or weak upstream State policies.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose these Clean Water Act \nriders and to support my amendment to strike section 110.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment. We have \ndebated this issue for many years now.\n  The fact is, the gentleman is right in one regard in that the Clean \nWater Act, in trying to define what waters of the United States by \nnavigable waters, is hard. Navigable to what?\n  Consequently, every organization that I know of supports a new rule \nthat brings certainty and clarity to it. That is what the Supreme Court \nsaid on two different occasions: that the Corps of Engineers and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency had gone too far, and that Federal \njurisdiction over the Clean Water Act was not as broad as they had \nclaimed, and that we needed certainty and clarity in this rule. So the \nEPA took that and said: okay, I know what will give certainty; we will \njust regulate everything.\n  That is pretty much what they have done with this rule. Everybody who \nproposes this as a really good deal is under the assumption that the \nwaters were not regulated before if they didn't fall under the Clean \nWater Act. The reality is that the EPA didn't regulate them, but the \nStates regulated them, and the States did a darn good job of it in most \ncases.\n\n  We do need some clarity. But as cases have said, as the Supreme Court \nhas said, the EPA has gone too far. Deciding how water should be used \nis the responsibility of State and local officials who are more \nfamiliar with the people and the local issues.\n  Under the WOTUS rule, the Federal reach of jurisdiction would be so \nbroad that it could significantly restrict landowners' ability to make \ndecisions about their property and a local government's right to plan \nfor its own development. While there may be a desire for clarity on the \nissue of the Federal jurisdiction, providing clarity does not trump the \nneed to stay within the limits of the law.\n  Bringing certainty to this, you know, that is a nice thing to say. A \nhanging brings certainty, but I am not sure it is the result you want, \nwhich is what we have got here.\n  The WOTUS rule would expand Federal jurisdiction far beyond what was \never intended by the Clean Water Act.\n  The provision in the Energy and Water Development bill does not \nweaken the Clean Water Act; it stops the administration from expanding \nFederal jurisdiction. For that purpose, I strongly urge my colleagues \nto vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the \ngentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the distinguished ranking member of \nthe subcommittee.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for \nyielding and support his amendment strongly. It strikes a harmful \nprovision that prevents the Corps from addressing deficiencies in \nregulatory uncertainties related to Clean Water Act regulations. \nWithout this amendment, the bill would contribute to delays, \nuncertainty, and increased costs both for the government, for \ncompanies, and individuals who discharge into wetlands, streams, lakes, \nand other waters.\n  It will increase delays in the implementation of important public \nworks projects and lead to protracted litigation on the disparity \nbetween existing\n\n[[Page H3063]]\n\nFederal regulations and two Supreme Court decisions.\n  The provision that this amendment strikes does not apply to just this \nyear. It applies to any subsequent Energy and Water Development Act \nprecluding potential changes that may be necessary to protect public \nhealth and the environment, and ensuring that uncertainty continues \nindefinitely.\n  I believe the amendment allows the Corps the needed flexibility to \ndeal with the confusion that has surrounded Clean Water Act \njurisdiction in the wake of the two Supreme Court decisions, and we \nshould be allowing the Corps to take actions that address the Supreme \nCourt's ruling, bringing clarity and certainty to the regulatory \nprocess, not prolonging the confusion.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  If this amendment is not passed, it could mean an estimated one-fifth \nof wetlands and 2 million miles of small streams will not be protected.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Beyer amendment. Freshwater is a \nprecious resource, one which should be protected in the best scientific \nmanner possible. We owe it to future generations.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, they are absolutely right. This would \nblock the implementation of this rule in the future. That is what we \nare trying to do. We are saying this rule is no good, start again. It \ndoesn't mean that these streams would be in danger or anything else.\n  We are saying to the Army Corps and to the EPA, go back and start \nagain, because they were wrong in this rule and they far overreached \ntheir authority of the Clean Water Act. I think that is what a court is \ngoing to decide, and this probably won't be necessary because a court \nis probably going to throw this out.\n  The reality is we all want clean water. If this amendment is not \nadopted and our language goes into effect, it doesn't mean that these \nwetlands and these streams are going to be unregulated. They will be \nregulated, as they were before, by the State governments. We have a \nFederal system. We have Federal law. We have State laws. The State laws \ndo some things. They have regulated water within their States for years \nand have done a pretty good job of it.\n  Is the Clean Water Act necessary? You bet it is. You are right. The \nCuyahoga River hasn't started a fire for a long time because of the \ncleanup that has been done, but that doesn't mean that they need to \nregulate every little mud puddle and stream in the State of Idaho.\n  I strongly oppose this amendment, as I have in years gone by. And I \nwould say it again: This is telling the EPA and the Army Corps of \nEngineers to start over again. Follow the intent of the Clean Water Act \nand the intent of Congress when it was passed.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Sec. 111.  As of the date of enactment of this Act and each \n     fiscal year thereafter, the Secretary of the Army shall not \n     promulgate or enforce any regulation that prohibits an \n     individual from possessing a firearm, including an assembled \n     or functional firearm, at a water resources development \n     project covered under section 327.0 of title 36, Code of \n     Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act), if--\n       (1) the individual is not otherwise prohibited by law from \n     possessing the firearm; and\n       (2) the possession of the firearm is in compliance with the \n     law of the State in which the water resources development \n     project is located.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. DeSaulnier\n\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 14, strike lines 7 through 19.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment simply strikes a controversial provision \nthat is irrelevant to the underlying bill.\n  Section 111 of the bill explicitly prohibits the Secretary of the \nArmy from preventing someone from bringing a loaded weapon onto Federal \nArmy Corps property. This divisive gun policy is nothing more than \nanother attempt by the majority, unfortunately, to promote the \ninterests of the gun lobby. It chips away at the safety and well-being \nof the Army Corps personnel and surrounding communities.\n  Not only is this gun rider widely considered bad policy, the Energy \nand Water Appropriations bill is an inappropriate mechanism for \ndebating the pros and cons of gun possession on Federal lands, and is \ninconsistent with the majority's promotion of regular order.\n  Last week, the House debated the National Defense Authorization Act, \nwhich is certainly a more appropriate legislative vehicle for a \ndiscussion about guns. I offered an amendment to that bill to improve \nsmart gun technology, and the majority didn't even allow it to be \ndebated on the floor. In fact, not a single gun bill has been \nconsidered by the House in the 114th Congress. If the majority is eager \nto debate the merits of carrying loaded weapons on Federal properties, \nI am certain that many of us on this side of the aisle would be more \nthan willing to participate in that debate.\n  By virtue of attaching this policy rider to an appropriations bill, \nand by virtue of the majority dismissing requests to debate gun \nresearch and smart gun technology, it seems that the majority would \nrather force a contentious issue through Congress with no debate at \nall. This approach is at odds with the purpose for which we are all \nhere: to debate issues important to our constituents and this country \nand, by virtue of that debate, advance policies to improve our country.\n  Mr. Chairman, this policy rider is misplaced and misguided.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, it is hard to understand that we are doing \nthis without any debate when the gentleman is, in fact, debating. That \nis what we are doing. That is what we did in committee. That is what we \ndid in subcommittee. That is how this process works.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment. The current regulation \nprohibits citizens from exercising their Second Amendment rights \nguaranteed in the Constitution on Corps land. Many people don't realize \nit, but the Army Corps of Engineers is the largest Federal provider of \noutdoor recreation in the country.\n  The language in this bill would simply align Corps policy with the \npolicy for national parks and national wildlife refuges established by \nCongress in 2009. We heard the same debate when we said, no, people \nought to be able to exercise their Second Amendment rights in national \nparks. They shouldn't have to disassemble their guns, put them in their \ntrunk, and everything else when they go through national parks. We \ninstituted that policy, and today you can exercise your Second \nAmendment rights in national parks. It hasn't been a problem. The same \nthing with national wildlife refuges.\n  Therefore, I oppose this amendment. Let's make sure that every \nAmerican has the right to exercise their Second Amendment rights \nguaranteed in the Constitution.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, while I respect that perspective, I \nappreciate the gentleman from Idaho's perspective, and hope that we can \nwork together in the future to make sure that public safety is \nprotected on Army Corps of Engineers property.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is clear today that this is not a day for a \nbreakthrough on gun debate, in my view.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Florida.\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n[[Page H3064]]\n\n  \n\n\n                                TITLE II\n\n                       DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\n\n                          Central Utah Project\n\n                central utah project completion account\n\n       For carrying out activities authorized by the Central Utah \n     Project Completion Act, $11,000,000, to remain available \n     until expended, of which $1,300,000 shall be deposited into \n     the Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Account for \n     use by the Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation \n     Commission: Provided, That of the amount provided under this \n     heading, $1,350,000 shall be available until September 30, \n     2018, for expenses necessary in carrying out related \n     responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior: Provided \n     further, That for fiscal year 2017, of the amount made \n     available to the Commission under this Act or any other Act, \n     the Commission may use an amount not to exceed $1,500,000 for \n     administrative expenses.\n\n                         Bureau of Reclamation\n\n       The following appropriations shall be expended to execute \n     authorized functions of the Bureau of Reclamation:\n\n                      water and related resources\n\n                     (including transfers of funds)\n\n       For management, development, and restoration of water and \n     related natural resources and for related activities, \n     including the operation, maintenance, and rehabilitation of \n     reclamation and other facilities, participation in fulfilling \n     related Federal responsibilities to Native Americans, and \n     related grants to, and cooperative and other agreements with, \n     State and local governments, federally recognized Indian \n     tribes, and others, $982,972,000, to remain available until \n     expended, of which $22,000 shall be available for transfer to \n     the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund and $5,551,000 shall be \n     available for transfer to the Lower Colorado River Basin \n     Development Fund;

(a) To maximize water supplies for the Central \n     Valley Project and the State Water Project, in implementing \n     the provisions of the smelt biological opinion or salmonid \n     biological opinion, or any successor biological opinions or \n     court orders, pertaining to management of reverse flow in the \n     Old and Middle Rivers, the Secretary of the Interior shall--\n       (1) consider the relevant provisions of the applicable \n     biological opinions or any successor biological opinions;\n       (2) manage export pumping rates to achieve a reverse OMR \n     flow rate of -5,000 cubic feet per second unless existing \n     information or that developed by the Secretary of the \n     Interior under paragraphs (3) and (4) leads the Secretary to \n     reasonably conclude, using the best scientific and commercial \n     data available, that a less negative OMR flow rate is \n     necessary to avoid a significant negative impact on the long-\n     term survival of the species covered by the smelt biological \n     opinion or salmonid biological opinion. If the best \n     scientific and commercial data available to the Secretary \n     indicates that a reverse OMR flow rate more negative than -\n     5,000 cubic feet per second can be established without an \n     imminent negative impact on the long-term survival of the \n     species covered by the smelt biological opinion or salmonid \n     biological opinion, the Secretary shall manage export pumping \n     rates to achieve that more negative OMR flow rate;\n       (3) document, in writing, any significant facts about real-\n     time conditions relevant to the determinations of OMR reverse \n     flow rates, including--\n       (A) whether targeted real-time fish monitoring pursuant to \n     this section, including monitoring in the vicinity of Station \n     902, indicates that a significant negative impact on the \n     long-term survival of species covered by\n\n[[Page H3065]]\n\n     the smelt biological opinion or salmonid biological opinion \n     is imminent; and\n       (B) whether near-term forecasts with available models show \n     under prevailing conditions that OMR flow of -5,000 cubic \n     feet per second or higher will cause a significant negative \n     impact on the long-term survival of species covered by the \n     smelt biological opinion or salmonid biological opinion;\n       (4) show, in writing, that any determination to manage OMR \n     reverse flow at rates less negative than -5,000 cubic feet \n     per second is necessary to avoid a significant negative \n     impact on the long-term survival of species covered by the \n     smelt biological opinion or salmonid biological opinion, and \n     provide, in writing, an explanation of the data examined and \n     the connection between those data and the choice made, after \n     considering--\n       (A) the distribution of Delta smelt throughout the Delta;\n       (B) the potential effects of documented, quantified \n     entrainment on subsequent Delta smelt abundance;\n       (C) the water temperature;\n       (D) other significant factors relevant to the \n     determination; and\n       (E) whether any alternative measures could have a \n     substantially lesser water supply impact; and\n       (5) for any subsequent smelt biological opinion or salmonid \n     biological opinion, make the showing required in paragraph \n     (4) for any determination to manage OMR reverse flow at rates \n     less negative than the most negative limit in the biological \n     opinion if the most negative limit in the biological opinion \n     is more negative than -5,000 cubic feet per second.\n       (b) No Reinitiation of Consultation.--In implementing or at \n     the conclusion of actions under subsection (a), the Secretary \n     of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce shall not \n     reinitiate consultation on those adjusted operations unless \n     there is a significant negative impact on the long-term \n     survival of the species covered by the smelt biological \n     opinion or salmonid biological opinion. Any action taken \n     under subsection (a) that does not create a significant \n     negative impact on the long-term survival to species covered \n     by the smelt biological opinion or salmonid biological \n     opinion will not alter application of the take permitted by \n     the incidental take statement in the biological opinion under \n     section 7(o)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n       (c) Calculation of Reverse Flow in Omr.--Within 90 days of \n     the enactment of this title, the Secretary of the Interior is \n     directed, in consultation with the California Department of \n     Water Resources to revise the method used to calculate \n     reverse flow in Old and Middle Rivers, for implementation of \n     the reasonable and prudent alternatives in the smelt \n     biological opinion and the salmonid biological opinion, and \n     any succeeding biological opinions, for the purpose of \n     increasing Central Valley Project and State Water Project \n     water supplies. The method of calculating reverse flow in Old \n     and Middle Rivers shall be reevaluated not less than every \n     five years thereafter to achieve maximum export pumping rates \n     within limits established by the smelt biological opinion, \n     the salmonid biological opinion, and any succeeding \n     biological opinions.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. McNerney\n\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk that \namends a portion of the bill not yet read for amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent to offer it at this point in the reading.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike page 22, line 1, through page 42, line 16.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am submitting an amendment with Representatives Lieu \nand Garamendi to strike provisions in the underlying legislation that \nare taken from H.R. 2898.\n  This important appropriations bill contains policy provisions that \nwould further drain freshwater from the California delta with \noverpumping. These provisions would damage the delta's ecosystem and \nwould cause serious economic harm to the communities we serve.\n  These provisions would undermine 40 years of progress in developing a \ntrue stewardship over the land and resources. Since these laws, which \nhave helped make this progress possible, there have been countless \nattempts to scale back or undo them.\n  The provisions in the bill will weaken the Endangered Species Act and \nset a precedent of putting aside environmental protections. It \nmisstates California water law and perpetuates a water war in the West \nat a time when we are working to bridge those divides. Families, \nfarmers, and small businesses north and south of the California delta \nneed water. This is a State issue, not a regional one.\n  Meanwhile, the results for farmers, families, businesses in the \ndelta, as well as fishermen will be devastating. Fish will vanish and \nsaltwater will intrude, permanently damaging some of the most \nproductive farmland in the world.\n  Mr. Chairman, California water use seems to rely on an endless supply \nof freshwater. Unfortunately, there is only a finite amount of \nfreshwater.\n  Historically, in limited water conditions, water has been taken from \none region to supply another region. The Owens Valley and the Colorado \nRiver are perfect examples of what happens--one region benefits and \nanother region suffers. That is exactly what is going to happen here. \nThe delta region will suffer. Is that what we really want?\n  Mr. Chairman, California and Federal officials have been able to \nincrease exports from the California delta. This action has helped \nmaximize use of what little water exists in the State. A lack of water \nis our biggest threat, not operational flexibility.\n  It is completely inappropriate for a policy of this magnitude to be \nincluded in an annual must-pass appropriations bill. We should not be \nusing an appropriations bill to ram through misguided policies that \nreward a few powerful stakeholders at the expense of others. This bill \nshould not be included in this year's Energy and Water Appropriations \nbill. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chairman, one of the most interesting things we \nalways hear is water is a finite resource and we shouldn't waste it.\n  It always blows my mind because this simple graph right here is a \nvery strong example of what happened from one year to the next. Right \nhere is what came into the delta in 2015, and right here is what \nhappened in 2016--the amount of water that came in and the amount of \nwater that was exported to the south of the delta--and this is the \namount of water going through the delta this year. So the amount of \nwater that went through the delta and out into the ocean and completely \nwasted, right here in this graph, and this is how much we are able to \ncapture.\n  That is a huge difference and a huge waste of water. Communities in \nmy district have been suffering because of a lack of action in this \nHouse. This is not a State issue. This is policy that was implemented \nyears ago; and as we watch and see the delta continue to go and \ncontinue to decline and the species continue to disappear, doing this \nhas actually not helped the species, has done nothing.\n  There is language in this bill that actually helps protect the \nspecies, the predator species. We have the ability in this bill to \nstart a program that could actually help eliminate the striped bass. We \nhave seen studies. As much as 60 to 90 percent of delta smelt are \nconsumed by striped bass.\n  Why don't we allow that language to move forward? There was a motion \ntoday to strike some of that language, as well, in another bill as \nthere is in this one.\n  This is a problem. As communities continue to struggle, this is what \nwe end up with. I think this is the most important picture. This is in \nmy district. This is not in a Third World country. This is in the \nUnited States of America. This is right here in California, and this is \nsomething that is happening in these communities because of this water \nbeing wasted.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  We are putting people out of work, and we now see shanty towns. These \nshanty towns are not just regular folks--these are families. You see a \nstroller here, and you see some children's toys.\n  Is this what we want to support?\n  Anybody who supports this amendment is supporting this in the United\n\n[[Page H3066]]\n\nStates of America, and I can't imagine why we would want to do that.\n  Again, this is commonsense language that helps to address the problem \nthat we have. We try to bring some common sense to the protection of \nthe delta, and we look at it from all different angles. If Members want \nto continue this debate elsewhere, I am happy to do it. We have passed \nlegislation. It sits in the Senate. The Senate hasn't acted. We are \ngoing to keep pushing and looking for a way to bring this to the \nforefront so we can offer a solution.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Garamendi).\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, welcome to California water wars, \nMembers of Congress. Here we are again, back to our water war.\n  We need to solve the problem of the delta, but you don't do it by \ngutting the environmental protections of the delta. Have no doubt about \nit. This is another water war in California that we do not need.\n  What we need is some wise legislation that actually can solve the \nproblem. Gutting the Endangered Species Act, overriding the biological \nopinions, taking away the Clean Water Act, and simply turning the pumps \non is not a solution. It is, in fact, the death knell of the delta. \nAlong with Governor Brown's twin tunnels, it will destroy the delta. So \nlet's not go that way. Let's find the right solution in which science--\nthat is the realtime monitoring of what is happening in the delta--is \nhow we determine whether to ramp up or to reduce the pumping in the \ndelta. That is not in this bill.\n  Take a look at the opponents here. We have the two delta interests, \nMr. McNerney and I. We have the San Joaquin Valley interests. Gentlemen \nand ladies, welcome to California water wars. This is not the way to \nhandle it--not in an appropriation, not in a bill that guts the \nenvironmental protections and simply turns the pumps on.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chair, we hear about water being wasted in its \ngoing out to the ocean, but that water is pushing saltwater away from \nour farms and the delta. It is allowing salmon fish to go out to the \nocean. It is providing jobs all up and down the coast. I don't really \naccept the word ``waste.''\n  I implore my colleagues from southern California: let's work \ntogether. There are solutions out there. We can recycle; we can store \nrainwater; we can become more efficient and find wastage and stop \nevaporations. There are plenty of things we can do to produce new \nwater. These provisions in this bill produce no new water. It just \nserves one portion of the State to benefit another.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chair, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Calvert).\n  Mr. CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chair, water wars. I have been at this for a while, too, as my \nfriend from northern California has. People are suffering right now for \nno good reason.\n  According to independent studies, under the existing biological \nopinions, over a million acre feet of water have been wasted because of \nnon-pumping. What I mean by ``wasted'' is not one fish--not one smelt, \nnot one salmon--would have been lost in the delta because of pumping; \nbut because of overcautiousness on the part of the Department of the \nInterior and the Department of Fish and Wildlife, we have let that \nwater go. Tell that to the people who live in that shanty town. Tell \nthat to the people who actually import produce from China to live on.\n  I know that people like to paint us as the party that doesn't care \nabout the Hispanic community. Tell that to the hundreds of thousands of \npeople who have been put out of work in the Central Valley. This is \nwrong.\n  I congratulate Mr. Valadao for the hard work and the passion that he \nhas put into this because he cares about the people he represents, and \nwe should care about them, too.\n  There is no good reason why we have let this happen. We have allowed \nthis to happen for a number of reasons, most of which don't make any \nsense to most people who understand this stuff. We have a chance, I \nthink, to fix this and to pass Mr. Valadao's legislation. Let's move \non.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcNerney).\n  Mr. McNERNEY. I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio.\n  Mr. Chair, I just want to follow up on a few things.\n  We talked about water that goes out to the ocean as being wasted. \nAgain, the delta is becoming more salty every year. We have been \nexporting 70 percent of the freshwater that comes to the delta. The \nsaltwater has been intruding. We need the freshwater to push out that \nsaltwater for the fishermen who live up and down the coast. I feel for \nthe farmers who are in the south part of the valley--it is devastating; \nit is horrible--but we also see the same thing happening with fishermen \non the north coast.\n  Basically, we are doing the same thing that has been done \nhistorically. At Owens Valley, we are going to take water from one part \nof the State, and we are going to give it to another. We are going to \nbenefit one part, and we are going to hurt another. That is not the way \nto do business.\n  We can find comprehensive solutions that include infrastructure \ninvestments, recycling, WaterSMART projects. There are ways to create \nnew water. We don't have to keep grabbing water from one another to \ngrow fruits and vegetables or to have fishermen survive on the north \ncoast.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nGaramendi).\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, all of us can get pretty excited about \nwater in California, and I see my colleagues from the San Joaquin \nValley and beyond who are lined up here to protest what has happened \nover this last year.\n  There is no doubt that in this last year the rainy season didn't work \nfor anybody. We can find a solution if we base that solution on solid \nscience, if we base it on the realtime monitoring of where the fish \nare. I know there is a monitoring provision in this bill. Also, this \nparticular bill, as written, would push aside the environmental \nprotections and simply allow the pumps to be turned on even with the \nmonitoring. What we really need to do is to base the delta operation on \nthe realtime monitoring of where the species are and then adjust the \npumps accordingly.\n\n  There is a solution. My colleague, Mr. McNerney, just talked in \ndetail about the necessity of building additional infrastructure for \nwater. We need Sites Reservoir in the northern part of the State. We \nneed to rebuild the San Luis Reservoir, and the Los Banos Grandes needs \nto be built. We need to build the infrastructure, the recycling, and \nall of the other things.\n  We do not need to take, as this bill does, the Endangered Species \nAct, the Clean Water Act, and the biological opinions and push them out \nof the way and just allow the pumps to turn on. That is not a solution. \nThat is a solution for the destruction of the largest estuary on the \nwest coast of the Western Hemisphere.\n  I don't doubt for a moment the sincerity of my colleagues from the \nSan Joaquin Valley and from southern California. They are sincere about \nthe concern, and we share that concern. 300,000 acres of my rice farm \ndidn't get planted this last year because of the drought. We also know \nthe damage that a drought can do, but there is a way of solving this \nproblem. This is not the bill. This bill will set off a war. Obviously, \nwe are already at it here on the floor of the House.\n  Let's put this aside. Let's sit down, as we can do, and develop a \nsolution that keeps in place the environmental laws and allows the \nflexibility that is present within those laws to be used to the maximum \nextent and not push the laws and the biological opinions out of the way \nto the detriment of the largest\n\n[[Page H3067]]\n\nestuary on the west coast of the Western Hemisphere. It is critical for \nsalmon and other species in the ocean as well as for the agriculture in \nthe delta and the 4 million or 5 million people who depend upon that \nwater from the delta.\n  I ask my colleagues to work with all of us, and I will take the chair \nof the subcommittee up on his offer. I will take the gentleman up on \nhis offer and sit down with him, and we will work this out, but not in \nthis way, at this moment on this floor, with a bill that really does \ngut the environmental laws and that guts the environmental species as \nwell as the Clean Water Act.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Reed). The gentlewoman from Ohio has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcNerney), who has fought so very hard on this issue.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Chair, I am basically appealing to my colleagues. There are \nsolutions out there. We can find a whole State solution to which all \nstakeholders have input. Right now that is not what this is. This is \npitting one region against the other, and it is going to perpetuate \nwhat has been called the California water war. We didn't need to go \nthere. There are solutions.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, I am always amazed by the debates on this floor, and I \nthink they are healthy. I like to listen to what people say and what \npeople desire. Let me explain what I have heard as a desire to deal \nwith the water crisis in California.\n  People request that whatever we do, do not change the Endangered \nSpecies Act. Could we work together on both sides? Could we make sure \nwe stay within the biological opinion?\n  For some of those people who are watching at home, they may not have \nwatched the last three terms of this Congress. This drought is not new. \nBut what is interesting is, if you just go back in this decade of the \nsnowpack in California--let's go back 5 years--we had 160 percent of \nsnowpack, which was an amazing year for California.\n  But do you know what was allocated from the State Water Project for \nwater?\n  Eighty percent out of 160 percent. The next year, we had only 55 \npercent. In 2015, we only had 8 percent of snowpack. This year was an \nEl Nino, so we got up to 87 percent. Yet, if you look at the numbers, \nwe have only pumped about the same amount of water as we did when we \nhad 8 percent.\n  My parents would always read me bedtime stories. The one I loved the \nmost was one in which they talked about a grasshopper and an ant. It \nwas interesting how one of them would save for that rainy day. In this \ncase, it would be putting the water away. It would be saving for that \nnext year because, as we go through these years, our snowpack is always \nnot the same.\n  If we are not pumping the water down, where is it going?\n  It is going to the ocean.\n  For the last three terms, we have tried to solve the water crisis, \nand, every time, we have heard these same arguments; so every term we \ndid something different. A term ago, we got together with Republicans \nand Democrats, and we worked with our Senate leaders on the other side; \nbut when it got time to make a final decision, I was told: no, no, we \ncouldn't do this because it didn't go through committee, and there \nweren't enough people in the room.\n  So we said: All right. Well, we will go back to the drawing board.\n  This time we went through and we put Republicans and Democrats in the \nroom.\n  Do you know what is interesting?\n  It just so happens Republicans are in the majority and Democrats are \nin the minority, but not in that room. There were more Democrats than \nthere were Republicans, and we stayed months in there talking. We came \nto a lot of agreements. Maybe some people who were in the room won't \nsay that on the outside, but on the inside, they agreed to a lot of the \npieces of the legislation.\n  I will tell you that those pieces that we agreed to are in this bill.\n  Do you know why?\n  Because we listened. We don't change the Endangered Species Act. We \ndon't go beyond the biological opinion.\n  Are you concerned about fish?\n  We say in this piece of legislation to pump higher unless there is a \nconcern in the harming of the fish. You don't have to come back to \nCongress to change the level of pumping. So those solutions I hear on \nthe floor are in the bill. I think it is about time that we stop making \nfalse accusations and actually stand for what we need.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Do you know what in these rooms I heard a lot about? Desalinization. \nAnd I said I will help with that. Because the whole concept of \ndesalinization is we will spend a lot of money with a lot of energy to \ntake that ocean water and take the salt out of it and make it \nfreshwater.\n  Don't you think it would kind of be smart of us first to make sure \nthat our freshwater is not becoming saltwater first? That is all we are \nasking here. We are saying let's live within the biological opinion.\n  We are protecting the Endangered Species Act, but we are doing \nsomething different in California. We are planning for the future. We \nare planning for those years that you won't have the big snowpack. We \nare planning for the years that California continues to grow. We are \nalso planning for those people who work in the fields. We are planning \nfor the people who want to build the homes.\n  Central Valley may be a little different than everyplace else, but \nthose jobs are just as important as any job anywhere else in \nCalifornia. So, yes, we have sat in the rooms. Yes, there were more on \nthe minority side than on the majority. Yes, we listened to you and we \ntook what we heard and put it into a bill.\n  Because the other thing I heard when we couldn't do this is that it \nhad to be regular order. That is why it could not be in the omnibus \nbill even though that was an idea from my Senate colleague in the other \nhouse.\n  So you know what? This is regular order on the floor of the House \nwith the ideas that we heard, and it is in the bill.\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n\n  temporary operational flexibility for first few storms of the water \n                                  year\n\n       Sec. 205.  (a) In General.--Consistent with avoiding an \n     immediate significant negative impact on the long-term \n     survival upon listed fish species over and above the range of \n     impacts authorized under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     and other environmental protections under subsection (d), the \n     Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall \n     authorize the Central Valley Project and the California State \n     Water Project, combined, to operate at levels that result in \n     negative OMR flows at -7,500 cubic feet per second (based on \n     United States Geological Survey gauges on Old and Middle \n     Rivers) daily average as described in subsections (b) and (c) \n     to capture peak flows during storm events.\n       (b) Days of Temporary Operational Flexibility.--The \n     temporary operational flexibility described in subsection (a) \n     shall be authorized on days that the California Department of \n     Water Resources determines the net Sacramento-San Joaquin \n     River Delta outflow index is at, or above, 13,000 cubic feet \n     per second.\n       (c) Compliance With Endangered Species Act \n     Authorizations.--In carrying out this section, the Secretary \n     of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce may continue to \n     impose any requirements under the smelt biological opinion \n     and salmonid biological opinion during any period of \n     temporary operational flexibility as they determine are \n     reasonably necessary to avoid additional significant negative \n     impacts on the long-term survival of a listed fish species \n     over and\n\n[[Page H3068]]\n\n     above the range of impacts authorized under the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973, provided that the requirements imposed \n     do not reduce water supplies available for the Central Valley \n     Project and the California State Water Project.\n       (d) Other Environmental Protections.--\n       (1) State law.--The actions of the Secretary of the \n     Interior and the Secretary of Commerce under this section \n     shall be consistent with applicable regulatory requirements \n     under State law. The foregoing does not constitute a waiver \n     of sovereign immunity.\n       (2) First sediment flush.--During the first flush of \n     sediment out of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in \n     each water year, and provided that such determination is \n     based upon objective evidence, OMR flow may be managed at \n     rates less negative than -5,000 cubic feet per second for a \n     minimum duration to avoid movement of adult Delta smelt \n     (Hypomesus transpacificus) to areas in the southern \n     Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta that would be likely to \n     increase entrainment at Central Valley Project and California \n     State Water Project pumping plants.\n       (3) Applicability of opinion.--This section shall not \n     affect the application of the salmonid biological opinion \n     from April 1 to May 31, unless the Secretary of Commerce \n     finds, based on the best scientific and commercial data \n     available, that some or all of such applicable requirements \n     may be adjusted during this time period to provide emergency \n     water supply relief without resulting in additional adverse \n     effects over and above the range of impacts authorized under \n     the Endangered Species Act of 1973. In addition to any other \n     actions to benefit water supply, the Secretary of the \n     Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall consider \n     allowing through-Delta water transfers to occur during this \n     period if they can be accomplished consistent with section \n     3405(a)(1)(H) of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act. \n     Water transfers solely or exclusively through the California \n     State Water Project that do not require any use of \n     Reclamation facilities or approval by Reclamation are not \n     required to be consistent with section 3405(a)(1)(H) of the \n     Central Valley Project Improvement Act.\n       (4) Monitoring.--During operations under this section, the \n     Commissioner of Reclamation, in coordination with the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries \n     Service, and California Department of Fish and Wildlife, \n     shall undertake expanded monitoring programs and other data \n     gathering to improve Central Valley Project and California \n     State Water Project water supplies, to ensure incidental take \n     levels are not exceeded, and to identify potential negative \n     impacts, if any, and actions necessary to mitigate impacts of \n     the temporary operational flexibility to species listed under \n     the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n       (e) Effect of High Outflows.--In recognition of the high \n     outflow levels from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta \n     during the days this section is in effect under subsection \n     (b), the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \n     Commerce shall not count such days toward the 5-day and 14-\n     day running averages of tidally filtered daily Old and Middle \n     River flow requirements under the smelt biological opinion \n     and salmonid biological opinion, as long as the Secretaries \n     avoid significant negative impact on the long-term survival \n     of listed fish species over and above the range of impacts \n     authorized under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n       (f) Level of Detail Required for Analysis.--In articulating \n     the determinations required under this section, the Secretary \n     of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall fully \n     satisfy the requirements herein but shall not be expected to \n     provide a greater level of supporting detail for the analysis \n     than feasible to provide within the short timeframe permitted \n     for timely decision making in response to changing conditions \n     in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.\n       (g) Omr Flows.--The Secretary of the Interior and the \n     Secretary of Commerce shall, through the adaptive management \n     provisions in the salmonid biological opinion, limit OMR \n     reverse flow to -5,000 cubic feet per second based on date-\n     certain triggers in the salmonid biological opinions only if \n     using real-time migration information on salmonids \n     demonstrates that such action is necessary to avoid a \n     significant negative impact on the long-term survival of \n     listed fish species over and above the range of impacts \n     authorized under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n       (h) No Reinitiation of Consultation.--In implementing or at \n     the conclusion of actions under this section, the Secretary \n     of the Interior shall not reinitiate consultation on those \n     adjusted operations if there is no immediate significant \n     negative impact on the long-term survival of listed fish \n     species over and above the range of impacts authorized under \n     the Endangered Species Act of 1973.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 43, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $50,000,000)''.\n       Page 45, line 16, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $45,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, this is a fairly simple amendment, and it \nis a commonsense amendment.\n  While the technologies could also be used that this amendment will \nplus up for natural gas or oil, I will focus my attention on coal \nbecause that is what happens in my district predominantly.\n  Over the last several years, as many of us know, there have been \nnumerous burdensome regulations on the coal industry and industries \nthat burn coal.\n  The very least we can do is to make sure that coal-fired power plants \nand others dependent on coal, among those most heavily targeted, have \nthe technologies necessary to meet the standards being imposed on them.\n  In recent months, I have had many conversations and discussions with \na number of folks in southwest Virginia, but also folks at the \nDepartment of Energy, about ways that we can better do the research \nnecessary to make clean coal technology available.\n  One thing is very clear. There is a future for coal, and it lies in \nmany ways in the technologies being researched and supported by the \nDepartment of Energy's Office of Fossil Energy Research. We would love \nto get parity. This amendment doesn't bring us to parity, but it gets \nus a little bit closer.\n  My amendment would simply add $45 million for fossil energy research \nand development from the energy efficiency and renewable energy account \nfor the purpose of aiding clean coal technology.\n  Now, just so you understand, the research money for energy efficiency \nand renewable energy would still be at $1.775 billion and the research \nmoney for fossil fuels, including coal, would only get plussed up to \n690.\n  So you still have a greater amount of money by a little bit more than \n2 to 1 going to other energies besides the fossil fuels.\n  Some of the key power providers in Virginia have made it clear that \ncoal\n\n[[Page H3070]]\n\nwill continue to be a part of their strategy for a long time to come.\n  Dominion Power, at a recent conference that we had, indicated that, \nby 2030, they expect that about 30 percent of their energy production \nwill be from coal. American Electric Power indicated that about half of \ntheirs in 2030 would still be from coal.\n  Now, what we have to do is we have to make sure that we get our \ntechnologies in line to make sure that we can continue to burn coal, \nbut burn it in a cleaner fashion. While there are various clean coal \ntechnologies currently in development, they will not be ready for \ncommercial use for years to come unless we change the timeline.\n  So my amendment would change that timeline. It will shorten that time \nby putting more money into research for clean coal technologies.\n  So we have two intersecting interests here. Let's figure out a way we \ncan keep the jobs, particularly in southwest Virginia and central \nAppalachia, and also burn coal more cleanly.\n  My amendment gives us a ray of hope, a step forward, to keeping those \nhigh-paying coal jobs, at least some of them--we have lost thousands in \nthe last few years--but keeping those jobs while also finding ways to \nburn the coal more cleanly.\n  This amendment will support both of these goals by ensuring \nadditional funding for clean coal research. That research can also be \nused in natural gas. My favorite is chemical looping.\n  This is a reasonable approach, and I hope that the body will adopt \nthis amendment.\n  I appreciate that the underlying bill does provide a slight increase \nin fossil fuel energy research over last year's level. But when you are \nlosing as many jobs as my district has, you have to fight for \neverything you can get.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I appreciate Congressman Griffith's efforts \nhere, but, unfortunately, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  Let me just say that, in the base bill that we have worked very hard \non, there are $645 million in the account for fossil energy. That is \nabout $13 million more over the current fiscal year. In addition, it is \n$285 million above the budget request.\n  So I think, if you put it in that frame, we have done quite well with \ndifficult choices inside our bill. The energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy account is already $248 million below this year and more than a \nbillion below the budget request.\n  So I would say to the gentleman that I don't think the offset you \nhave provided is a very good one.\n  We know that renewable energy is at the forefront of an energy \ntransformation that is already happening across our country, and we do \nneed a more balanced approach to energy.\n  While I do support fossil energy research and development and, \nfrankly, transition for communities that have been harmed by the \ntransformation in the energy sector--coal communities and coal-shipping \ncommunities across this country--I really can't support this level of \ndisproportionate funding.\n  So I strongly oppose the amendment and do not agree with its offset. \nI would urge my colleagues to join me in a ``no'' vote.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments and \nrecognize that they did plus it up a little bit.\n  But when you look at the folks that I represent and the thousands of \nfolks who have lost their jobs in the mining industry, we have to do \nmore. We have to do more.\n  Everybody likes to talk about we are going to help, we are going to \ntransition. But some of my counties, quite frankly, what are you going \nto transition them to?\n  There are no great roads. We should work on that as well. Frankly, we \nhave got trees and mountains. Recently, one of my counties had to build \na new high school because all of their high schools were in the \nfloodway. We had two pieces of land that were flat enough to build the \nhigh school on in the entire county.\n  So when people say transition, I always say: What are you going to do \nwhen you don't have the land to build factories and you don't have the \nresources to do something else?\n  They have always done mining. They can continue to do mining. Let's \nmeet and compromise here and put research money in so that they can \ncontinue to mine, continue to have jobs, and we can have a cleaner \nburning fuel, but still use our coal.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, might I inquire how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I couldn't agree with Congressman Griffith \nmore about the necessity of transitioning communities.\n  When I look back to the 1990s when something called NAFTA passed--the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement--we were promised that there would \nbe a North American development bank and that any community that was \nharmed in the South or the North would be helped.\n  The Federal Government never kept its word. It never kept its word. \nGo try to find that North American development bank today and we look \nat hollowed-out communities across this country.\n  If we look at the coal communities in--and Ohio has a lot of coal. We \nactually have more Btus under the ground between Virginia, \nPennsylvania, Ohio, all the way to Illinois, than the Middle East has \noil. It is just a little bit harder. So we look at these communities \nthat have been so devastated, and the Federal Government kind of sat on \nthe side.\n  Yes, we had the Appalachian Regional Commission terribly underfunded \nwithout the kind of bonding and development authority that should \nexist.\n  I look at the steel communities that I represent. People in my \ndistrict are getting pink slips every day at our big steel companies \nbecause of imported steel, and the Federal Government sits on its hand \nhere at the Federal level in the International Trade Commission and the \nNational Economic office over at the National Security Council. It \nupsets me a great deal that we haven't been able to help communities so \nimpacted.\n  I hope that, for those communities that are suffering because of the \ntransition in the energy sector partly due to the discovery of natural \ngas, quite frankly, in places like Ohio--and I am not sure about \nVirginia--we really need the type of transition program that we should \nhave had back in the 1990s for the NAFTA communities and that we should \nhave had for the steel communities. The Federal Government is just too \nfar away from the places where we live to even see it sometimes.\n  So I share the gentleman's passion on that, but I really don't think \nthat we should take from the accounts that are providing some of the \nfuture answers. I hope that regions like yours could move into the new \nenergy economy as well.\n  Up in the Lake Erie area where I live, we are trying very, very hard \nto capture the wind. Lake Erie is the Saudi Arabia of wind, and it is \npart of our new future and part of a new grid. We hope to be very \nsuccessful there. I hope that some of these new technologies could also \nburgeon in regions of Virginia. There is no reason that they can't.\n  I believe the Department of Energy, the Department of Labor, the \nDepartment of Commerce, and all of our departments have an obligation \nto the communities that have been harmed because of policies that \nhappen in the private sector or the public sector, but we haven't been \nso good at that as the Federal Government.\n  So I reluctantly oppose the gentleman's amendment, but I understand \nhis motivation. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Griffith \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by\n\n[[Page H3071]]\n\nthe gentleman from Virginia will be postponed.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. McNerney\n\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Cohen), I offer an amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 43, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $2,000,000)''.\n       Page 50, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $2,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This amendment would increase funding for the Energy Efficiency and \nRenewable Energy account by $2 million for the SuperTruck II program. \nThe SuperTruck program was started by the Department of Energy to \nimprove freight and heavy duty vehicle efficiency.\n  The Committee on Appropriations acknowledged in their committee \nreport the success of the SuperTruck II program but recommended only \n$20 million of the requested $60 million for the SuperTruck II program \nto further improve efficiency in these vehicles.\n  SuperTruck II will continue dramatic improvements in the efficiency \nof heavy-duty class 8 long-haul and regional-haul vehicles through \nsystem-level improvements. These improvements include hybridization, \nmore efficient idling, and high efficiency HVAC technologies. By \nincreasing the funding for the SuperTruck II program by $2 million, it \nwill allow the Department of Energy to better achieve their freight \nefficiency goals.\n  This amendment is fully offset by a decrease in the departmental \nadministration account.\n  I thank my colleague, Steve Cohen, for his continued work on this \nimportant issue. I would also like to thank Chairman Simpson and \nRanking Member Kaptur for their hard work on this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``yes'' on the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of an amendment Congressman \nJerry McNerney and I are offering today to the Fiscal Year 2017 Energy \nand Water Appropriations Act.\n  Our amendment would increase funding for the Energy Efficiency and \nRenewable Energy account by $2 million for the SuperTruck II program, \nand it is fully offset.\n  The SuperTruck program at the Department of Energy (DOE) helps \nresearch and develop more fuel efficient long-haul, tractor-trailers, \nwhich is important not just for our environment but also for our \neconomy.\n  The types of improvements we may see as a result of this program \ninclude better engine efficiency, aerodynamics, and truck weight.\n  The Appropriations Committee included $20 million of the requested \n$60 million for the SuperTruck II program. While I am grateful for the \nfunding, I believe we can do more.\n  I would like to thank Congressman McNerney for his help on this \namendment as well as Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur for all \ntheir efforts on this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Buck\n\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 43, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced to $0)''.\n       Page 44, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     to $0)''.\n       Page 44, line 25, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced to $0)''.\n       Page 45, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     to $0)''.\n       Page 45, line 16, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced to $0)''.\n       Page 45, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced to $0)''.\n       Page 80, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $3,481,616,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the opportunity to speak \nabout this amendment to the Energy and Water Development and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act of 2017.\n  This amendment zeroes out several Federal agency programs that have \nbeen in the business of picking winners and losers. Federal bureaucrats \nare not venture capitalists or R specialists. They have no business \nexposing billions of taxpayer dollars to potentially risky investments.\n  We must continue to invest in renewable, nuclear, and fossil energy \ntechnologies; but the investments in these projects should be left to \nthe private sector, where firms can decide whether or not to take on \nthe risk.\n  Additionally, the discoveries from these projects are owned by the \ncompanies themselves, rather than placed into the private domain to \nbenefit our Nation more fully. Moreover, wherever the Federal \nGovernment doles out taxpayer dollars, high-paid lobbyists stand at the \nready to collect their share.\n  The success of companies pursuing new energy technologies should \ndepend on those technologies' merits. This amendment eliminates those \ncrony subsidies.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting Chair. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, it is interesting that a Member from Colorado, \nwhich is where the National Renewable Energy Laboratory--I would sure \nlike to have that in Ohio--is headquartered. I have actually visited \nthat site and have been so impressed by the basic research that has \nbeen done in so many arenas that has brought new products to market.\n  When I look at the solar industry, for example, were it not for the \nphotovoltaic research of the U.S. Department of Energy back in the \nearly days, it would not now be employing more people than those who \nwork in many of the other energy sectors put together. It is amazing to \nme that it is one of the fastest growing segments of our market.\n  But the basic research that had to be done--the thin film research, \nthe work on silicates, on cadmium tellurides, so many of the \ningredients--frankly, there was no company that was able to take that \nrisk in the past. And they certainly couldn't get the funding; I can \nguarantee you that. Some of this research started back in the 1980s. So \nI think that the energy efficiency and renewable energy programs are \njust terribly important.\n  On the nuclear front, there is no private company that has figured \nout how to really handle the waste product from nuclear. We have to \ninvest in nuclear energy to build a safer world for the future, and the \nDepartment of Energy does that. No private company takes that on.\n  In fact, we have a lot of waste. There are environmental management \nprojects across this country, hundreds of billions of dollars. We have \nto handle cleanup from past years and the cold war. No private company \nis able to do that on its own. That is something that is a legacy of \nour defense structure.\n  I am really not quite sure what the gentleman's objective is here, \nbut I don't want to take America backwards. I want her to move forward.\n  We are now at 91 percent in terms of our ability to fund our energy \nuse here in our country, compared to half that just several years ago. \nThat is a real accomplishment. It is something that the public sector \nand the private sector are able to work on together.\n  I really think that the gentleman's efforts are misguided, and I \nwould have to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I yield to the gentleman from Idaho.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Like the ranking member, I would oppose this amendment. It would \nreduce funds in the following accounts: EERE, nuclear energy, fossil \nenergy, and other accounts throughout this bill.\n  We spend an awful lot of time making sure that we continue our \nresponsibility to effectively manage government spending, and we have \nworked\n\n[[Page H3072]]\n\ntirelessly to that end. These are targeted funds to provide needed \ninvestments and to efficiently and safely utilize our natural resources \nand invest in the next technological innovations.\n  It is interesting that years ago, we used to have what were called \nthe Bell Laboratories, and they did a lot of the research and stuff \nthat is now done by government. Because it has gotten too expensive, \nany individual company can't do a lot of the research that is done.\n  I will give you an example in the nuclear energy arena. At the Idaho \nNational Lab, we have the advanced test reactors. It is the only one in \nthe United States that does this. Private companies come, as well as \ngovernment and other organizations, to test new fuels, new designs of \nfuels, and those types of things. This is not something that can be \ndone by the private sector.\n  So there are a lot of things that the government does and research \nthat the government does that the private sector, frankly, just doesn't \nhave the resources to do that need to get done. That is what we expect \nour national laboratories to do. That is what EERE does, what fossil \nenergy research does, and other things.\n  As I said, some of these programs, like the ATR, some of the funding \nis paid by the companies that come and use the facility and those types \nof things, as they have to. And besides that, it is good for our \nnational security.\n  It is an interesting fact--and I think my numbers are accurate; if \nthey are not exactly accurate, they are pretty close--that when the \nfirst nuclear-powered submarine was launched, it was fueled for 6 \nmonths and then had to be refueled. But through the research that they \nhave been able to do, the Navy, with the advanced test reactor, we now \nfuel ships for the life of the ship, which is an incredible \nadvancement. But that is done through government research.\n  So while it would be nice to say the private sector ought to do all \nthese things, the reality is the private sector can't do all of those \nthings.\n  I would agree with the gentlewoman and oppose the gentleman's \namendment.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chair, the ranking member asked what the purpose is, \nand I would be glad to answer that.\n  We have over $19 trillion of debt. We are running up huge annual \ndeficits in this country. We do not have a major war going on right \nnow, and we do not have a recession going on right now, but we continue \nto overspend.\n  This is an area where I contend that the private sector has got to do \na lot more than it is doing if we are going to try to balance our \nbudget some day. That may seem like folly to some, but I think the \nimpact of going off the fiscal cliff is far greater than the impact of \ncutting funds for research in this area.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n  Vacating Demand for Recorded Vote on Amendment Offered By Mr. Beyer\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \nrequest for a recorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Beyer) to the end that the Chair puts the question \nde novo.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Idaho?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n     Amendment Offered by Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico\n\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I have an \namendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 43, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $25,000,000) (reduced by $25,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentlewoman \nfrom New Mexico and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Mexico.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, New Mexico is, \nfrankly, very fortunate to have many natural resources, including vast \namounts of minerals, oil, and natural gas; but water is, by far, New \nMexico's most precious commodity.\n  As a Representative from New Mexico, I have witnessed the devastating \nimpact that long-term severe drought can have on businesses, \ncommunities, and the State. Drought conditions threaten the livelihoods \nof farmers and ranchers who depend on this natural resource to run \ntheir operations.\n  In addition, there are many communities in New Mexico, both in urban \nand rural areas, that may not survive without an affordable and a \nsustainable water source. These conditions go beyond New Mexico and \nextend, in fact, to the entire Southwest.\n  Based on the most recent available science, experts believe that this \nregion of the country will continue to experience megadroughts in the \nfuture.\n  It is critical that we make investments now not only to protect and \nconserve this scare resource but to also research and develop \nalternative, affordable, and sustainable water technologies to ensure \nthat Southwest communities and businesses can continue to thrive in \npersistent drought conditions.\n  My amendment would prioritize $25 million for an energy water \ndesalination hub, as proposed by the Department of Energy. The hub will \ndevelop the technology to reduce the cost, energy input, and carbon \nemission levels of water desalination.\n  Desalination technology has been around for many years, and I have \nvisited several countries that are currently using desalination \ntechnology.\n  New Mexico would greatly benefit from this technology, since the \nState has large brackish water reserves that could become viable water \nresources through desalination. Desalination can also help the State's \noil and gas industry to address water shortage and wastewater disposal \nchallenges.\n  Despite the number of benefits and industry advancements, \nunfortunately water desalination is still cost-prohibitive for small \ncommunities and companies. This is why I think it is crucial that we \ndevelop this technology to make it as affordable and energy-efficient \nas possible.\n  Making important investments in water technologies like water \ndesalination will be critical in determining the future of Southwest \ncommunities and businesses.\n  Now, I am disappointed, of course, that this is not something that is \ncurrently included in the bill. I am looking forward to working with \nthe majority on this really important issue.\n  At this time, Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. I yield to the gentlewoman \nfrom Ohio.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  I think Congresswoman Lujan Grisham has done such a phenomenal job \nhere, and I appreciate her interest in the necessity of desalinization \nwork and how important the Department of Energy is in finding a \nsolution that is cost effective and the most advanced energy system we \ncan have to desalinate as we move forward. I share her interest in \nfinding funding for this important work, and, hopefully, in a \nconference situation, we can provide a way to provide some resources.\n  I really applaud the gentlewoman for her path-breaking efforts on \nbehalf of a very important issue.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous \nconsent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Mexico?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n[[Page H3073]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Perry\n\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 43, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $15,000,000)''.\n       Page 50, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $15,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chair, the current bill cuts hydropower by $15 \nmillion, and this amendment seeks to restore it. It offsets it with \nDepartment of Energy, or DOE, administrative costs. Actually, the \namendment reduces outlays by $8 million because, Mr. Chair, water power \nprograms are vitally important to reducing our dependence on foreign \nenergy sources.\n  Hydropower is available in every region of the country, every single \nregion. Literally, 2,200 hydropower plants provide America's most \nabundant source of clean, renewable energy and account for 67 percent \nof domestic renewable generation, for a total of 7 percent of the total \ngeneration across the country.\n  This amendment stands to create 1.4 million new jobs by 2025, Mr. \nChair, and this would be harnessing a truly renewable and green source \nof energy.\n  Let me just talk about some of the advantages of hydro as opposed to \nwind and solar.\n  Hydro has a predictable, year-round output. Solar and wind require, \noften, a battery backup or an alternative power source if they are \ngoing to be viable. Even routine maintenance on a windmill way up there \nis problematic and expensive, where hydro is right down on the ground \nwhere we are. It is easy to maintain.\n  Hydropower facilities are quiet and often unobtrusive. Most of the \nneighbors don't even know they are there. Oftentimes, we hear \ncomplaints about wind generation and the noise it also generates along \nwith the power.\n  Hydropower--I think this is the most important--is baseload. It is a \nbaseload source of energy. It occurs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. \nIt is actually what backs up the other intermittent sources of \nalternative energy. So, it is really important in that context.\n  Now, hydropower faces a comprehensive regulatory approval process, \nand some folks don't like that. But the important part about that is \neverybody is involved: FERC, Federal and State resource agencies, local \ngovernments, tribes, NGOs, and the public. Everybody gets buy-in before \na hydro plant goes on line. Sixty thousand megawatts of preliminary \npermits and projects await final approval and are pending currently \nbefore the Commission in 45 States.\n  Mr. Chair, this is not parochial.\n  There are 80,000 nonpowered dams across the U.S. right now that could \naccept hydropower. There are 600 that have an immediate capability to \nproduce energy right now. That is 80,000 and 600 across the country \nright now. Pennsylvania, itself, has 678 megawatts of untapped power in \nthe form of hydro.\n  Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for the opportunity to offer the \namendment. I understand the $15 million concerns some Members, and I, \ntoo, am concerned about spending. So this one is bipartisan, but I am \nhopeful others will follow.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Ms. Bonamici\n\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 43, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $9,000,000)''.\n       Page 50, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $9,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentlewoman \nfrom Oregon and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Oregon.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a bipartisan \namendment with my colleague from Pennsylvania, Congressman Perry, and \nmy colleague from Maine, Congresswoman Pingree, in support of water \npower technologies.\n  Mr. Chairman, our amendment would increase funding to the Department \nof Energy's Water Power Program by $9 million. This increase is offset \nby an equal amount by the departmental administration account.\n  As Congress promotes technologies that can help lower our \nconstituents' energy bills, we must invest in new and innovative \nsolutions, and my colleague just made a case for why hydropower is so \nimportant.\n  The Department of Energy has estimated that our Nation's marine \nenergy resources could, in the future, represent a very good portion of \nU.S. generation needs.\n  Oregon State University, the University of Washington, and the \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks are leveraging Federal funding from the \nWater Power Program to support the testing and research activities of \nthe Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center, a center that \nwill provide visionary entrepreneurs with the domestic location to test \nwave energy devices, along with other technology, instead of traveling \nto Scotland to use their test center.\n  Without continued Federal investment, Europe will remain the leader. \nChina is investing heavily in these technologies as well.\n  Federal partnerships with educational institutions and the private \nsector are necessary to further the research and development efforts \nalready well underway and close the gap for these technologies on the \nverge of commercial viability.\n  The National Hydropower Association, along with its Pumped Storage \nand Marine Energy Councils have endorsed our bipartisan amendment. \nInvestments in these technologies and this source of energy will spur \ndomestic industry and create good-paying jobs and economic \nopportunities in our communities.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of this bipartisan amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chair, I seek the time in opposition, though I am not \nopposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate my good friend and \ncolleague from Oregon. She has been a champion on this before. She \nfully understands, as I do, that resources across the country are \nstrained. We don't have a lot of extra money to go around. And for all \nthe reasons that I pointed out and the reasons that she pointed out and \nthe Northwest agreeing with the Northeast, let's work together on what \nworks.\n  We know this works. It is one of the oldest sources of electric \nenergy in the world. Why are we wasting our time and collective energy \nin the form of funds and time on these other things that might be nice \nand they might be great years after the development, but this works \nright now and doesn't break the bank?\n  This is a good amendment, and I urge all my colleagues on both sides \nto support it.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, again, I want to thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania and my colleague from Maine for cosponsoring this \nimportant amendment. This is a modest increase in the Water Power \nProgram. It supports marine and hydropower energy technology, and I \nurge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 43, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $9,750,000)''.\n       Page 45, line 16, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $13,000,000)''.\n\n\n[[Page H3074]]\n\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, this bill, in its current form, appropriates \nconsiderably above the administration's mark for fossil energy research \nand development. My amendment doesn't take away all of the amount that \nhas been plussed up. It just takes a small amount of that--$13 million \nout of the $645 million, which is the amount the bill is above last \nyear's appropriations--and directs those funds to the Energy Efficiency \nand Renewable Energy fund, which is an extremely important fund that \nfunds a lot of important activities across our country.\n  As an example, the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy fund is \nworking with American manufacturers to apply 3-D printing, also called \nadditive manufacturing, to renewable technologies. Blades are one of \nthe most costly components of wind turbines, but additive manufacturing \nhas the promise of reducing costs. There is a lot of important basic \nresearch that supports it.\n  In addition, they are working on--it is funded by EERE--advanced \ntechnologies for microgrid projects, coordinated with the Electric \nPower Research Institute, to have localized grids that are connected to \ntraditional grids--but can also disconnect--to operate autonomously and \nhelp mitigate grid disturbances, meaning more security for our national \nenergy system when we can avoid large-scale downtime from large grid \noutages.\n  Another example is solar resource maps, leading to solar exports to \nenhance the quality and accuracy of our research maps across the \ncountry, helping to facilitate exports of solar PV products to other \ncountries, like India, by identifying high-quality solar projects in \nIndia that are creative and profitable.\n  Another example of the EERE is the Vehicle Technologies Office to the \nClean Cities coalition in support of a project fostering electric \nvehicle readiness in the Rocky Mountain area to foster State policies \nto increase the adoption of plug-in electric vehicles.\n  As we know, plug-in engines powered from the grid are far more \nefficient at converting energy, whether it comes from a balance of coal \nand wind and solar, than an internal combustion engine that just runs \noff gasoline.\n  So the budget estimate for the fund that we are talking about was \n$360 million. The plus up recommended was $645 million. This would \nsimply remove $13 million and allocate it to a very important account \nthat I hope we can build bipartisan support for.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose this amendment. The \namendment would cut funding for the Fossil Energy Research and \nDevelopment program and increase the EERE program by a similar amount.\n  Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, provide for 81 \npercent of the energy used by the Nation's homes and businesses and \ngenerates 67 percent of the Nation's electricity. It will continue to \nprovide for the majority of our energy needs for the foreseeable \nfuture.\n  Let me repeat that. They provide for 81 percent of the energy used by \nthe Nation's homes and businesses and generate 67 percent of the \nNation's electricity.\n  The bill rejects the administration's proposed reductions in fossil \nenergy and, instead, funds these programs at $645 million, or $13 \nmillion above last year's request.\n  With this additional funding, the Office of Fossil Energy will \nresearch how to capture emissions from our power plants on how water \ncan be more effectively used in power plants and how coal can be used \nto produce electric power through fuel cells.\n  This amendment would reduce the funding for a program that ensures we \nuse our Nation's abundant fossil fuel resources as well and as cleanly \nas possible. In fact, just increasing the efficiency of fossil fuel by \n1 percent would power millions of households, all without using a pound \nof additional fuel from the ground. That is the kind of research this \nprogram represents.\n  Therefore, I must oppose this amendment, and I urge Members to vote \n``no'' on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. \nKaptur).\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding, and I \nrise in support of the Polis amendment to increase funding for the \nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. That office is one of \nthe most forward-looking segments within the Department of Energy and \nthe group that is driving the huge surge we are seeing across the \ncountry in energy innovation.\n  The future we all envision is in renewable energy, smart grids, \nenergy storage, and energy efficiency. One hundred and ninety countries \nmade it clear to the world that they support this new future in Paris \nat the end of the last year, and the funding of EERE is critical to \nensuring the U.S. leads the world into that future.\n  Let me mention the solar energy account, in particular, is yielding \nserious benefits. The number of workers in this growing renewable \nsector has doubled over the last 5 years, and its rapid expansion shows \nno signs of slowing down, with solar projected to add 9.5 gigawatts of \nnew energy this year, more than any other energy source.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  It employs more Americans than work on oil rigs and in gas fields, \njust in the solar sector.\n  So I support this amendment to expand the Energy Efficiency and \nRenewable Energy Office and the increase in funding that Congressman \nPolis is offering for a clean energy future for all.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am hopeful that this amendment will pass. I have prepared some \nother amendments that specifically look at the fossil fuel R as a \nwasteful expenditure.\n  To be clear, this one does not contemplate that. It still increases \nthe level substantially from the budget estimate, which is $360 million \nfor this account. The recommended 2017 level in the chairman's mark is \n$645 million, so there is a plus-up of $285 million over the \nPresident's budget for this line item.\n  So I think it is entirely appropriate to just take $13 million from \nthat, without prejudice with regard to the rest, put it into the Energy \nEfficiency Renewable Energy Fund, which I had the opportunity to talk \nabout some of the great advances that it makes for energy security with \nregard to our grid, for manufacturing, and job creation through 3D \nprinting of wind blades, and many other worthy causes.\n  I am hopeful that this body chooses to gain from the best of both \nworlds by adopting this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 43, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $285,000,000)''.\n       Page 45, line 16, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(decreased by $285,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, look, now let's get serious here. Fossil \nfuel research and development is simply the wrong direction for our \ncountry. Putting more and more money behind oil and gas, which we need \nto move away from, over time, is only increasing our sunk costs in an \neconomy that leads to\n\n[[Page H3075]]\n\nclimate change and long-term ruin. Not only our economy is ruined by \nthe use of oil and gas, but health and safety for communities, our \noceans, our air, and our world.\n  The fact that this bill has appropriated almost $300 million more \nthan the President requested shows how lopsided the priorities in the \nbill are. This is an enormous subsidy for the oil and gas industry. One \nof the most profitable industries in the world is more than capable of \nfunding its own research and development without subsidies from the \nFederal Government using the taxpayer money from hardworking Americans \nto further fund them.\n  This bill would simply reduce the fossil fuel account back to the \nPresident's recommended level, and the remainder would go to reduce the \nbudget deficit.\n  I think that this is an important point to point out, that many of \nthe components of the fossil energy R expenditure line make our air \ndirtier, our water dirtier, and, of course, move to destruction of the \nclimate. So, in many ways, the less we can do the better.\n  At a time of record budget deficits, finding smart savings by \nreducing handouts to the oil and gas industry is something that can \nhelp restore some semblance of fiscal responsibility to our Nation.\n  There is an example of an account under the Division of Fossil Energy \nthat creates technology that allows oil and gas companies to drill in \noil shale formations where there is less than 50,000 barrels per day.\n  We should be doing less oil shale drilling, not ways to find more. As \na district and a State directly affected by oil shale drilling, we deal \nwith all of the economic externalities and costs every day. Oil shale \nis one of the most dirty extraction methods that exists, and the \ndistillation for oil shale releases toxic pollutants into the air, like \nsulfur dioxide, lead, and nitrogen oxide.\n  If companies want to research new extraction technologies, more power \nto them, as long as they abide by the EPA and other health and safety \nguidelines. But for taxpayer money and subsidies to go to developing \nsomething that has been devastating for my State and for the country is \nreally an abomination, and I am hopeful that, in the name of reducing a \nbudget deficit and finding smart savings, we can reduce this line \nsignificantly back to the $360 million that was in the original budget \nestimate.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I must insist on my point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, the amendment proposes to amend portions \nof the bill not yet read.\n  The amendment may not be considered en bloc under clause 2(f) of rule \nXXI because the amendment proposes to increase the level of outlays in \nthe bill.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member seek to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  Mr. POLIS. I do, Mr. Chairman.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, it is simply the deficit savings account, so \nwhen the money isn't spent, that is where it goes. The deficit savings \naccount is not an outlay. It is simply not being spent in the first \nplace.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.\n  To be considered en bloc pursuant to clause 2(f) of rule XXI, an \namendment must not propose to increase the levels of budget authority \nor outlays in the bill.\n  Because the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado proposes \na net increase in the level of outlays in the bill, as argued by the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations, it may not avail itself \nof clause 2(f) to address portions of the bill not yet read.\n  The point of order is sustained. The amendment is not in order.\n\n\n                        Parliamentary Inquiries\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, point of parliamentary inquiry.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, when would it be in order to present the \namendment?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair has ruled on that particular amendment. \nThe gentleman may seek to offer an amendment at the appropriate point \nin the reading of the bill.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, further point of parliamentary inquiry.\n  If the deficit reduction account is not cited, what happens to the \nsavings that are designated under the bill?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair will not respond to a hypothetical.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H3076]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I believe with this new structure of this \namendment we have now addressed the procedural issue around deficit \nreduction. We are now, again, with this amendment, seeking to reduce \nthe fossil energy subsidies back to the level requested by the \nPresident and return the savings to our Federal coffers, namely, by not \nspending them in the first place.\n  So, again, in previous amendments, we talked about spending some on \nrenewable energy. In this case, it doesn't increase any of those lines. \nWhat it does do is simply decrease the subsidies to the fossil energy \nindustry, including some of the research priorities we talked about, \nwhich private companies are welcome to pursue.\n  But I don't want to go back to Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer in my district \nand say, guess what, your hard-earned tax money is going to subsidize \nthese multi-billion dollar international corporations to do their \nresearch for them.\n  This amendment would do that. It would then allow the savings to not \nbe spent and to reduce our deficit.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my reservation of a point of \norder.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The reservation of the point of order is withdrawn.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the gentleman's \namendment. He would cut $285 million out of the fossil energy program.\n  What is interesting about this is that they say that this is an \nunbalanced bill because we have increased funding for fossil energy. \nAnd if you look at the amount of the electricity in this country and \nthe energy that is produced by fossil energy, the research done in \nfossil energy by those big companies, as the gentleman suggests, is \nimportant, and it is proportional to the amount of energy produced by \nfossil fuels in this country.\n  To suggest that let's make sure that we don't do any fossil fuel \nresearch or we cut it substantially suggests that we don't do any \nsubsidies to any of the other fuels in this country. We don't do any \nwind subsidies. We don't do any solar subsidies or any of the other \ntypes of things for these big companies. In fact, we do loan guarantees \nfor a lot of them that go out of business.\n  So I think this is important, and striking the majority of these \nfunds--or at least taking it back to what the President recommended--\nthe problem is that the bill created a balanced, all-of-the-above \nenergy policy.\n  It is the administration's proposal that was unbalanced, and focused \nmainly on renewable energies and ignored, to a large degree, the \nmajority of the fuel that we use today, the energy sources we use \ntoday, and that is the fuel of fossil fuels.\n  As I said in the last debate on one of the earlier amendments, 81 \npercent of the fuel we use today, and if you ask most experts, they \ndon't expect that to go down in the near future or even in the long-\nterm future. It is going to remain a major portion of our energy \nportfolio for years to come.\n  So I would oppose this amendment. What we do in the fossil energy \nresearch program is very important to developing the clean source of \nenergy that we all want.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, we have a somewhat ironic situation where \nthe Republicans are saying: President Obama, you don't want to spend \nenough. President Obama, you have to spend more.\n  This from the so-called party of fiscal responsibility telling our \nPresident's budget: You aren't spending enough, you aren't spending \nenough on fossil fuels on this case, spend hundreds of billions of \ndollars more of money we don't have that we are borrowing from China \nand Saudi Arabia to fund a legacy technology that we are moving away \nfrom.\n  Of course, we still rely on fossil fuels. The gentleman won't have \nany disagreement, and I am not trying to zero out the account. We are \nsimply reducing it to the level that the President wants to spend at \nrather than throwing more and more money hand over fist like this \nRepublican tax-and-spend Congress continues to do.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I have to say that that is just kind of a \nbogus argument. It is not that we are saying to the President: You have \nto spend this money in this area.\n  We are rebalancing the portfolio. We are not spending any more money \nthan the President recommended in the entire bill--well, we are about \n$285 million, or $259 million, but most of that is in the weapons \nactivities. But we are rebalancing the portfolio. We are spending less \nthan the President wants to spend in other areas. So to say, oh, we are \njust trying to spend money is not the case. We have different \npriorities.\n  We want an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which is what this bill \nrepresents. We spend money in solar, we spend money in wind, we spend \nmoney in nuclear, and we spend money in fossil energy. Those are all \nimportant. So just because the gentleman doesn't like fossil energy \ndoesn't mean that we ought to do away with the research on it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, what this amendment would do is reduce the \nbudget deficit by $285 million. It gives Congress an opportunity to \nsay: Let's not spend more than the President of the United States \nwants; let's make some reasonable cutbacks to levels that are in the \nbudget estimate already; and rather than throw subsidies hand over fist \nto the most profitable industry on the face of the planet, instead of \nrebalancing, let's move towards balancing our budget.\n  I came here to reduce our deficit. I support a constitutional \namendment to balance our budget. We haven't been able to have a vote on \nthat in this body this session of Congress. By reducing this $285 \nmillion of expenditures where we found an area where Congress actually \nwants to spend $285 million more than President Obama wants to spend, \nlet's just go back to what President Obama wants to spend, okay, rather \nthan be even more profligate throwing money hand over the fist after a \nlegacy industry and research that should be done by highly profitable \nprivate companies, let's simply cut it back to the level in the \nPresident's budget and move towards balancing rather than rebalancing.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I suggest that if that is the case, then I \nsuspect that the gentleman, if that is his desire, then I suspect that \nthe gentleman supports the Republican plan to not spend as much money \nin the EERE as the President wanted because we are spending less in \nEERE, and in some other programs within the Department of Energy we are \nspending less than the administration wanted. So I am glad to hear that \nhe would support the Republican position on that because we are \nspending less.\n  Now, there is one thing we both agree on. I would like to see a \nbalanced budget amendment before us. I think it would be important that \nwe would pass one. That is not what we are debating today. What we are \ndebating today is the Energy and Water Development program. What we do \nis we have a cap on how much we can spend. That cap is within the \nbipartisan budget that was agreed to last year. I suspect the gentleman \nprobably voted for it. I don't know that for sure, but I suspect he \nprobably did. This is within that budget.\n  If the gentleman wants to decrease the funding in EERE and all of the \nother programs that the Republicans have reduced funding in, then, gee, \nI will go along with him.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, I would and I have supported across the board 1 \npercent cuts and 3 percent cuts. I am happy to do it on this bill, too. \nI hope that somebody offers one. I haven't prepared one. Usually Mrs. \nBlackburn prepares those. I usually vote for them as long as they are \nreasonable.\n\n[[Page H3077]]\n\n  What we have here is a targeted cut that can reduce the budget \ndeficit by $285 million by simply spending as much as President Obama \nwants to spend. We shouldn't need a balanced budget amendment. I \nsupport it. Let's bring it to the floor. I am glad the gentleman \nagrees. I hope he tells his conference and the majority leader to work \nwith Democrats on a bipartisan amendment to balance our budget.\n  But in the meantime, we needn't wait for that. Let's start right now. \nLet's cut $285 million which will actually make a dent in this bill and \nmove towards balancing the budget rather than simply put it off for \ntomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I would just say that in EERE, the \nadministration requested $2.9 billion. We funded it at 1.8--1.8 \nsomething--1.86 or something like that. We saved a billion dollars. So \nwe actually are rebalancing the portfolio in what we think is \nimportant. That is what we do.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado.\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                    Office of Technology Transitions\n\n       For Department of Energy expenses necessary for technology \n     transitions and commercialization activities in carrying out \n     the purposes of the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7101 et seq.), section 1001 of the Energy Policy Act \n     of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16391), and the Stevenson-Wydler \n     Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.), \n     $7,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2018.\n\n                 Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves\n\n       For Department of Energy expenses necessary to carry out \n     naval petroleum and oil shale reserve activities, \n     $14,950,000, to remain available until expended: Provided, \n     That notwithstanding any other provision of law, unobligated \n     funds remaining from prior years shall be available for all \n     naval petroleum and oil shale reserve activities.\n\n                      Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n\n       For Department of Energy expenses necessary for Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve facility development and operations and \n     program management activities pursuant to the Energy Policy \n     and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.), $257,000,000, \n     to remain available until expended.\n\n                   Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve\n\n       For Department of Energy expenses necessary for Northeast \n     Home Heating Oil Reserve storage, operation, and management \n     activities pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.), $6,500,000, to remain available \n     until expended.\n\n                   Energy Information Administration\n\n       For Department of Energy expenses necessary in carrying out \n     the activities of the Energy Information Administration, \n     $122,000,000, to remain available until expended.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Katko\n\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 47, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $3,000,000)''.\n       Page 72, line 9, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $3,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, can we get a clarification of what \namendment the gentleman is offering?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will re-report the amendment.\n  The Clerk reread the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Chairman, over the past several years, the Northern \nBorder Regional Commission has provided vital resources to economically \ndistressed communities along the northern border of New England and New \nYork. Each year, the commission selects a number of projects through a \ncompetitive process that are aimed at spurring economic development, \nimproving infrastructure, and increasing access to health care among \nother things.\n  This region, like many other communities in our country, has \nexperienced severe economic challenges in recent years. Mills and \nfactories have closed, populations of States are static or have \ndeclined in some areas, and some industries are particularly hard-hit, \nlike the nuclear industry, and the change in market dynamics related \nthereto.\n  For example, the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant is closed. The \nFitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant in my district is closing and putting \nout of work 600 individuals with very high-paying jobs in an \neconomically distressed community.\n  This commission provides a smart, efficient, and targeted way of \nspurring economic development across this region. My amendment would \nincrease the appropriation level in this bill from $5 million to $8 \nmillion in order to maintain the vital work of this commission. This \nincrease is fully offset by a decrease in funding for the Energy \nInformation Administration.\n  This amendment can give displaced workers job training, give them \nback work, improve infrastructure, and boost the economy across this \nchallenged region.\n  At this time, however, I will withdraw my amendment, but I hope I can \nwork with the chairman moving forward to ensure that this vital program \nis maintained to the benefit of the economies in the northern border \nregion.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. KATKO. I yield to the gentleman from Idaho.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's, my \ncolleague's, passion for the Northern Border Regional Commission, and I \nwill work with him in conference to see if additional funds can be \nprovided because it provides an important function in that area.\n  So I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                   Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup\n\n       For Department of Energy expenses, including the purchase, \n     construction, and acquisition of plant and capital equipment \n     and other expenses necessary for non-defense environmental \n     cleanup activities in carrying out the purposes of the \n     Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 et \n     seq.), including the acquisition or condemnation of any real \n     property or any facility or for plant or facility \n     acquisition, construction, or expansion, $226,745,000, to \n     remain available until expended.\n\n      Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund\n\n       For Department of Energy expenses necessary in carrying out \n     uranium enrichment facility decontamination and \n     decommissioning, remedial actions, and other activities of \n     title II of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2297f et \n     seq.) and title A, subtitle X, of the Energy Policy Act of \n     1992 (42 U.S.C. 2296a et seq.), $698,540,000, to be derived \n     from the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and \n     Decommissioning Fund, to remain available until expended, of \n     which $32,959,000 shall be available in accordance with title \n     A, subtitle X, of the Energy Policy Act of 1992.\n\n                                Science\n\n       For Department of Energy expenses including the purchase, \n     construction, and acquisition of plant and capital equipment, \n     and other expenses necessary for science activities in \n     carrying out the purposes of the Department of Energy \n     Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.), including the \n     acquisition or condemnation of any real property or facility \n     or for plant or facility acquisition, construction, or \n     expansion, and purchase of not more than 17 passenger motor \n     vehicles for replacement only, including one ambulance and \n     one bus, $5,400,000,000, to remain available until expended: \n     Provided, That of such amount, $184,697,000 shall be \n     available until September 30, 2018, for program direction.\n\n                         Nuclear Waste Disposal\n\n       For nuclear waste disposal activities to carry out the \n     purposes of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (Public Law \n     97-425), including the acquisition of real property or \n     facility construction or expansion, $150,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended, and to be derived from the Nuclear \n     Waste Fund: Provided, That of the amount provided under this \n     heading, $5,000,000 shall be made available to affected units \n     of local government, as defined in section 2(31) of the\n\n[[Page H3078]]\n\n     Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101(31)), to \n     support the Yucca Mountain geologic repository, as authorized \n     by such Act.\n\n               Advanced Research Projects Agency--Energy\n\n       For Department of Energy expenses necessary in carrying out \n     the activities authorized by section 5012 of the America \n     COMPETES Act (42 U.S.C. 16538), $305,889,000, to remain \n     available until expended: Provided, That of such amount, \n     $29,250,000 shall be available until September 30, 2018, for \n     program direction.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Schiff\n\n  Mr. SCHIFF.

Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer a bipartisan amendment with \nRepresentatives Gibson, Peters, Dold, and Swalwell of California, to \nincrease funding for the Advanced Research Project Agency-Energy, \notherwise known as ARPA-E.\n  I offered similar bipartisan amendments many times in the past, and \nthey have passed with bipartisan support.\n  The House bill includes roughly $306 million for ARPA-E this year, \nwhich is an improvement over prior years, but it still falls $44 \nmillion below the President's request.\n  This amendment would not make up the full deficit of $44 million, but \nwould increase funding for ARPA-E by $19 million with the offset taken \nfrom the administrative account. With this amendment, the House bill \nwould fund ARPA-E at $325 million. That is the same level as the Senate \nbill, which acted in a bipartisan fashion to increase funding. While \npassage of the amendment would mean that ARPA-E is still funded well \nbelow the President's request, it will reinforce our commitment to \nsupporting high-risk, high-reward, and game-changing research.\n  ARPA-E is a revolutionary program that advances high-potential, high-\nimpact energy technologies that are simply too early for market \ninvestment. ARPA-E projects have the potential to radically improve \nU.S. economic security, national security, and environmental well-\nbeing. ARPA-E empowers America's energy researchers with funding, \ntechnical assistance, and market readiness.\n  ARPA-E is modeled after the highly successful Defense Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency, or DARPA, which has produced groundbreaking \ninventions for the Department of Defense and the Nation.\n  Energy is a national security issue. It is an economic imperative. It \nis a health concern. It is an environmental necessity. Investing wisely \nin this type of research going on at ARPA-E is exactly the direction we \nshould be going as a nation. We want to lead the energy revolution. We \ndon't want to see this advantage go to China or some other country.\n  If we are serious about staying in the forefront of the energy \nrevolution, we must continue to fully invest in the kind of cutting-\nedge work that ARPA-E represents. By providing this additional funding \nwith the offset, we will send a clear signal of the seriousness of our \nintent to remain the world leader.\n  I have a couple of my GOP colleagues who wanted to speak, Mr. Gibson \nand Mr. Dold. I don't know if they are present.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge support for the bipartisan measure.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Schiff).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n         Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program\n\n       Such sums as are derived from amounts received from \n     borrowers pursuant to section 1702(b) of the Energy Policy \n     Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16512(b)) under this heading in prior \n     Acts, shall be collected in accordance with section 502(7) of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974: Provided, That for \n     necessary administrative expenses to carry out this Loan \n     Guarantee program, $37,000,000 is appropriated, to remain \n     available until September 30, 2018: Provided further, That \n     $30,000,000 of the fees collected pursuant to section 1702(h) \n     of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 shall be credited as \n     offsetting collections to this account to cover \n     administrative expenses and shall remain available until \n     expended, so as to result in a final fiscal year 2017 \n     appropriation from the general fund estimated at not more \n     than $7,000,000: Provided further, That fees collected under \n     section 1702(h) in excess of the amount appropriated for \n     administrative expenses shall not be available until \n     appropriated: Provided further, That the Department of Energy \n     shall not subordinate any loan obligation to other financing \n     in violation of section 1702 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 \n     or subordinate any Guaranteed Obligation to any loan or other \n     debt obligations in violation of section 609.10 of title 10, \n     Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n\n                Amendment Offered by Mr. Weber of Texas\n\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 49, line 18, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $7,000,000)''.\n       Page 80, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $7,000,000)''.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise to offer a commonsense amendment to the Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill that I would think all Members can support.\n  First, I want to thank Chairman Simpson for his work on this \nlegislation and for continuing to prioritize the needs of the Nation's \nharbors and waterways.\n  One of the most important responsibilities of the Science, Space, and \nTechnology Committee is to conduct oversight of the DOE programs under \nthe committee's jurisdiction, Mr. Chairman.\n  This includes the DOE Loan Programs Office. Our commitment to \nrigorous oversight has led us to request that this office provide us \nwith their internal watch list, which describes each loan in their \ncurrent portfolio that DOE has determined to have existing or potential \nchallenges that may impact repayment or to be at risk of default. Can \nyou say ``Solyndra,'' Mr. Chairman? This request was made in December, \nand, to date, the Department of Energy has refused.\n  The DOE Loan Guarantee Program has a track record of failed loans. In \nMarch, reports surfaced that a solar power company with $1.6 billion in \ntaxpayer loan guarantees could fail to meet its contractual obligations \nand be shut down. This is the kind of potential failure, Mr. Chairman, \nthat taxpayers can least afford. Full congressional oversight of this \nprogram is absolutely necessary. The DOE has no justification for \nwithholding this list from Congress.\n  My amendment, Mr. Chairman, would reduce the program's administrative \nbudget by $7 million of Treasury funds, but leave in place the $30 \nmillion the DOE collects from fees generated by existing loan guarantee \nrecipients. These fees are used to monitor and oversee the existing \nloan guarantee portfolio.\n  In the past year, DOE has announced several new loan solicitations. \nHowever, the Department's failure to respond to a congressional inquiry \nleaves us seeing red. That is what is wrong with our budget. Now the \ndeficit is in the red.\n  This requires us to act to protect taxpayer funds, Mr. Chairman. This \namendment would simply prevent the Department from issuing new loans \nuntil it has complied with our investigation and provides the requested \ndocuments to our committee.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, while I share my colleague's concern \nregarding the Loan Guarantee Program and the nonresponse from the \nDepartment to the Science, Space, and Technology\n\n[[Page H3079]]\n\nCommittee that has requested the information--and I will guarantee you \nthat I will do all I can to make sure that they do respond to that--the \nelimination of the funding would hurt Federal oversight of more than $8 \nbillion in loan guarantees that are already out there.\n  The committee recommendation only provides costs the program needs to \nmonitor loans and conduct the proper oversight to ensure taxpayer funds \nare being effectively managed, and you should have access to that \ninformation that you have requested.\n  Let me be clear. The funds provided in this bill support \nadministrative operations only. Further, the bill rejects the \nPresident's request for new loan guarantee authority.\n  The loans already committed will require oversight for many years to \ncome. Eliminating these funds for this administrative function is the \nwrong approach and effectively removes the government's ability to \nretrieve billions of dollars in loan fees.\n  Therefore, I have to oppose this amendment, but I understand why the \ngentleman is offering it. I would say that I will work with you to make \nsure that the Department is more responsive to the requests of the \ncommittees.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman very much for yielding \nand join him in opposing this, I think, well-intentioned amendment. The \namendment would actually cut funding for the oversight of existing \nloans. I don't think, in view of some of the things that have happened \nin the past, that is the best course.\n  The program has had a significant beneficial impact on innovative \nenergy projects coast to coast that are generating energy today. \nTherefore, I would agree with the chairman in opposing the amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our efforts to vote ``no'' at this \ntime.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, in my district on the Gulf Coast of \nTexas, which is laden with energy--and I agree with Mr. Schiff of \nCalifornia that energy is a national security issue--we have to have \nagencies that are focused on energy, on programs, on loan guarantees, \nwhere Americans get the most bang for their buck.\n  These agencies must be accountable. They have to understand that \nCongress has to be in the driver's seat and is in the driver's seat. We \nneed to hold them accountable. They need to provide us with that list.\n  While I appreciate my colleague from Idaho's willingness to work with \nus to make sure that the agency complies, I appreciate the \ngentlewoman's comments. We are going to have to get their attention. \nThey have fees to continue to run their program that they collect from \nthose companies that they actually make the loan guarantees to.\n  I have to insist that we get their attention. My colleagues in the \n14th Congressional District of the State of Texas want us to rein in \nsome of these agencies and make them accountable to the elected \nrepresentatives of the American people. So I have to insist that I push \nforward with this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Welch\n\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask \nunanimous consent to offer it at this point in the reading.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Vermont?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 46, line 16, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $2,500,000)''.\n       Page 72, line 9, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $2,500,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Vermont and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Vermont.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, the northern border region, from Maine, to \nNew Hampshire, to Vermont, to New York, is a particularly hard hit \neconomic area. The Northern Border Regional Commission has been a \ntremendous asset to help folks across that region--by the way, \ninhabited by Republicans and Democrats--to start reviving their \neconomy.\n  The Commission is modeled, by the way, after the Appalachian Regional \nCommission and provides Federal funds for critical economic and \ncommunity development projects throughout the Northeast. These lead to \nnew jobs and stronger communities.\n  Importantly, the Northern Border Regional Commission helps orient \nFederal appropriations toward State-prioritized projects. The State is \nvery much a player in allocating where this money goes.\n  Through the collective vote of the Governors of these States, they \ncoordinate with the Federal co-chair to rank the funding applications. \nThis ensures accountability and effectiveness. It has worked.\n  In Vermont, for instance, the Commission has helped fund a number of \nprojects: $226,000 for Lyndon State College to establish a new 4-year \ndegree in hospitality and tourism management, one of the big drivers of \nour economy in the Northern Border Region; $250,000 to the Northern \nCommunity Investment Corporation for telecommunications infrastructure \nthat rural areas have to have; and $250,000 to the Vermont Agency of \nTransportation to connect with the Washington Railroad network in \nBarton, Vermont.\n  The Commission is having a similarly positive effect across the \nNortheast: New York, New Hampshire, Maine, as well as Vermont. Our \namendment recognizes the effective work the Commission is doing and the \nlarge need that remains unmet by restoring funding for the program to \nlast year's level of $7.5 million.\n  We are trying to avoid a cut, and we are trying to maintain level \nfunding. The increase in funding will go a long way in the communities \nacross the northern border to help them revitalize their economy.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, first let me say that I understand the \ngentleman's concerns for the economic hardships of his region and \nappreciate his passion on this issue. His amendment would be an \nincrease of 50 percent above the funding in the bill.\n  Additionally, the amendment would pay for that increase with a cut to \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve account. The bill funds the Reserve \naccount at the budget request in order to ensure the continued \noperability of the Reserve. This funding will provide for the basic \nannual costs as well as addressing some of the deferred maintenance \nbacklog.\n  I know it doesn't always sound exciting, but the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve is a Federal asset that must be properly maintained. It \ncontributes to our Nation's energy security and economic stability.\n  For these reasons, I must oppose the amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Vermont will \nbe postponed.\n\n[[Page H3080]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n        Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program\n\n       For Department of Energy administrative expenses necessary \n     in carrying out the Advanced Technology Vehicles \n     Manufacturing Loan Program, $5,000,000, to remain available \n     until September 30, 2018.\n\n                      Departmental Administration\n\n       For salaries and expenses of the Department of Energy \n     necessary for departmental administration in carrying out the \n     purposes of the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7101 et seq.), $233,971,000, to remain available until \n     September 30, 2018, including the hire of passenger motor \n     vehicles and official reception and representation expenses \n     not to exceed $30,000, plus such additional amounts as \n     necessary to cover increases in the estimated amount of cost \n     of work for others notwithstanding the provisions of the \n     Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1511 et seq.): Provided, That \n     such increases in cost of work are offset by revenue \n     increases of the same or greater amount: Provided further, \n     That moneys received by the Department for miscellaneous \n     revenues estimated to total $103,000,000 in fiscal year 2017 \n     may be retained and used for operating expenses within this \n     account, as authorized by section 201 of Public Law 95-238, \n     notwithstanding the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3302: Provided \n     further, That the sum herein appropriated shall be reduced as \n     collections are received during the fiscal year so as to \n     result in a final fiscal year 2017 appropriation from the \n     general fund estimated at not more than $130,971,000: \n     Provided further, That of the total amount made available \n     under this heading, $31,000,000 is for Energy Policy and \n     Systems Analysis.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Ellison\n\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 50, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $1,000,000) (increased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.\n  (Mr. ELLISON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, we can raise living standards for working \nfamilies all across the United States if we use the Federal dollars to \ncreate good jobs.\n  My amendment would reprogram funds to create an Office of Good Jobs \nin the Department of Energy that would help ensure that the \nDepartment's procurement grant making and regulatory decisions \nencourage the creation of decently paid jobs, collective bargaining \nrights, and responsible employment practices.\n  Right now the U.S. Government is America's leading low-wage job \ncreator, funding over 2 million poverty jobs through contracts, loans, \nand grants with corporate America. That is more than the total number \nof low-wage workers employed by Walmart and McDonald's combined.\n  This is a fact, Mr. Chairman, and I think it should alarm all of us. \nThe Federal Government should not lead the race to the bottom for \npoorly paid low-wage jobs.\n  U.S. contract workers earn so little that nearly 40 percent use \npublic assistance programs, Mr. Chairman, like food stamps and section \n8, to feed and shelter their families.\n  To add insult to injury, many of these low-wage U.S. contract workers \nare driven deeper into poverty because their employers steal their \nwages and break other Federal labor laws. Not all. Many Federal \ncontractors are excellent, but some do steal wages, and they tend to \nget away with it.\n  Take, for example, the story of Edilicia Banegas. Edilicia is a \nsingle mom. Edilicia worked for 7 years at the Ronald Reagan Building \nfood court, a Federal building.\n  Her employer stole her wages, paid her with cash under the table, \nused checks from two different establishments in the same food court to \navoid paying her overtime, and retaliated against her when she and her \ncoworkers stood up for their rights.\n  Edilicia has been on strike several times to highlight the plight of \nlow-wage Federal contract workers in Washington, D.C., and across the \ncountry.\n  Well, what about the story of Mayra Tito. Mayra is a Pentagon food \ncourt worker who was fired for challenging her managers to comply with \nlabor laws and for going on strike multiple times.\n  She is a first-generation immigrant struggling to pay her tuition at \nGeorge Mason University and now works odd jobs to make ends meet. Her \nexperience at the Pentagon has inspired her to go to law school to help \nworkers defend their rights.\n  Mr. Chairman, research shows that Federal contractors break Federal \nlaws somewhat on a regular basis. A U.S. Senate report, for example, \nfound that over 30 percent of the biggest penalties for lawbreaking \nwere filed against the biggest U.S. contractors, people who the \nprocurement process got money from the U.S. taxpayer.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  But workers aren't the only ones who would benefit from this new \noffice. This new office would also benefit law-abiding businesses and \nhigh-road employers--employers who play by the rules but who get put at \na competitive disadvantage because they obey the law. The Office of \nGood Jobs would direct taxpayer dollars to American businesses that \nplay by the rules and ensure that cheaters don't get a leg up.\n  It is unfair to make law-abiding companies compete with contractors \nwho are willing to cut corners. Think about it: you are a law-abiding \ncompany that fought hard for that contract, but now the Federal \nGovernment is going to give it to your competitors who are willing to \nsteal from their workers?\n  Plus, we know that contractors who consistently adhere to labor laws \nare more likely to have greater productivity and an increased \nlikelihood of timely, predictable, and successful delivery of goods and \nservices to the Federal Government. Bad contractors usually not only \ncheat workers, but they cheat the Federal Government by poor \nperformance.\n  In conclusion, Mr. Chair, these are tax dollars that should be used \nto build the middle class, to support high-road employers, and to \nprovide the best possible service to the American public. An Office of \nGood Jobs would achieve that. Abandon the days when the U.S. Government \nwas the leading funder of low-wage jobs. After all, Mr. Chair, when you \nand I and all of the other taxpayers have to fund low-wage workers with \nsection 8 and food stamps, that comes out of our pockets. Make these \nfolks pay their workers right. Let's set up an Office of Good Jobs.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, this amendment, basically, is duplicative and \nignores the existing responsible contractor award system that is \nalready in place. Contracting officers must already consult the System \nfor Award Management to ensure a contractor can be awarded a contract. \nBusinesses on the Excluded Parties List System have been suspended or \ndebarred through a due process system and may not be eligible to \nreceive or renew contracts for such cited offenses.\n  The best way to ensure the government contracts or provides grants to \nthe best employers is to enforce the existing suspension and debarment \nsystem. Bad actors who are in violation of basic worker protections \nshould not be awarded Federal contracts. We all agree with that. That \nis why the Federal Government already has a system in place to deny \nFederal contracts to bad actors. If a contractor fails to maintain high \nstandards of integrity and business ethics, agencies already have the \nauthority to suspend or debar the employer from government contracting. \nIn 2014, Federal agencies issued more than 1,000 suspensions and nearly \n2,000 debarments to employers who bid on Federal contracts.\n  The amendment will delay the procurement process with harmful \nconsequences to our Nation's nuclear safety and security. On numerous \noccasions, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has \nhighlighted costly litigation stemming from the complex regulatory \nrules, including from the Fair Labor Standards Act. This amendment \npunishes employers who may unknowingly or unwillingly get caught in the \nFederal Government's maze of bureaucratic rules and reporting \nrequirements.\n  The procurement process is already plagued by delays and \ninefficiencies.\n\n[[Page H3081]]\n\nThis amendment will make these problems worse for the Department of \nEnergy--the second largest contracting agency outside of the Department \nof Defense--further delaying critical support for national nuclear \nsecurity operations.\n  This amendment will work against those who are working hard to \nprotect the Department of Energy and the Army Corps of Engineers \nassets, which is inconceivable given the safety needs of our Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota has 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, let's have an Office of Good Jobs that makes \nsure that the Federal Government leads the example in creating good \njobs, not encourages a race to the bottom as we are doing now. This is \na good amendment, and if we want to restore the American middle class, \nall Members should vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. Chair, it is intended that the appropriation for Departmental \nAdministration be used to establish an Office of Good Jobs in the \nDepartment aimed at ensuring that the Department's procurement, grant-\nmaking, and regulatory decisions encourage the creation of decently \npaid jobs, collective bargaining rights, and responsible employment \npractices. The office's structure shall be substantially similar to the \nCenters for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships located within \nthe Department of Education, Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Health and \nHuman Services, Department of Labor, Department of Agriculture, \nDepartment of Commerce, Department of Veterans Affairs, U.S. Department \nof State, Small Business Administration, Environmental Protection \nAgency, Corporation for National and Community Service, and U.S. Agency \nfor International Development.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chair, I reserve a point of order on the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman from Rhode Island and \na Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I offer this amendment with my good friend \nand colleague, Congressman Larsen of Washington, to support the \ncontinued assessment of the feasibility of using low-enriched uranium, \nor LEU, in naval reactor fuel that would meet military requirements for \naircraft carriers and submarines.\n  Using low-enriched uranium in naval reactor fuel brings significant \nnational security benefits related to nuclear nonproliferation; it \ncould lower security costs and support naval reactor research and \ndevelopment at the cutting edge of nuclear science.\n  As we continue to face the threat of nuclear terrorism and as \ncountries continue to develop naval fuel for military purposes, the \nimperative to reduce the use of highly enriched uranium, or HEU, will \nbecome increasingly important over the next several decades.\n  Using LEU for naval reactors is not an impossible task. France's \nnuclear navy already has converted from HEU to LEU fuel. We must \nevaluate the feasibility for the U.S. Navy as well and take into \naccount the potential benefits to U.S. and international security of \nsetting a norm for using LEU instead of nuclear bomb-grade material. \nFurthermore, the U.S. Navy will eventually exhaust its supply of highly \nenriched uranium.\n  Unless an alternative to using low-enriched uranium fuel is developed \nin the coming decades, the United States would have to resume its \nproduction of bomb-grade uranium for the first time since 1992, \nultimately undermining U.S. nonproliferation efforts.\n  Last year, on a bipartisan basis, Congress authorized and \nappropriated first-year funding in FY16 for naval LEU fuel R \nAlready, this year, the House Armed Services Committee and the Senate \nAppropriations Committee have again supported LEU R efforts. It is \nnow critical that the full House provide funding for this critical \nresearch that is paramount to our national security interests. This $5 \nmillion in funding would support the early testing and manufacturing \ndevelopment that is required to advance the LEU technology for use in \nnaval fuel, yielding significant benefits for nuclear nonproliferation \nas well as security cost savings.\n  The time has come to invest in new technologies to address this \nthreat and to reduce the reliance on highly enriched uranium. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment, and I hope that the majority will \njoin with me in supporting this.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I must insist on my point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. The amendment proposes to amend portions of the bill not \nyet read.\n  The amendment may not be considered en bloc under clause 2(f) of rule \nXXI because the amendment proposes to increase the level of outlays in \nthe bill.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n\n[[Page H3082]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Rhode Island?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Langevin\n\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 53, line 11, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.\n       Page 54, line 14, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $5,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Rhode Island and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, now that the technical correction was made \nto the amendment, my argument stands as to the previous amendment.\n  As I said, the goal of the amendment is to allow R to take place \nusing LEU, low-enriched uranium, for naval reactor fuel that would meet \nmilitary requirements for aircraft carriers and submarines. As I said, \nthis is already done by France in their nuclear navy, which has already \nconverted from using HEU to LEU fuel. This is a much more secure and \nstable fuel than using HEU.\n  Again, the Navy will exhaust its fuel at some point in the coming \ndecades, and unless we have an alternative fuel that would power our \nnuclear aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines, we would have to \nstart producing weapons-grade uranium, once again, for fuel in powering \nour aircraft carriers and submarines. By switching over to LEU, it \nwould, ultimately, reduce costs, be more secure, and provide a long-\nterm fuel for powering our Navy. This is a commonsense approach, as I \nsaid with regard to the previous amendment before the technical \ncorrection was made.\n  Last year, the Congress, on a bipartisan basis, authorized and \nappropriated first-year funding for FY16 for Navy LEU fuel in R \nAlready, this year, the House Armed Services Committee and the Senate \nAppropriations Committee have again supported LEU R efforts.\n  I believe now the time is critical that the full House provide \nfunding for this critical research that is paramount to our national \nsecurity interests. It supports R, and it gives our Navy options for \npowering our nuclear carriers and submarines.\n  I would ask that my colleagues support the amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Garamendi\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 53, lines 11 through 16, strike ``Provided'' through \n     ``Provided further'' and insert ``Provided''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just heard the most interesting discussion a few moments ago about \nhighly enriched uranium. In fact, we are in the process of spending \nseveral billions of dollars in rebuilding our highly enriched uranium \nfacility so that we can produce more nuclear weapons.\n  The subject of this amendment is about old nuclear weapons. We have \nsome 30-plus metric tons of unused plutonium that is sitting in various \nstorage facilities around the United States. We have designed, in an \nagreement with Russia, to dispose of about 30 metric tons of that \nplutonium, and Russia has agreed to dispose of a little bit more than \nwe are going to dispose of. This was all supposed to be done at the \nMixed Oxide Fuel Facility in South Carolina, at the Savannah River \nfacility.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  It is going to cost about a billion dollars back in 2001. The \nestimate in 2014 was $7.7 billion. And in 2015, the estimate is some \n$30 billion, and most people say it isn't going to work.\n  So we have sinkholes for money, and we have black holes for money. \nAnd this is the ultimate black hole into which perhaps $30 billion will \nbe spent. And, at the end of the day, it will probably create more \nproblems and not solve the problem of the 30-or-so metric tons of \nplutonium that actually came out of various bombs that have been \ndismantled over the last several years.\n  So why are we continuing?\n  In the appropriation bill, it calls for $340 million to be spent on \nconstruction of a facility that the Department of Energy says shouldn't \nbe built. But, hey, we are the Congress and we can throw around $340 \nmillion with great aplomb and not even worry about it.\n  So this is a very simple amendment. It doesn't save us the $340 \nmillion, which is what we really ought to do. What this amendment \nreally does is say: don't spend it on further constructing this \nuseless--well, not useless--but totally expensive facility, the MOX \nfacility. Don't waste the money on this boondoggle.\n  And we can spend the money on maybe what the Department of Energy \nthinks we ought to do, which is to dilute and dispose or maybe we could \nbuild a fast reactor, which we actually have built in the past and \nwhich Russia is actually using to dispose of its plutonium. They are \ngenerating energy in doing so while disposing of their unused \nplutonium.\n  So why don't we just accept this amendment and eliminate the \nconstruction clause? Keep the $340 million in South Carolina so that \nthey could be happy and maybe they could spend it on something that \nmight actually work.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Mike \nSimpson for his leadership.\n  I rise today in opposition to the amendment and in support of the \nmixed oxide fuel fabrication facility, or the MOX project, which is \nlocated at the Savannah River site in Aiken and Barnwell, South \nCarolina, adjacent to Augusta, Georgia.\n  I support the facility for a very simple reason. It is the only \nviable method of permanently disposing of weapons-grade plutonium and \nturning it into green fuel for nuclear reactors.\n  Furthermore, it is the only means of upholding our nuclear \nnonproliferation agreement with the Russian Federation. I say so with \nthe background of myself having served as the Deputy General Counsel of \nthe Department of Energy and the only person currently serving in \nCongress who has ever worked at the Savannah River site.\n  The citizens of South Carolina accepted nuclear waste under the \npledge by the Department of Energy that there would be a facility to \nprocess and remove the plutonium. After years of empty promises, the \nactions by this administration to close MOX with no viable alternative \nmakes South Carolina a repository for nuclear waste, putting the people \nof South Carolina and Georgia at risk.\n  The facility is nearly 70 percent completed. There has been a \nshortsighted decision to terminate the MOX project without appropriate \nconsiderations. The administration has failed to complete a \nrebaselining of the MOX project, as required by law.\n  The administration has failed to consult key partners, including the \nEPA or the State of New Mexico as a receiving location. The \nadministration cannot definitely state that the Waste Isolation Pilot \nPlant has the capacity for 34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium or even \nif it will reopen.\n  The administration has failed to communicate with Russia about the \nplan to close MOX, causing Vladimir Putin to not attend the recent \nnuclear summit in Washington. Putin himself stated:\n  ``This is not what we agreed on.\n  ``But serious issues, especially with regard to nuclear arms, are \nquite a different matter and one should be able to meet one's \nobligations.''\n\n[[Page H3083]]\n\n  MOX is a proven technology. It has worked overseas. It is crucial for \nour national security, and any decision to halt or alter its mission \nshould only be carried out after a thorough and careful evaluation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support MOX, to stand up for our national \nsecurity initiatives, to support the only viable alternative for \nplutonium disposition, and to reject the amendment.\n  I am grateful that today the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has issued a \nletter in support of MOX:\n  ``The Chamber opposes any efforts to reduce funding for National \nNuclear Security Administration's mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel facility at \nthe Department of Energy's Savannah River Site. This project is \ncritical to honoring the United States' Plutonium Disposition Protocol \nand the advancement of domestic nuclear fuel production.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1\\3/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, with great respect for my friend from South \nCarolina, who is a most able advocate for his neighborhood, the MOX \nfacility is the ultimate sinkhole for Federal dollars.\n  In fact, there is a viable alternative, and there are quite possibly \ntwo different viable alternatives. One is the Russian fast reactor. We \nhave our own fast reactor. It clearly is disposing of the plutonium \nstockpile in Russia and creating energy along the way that they are \nusing. We also have our own fast reactor systems that have been built \nin the past, and they could be viable and could be located at the \nSavannah River facility to dispose of the plutonium.\n\n  We are going to need to come to some conclusion here. This is a \ndebate that we really must have. The Senate has two different versions, \nand the House has two different versions about what to do. Maybe the \ngentleman and I could wrestle and we could decide which one is the \nversion we would actually take on here.\n  This does not stop the facility. It simply says to stop construction, \nuse the money to look at designs, use the money to look for ongoing \nsolutions, which the gentleman, I believe, is incorrect. But if he is \nright, it could be the MOX facility.\n  But we need to solve this problem. It is a very, very serious \nproblem. We are required by a treaty with Russia to dispose of our \nunused plutonium, which is another amendment that I will take up at the \nend of the day, but I will talk about that much later tonight.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chair, usually Congressman \nGaramendi and I agree on issues like small monitor reactors.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from California has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, this debate has been going on for a while. I \nappreciate what the gentleman is saying.\n  I have been having this debate with the Secretary of Energy for some \ntime. I understand where the people from South Carolina are coming \nfrom. We are talking about jobs and we are talking about the economy.\n  I don't have a dog in this fight, but what I do have is \nresponsibility as chairman of this committee. Five years from now, we \nare not sitting up here talking about the same thing, another chairman \nand another Secretary of Energy and another President.\n  The Department of Energy is famous for starting programs and getting \nhalfway down and then spending billions of dollars and then walking \naway from them. Yucca Mountain is the biggest hole in the ground--they \nspent $14 billion to build--than anything I have ever seen. And it is \nnot the only thing that the Department of Energy has done.\n  But they come to us now and say: Hey, we have a plan and it is going \nto be cheaper. We think that MOX is going to cost $30 billion. Other \npeople say: Nah, that is a stretch. We are looking more like 20 or \nsomething like that.\n  Nobody can get the numbers right, so we ask them to rebaseline it. \nThey haven't done that. But they come to us and say: We have a plan. We \nthink that what we ought to do is just dilute this stuff and then \ndispose of it.\n  Okay. Great. What is that going to take?\n  Well, first of all, we have a treaty with Russia.\n  Have the Russians agreed to this?\n  Well, no, but we think they will.\n  Well, you know, there are a lot of things I think that my wife will \nagree to that she doesn't in the long run.\n  So we are going to go out and we are going to stop construction of \nthis on the hope that the Russians are going to agree with us. Of \ncourse, we have such a good relationship going on with them right now. \nBut the Department says: Oh, I think they will be okay, and they have \nindicated they are willing to talk.\n  Okay. We are going to dispose of it.\n  Where are we going to dispose of it? WIPP?\n  WIPP is shut down right now, but we are going to get WIPP reopened.\n  Is that where we are going to put it? Is WIPP large enough to hold \nthis? Are we going to have to do another land withdrawal in New Mexico? \nIs the State of New Mexico okay with this?\n  Well, we don't know. We haven't talked to them yet.\n  So what you want to do is stop this before you have a plan of what \nyou want to do with it, and that is just crazy. And that is my problem.\n  If the Department would come to us and say that the Russians have \nagreed to amend the treaty, and New Mexico has agreed that they will \ntake the stuff, then maybe we could have a serious discussion. But \nright now, it is just all pie in the sky.\n  I will tell you that if you really don't care about the treaty and \nyou really don't care about where they dispose of it--dispose of it in \nNew Mexico--the cheapest thing to do is just store it, but nobody wants \nto do that.\n  So all we are saying is let's be reasonable on this and let's \nrecognize that you have a facility here that is 67 percent complete. I \nthink we ought to go down the same road. Although there are others, I \nhave to admit, that look at $340 million--and probably it will be $500 \nmillion when it gets going as we continue, as construction ramps up--\nbut look at that as: Oh, that is taking money out of my programs in my \ntown, and I don't want that to happen. So let's stop MOX, and that \nmeans my favorite project will get more money.\n  I know there is a lot of that going on, too. So I understand where \nthe gentleman is coming from. There are other people that agree with \nhim.\n  There are people on my side of the aisle that come up and ask why are \nwe spending money on that boondoggle?\n  It is not a boondoggle. The fact is it is supposed to create MOX \nfuel.\n  While the Department says there are no energy companies that want the \nMOX fuel, that is not true. There are some who would sign long-term \nagreements. The problem is they see this debate and are wondering \nwhether we are going to have any or not. But the problem is the \nDepartment won't come to us with a solid proposal that we can rely on \nthat is an alternative that we could weigh one against the other.\n  I don't want 5 years or 10 years from now a chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies at \nthat time and a Secretary of Energy to be down on the street corner \narguing about: Well, gee, we stopped MOX. We got that big cement pile \nout there. We stopped construction on that. We have a problem with New \nMexico, and the Russians are on our back. They won't do anything about \nthe treaty. What are we going to do? Let's think of something else.\n  So until somebody has a reasonable alternative that they could \ncompare it to and the cost to, we need to continue with this MOX \nproject. And that is why the funding is in there for this bill and that \nis why we will fight for it in conference, even though the Senate, I \nknow, wants to stop it and do other things.\n  So, anyway, that is why that is there. I appreciate what the \ngentleman is doing. I understand his concerns. Other people have those \nconcerns, but the right path for us to follow is to continue the \nproject that currently exists.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.\n\n[[Page H3084]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I have great respect for Congressman \nGaramendi. I know how thoughtful he is, and normally I do support his \nefforts.\n  I have to say that, in this instance, I think the priority has to be \non completing construction of MOX. I think there was a reference made \ntonight that 67 percent of the construction is already completed. 90 \npercent of the equipment has been procured. 50 percent of the equipment \nis onsite. 1,800 people are directly employed. 4,000 American \ncontractors and suppliers are being utilized in 43 States. And MOX is \nthe only proven pathway we have for disposing of the 34 metric tons of \nU.S. weapons-grade plutonium in a pragmatic way.\n  I have to say that one of my goals in supporting this effort--having \nworked now with the Department of Energy on a number of programs, my \ngoodness, it seems never to be able to finish anything. So we talk \nabout Yucca Mountain--the chairman of the subcommittee made significant \nreference to that--billions of dollars and a hole sits in the ground \nunused.\n  Back when Jimmy Carter was President, he had a goal of putting solar \npanels on the Department of Energy. It didn't happen until recently. I \nmean, it has been three decades, four decades, before they could even \nfinish something like that.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  We look at Hanford and the cleanup that is necessary there. I mean, \nhow many more centuries is it going to take? The one thing we can say \nabout MOX, yes, it is treaty required and we are trying to meet our \ntreaty obligations, but it is moving toward completion.\n  I mean, this is a miracle for the Department of Energy. Perhaps fast \nreactor might be better. But how do we know it won't cost an equal \namount or more? We know South Carolina wants this. The Congressman from \nthe region is here.\n  If we talk about WIPP, how do we know they even want the material? We \nhave all these problems like Yucca Mountain. We have material we want \nto bury in the ground, and then the people say in the State that you \nbuild the facility: Well, now we don't want it.\n  So, frankly, of all the subcommittees I have served on or full \ncommittee--I have served on a majority of them--I have never seen a \ndepartment that can't get its act together and get the work done.\n  So as much as I respect you, Congressman Garamendi, and you are right \non so many efforts, I think to stop this project now with more than \ntwo-thirds of it constructed and hundreds of contracts let with vendors \nin 43 States--canceling those would expose our government to major \nliability and court costs from lawsuits and so forth.\n  The House bill prioritizes funds for national security to allow the \nUnited States to uphold its worthy nonproliferation and disarmament \ngoals, which we share, and focuses on completing the MOX facility at \nthe Savannah River site in the most cost-effective manner that the \nDepartment is capable of doing. I really think that we need to get it \ndone. We are close to doing that.\n  We don't need another disaster sitting out there that is unused or \nthis delay and stop and delay and hesitation and uncertainty and so \nforth. We need to complete this. We need to take care of the spent \nplutonium in a very responsible manner.\n  I share the chairman's perspective on this and continue to hold the \nauthor of the amendment--Congressman Garamendi--in the highest regard. \nI share your desire for nonproliferation. I think one of the best \nthings we can do is get this material processed and leave the world a \nsafer place in our time and generation.\n  I do oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The MOX facility at the Savannah River Site is absolutely crucial to \nour environmental clean-up missions, which produces green fuel, and \nnational security.\n  The MOX facility is already over 70% completed, and is the best way \nto uphold the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement, our \nnuclear non-proliferation agreement with Russia.\n  The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant facility has been absolutely riddled \nwith problems and shutdowns in recent years.\n  Not only would we be unable to fulfill our international obligations, \nbut eliminating the MOX facility would make the Savannah River Site a \nde facto permanent repository for nuclear waste.\n  This is absurd--we need to deposit our nuclear waste at a \ngeographically stable site in a largely uninhabited area. We have \nalready identified the best location for permanent storage--Yucca \nMountain in Nevada.\n  Until we restart the process for storing our nuclear waste at the \nYucca Mountain site, it would be incredibly irresponsible to allow the \nnuclear waste to build up at a less safe and less stable site when we \ncould be processing this material at the MOX facility and convert our \nplutonium into fuel that can be used at our commercial nuclear \nreactors.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment to eliminate funding to the MOX \nfacility is counterproductive and short-sighted.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Naval Reactors\n\n       For Department of Energy expenses necessary for naval \n     reactors activities to carry out the Department of Energy \n     Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.), including the \n     acquisition (by purchase, condemnation, construction, or \n     otherwise) of real property, plant, and capital equipment, \n     facilities, and facility expansion, $1,420,120,000, to remain \n     available until expended: Provided, That of such amount, \n     $44,100,000 shall be available until September 30, 2018, for \n     program direction.\n\n                     Federal Salaries and Expenses\n\n       For expenses necessary for Federal Salaries and Expenses in \n     the National Nuclear Security Administration, $382,387,000, \n     to remain available until September 30, 2018, including \n     official reception and representation expenses not to exceed \n     $12,000.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 54, line 14, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $1,000,000)''.\n       Page 56, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $500,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, the $500,000 in funds will be for sites \nwhere remediation is currently being conducted by the Office of Legacy \nManagement at DOE in accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental \nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act, called CERCLA--these are \ncalled CERCLA sites--and/or the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, \nRCRA.\n  So it is CERCLA sites and RCRA sites. There are eight of them in \nseven different States. There are two in Ohio, one in California, one \nin Kentucky, one in Utah, one in Florida, one in Colorado, and one in \nMississippi.\n  In Colorado, Rocky Flats, which is a now-shuttered nuclear weapons \nplant, has oversight by DOE. They do some water testing, but downwind \nand downstream communities have concerns about potential contamination.\n  These funds will help complete testing, which is vital for scientific \nknowledge, for public confidence, and for public health. We need them \nas we move forward with various uses of the land and properties in the \narea, including, in the case of Rocky Flats, opening to extensive \npublic visitation.\n  Several municipalities and communities in my district have voted to \nask for more soil samples. The portion they have asked for this \nregarding is both on Fish and Wildlife- and DOE-managed areas.\n  I personally have heard from many scientists, residents, even \nsomebody who investigated the former Rocky Flats plant 30 years ago, \nwho feel that it is very important that we make sure that the \ndownstream areas and the site are not still contaminated and not \nhazardous for human visitors.\n  We need to have the proper science by testing the air, water and \nsoil, relatively low-cost propositions that\n\n[[Page H3085]]\n\nwould be funded by this small change from administrative accounts. \nThese funds, to be clear, would be applied to all CERCLA lands, such as \nRocky Flats and the others.\n  Mr. Chairman, to conclude, I am very grateful to work with the \ncommittee and their staff on this important testing for CERCLA and RCRA \nlands like those at Rocky Flats and in the other seven States.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 72, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $1,000,000) (increased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment with \nthe gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), a champion of these issues.\n  Our amendment is simple and straightforward. It seeks to provide \nadequate resources for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in order to \nensure the safe and effective decommissioning of nuclear power plants.\n  Last year Entergy Corporation, the owner and operator of the Pilgrim \nNuclear Power Plant in Plymouth, Massachusetts, after facing severe \nlosses in revenue and plagued by serious safety concerns, announced \nthat the plant would be decommissioned by 2019.\n  Since coming to Congress, I have been concerned about the safety of \nPilgrim's day-to-day operations as well as the security of its spent \nfuel storage.\n  Following Entergy's announcement, I have worked with State and local \nrepresentatives from southeastern Massachusetts to prioritize the \nsafety of the decommissioning process, security of the plant's spent \nfuel, and displacement of over 600 workers employed at this site.\n  Just this week, attention has focused on the NRC's recent report that \nrevealed that the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station came up short yet again \nduring an investigation of their follow-through on critical systems \nmaintenance.\n  While this infraction ultimately falls on the responsibility of \nEntergy, it is equally important that the NRC has the necessary \nresources to address concerns as they arise, including through \ncooperation with local communities.\n  As we have often cited, decommissioning of nuclear power plants has \nan enormous economic and financial impact on host communities. We have \nurged that decommissioning funds be used strictly for removal of spent \nfuel from wet storage to dry cask storage, restoration and remediation \nof the site, and maintenance of emergency preparedness and security \nresources throughout the entire process.\n  Finally, it is my hope that the NRC prioritizes workforce development \nopportunities. As the number of decommissioned plants increases, so, \ntoo, will thousands of high-skilled, well-paying jobs.\n  I thank my colleagues for their consideration of this amendment and \nurge their support.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Vermont \n(Mr. Welch).\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. We have a lot of \nmerchant nuclear plants that are now starting to get decommissioned. \nThe first one that got decommissioned was in Vernon, Vermont. We have \nnow got Pilgrim.\n  The communities there face enormous challenges. One, we lose a lot of \ngood jobs. Number two, there is the question: How do you get that asset \nback in production? That is where the local community, like select \nboards, citizen groups, are enormously concerned, and rightly so. It is \ntheir community, and they want to get it back operational.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to try to get the NRC the resources \nit needs and, also, the process it needs for citizen community \ninvolvement to be accepted. They are in a new era.\n  Generally, the NRC has been about regulating the safety of the plant. \nNow we are moving into the era where they have to deal with the \ndecommissioning of the plant.\n  Safety issues continue to be of paramount concern, but economic \nvitality in the future is an urgent concern. Our goal here is to make \ncertain that those folks who are in the community and their elected \nrepresentatives have the capacity for significant input.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  We are very pleased that the NRC is starting a rulemaking process to \ntry to open it up a bit. We want to encourage them to do so. This \nlegislation is a big step towards that.\n  Mr. KEATING. I also want to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member \nKaptur for their consideration of the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 79, beginning on line 24, strike section 506.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chair, I rise once again because every year we face \nthis amendment and it does get knocked out in conference. But I rise \nwith concern that it keeps coming back, because I think it is based on \na lot of misunderstanding, and it really can cause serious problems.\n  For many years, Congress has been struggling with all these sorts of \nconflicts at the sea. Different Federal entities have different \nresponsibilities--some for mineral management, some for fishing, some \nfor coastal zone protection, Coast Guard for buoys. And when we were in \nthe State legislature, State after State complained that there was a \nconflict of seas.\n  Congress actually appointed a commission to review these, a \nbipartisan commission. The membership was appointed by President Bush. \nThe commission came back with an oceans report indicating that we had \nto avoid these conflicts among agencies. What we would do is create a \nNational Ocean Policy, which required all the Federal agencies to look \nat their responsibilities and to make sure that they were all \ncoordinated so that they carry out the functions that they have been \nresponsible for, but carry them out in a timely fashion.\n  What this language in this bill says is you can't carry out these \nresponsibilities under the National Ocean Policy. It is really stupid \nto knock it out, because what it will do is cost the people who want \npermits from the Federal Government a lot more time and money. And in \nfact, what it really does is jeopardize our national security because, \nbelieve it or not, one of the ways that people are sneaking into our \nexclusive economic zone is through fishing boats. And fishing boats are \nthe responsibility more of National Marine Fisheries and the Coast \nGuard, and they have to be able to communicate with each other on \nissues.\n  So it is just one thing after another. I am really saying let's knock \nthis language out.\n  The other thing I would like to say is that I hate to make this thing \npartisan, but I was just at a huge Oceans conference in Monterey, in \nthe district I represent, with a lot of national scientists and NGOs.\n  The one thing that they pointed out time after time is how the \nRepublicans are just attacking issues on the oceans, on marine \nfisheries, on oil and gas development, and so on.\n  And a policy like this is not something that is not actually \nbeneficial to\n\n[[Page H3089]]\n\ntry to get bureaucracy to work in knocking it out so that it goes back \nto the old bureaucracy. It is harmful for the government, it is harmful \nfor users of ocean resources, and it is more harmful for people that \nare trying to get a handle on what is killing our oceans and killing \nour fish.\n  So we spend absolutely no money on oceans planning. The National \nOcean Policy does not supersede any local or State regulations or \ncreate any new Federal regulations. It just creates a mechanism by \nwhich 41 numerous ocean agencies, departments, working groups, and \ncommittees can coordinate and communicate to manage effectively. It is \na bottom-up, not top-down project.\n  National Ocean Policy leverages taxpayer dollars by reducing \nduplication between Federal, State, and local agencies, by streamlining \ndata collection, by strengthening public involvement, by actually \nresulting in better decisionmaking and more decisionmaking, less costly \ndecisionmaking.\n  National Ocean Policy is a tool for planning, not a mandate to strip \nlocal and stakeholder control from our oceans' resource. It was \nsupported by President Bush. It has been supported by President Obama. \nIt is bipartisan, bicameral, bi-everything, and this language just \nmakes it impossible to carry on the responsibilities that we have in \nusing our natural resources in a responsible fashion.\n  I ask that the amendment be adopted.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  While there may be instances in which the greater coordination would \nbe helpful to ensure our ocean and coastal resources are available to \nfuture generations, any such coordination must be done carefully to \nprotect against Federal overreach.\n  As we have seen recently with the proposed rule to redefine waters of \nthe United States, strong congressional oversight is needed to ensure \nthat we protect private property rights.\n  Unfortunately, the way this administration developed its National \nOcean Policy increases the opportunities for overreach. The \nimplementation plan is so broad and so sweeping that it may allow the \nFederal Government to affect agricultural practices, mining, energy \nproducers, fishermen, and anyone else whose actions may have an impact \ndirectly or indirectly on the oceans.\n  The fact is the administration did not work with Congress to develop \nthis plan and has even refused to provide relevant information to \nCongress, so we can't be sure how sweeping it actually will be. That is \nwhy I support the language in the underlying bill and, therefore, \noppose the amendment and suggest that the Committee on Natural \nResources is the one that should be taking this up if they want to \ndevelop a National Ocean Policy.\n  Mr. FARR. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. FARR. First, whoever wrote your statement is wrong on the facts. \nI was here. This report that was done by the Bush administration was \nbrought to the United States Congress, to the Natural Resources \nCommittee. I was a member. Mr. Pombo was the chairman. He would not \nallow Admiral Watkins, who was chair of the committee, to testify on \nit. He would not allow a bill, carried by Republican members--Mr. \nGreenwood, Mr. Saxton, and others--to be heard. Every attempt was made \nto bring that report to Congress to enact as a bill, and the Natural \nResources Committee rejected it, just slammed the door.\n  What President Obama does, there was more in the recommendations \nbecause there was actually a way of governing regional areas, much like \nthe National Marine Fisheries does with their regional fishery boards. \nNone of that was allowed. He only uses executive order to get all the \nFederal agencies together so they can come up with a National Ocean \nPolicy, and not a thing in that policy mentions any of that.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Reclaiming my time, in fact, we were not wrong. Congress \ndid not approve a national ocean plan.\n  Now, we can argue about it whether they should have or whether they \nshouldn't have or whether Chairman Pombo should have brought it up or \nshouldn't have brought it up, or whatever, but that is way the process \nworks around here. There are things that aren't brought up that I think \nought to be brought up.\n  I have got a wildfire funding bill that hasn't been brought up. I \nthink it ought to be brought up. That doesn't mean the administration \ncan go out and say: Hey, that is the right thing to do. We are going to \ndo it by executive order.\n\n  That is the problem with this administration, that they have got a \nphone and they have got a pen if they don't get what they want out of \nCongress and Congress decides not to act for whatever reason. We didn't \nact on immigration. I think that was wrong. I think we should have. But \nguess what. We didn't. That doesn't free the President to say: Well, if \nyou won't do it, I am going to do it.\n  That is kind of what he did with the National Ocean Policy, and that \nis the problem we have here.

Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. Cicilline).\n  Mr. CICILLINE. I thank the gentleman for yielding go.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my \ncolleague from California, which would strike this misguided provision \nto prohibit funding of the National Ocean Policy, which permits better \ncoordination among Federal agencies responsible for coastal planning.\n  This provision in particular would undermine the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration's participation in planning; would hurt \nStates, communities, and businesses; and would keep States like Rhode \nIsland from managing resources in a way that best fits their needs and \npriorities.\n  The administration has made it clear that the National Ocean Policy \ndoes not create new regulations, supercede current regulations, or \nmodify any agency's established mission, jurisdiction, or authority. \nRather, it helps coordinate the implementation of existing regulations \nby Federal agencies to establish a more efficient and effective \ndecisionmaking process.\n  In the Northeast, our Regional Ocean Council has allowed our States \nto pool resources and businesses to have a voice in decisionmaking and \nhas coordinated with Federal partners to ensure all stakeholders have a \nvoice in the process, and it was the first in the Nation to release a \ndraft regional ocean plan.\n  It is astounding to me that, since 2012, more than 15 riders \nundermining ocean planning have been introduced to House bills, \nincluding riders on several previous appropriations bills.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Farr).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. FARR.

Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer a very \nbrief amendment to the bill. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand my good friend from California (Mrs. Napolitano).\n  Many of my colleagues, especially those who are members of the \nCongressional Ports Caucus, have worked very hard in recent years to \nensure that the Army Corps of Engineers has the funding necessary for \noperations and maintenance of our waterways. We achieved a great \nvictory in WRRDA 2014, which set annual targets for the harbor \nmaintenance trust fund usage.\n\n                              {time}  2145\n\n  It is vitally important that we not only hit the WRRDA targets, but \nthat we also ensure that the Army Corps and the White House Office of \nManagement and Budget allocate harbor maintenance trust fund resources \nproperly, according to the authorizing statute.\n  The Brownley-Napolitano amendment simply directs that none of the \nfunds in the bill can be spent contrary to existing law.\n  Our amendment is supported by the American Association of Port \nAuthorities. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment \nto ensure that the Army Corps and the OMB follow the direction provided \nby Congress in the 2014 law which passed the House in a vote of 412-4.\n  Mr. Chairman, again, it is critically important for Congress to \nensure that the administration follows the law.\n  This amendment is intended to ensure that the Corps and the \nadministration and the OMB implement the law as directed by Congress.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Brownley).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Burgess\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following new section:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used--\n       (1) to implement or enforce section 430.32(x) of title 10, \n     Code of Federal Regulations; or\n       (2) to implement or enforce the standards established by \n     the tables contained in section 325(i)(1)(B) of the Energy \n     Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(i)(1)(B)), or to \n     implement or enforce section 430.32(n) of title 10, Code of \n     Federal Regulations, with respect to BPAR incandescent \n     reflector lamps, BR incandescent reflector lamps, and ER \n     incandescent reflector lamps.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwill actually maintain current law.\n  Since its passage in 2007, I have heard from tens of thousands of \nconstituents about how the language of the 2007 Energy Independence \nSecurity Act takes away consumer choice when deciding what type of \nlight bulb to use in their homes.\n  Mr. Chairman, they are right. While the government has passed energy \nefficiency standards in other realms over the years, they never moved \nso far and lowered standards so drastically.\n  It is to a point where technology is still years away from making \nbulbs that are compliant with the law at a price point that the average \nAmerican can afford.\n  Opponents to my amendment will claim that the 2007 language did not \nban the incandescent bulb. That is true. It bans the sale of the 100-\nwatt, the 60-watt and then the 45-watt bulb.\n  The replacement bulbs are far from economically efficient even if \nthey may be regarded as energy efficient. A family living paycheck to \npaycheck simply cannot afford the replacement cost of these bulbs.\n  But the economics of the light bulb mandate are only part of the \nstory. With the extreme expansion of Federal powers undertaken by the \nObama administration during the first 2 years of the Obama \nadministration, Americans woke up to just how far the Constitution's \nCommerce Clause has been manipulated from its original intent. The \nlight bulb mandate is the perfect example of this.\n  The Commerce Clause was intended by our Founding Fathers to be a \nlimitation to Federal authority, not a catch-all nod to allow for any \ntopic to be regulated by Washington.\n  Indeed, it is clear that the Founding Fathers never intended this \nclause to be used to allow the Federal Government to regulate and pass \nmandates on consumer products that do not pose a risk to either human \nhealth or safety.\n  This exact amendment has been accepted for the past 4 years by the \nHouse. The first 3 years it was accepted by a voice vote. It has been \nincluded in the annual appropriations legislation signed into law by \nPresident Obama every year since its first inclusion in 2011.\n  It allows consumers to continue to have a choice and to have a say \nabout what they put in their homes. It is just common sense.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition to \nthe amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this damaging rider which \nwould block the Department of Energy from implementing or enforcing \ncommonsense energy efficiency standards for light bulbs. I have the \nhighest respect for Dr. Burgess, but not on this particular topic.\n  This rider was a bad idea when it was first offered 5 years ago, and \nit is even more unsupportable now. Every claim made by proponents of \nthis rider has been proven wrong.\n  Dr. Burgess told us that the energy efficiency standards would ban \nincandescent light bulbs. That is simply false. You can go to any store \ntoday and see shelves of modern, energy-efficient, incandescent light \nbulbs that meet the standard. I have bought them myself.\n  They are the same as the old bulbs except that they last longer, they \nuse less electricity, and they save consumers money.\n  We have heard for years that the energy efficiency standards restrict \nconsumer choice. But if you have shopped for light bulbs lately, you \nknow that simply isn't true.\n  Modern incandescent bulbs, compact fluorescent light bulbs, and LEDs \nof every shape, size, and color are now available. Consumers have never \nhad more choice. The efficiency standards spurred innovation that \ndramatically expanded options for consumers.\n  Critics of the efficiency standards claimed that they would cost \nconsumers money. In fact, the opposite is true. When the standards are \nin full effect, the average American family will save about $100 every \nyear. That comes to $13 billion in savings nationwide every year. But \nthis rider threatens those savings, and that is why consumer groups \nhave consistently opposed this rider.\n  Here is the reality. The 2007 consensus energy efficiency standards \nfor light bulbs were enacted with bipartisan support and continue to \nreceive overwhelming industry support.\n  U.S. manufacturers are already meeting the efficiency standards. The \neffect of the rider is to allow foreign manufacturers to sell old, \ninefficient light bulbs in the United States that violate the \nefficiency standards.\n  That is unfair to domestic manufacturers who have invested millions \nof dollars in the United States in those plants to make efficient bulbs \nhere that meet the standards.\n  Why on earth would we want to pass a rider that favors foreign \nmanufacturers who ignore our laws and penalizes U.S. manufacturers who \nare following our laws?\n  But it even gets worse. The rider now poses an additional threat to \nU.S. manufacturing. The bipartisan 2007 energy\n\n[[Page H3091]]\n\nbill requires the Department of Energy to establish updated light bulb \nefficiency standards by January 1 of next year.\n  It also provided that, if final updated standards are not issued by \nthen, a more stringent standard of 45 lumens per watt automatically \ntakes effect. Incandescent light bulbs currently cannot meet this \nbackstop standard.\n  This rider blocks DOE from issuing the required efficiency standards \nand ensures that the backstop will kick in. Ironically, it is this \nrider that could effectively ban the incandescent light bulb.\n  The Burgess rider directly threatens existing light bulb \nmanufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, across our region. \nIt would stifle innovation and punish companies that have invested in \ndomestic manufacturing.\n  This rider aims to reverse years of technological progress only to \nkill jobs, increase electricity bills for our constituents, and worsen \npollution.\n  It is time to choose common sense over rigid ideology, and it is time \nto listen to the manufacturing companies, consumer groups, and \nefficiency advocates, who all agree that that rider is harmful.\n  I urge all Members to vote ``no'' on the Burgess light bulb rider, no \nmatter how well intended.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I would merely observe that, in calendar \nyear 2007, the political analyst George Will opined at the end of that \nyear that the American Congress essentially had two mandates, to \ndeliver the mail and defend the borders, that it had failed miserably \nat both jobs.\n  Instead of performing either of those jobs, it banned the \nincandescent bulb, probably the single greatest invention to have \noccurred in America in the 1800s.\n  This is a commonsense bill. Our constituents have asked for this. The \nCongress has supported it. The amendment, in fact, maintains current \nlaw.\n  I urge all Members to support it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Garamendi\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to expand plutonium pit production capacity at the \n     PF-4 facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 743, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, about an hour and a half ago we had a \nvery important debate on this floor concerning some 30-plus metric tons \nof unused surplus plutonium to be disposed of in South Carolina at the \nmixed oxide fuel facility. The debate went on.\n  I want to thank my colleagues on the majority side for elucidating \nthe issue and bringing to our attention, as did I, that we have some 34 \nmetric tons of plutonium lying around in various depositories around \nthe United States. And from our discussion earlier, it is pretty clear \nit is not going to be disposed of any time soon.\n  Now, this bill would set about the United States putting together \nfacilities that would create even more plutonium somewhere in the range \nof 80 nuclear bomb pits. This is the essential element in a nuclear \nbomb. For what purpose?\n  Well, we really probably can't talk about it here in this public \nsetting, but it appears to be a rather unclear purpose as to why we \nwould need to build a new facility at a multibillion dollar cost for \nthe production of more plutonium pits when we have 34 metric tons of \nthem sitting in various repositories.\n  So I guess I just kind of ask: Why are we doing that?\n  Well, this amendment would simply limit the PF-4 facility in Los \nAlamos, New Mexico, to no more than 10 pits a year, which they can \nproduce. Probably a little bit of refurbishing will be necessary as the \nyears progress, but we really do not need to spend a few billion \ndollars on a brand-new facility to make brand-new atomic bomb plutonium \npits.\n  Why would we do that? Well, I don't think we do need to do that. We \ncan get by with 10 a year. And I suppose, if we really got into a \nsituation where we need to build more, we could run 2 shifts a day, \nmaybe even 3 shifts a day, and get production up to some 20.\n  Nobody has really bothered to explain in detail why we need more than \n10, and certainly nobody has explained in detail why we need 80.\n  So that is what this amendment does. It simply says: Let's save our \nmoney. Let's not put it into a facility that we don't need and go about \nour business of making just 9 or 10 new nuclear plutonium pits a year.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment because I am \nconcerned that the amendment would limit the activities that may be \nnecessary to maintain our nuclear weapons stockpile. That is basically \nit.\n  We need to be modernizing the legacy facilities of the National \nNuclear Security Administration. And these are old facilities, if we \nare going to have a credible nuclear deterrent.\n  That is what this is all about, is keeping our nuclear deterrent and \nmaking sure that we have the facilities to produce those things that \nare necessary. It is as simple as that.\n  I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  2200\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, 2 minutes is probably insufficient to \npersuade my colleagues on the majority side that my argument is worthy \nof support; but nonetheless, I will take a shot at it.\n  We can build 9 or 10 pits a year now. If we go to two shifts, we \ncould build 20. The only reason we would need 80 has to do with a \nrevamped, refurbished nuclear bomb, which I will talk about tomorrow \nmorning, because at the request of the majority, I was asked to put it \noff until tomorrow morning.\n  In any case, where are we today?\n  We have enough nuclear weapons to pretty much destroy the entire \nworld or any enemy that would like to take us on.\n  Do we need to have 80 new nuclear pits a year?\n  In all the testimony I have heard in the various classified sessions, \nthe answer is: We would like to have it. We would like to have that \ncapability because sometime maybe somehow we may have a nuclear war, \nand we will expend all of our existing bombs and we will need to \nsomehow make more.\n  I am not exactly sure why we would be making more after a nuclear \nwar, but there are some who would argue that would be necessary.\n  I don't get it. I really don't understand when we have the capability \nto build sufficient nuclear bomb components, the pit, the plutonium \npit, why we would want to spend a few billion dollars--an unknown \nnumber, by the way, not unlike the MOX facility, it is likely to \nrapidly escalate.\n  But our Los Alamos scientists would like to have something new and \nfancy when something old is quite necessary. My wife always said that \nthere is a choice between nice and necessary. I have yet to hear the \nargument for necessary, why we should set our path on spending several \nbillion dollars on a new pit production facility. I am sure there is \nsome argument to be made. In any case, I have a sense that I might lose \nthis vote on the floor when I will ask for a vote.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n\n[[Page H3092]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI.
