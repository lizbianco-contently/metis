The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of \nthose lost in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n  It is hard to believe that so many years have passed since the tragic \nevents of 9/11, since the sadness and loss are so fresh for many \nthroughout this Nation.\n  The attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and my home \nState of Pennsylvania stand as the most cowardly and senseless acts of \nterrorism ever perpetrated against the United States and its citizens.\n  My family and I continue to solemnly offer our thoughts and prayers \nfor those who were impacted that day. We also salute those who came to \naid, those who rushed into the World Trade Center before the towers \nfell, the first responders at the Pentagon, and the passengers who made \nthe ultimate sacrifice, downing United Flight 93 in Somerset County \nbefore it could reach its intended destination.\n  Among those who lost their lives in the attack on the World Trade \nCenter in New York City was Mary Ellen Tiesi. Mary Ellen was a native \nof Irvona, Clearfield County, and was working in the South Tower on \nthat morning 14 years ago.\n  Family members have said that, after the attack, Mary Ellen was \nexiting the stairs of the tower with a friend.\n  She stopped to wait for her boss, who she knew had a heart condition. \nHer boss eventually took the elevator, but Mary Ellen continued down \nthe stairs.\n  She did not make it out of the building and was the only Clearfield \nCounty native to lose her life in the attacks in New York. Three years \nago the Pennsylvania Route 53 bridge in Irvona was renamed in her \nmemory.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of the kindness Mary Ellen Tiesi showed \nfor her coworker on one of the worst days our Nation has ever known. \nLet us never forget the thousands like Mary Ellen who truly embody the \nundying resolve of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5869-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5869-H5870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               WILDFIRES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I concluded my summer tour of Oregon at \nthe fire control center on the Warm Springs Indian reservation.\n  Summer was an amazing time in my State. Smoke enveloped downtown \nPortland and drifted all the way for 270 miles to the south in Medford. \nAs I drove past, into central Oregon, the Crater Lake National Park \nconsumed 25 square miles.\n  Throughout the West, 8.5 million acres have already been burned this \nyear. And like we hear almost every year, the 2015 fire season is one \nof the worst on record.\n  We should acknowledge the amazing men and women who are on the front \nlines and the tremendous strain they bear.\n  We need so many people that we have actually had active military \npersonnel brought online for the first time in a decade. Even \nfirefighters from Australia, New Zealand, and Canada have come to \nassist in these efforts.\n  One cannot say enough about the tremendous bravery and sheer hard \nwork involved on so many levels with the men and women who are \nliterally putting their lives on the line for this heroic fight.\n  But it is important to note that we are not just decimating our \nforests. We are decimating the Forest Service budget. The portion of \nthe overall budget spent on fighting wildfires has grown in the last 20 \nyears from 16 percent to over one-half, 52 percent.\n  Because Congress refuses to treat wildfires like other natural \ndisasters, the Forest Service budget is being consumed, squeezing out \nother critical areas, not just maintaining these special places and \ntrails and recreational opportunities, but even the efforts that\n\n[[Page H5870]]\n\nwould deal with forest health and reduce the danger and the cost of \nfuture firefights.\n  The trend is that two-thirds of the budget in the next 10 years will \nbe firefighting. Absolutely, totally unacceptable.\n  These fires ought to be treated like any other natural disaster, not \ndecimate our ability to manage our national forests.\n  The people dealing with these megafires know that part of the problem \nis climate change making itself felt. Less than 2 percent of these \nmegafires consume almost one-third of the total fire suppression costs \nbecause our forests are drier.\n  There is less snow and rainfall, one more graphic reminder of the \ndevastating impact of climate change, with higher temperatures and less \nwater.\n  It is past time that Congress steps up to reduce carbon emissions. \nPerhaps the Pope in 2 weeks will inspire us to do something about \nclimate change.\n  But, in the meantime, we should at least pass H.R. 167, the Wildfire \nDisaster Act--bipartisan legislation introduced on the very first day \nof this Congress, but languishing in committee--that would treat \nmegafires like other natural disasters, not discriminate against the \nForest Service.\n  One final point is that we should stop making the problem worse by \nallowing more and more people to move into the fire zone in the \nwildland-urban interface and give these people the illusion that \nsomehow they are going to be provided with urban-level fire protection. \nSixty percent of the new homes since 1990 have been built in the flame \nzone.\n  We should stop this madness because we are putting more people at \nrisk not just to their properties and their families, but also the men \nand women who fight forest fires to protect structures.\n  Remember the 19 hotshots who were killed in Arizona a couple years \nago who lost their lives trying to save homes that probably shouldn't \nhave been there in the first place?\n  Commonsense budgeting, fighting climate change, and reasonable land \nuse will reduce costs, protect lives, and allow us to begin spending \nmoney on prevention, which will, in turn, reduce further costs. It more \nthan pays for itself.\n  Sensible budgeting, prevention, sound land use planning, will protect \npeople and our forests, along with our budgets, while we start our long \noverdue actions to reduce carbon pollution.\n  It is time that Congress steps up to start addressing these problems \nnow. This is not rocket science.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5870-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MINNESOTA'S BEST BAGGER GOES TO THE SIXTH DISTRICT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate \nLauren Gillson of St. Cloud for her first place win in the Minnesota \nGrocers Association 2015 Best Bagger Contest, which took place at the \nMall of America last month.\n  I would also like to commend the Minnesota Grocers Association for \nhosting this competition. It demonstrates how much value they place on \nproviding excellent customer service.\n  Anyone who visits a grocery store will understand just how crucial a \nbagger's role is to the industry. They are, by far, one of the most \nmemorable employees in the store, as they are the last person to be in \ncontact with the customer. A bagger can often make or break the \ncustomer's overall experience.\n  Lauren competed against nine others before winning first place. Her \nwin is truly impressive, as she has only worked at Lunds & Byerlys in \nSt. Cloud for less than a month.\n  I wish Lauren good luck as she competes in the 2016 National Grocers \nAssociation Best Bagger Championship this February.\n\n\n                       Live Until the Day You Die\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jim \nDavis for all that he has done to help those affected by cancer.\n  Over the past 4 months, Jim has flown throughout the continental \nUnited States and given free plane rides to cancer survivors and \npatients. By sharing his passion for flying, Jim has brought comfort \nand everlasting memories to these individuals in their time of need.\n  What truly is amazing about Jim's story is that he is going through a \nsimilar situation as the people he is helping.\n  After being diagnosed with liver cancer and given just 9 months to \nlive, Jim decided that he wasn't going to give up. Instead, he made it \nhis mission to help others affected by this terrible disease.\n  Jim has said, ``Some people get a cancer diagnosis and just sit and \nwait to die. Not me. I want to live. Cancer patients, live until the \nday you die.''\n  Jim, I want to thank you for your amazing acts of kindness. I am in \nawe of your positive attitude and capacity for helping others.\n\n\n                   Minnesota is Proud of Her Veterans\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Bera) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the three young men \nfrom Sacramento County who have deep roots in my district and whose \nquick thinking onboard a train to Paris saved lives and inspired our \ncountry.\n  Alek Skarlatos, Anthony Sadler, and Spencer Stone sprang into action \nto stop a man wielding a gun and a box cutter onboard their train. The \nchildhood friends were on vacation when the gunman burst into their \ncabin.\n  As an Oregon Army National Guardsman, Army Specialist Alek Skarlatos \nhad recently returned from a tour in Afghanistan. He was the first to \nsound the alarm, telling his friends, ``Let's go,'' as they moved to \nsubdue the gunman.\n  Anthony Sadler, a senior at Sacramento State University, and Airman \nFirst Class Spencer Stone of the United States Air Force acted without \nhesitation.\n  Stone was slashed while trying to disarm the man, but the injury did \nnot stop him. After subduing the gunman, the trained EMT went on to \nhelp treat other injured passengers.\n  These men showed bravery as they put themselves in harm's way to save \nthose around them. Today I commend them and recognize their great \nservice.\n  A parade in their honor will be held tomorrow in Sacramento. The date \nSeptember 11 is fitting. They will be welcomed home and honored for \ntheir heroism. The story of these three men is a reminder that everyone \ncan be a hero.\n  Thank you, Alek, Anthony, and Spencer.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Curbelo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention \nto the tragic humanitarian crisis currently underway with the migration \nof refugees from Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey making their way into \nWestern Europe.\n  With the unfolding of the horrific conflict in Syria and the \ncontinuing grotesque violence of ISIS, we can only\n\n[[Page H5871]]\n\nexpect that hundreds of thousands more will attempt to flee hostile \nregions for the safety of Europe and beyond.\n  Since 2011, at least 4 million Syrians have fled their country, \nuprooting their families to escape brutal violence and miserable living \nconditions.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  However, the refugees' plight for a safe environment since leaving \nSyria and escaping to Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey has been bleak.\n  In just the last few days, we have seen heartbreaking images of \nrefugees making the difficult journey to enter European countries, \nsometimes paying with their lives. These migrants and refugees will do \nanything for a better future.\n  I was proud to see the leadership of Angela Merkel in Germany \naccepting so many of these people in need. I strongly encourage all \nEuropean Union countries to follow Chancellor Merkel's lead in \nwelcoming these migrants and refugees and also supporting Germany's \nefforts in ensuring this undertaking is spread across the continent.\n  Most importantly, the United States must also offer any humanitarian \nassistance we can to ensure these vulnerable refugees have all \navailable resources to return to a sense of normalcy. The world must \nstep up, and I hope this Congress will play a role in the process of \nassisting these refugees.\n  Mr. Speaker, the conflict in Syria is one of the great blemishes on \nhuman history. Approximately 250,000 people have been killed. This \nadministration said early on that Bashar al-Assad had to go. Nothing \nhappened. The administration then said that, if Mr. Al-Assad used \nchemical weapons, then he really had to go. The dictator did, gassing \ninnocent people, including children, and the world did nothing.\n  This is a heavy burden we carry now, and that is why it is essential \nthat we do everything we can to assist these refugees. My parents were \nrefugees; my grandparents were refugees, and the United States took us \nin and gave us an opportunity. The world must also now account for our \nfailure in Syria and do everything we can to help these innocent \npeople.\n\n\n                      World Suicide Prevention Day\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize today, \nSeptember 10, as World Suicide Prevention Day. Anyone who has been \nimpacted by the horrible tragedy of a suicide, whether it be a family \nmember, friend, or colleague, is well aware of the devastating impact \nwhen one person they love takes their own life.\n  It is critical that we continue the conversation about not only \nsuicide, but mental health issues as well. People of all ages, races, \nand socioeconomic status can be plagued with mental health problems, \nand we must ensure those who are suffering receive the proper diagnosis \nand treatment.\n  In addition, communities must work together to foster understanding \nrather than judgment. If you or a loved one is experiencing \ndifficulties, I encourage you: Please, take the time to seek counseling \nfrom a professional.\n  Every life is worth living, and every life is precious. Let's come \ntogether to support our friends and neighbors and work to address \nmental illness and prevent suicide.\n\n\n                         Maduro Border Closing\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it was recently announced by \nVenezuela's de facto dictator, Nicolas Maduro, that the single \nremaining border crossing with Colombia will be completely bolted.\n  This action is only the latest example of Maduro's weak attempts to \nsearch for phantom scapegoats of his regime's failed economic policies. \nThe figment of Maduro's imagination is Colombians are the cause of food \nshortages, the collapse of the Venezuelan currency, and his country's \nrampant crime. As a result, the Venezuelan dictator has ordered the \nborder between Colombia and Venezuela closed.\n  Colombians living in Venezuela have been unlawfully arrested and have \nhad their homes bulldozed, leaving them with no other option but to \nflee; but with the latest and final border closure, Colombians are \nforced to return to their home country using very dangerous routes. \nThis has been dubbed a humanitarian crisis by the United Nations.\n  Make no mistake, this crackdown by Maduro is a sick and twisted \nattempt to distract the Venezuelan electorate from Caracas' failed \nsocialist and antidemocratic policies ahead of the December elections.\n  Unfortunately, the horrible suffering these policies have caused for \nboth Colombian refugees and the Venezuelan people are all too real.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5871-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5871-H5872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WATER AND DROUGHT IN CALIFORNIA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Loretta Sanchez) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, as we come back from \nthe August recess, I would like to speak on an issue that hits very \nclose to home and to the Southwestern States--yes, the Southwestern \nStates--and this is the drought.\n  The drought in particular that is facing California is the worst one \nrecorded in history in our State, and I believe it will define this \nera.\n  My home State is entering its fourth year of consecutive drought, \nwith nearly 93 percent of residents experiencing severe droughts, and \nthere is no foreseeable end in the future.\n  The lack of water in California is so serious that our Governor Jerry \nBrown declared a state of emergency and asked that all residents cut \nback on water 25 percent. Even with us hitting that, a recent study \nestimates that it will take at least 11 million gallons of water to \nreplenish our drought losses.\n  Water conservation and infrastructure is a life or death issue, not \njust for the residents of my district, but for all of California. \nWithout water infrastructure, farmers in the Central Valley cannot \nadequately grow and sell their crops; the price of foodstuff \nskyrockets; wildfires rage and destroy acres of property; State energy \nproduction is crippled; the economy slows; and the list goes on and on.\n  While other areas of California are just now setting the initial \nframework for water conservation and recycling projects, my home \ndistrict recycles almost 70 percent of the water that we use both in \nbusiness and at home.\n  How are we able to do that? Well, when I came here 19 years ago, I \nchampioned a project called the Groundwater Replenishment System, and \nit is located in Orange County. It is the water table underneath our \nhomes.\n  This system recycles treated waste water into clean drinking water, \nwhich exceeds Federal and State standards; and it has produced over 160 \ntrillion gallons of new water and serviced millions of Orange County \nresidents since its creation.\n  This system has become the largest reclamation project in the world. \nIn fact, people from around the world and from across our great States \ncome to take a look at how we replenish our water supply.\n  Legislation to fund projects like our groundwater replenishment \nsystem--well, it should be commonsense to fund those. However, the \ndrought has continued in the past 4 years, and there has been no \nmeaningful action on infrastructure improvements to move water, to \nreclaim water, to save water.\n  While residents of California are feeling the effects of our historic \ndrought, this Chamber continues to stall on meaningful drought relief \nand water infrastructure legislation. Back in my home district, I have \nheld numerous briefings about the drought and recognized community \nmembers who are cutting back and being more efficient with their water.\n  I recently spent part of this August recess meeting with community \nmembers of the Central Valley to discuss water storage and recycling \nprojects.\n  In this Congress, I have cosponsored the Drought Recovery and \nResilience Act of 2015. It is commonsense legislation which addresses \ninnovative water financing, it improves water infrastructure and water \nmanagement, and it assists in planning for future droughts.\n  The residents of my State have been doing their part to conserve the \nwater; so now, it is time for Washington, D.C., to help us to do what \nis right for California and to do what is right for the other \nSouthwestern States.\n  While the House Republicans are bickering amongst themselves to avoid \nanother embarrassing government shutdown, I will continue to fight for \nmeaningful water infrastructure to secure the water independence of \nfuture\n\n[[Page H5872]]\n\ngenerations because with water comes growth and California will grow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5872-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING TYRELL CAMERON\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Tyrell \nCameron, a young man from northeast Louisiana whose life was cut \ntragically short in an accident on the football field last Friday \nnight.\n  Tyrell was a bright student at Franklin Parish High School with a \npromising future, surrounded by a supportive and loving community.\n  I live about 20 miles from the high school. I consider Winnsboro an \nextension of my home. I know their people well. I know that this is a \nstrong community that supports each other, helps each other, and loves \neach other.\n  As Tyrell's family and friends come to grips with this tragedy, we \nwill mourn; we will grieve, and then we will start the healing process.\n  While we pray for Tyrell, his family, his teammates, and Franklin \nParish, I also ask that you keep the Sterlington community in your \nprayers. They were on the other sideline during the game, and I know \nthis has been a difficult experience for them as well.\n  Louisiana is a special place. We love our high school football. Our \nyoung men play with heart for their schools every Friday night. As \ncompetitive as it can get, we know what is most important. I have been \nso impressed with the outpouring of support for Tyrell and Franklin \nParish that has come from high schools throughout the entire State of \nLouisiana.\n  Many local teams will wear Tyrell's number, number 48, on their \nhelmets for the remainder of the season. That says a lot to me about \nthe strong character of our young men back home.\n  Others like me are wearing blue today, his team color, to honor \nTyrell, just as his teammates are doing this week also.\n  My thoughts and prayers are both with Franklin Parish and Sterlington \ncommunities, and I encourage them to keep playing for Tyrell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5872-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Tamara was the mother of five and the daughter of \nChicago gun violence prevention advocate Andrew Holmes, a personal hero \nof mine.\n  Andrew is a man who has dedicated his life to preventing gun violence \nand supporting families of gun violence victims. For decades, he has \ntraveled to hundreds of crime scenes to console those who lost friends \nand family members. In a cruel twist of fate, he was the one who needed \nconsoling when Tamara was caught in the crossfire while at a gas \nstation.\n  I wish Tamara's story was an exception, but we know it is not. It is \na tragic reminder that only in America does an everyday trip to the gas \nstation, the movie theater, or church end in gun violence or maybe you \nare a reporter and a photographer just doing your job or a sheriff \nfilling your car with gas.\n  All across America, gun violence is surging. More than 30 cities are \nreeling from a summer of senseless shootings, with death tolls reaching \nhistoric levels. In Chicago last week, we marked the highest number of \ngun homicides in a single day in more than a decade.\n  After each mass shooting, Congress launches into its ritual that is \nused as an end run around real reform. We give our speeches; we hold \nour moments of silence, and then we wait for the national buzz to fade.\n  My colleagues seem to forget that our actions may fade, but the \nviolence remains. Violence--gun violence--is a major public health \nproblem in the United States. Every moment that we don't act, we risk \nlosing even more lives to senseless gun violence, which might be \nhomicides, suicides, or accidents.\n  Last week, I hosted a dinner for a group of parents who lost their \nchildren to senseless gun violence. They think we simply do not care. \nThey wonder. There has been Newtown; there is Hadiya Pendleton; there \nis the church shooting, movie theaters, the mall, but still, we do \nnothing.\n  Today, I rise again on behalf of victims of gun violence. I rise to \nsay that we can no longer dismiss the mass shootings as isolated \nincidents and ignore everyday shootings altogether because the fact is, \nwhen our Nation is averaging one mass shooting a day, they aren't so \nisolated. When shootings are so commonplace that they are called \neveryday shootings, they cannot be ignored.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Over the Labor Day weekend, 9 people were killed and 34 were wounded \nby gun violence in Chicago. It is time that we own up to the gun \nviolence problem that is gripping our Nation and robbing us of a \ngeneration of young people one shooting at a time.\n  This year, for the first time in history, gun deaths are on pace to \nbe the leading cause of death of Americans aged 15 through 24, and the \nsuicide rate is climbing, also. The future of our Nation is hanging in \nthe balance here.\n  It is time for Congress to act. There are a number of gun violence \nreform bills that truly make sense and that are truly bipartisan.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with the American people and to take \naction, because the American people are on the side of gun violence \nreform that makes sense.\n  The other thing you can do is to try attending a funeral of an \ninnocent person--of a mom of five kids, who cling onto her coffin, or \nof a young teen who lost his life to senseless gun violence. I wonder \nhow you would feel then.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5872-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5872-H5873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, as we have heard so far during debate \non the Iran Joint Plan of Action, there are dozens of shortcomings and \nconcerns when it comes to this administration's nuclear deal--the so-\ncalled P5+1. No doubt, we will hear dozens more before all is said and \ndone.\n  The more we study this agreement--Republican or Democrat--the clearer \nit is to see that it does not measure up to its ultimate goal: to \nprevent a nuclear Iran.\n  The essential restrictions on Iran's key bomb-making technology \nsunset in as soon as 10 years, leaving an internationally recognized, \nindustrial-scale nuclear program with breakout times shrinking down to \nnearly zero--and that is if Iran doesn't cheat--but we will have a \ntough time knowing because what was ``anytime, anywhere'' inspections \nof Iranian nuclear sites has now become ``managed access,'' leaving \nIran as long as 24 days to scrub sites, enough time to nearly \ncompletely remove incriminating evidence of wrongdoing or the option of \nself-reporting compliance in places like their military base at \nParchin.\n  However, what this deal does accomplish is to precipitate a nuclear \narms race in the Middle East--a reality we are already seeing as \nnations like Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia have already begun \nbuilding up their nuclear infrastructure in response.\n  Any of those details should be enough to reject this deal, but that \nwould not even mention the most objectionable portion: that this good-\nfaith agreement with the world's largest state sponsor of terror frees \nup hundreds of billions of dollars in economic sanctions and frozen \nassets seemingly without any regard for what that money will be used \nfor.\n  Mr. Speaker, for the last 6 months, I have had the opportunity to \nchair the Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing, which is a \nbipartisan group that was established by both parties of the Financial \nServices Committee, to look into the increasing ability for terror \ngroups to fund and finance their actions and to evaluate the United \nStates' response to these challenges.\n  Specifically, the task force examined the impact of this nuclear \nagreement on Tehran's state sponsorship of terror proxies across the \nregion.\n\n[[Page H5873]]\n\n  What became abundantly clear was that the influx of hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to Iran that have been authorized in this deal will \nincrease that nation's ability to continue regional destabilization \nthrough the support of groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, Iraqi Shiite \nmilitias, the Houthis in Yemen, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's \nregime in Damascus.\n  This deal goes about rolling back sanctions while expert witnesses \nhave testified before our task force, even as recently as yesterday, \nadvocating for increased sanctions. There is a real disconnect here \nbetween what the experts tell us and what the administration is doing.\n  Iran's budget already features a nine-figure line item to support \nterrorism, and there is no doubt that the activities it funds will \nexpand Iran's radical efforts--a fact even acknowledged by the \nadministration following negotiations.\n  Mr. Speaker, what we have today is a bad deal, one that clears the \nway for a nuclear Iran, that gravely endangers allies like Israel, and, \nwith our blessing, that makes an already volatile, unstable Middle East \nless safe by giving Tehran more power to fund its terror syndicates.\n  What is so troubling to me is that a number of my colleagues, after 2 \nyears of negotiations that have been predicated on no deal being better \nthan a bad deal, have begrudgingly accepted a self-admitted bad deal \nsolely because it is better than no deal.\n  A better deal would include, truly, ``anytime, anywhere'' inspections \nof Iran's entire nuclear program, a plan of action to oversee and \nmanage any funds returning to Iran through sanctions relief or a return \nto the international banking community, the release of American \nprisoners improperly held by the regime, and a payment of the $22 \nbillion in compensation owed by Iran to families of September 11 \nvictims, including Bucks County residents. The court judgments should \nbe paid before Iran receives any funds under this agreement.\n  I urge them to reconsider what the reality of this bad deal means for \nthe safety of the world and the future of our Nation's foreign policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this deal because it is one that will \nhave decades-long consequences to our national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5873-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5873-H5874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING DEPUTY DARREN GOFORTH, HARRIS COUNTY \n                            SHERIFF'S OFFICE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to Deputy \nDarren H. Goforth, 47 years old, who lost his life more than 10 days \nago in Houston, Texas, in an execution-style killing, doing his job and \nserving his community.\n  Deputy Goforth was a Harris County Sheriff's Deputy and a man who \nloved his job. He loved his family, his daughter and his son, and he \nloved his beautiful wife. Might I share with you her words, Kathleen \nGoforth's:\n  ``My husband was an incredibly intricate blend of toughness and \ngentility,'' she said in a statement following his tragic death.\n  He was fueling his vehicle at about 8:30 on a Friday night, and \nsomeone came behind him--the individual now in custody--and, in \nexecution style, killed him.\n  ``There are no words for this,'' his wife said. ``He was always \nloyal--fiercely so. He was ethical. The right thing to do is what \nguided his internal compass.''\n  Of course, she wanted us to know, ``If people want to know what kind \nof man he was, this is it. He was who you wanted for a friend, a \ncolleague, and a neighbor,'' Goforth said in a statement.\n  She went on to say, ``However, I am who was blessed so richly that I \nhad the privilege of calling him my husband and my best friend.''\n  To Kathleen and her family, Deputy Goforth was the best friends of \nall of us. He was the best friend of the community. He was the best \nfriend of children whom he stopped and talked to or of young people \nwhom he sought to inspire.\n  He was the best friend of his friends and neighbors, as was evidenced \nby the 11,000 people who attended his funeral. He was the best friend \nof law enforcement officers. He was the best friend of the integrity of \nwhat law enforcement and first responders are all about.\n  He was a young man, as we came to know during the eulogy and the \nvarious statements of friends and officers, who desired to be just a \nhelper to anyone.\n  We were told that, even as he worked, his father had a business and, \nwhen he had his time off, he would go to that business and help his \nfather.\n  We have come to understand that it was his mode of law enforcement \nto, again, protect and serve but to reach out even to talk to those who \nweren't even looking his way. It was our understanding that he was \ngentle and kind and had a great sense of humor and, yes, looked like he \ndid a little baby-sitting as well.\n  So I rise today to speak to this Nation about this officer and to \nclaim the time for ending senseless violence and to recognize that his \nlife--Deputy Goforth's life--is a testament to the goodness of the \nAmerican people and our citizens in Houston and Harris County. \nCertainly, all of our State and local and congressional officials were \nthere to acknowledge our deepest sense of loss.\n  I want to thank the people of Harris County, when we see officers, \nfor distributing 30,000 wristbands to pray for police. I went out to \nthe gas pump where he was so heinously and tragically shot, and all of \nthe flowers and notes and people raising money touched all of our \nhearts. Everyone stopped to pray and talk and hug.\n  I remember someone saying, ``I am a conservative male, but I am so \nglad to see you here.''\n  And I said, ``My brother, I am glad to see you here. Can I hug you?'' \nAnd we hugged because tragedy brings us together, but purpose should \nhave us going forward. There should be a purpose as we lost this \nwonderful father and husband and law enforcement officer.\n  As the ranking member on the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \nInvestigations Subcommittee, that is the very purpose that I am so \nexcited about: this opportunity to talk about walking together, finding \nways for solutions, and making sure that the life of a gentle, strong \nlaw enforcement person continues to have a presence in our lives \nthrough the way we handle our legislation and our coming together.\n  Foremost among these dangers, of course, are those who come upon \nofficers in the line of duty. Just a week ago, an officer in Illinois \nfaced an enormous tragedy and lost his life, but we realize that they \nunderstand that as they go to serve their communities.\n  We must all work together--law enforcement, community residents, \npublic officials, the Nation--to make our communities places where we \ntrust one another and cooperate to achieve our mutual goal of safety \nand security for all persons. It reminds us how much work we have to do \nand how much we are interwoven with our first responders and our law \nenforcement.\n  Mr. Speaker, just a few days ago, I was at the 9/11 commemoration, \nthe memorial, and it reminded me of the strength of Deputy Goforth. So \nI would simply say we honor them.\n  At this time, I will ask for a moment of silence in honor of Deputy \nGoforth.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is with great sorrow but an abiding admiration that I \nrise today to acknowledge the life and service of Deputy Darren Goforth \nof Houston, Texas.\n  Deputy Darren Goforth, a ten year veteran of the Harris County \nSheriff's office, died on Friday, August 28, 2015, while refueling his \npatrol car.\n  He was shot fifteen times by a man who, by all accounts, never knew \nDarren Goforth and the light he brought into this world.\n  In a senseless act of violence, the love and care Darren Goforth gave \nto his wife, Kathleen and two young children, and the community he \nserved, ended entirely too soon.\n  According to Kathleen Goforth her husband was an ``intricate blend of \ntoughness and gentility,'' a man who was fiercely loyal and always \nstrived to do the right thing; a person ``who you wanted for a friend, \na colleague, and a neighbor.''\n  May I add, Mr. Speaker, Darren Goforth was what we want in an \nAmerican.\n  Mr. Speaker, Darren Goforth's life is a testament to the goodness in \nthe American people, but his death is a reminder of many difficult and \npainful truths.\n\n[[Page H5874]]\n\n  Foremost among these are the dangers the men and women of our \nnation's law enforcement departments face every time they walk their \nbeats and patrol their communities.\n  Their families, the persons who know them best and love them most, \ndeserve to welcome them home at the end of each shift, safe and sound.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must confront the reality that police departments and \nthe communities they protect are all too often adversarial.\n  We must all work together--law enforcement, community residents, \npublic officials--to make our communities places where we trust one \nanother and cooperate to achieve our mutual goal of safety and security \nof for all persons.\n  The murder of Deputy Goforth also reminds us that we must do more to \nstem the tide of gun violence that tears through this country.\n  Neither our country nor our hearts can afford to lose people of such \nquality as Darren Goforth to gun violence in the staggering quantities \nthat we do.\n  Mr. Speaker, over 32,000 Americans die from gun violence each year.\n  So, while Darren Goforth's death is most certainly a tragedy, death \nby gun violence happens all too often in our country.\n  This normalcy of gun violence is inexcusable.\n  Mr. Speaker, according to media reports, the person who ended Deputy \nGoforth's wonderful life, struggled with mental illness for quite some \ntime.\n  We absolutely have to do more to ensure that society's most dangerous \nweapons stay out of the hands of the most mentally or emotionally \nunstable persons.\n  It is important that we do this because it is estimated that 61.5 \nmillion Americans experience mental illness in a given year.\n  This is why we must, as a nation, attach as much importance and \nprovide the same level of resources for mental health as we do for \nphysical health.\n  We can no longer afford to ignore the struggles of nearly 20 percent \nof the population and fail to provide adequate treatment and services \nthat could alleviate some of that struggle and prevent horrific events \nlike the one that claimed the life of Deputy Darren Goforth.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand here today mourning the loss of Deputy Darren \nGoforth but I have hope.\n  I have hope that out of this tragedy we will be moved to act to make \nthis country safer for the men and women who risk their lives to keep \ntheir communities safe.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in honor \nof Deputy Darren Goforth, an extraordinary human being and a shining \nexample of what is meant when we remember him and say: ``he was one of \nHouston's finest.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5874-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Williams) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, as this President comes closer to his \nfinal year in office, it is no secret that he only cares about shaping \nand molding his legacy.\n  When discussing the Iran deal last year, his Deputy National Security \nAdvisor said to reporters: ``This is probably the biggest thing \nPresident Obama will do in his second term on foreign policy. This is \nhealth care for us.''\n  Four years earlier, that health care--ObamaCare--was described by our \nVice President as a ``big--explicative--``deal,'' but only time will \nshape this President's legacy.\n  Seventy-five years ago, Winston Churchill proclaimed that Neville \nChamberlain had a ``precision of mind and an aptitude for business \nwhich raised him far above the ordinary levels of our generation.''\n  Although this description is far too generous to describe our current \nPresident, who has no aptitude for business, Mr. Chamberlain was \nportrayed in a very different light than he is today. If he could be \ncharacterized in one word today, it would be ``appeaser.''\n  Regardless of his intellect, Mr. Chamberlain's incorrect decision to \nconcede to Adolf Hitler's demands for the purpose of avoiding a \nconflict in Europe overshadowed anything else he ever accomplished as \nPrime Minister.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Iran deal, I believe, is President Obama's \nChamberlain moment.\n  As the Associated Press reported 2 weeks ago, under this deal, Iran \n``will be allowed to use its own inspectors to investigate a site it \nhas been accused of using to develop nuclear arms.''\n  These reported ``secret deals'' acknowledge what many of us have \nknown to be true and confirm what President Obama and his \nadministration still deny--that this deal is based on trust.\n  This deal is based on trusting the Iranians in that they will not \nbreak their promise to build a nuclear bomb. How can we trust Iran's \nSupreme Leader, who chants ``death to America'' and ``death to \nIsrael''? How can we trust a Supreme Leader who said this week that \nIsrael will not exist in 25 years?\n  As the former Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee appropriately said, this deal would be ``the equivalent of \nhaving an athlete accused of using performance enhancing drugs submit \nan unsupervised urine sample.''\n  Any deal with Iran must protect America's interests at home and \nabroad, and this deal does not.\n  As Israel's Prime Minister warned in his speech before this very \nChamber only a few months ago, Iran's regime poses a grave threat not \nonly to Israel, but to the peace of the entire world.\n  The President and his deal supporters have ignored these warnings. \nThis deal will shift the balance of power in the Middle East. This deal \ngoes against the wishes of Israel, our greatest ally in the region.\n  I challenge all of my Democratic colleagues who support this deal to \ncome to the floor and look into the camera--and, quite frankly, look in \nthe mirror--so, when history comes full circle, the American people \nwill know who in this body let our Neville Chamberlain give Iran the \nbomb.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Despite the warnings from those within his own party and leaders of \nally nations, this President has made it clear he is not concerned \nabout the safety of Americans.\n  This President and his administration have made it clear they are not \nconcerned about Israel. This President and his administration have made \nit well known that they are not concerned about the fate of the world. \nAnd this President and his administration are only concerned with the \nlegacy they have in the future.\n  For that reason, I ask you, Mr. Speaker, is this President prepared \nto suffer the same legacy as Neville Chamberlain?\n  I urge President Obama and his administration to simply let their \nconscience be their guide.\n  In God we trust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5874-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5874-H5875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. DeFazio) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, well, I will look the camera in the eye and \nsay why I am supporting this agreement. I think there is only one \ncommon thing that is agreed upon here in the House and in the Senate: \nthat we don't want Iran to have nuclear weapons.\n  If the U.S. were to walk away from this deal and say we want to go \nback to the table, they will be sitting in an empty room, and the only \npeople at the table will be U.S. representatives. There will not be any \nother nations from Europe, Russia, or China; and Iran won't be at the \ntable either.\n  This is a deal that is not perfect. Sure, it is far from perfect. \nThey say: Well, Iran could become a nuclear threshold state again in 10 \nor 12 years because of the way this agreement is written. If we walk \naway today, they are a nuclear threshold state; and they will build a \nbomb, and they will have it within 3 or 4 months. Then what?\n  Well, we do have options, of course. They are being recommended by \nDick Cheney, John Bolton, and Benjamin Netanyahu, all who were \ncheerleaders for the Iraq war and who were oh so wrong about the \ngreatest foreign policy mistake in the history of the United States of \nAmerica. But they learned nothing from that, and they think yet another \nwar in the Mideast is a better solution than this.\n  Now what does Iran give up? Two-thirds of its centrifuges. They are \nallowed to keep the oldest, most primitive centrifuges. Ninety-seven \npercent of its enriched uranium stockpile will be gone. Their mine \nsites will be monitored 24/7. Their mill sites for uranium will be \nmonitored 24/7. There will be an intrusive inspection regime. They have \nto fill in the core of the nearly finished Iraq reactor--which can take \nthem on\n\n[[Page H5875]]\n\nthe plutonium path to a bomb--with concrete and convert that to \npeaceful use.\n  Natanz, underneath the mountain that some would have us bomb--\nunfortunately, it is underneath the mountain--that will become a \nmedical facility monitored 24/7. No. That is Fordow, excuse me, not \nNatanz. Yet we hear the drumbeat for war over here. They don't want to \nsay they want to have a war, but that is the ultimate conclusion.\n  If you don't want Iran to have nuclear weapons, this is the best deal \nwe can get, and we amazingly got this deal with the support of Russia, \nChina, and four nations in Europe.\n  Now, they are already flooding into Iran in anticipation of this deal \ngoing forward. They have no intention of going back to the table. The \nChinese want the oil. Russians want to sell them weapons. The planes \nhave been totally full coming out of Europe with high-level corporate \nexecutives wanting to go into Iran and do business.\n  No. This is the only alternative before the United States Congress \nand the only one that can prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon in \nthe short term. Yes, 12, 15 years down the road, we may have to deal \nwith this again. Yet again, 12 or 15 years from now, under this regime, \nperhaps Iran will have changed. We will see.\n  So I am proud of this vote, and I think it is the best path. I am \nalso incredibly proud of my vote against popular opinion and such \nsagacious people as Dick Cheney, John Bolton, and Benjamin Netanyahu \nabout invading Iraq, which has turned the Middle East into an \nunbelievable mess that will not be undone in my lifetime. ISIS is \nbasically a product of the Iraq war, an invasion by the U.S.\n  So let's not create even worse problems. Let's take this imperfect \nagreement, but let's take it because it prevents Iran from having a \nnuclear weapon and having a weapons race in this incredibly unstable \npart of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5875-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nKansas (Mr. Yoder) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people of the \nThird District of Kansas and on behalf of American people who are \ncounting on us to put their security before the obvious partisan \npolitics of Washington, D.C. I also join a bipartisan majority, leaders \nof each party in each Chamber, to stand up and be counted as one of the \nmany voices in this country in opposition to the President's deal with \nIran.\n  Like others who plan to oppose the ratification of this deal, I am \nnot opposed to the idea of diplomacy, but I am opposed to the idea of \nsurrender diplomacy. This administration asked us to trust Iran; but as \nIran continues to be the largest world state sponsor of terror, as they \ncontinue to shout ``death to America'' and call for our destruction and \nthe obliteration of Israel, our greatest ally, how can we trust Iran?\n  With secret deals, side deals, and self-verification, this \nPresident's capitulation will lead to a nuclear Iran for the first time \nin history and an American endorsement of their efforts to get there.\n  Well, the Ayatollah has convinced the President that it only needs \nnuclear capacity for peaceful purposes. But why does Iran need nuclear \ncapacity at all? Iran has the world's fourth largest proven oil \nreserves, totalling 157 billion barrels of crude oil, and the world's \nsecond largest proven natural gas reserves, totalling 1.193 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas.\n  With such a robust energy sector, why should Iran, a nation that has \nconsistently defied the international community on this issue, be \ngranted the ability to proceed with a nuclear energy program? Why \nshould we trust Iran? Have they earned the right to be trusted?\n  Simply put, Mr. Speaker, this is a gift to the ayatollahs of Iran. \nFor starters, it releases hundreds of billions of dollars in assets to \nthe regime in Iran, giving them a gift basket full of cash to flood \nterrorist organizations which seek to harm Americans and our allies.\n  The deal gives the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism a stamp \nof legitimacy and the means to expand its destabilizing influence \nthrough massive amounts of sanctions relief, even before Iran has \ndemonstrated full adherence to the deal's term. It does, however, bring \nhome the four Americans being imprisoned in Iran.\n  When questioned as to why, this administration claims that it did not \ndemand the release of American prisoners because it wanted to limit \nnegotiations to just Iran's nuclear program.\n  On the contrary, Iran won key nonnuclear concessions through the \nprocess. The deal grants amnesty to Qasem Soleimani, the head of the \nQuds force in Iran's Revolutionary Guard, who is one of the world's \nmost leading terrorist masterminds and the man thought responsible for \nthe death of at least 500 United States troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  It also lifts the conventional arms embargo on Iran in spite of \npublic testimony from Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and Joint Chiefs \nChairman Martin Dempsey that we should do so ``under no \ncircumstances.''\n  Lifting this embargo means Iran can begin to stockpile conventional \nweapons, and Russia and China can begin to legally profit off major \nweapons exports to Tehran.\n  Yet perhaps the most troubling aspect of this deal is its inspections \nregime. Gone are the anytime, anywhere inspections that were required \nby Congress and outlined by the administration. In its place, a 24-day \nnotice period for Iran, combined with secret side deals that this \nCongress has no knowledge of and in which the proponents of the plan \nare happy to be blissfully ignorant.\n  Mr. Speaker, the proponents of this deal know that it does not make \nus safer or more secure. They know that we cannot trust Iran. They know \nthat the verification process is weak and is built upon secret deals, \nthey know we shouldn't lift the arms embargo, and they know that the \nhundreds of billions of dollars being released to the Ayatollah will \nend up on the battlefield in the hands of terrorists who will use it to \nkill Americans and our allies. Mr. Speaker, they know this is a bad \ndeal.\n  I'm proud to have my name listed along with Democrats and Republicans \nin a bipartisan majority opposing this deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. In \n1994, we heard President Clinton sell his nuclear agreement with North \nKorea on many of the same talking points President Obama used in his \nspeech to sell this deal with Iran. Yet in 2006, we watched as the \nNorth Koreans detonated a nuclear weapon.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is still time to stop this, and I urge--I beg--my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote against this deal so we \naren't watching Iranians detonate their own bomb just a few years from \nnow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5875-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5875-H5876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate agreed to the following resolution:\n\n                              S.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McClintock) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my deep disappointment \nin the decision by the House leadership to back off from a direct vote \non a resolution of disapproval of the Iran nuclear accord as provided \nunder the Corker Act.\n  Clearly, the President has not complied with the requirements of \nCorker to provide Congress with the full text of its agreement with \nIran, most specifically, the side deals referenced in the agreement \nbetween Iran and the IAEA.\n  H. Res. 411, which declares the administration out of compliance with \nthe Corker Act, is well-founded, but there is no reason to cancel the \nvote on the resolution disapproving the agreement as specified in the \nCorker Act and as promised by the House leadership for the last 6 \nweeks.\n  H. Res. 411 rightly disputes September 17 as the deadline for \ncongressional action to stop this treaty from taking effect, and I \nsupport that resolution, but it cannot authoritatively settle this \ndispute. That leaves the deadline as an open question, and this House \nmust not let that deadline pass without definite action as provided by \nCorker.\n  I oppose the act because it guts the Treaty Clause of the \nConstitution that requires treaties to be ratified by a two-thirds vote \nof the U.S. Senate. Despite the President's contention that this is an \nagreement and not a treaty, the fact that it explicitly modifies the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty makes it obvious that it requires \nSenate ratification.\n  Unfortunately, the Congress overwhelmingly approved the Corker Act, \nestablishing a very different framework with respect to this particular \ntreaty. Instead of a two-thirds vote of the Senate to ratify it, \nCorker, in essence, requires two-thirds of both Houses to reject it \nthrough a resolution of disapproval, an almost impossible threshold.\n  Under Corker, the resolution of disapproval is the specific legal act \nrequired to reject this treaty. This is what the leadership had \npromised the House would vote on this week, until yesterday. Now we are \nto vote on a legally meaningless bill to approve the treaty that is \nexpected to be voted down. It is specifically designed to have no legal \neffect but merely to give Members political cover.\n  Thus, the House will fail to take action on a resolution of \ndisapproval called for under the Corker Act by the disputed September \n17 deadline. On that deadline, the President will declare victory, \nimplement the treaty, and the Congress will be left sputtering. The \nworld will correctly interpret this dereliction as a capitulation by \nthe House to this treaty. And years from now, maybe, possibly, the \ncourts will intervene to declare the President's action illegal or \nmaybe not.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House is right to dispute the September 17 deadline \nbecause clearly the President did not comply with provisions of Corker \nand provide the full text of the side agreements to the Congress; but \nthe House is dead wrong to refuse to take action on the resolution of \ndisapproval prior to the disputed deadline to assure that the House has \nspoken clearly, unambiguously, and indisputably according to the \nprovisions of the Corker Act that the Congress, itself, enacted in May. \nOnce it has acted, the House can still dispute whether the President's \nsubmission meets the requirements of Corker, but it will not have this \nmomentous question dangling unresolved and in dispute.\n  The argument we hear for this course is that the Senate is unlikely \nto take up a resolution of disapproval; therefore, we should hold the \nPresident to the letter of Corker. Well, what the Senate does is up to \nthe Senate; but for our part, the House has a moral obligation to act \nwithin the undisputed timeframe to legally reject this dangerous action \nby the President.\n  There is little doubt that this treaty will trigger a nuclear arms \nrace in the Middle East. The leaders of Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia \nhave already made that abundantly clear. There is little doubt it is \nunverifiable.\n  There is no doubt it will release $150 billion of frozen assets to \nIran with which it can finance its terrorist operations and continue \nits nuclear research.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  I fear the Iran nuclear agreement may be just as significant to the \nfate of the 21st century as the Munich Agreement was to the 20th \ncentury. The American people and the world deserve a clear, \nunambiguous, and indisputable act of the House to repudiate this act. \nWhat the House leadership is now pursuing falls far short of this moral \nimperative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5876-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5876-H5877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Barr) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, last month, I traveled to Israel with more \nthan 35 of my colleagues to meet with key leaders in that country, \nincluding Prime Minister Netanyahu, and learned firsthand what our \nclosest ally in the Middle East thinks about the proposed Iran nuclear \nagreement, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action between \nthe P5+1 countries and Iran.\n  The consensus view from the Israelis across the political spectrum, \nfrom the Prime Minister to the opposition leader in the Knesset, Isaac \nHerzog, from the President of the State of Israel, Reuven Rivlin, to \nthe military leaders in the Israeli Defense Forces, they all agree that \nthe deal negotiated by Secretary Kerry and championed by President \nObama is a dangerous and historic mistake.\n  This confirms what we have learned in briefings and hearings in \nCongress. This deal will not deliver the safety and security the \nAmerican people deserve. Instead, it will transform Iran from the \nworld's leading state sponsor of terrorism with an illicit nuclear \nprogram into the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism awash in \nbillions of dollars in sanctions relief with an internationally \nsanctioned nuclear program on an industrial scale.\n  This is not just a bad deal for Israel. This is not just a bad deal \nfor America. A nuclear Iran is a global threat to everyone everywhere. \nConsider the counterparty to this deal. Since the seizure of the U.S. \nEmbassy and the taking of 52 American hostages during the 1979 \nrevolution, the Islamic Republic of Iran has taken the long view on its \nglobal ambitions of exporting its revolution, supporting terrorist \nproxies like Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis, and Boko Haram.\n  The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and the leader of its elite \nQuds Force, Qasem Soleimani, is responsible for the killing of over 500 \nU.S. soldiers in Iraq.\n  The Iranian regime has covered up and lied about its nuclear program \nfor decades, deceiving international inspectors, agreeing to intrusive \ninspections, and then allowing those inspections to be implemented only \nprovisionally and selectively. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah \nKhamenei, regularly chants ``death to America'' and openly calls for \nthe annihilation of the Jewish people and the destruction of Israel.\n  In Jerusalem, we visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial museum. \nThere, we saw exhibits recounting the horrifying images of the \nHolocaust. During our visit with Prime Minister\n\n[[Page H5877]]\n\nNetanyahu, he made a profound observation. He said they compare this to \nthe 1930s.\n  This is not like the 1930s. In the 1930s, the Nazis concealed their \nintentions for the Jewish people in the Holocaust. Here, they are \nactually telling us. They are telling us what they want to do to the \nJewish people and death to the Great Satan. Let's not give them the \ntools to actually carry it out.\n  The President's promise of anytime, anywhere inspections has been \nreplaced with managed access to suspect nuclear sites in which \ninternational inspectors must appeal to Iran, Russia, and China. This \nbureaucratic process could take up to 24 days at least, during which \nIran would remove anything covert or in violation of the agreement.\n  The Associated Press now reports that at least one of two secret \ndeals between the IAEA and Iran--secret deals neither Congress nor even \nthe Secretary of State has been allowed to see--allows Iran to use its \nown inspectors at the military complex long suspected as the \nheadquarters of Iran's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program.\n  Given the Iranian regime's past behavior and contempt for U.S. \nnegotiators it knows are weak, there is little doubt Iran will cheat \nand dare the Obama administration to find violations which prove the \nvery deficiencies of the deal it negotiated.\n  Even if Iran does not cheat, even if Iran actually complies with the \ndeal, three bad outcomes are guaranteed. First, Iran will be allowed an \narsenal--not a bomb--an arsenal of nuclear weapons in as little as 10 \nyears.\n  Under the agreement, Iran is not required to dismantle key bomb-\nmaking technology, is permitted to retain vast enrichment capacity, may \ncontinue research and development on advanced centrifuges, and will be \nallowed to acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in as little as \n8 years. Intercontinental ballistic missiles--those are not for Tel \nAviv; those are for Washington, D.C., and New York.\n  Second, Iran gets sanctions relief, at least $56 billion almost \nimmediately, and that is according to the Obama administration itself. \nIndependent analysis projects the relief could be as much as $150 \nbillion. As a member of the Task Force to Investigate Terrorist \nFinancing, I have heard extensive testimony that, when these funds are \nreleased, a significant percentage will go to Iran's terrorist proxies \nin Gaza, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, Nigeria, and elsewhere. Experts warn it \nwill be impossible to snap back effective sanctions.\n  Third, because Iran's neighbors know this deal reverses a decades-\nlong bipartisan U.S. policy blocking Iran's nuclear program, this \nagreement will spark a nuclear arms race in the broader Middle East. \nTurkey, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt have already signaled their intent to \nacquire nuclear retaliatory capability if this deal is finalized. The \npeople who know Iran the best trust them the least.\n  This President says it is this deal or war, but that is a false \nchoice. Rejecting this deal will keep most sanctions in place and allow \nCongress and our allies to turn up the pressure on Iran to get a better \ndeal. In fact, I signed a letter with 366 colleagues outlining the \nconditions we would consider to be part of a better deal, none of which \nwere included in the one before us.\n  On the last night we were in Israel, one of the last nights, as we \nfinished dinner at a restaurant on the Sea of Galilee, the owner of the \nrestaurant took the microphone and announced that Members of the \nAmerican Congress were here to stop this bad Iran deal. The whole \nrestaurant stood up and sang ``God Bless America.''\n  To conclude, Mr. Speaker, on the Iran deal, I proudly stand with our \nallies in Israel, not with the mullahs in Tehran.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5877-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5877-H5878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WHY THE IRAN AGREEMENT MUST BE OPPOSED\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Dold) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I want to just associate myself with the \ncomments of my good friend from Kentucky, who was just up here and I \nthink eloquently was giving a case as to why this deal with Iran is \nsuch a bad deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly believe that the national security \nconsequences of the nuclear agreement with Iran will haunt America for \ngenerations if Congress does not step in to stop it. This shouldn't be \nabout party. It should not be about loyalty to the President because, \nif one thinks about this current President, whether you like him or \ndon't like him, whether you agree with him or don't agree with him, \nthis administration ends in 15 months, but the national security \nconsequences of this deal will go on and haunt America for generations \nto come.\n  This deal, this agreement, needs to be evaluated on the substance and \nhow it will impact America and will it make America safer.\n  Mr. Speaker, an overwhelming bipartisan majority of Americans and a \nbipartisan majority of this Congress are against this agreement. It \nmakes America less safe. If it survives, it is only because the \nPresident was able to ram it through on a wholly partisan basis. That \nis not something to celebrate, Mr. Speaker. The fact that there is zero \nbipartisan support for this pact in the United States Congress further \ndemonstrates just how dangerous this is for our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, in my very first speech on the floor of this House in \n2011, I stated my belief that Iran was the greatest national security \nthreat that we had. Today, I am even more committed that Iran is the \ngreatest threat that we have to our own national security.\n  By proving that aggression and defiance will be rewarded, this \nagreement makes the world less safe and, tragically, war more likely. \nWhat are we saying to our neighbors? If Iran gets a nuclear weapon, \nsurely its neighbors will go on a nuclear arms race as well and will \nmake this dangerous part of the world even less safe than it already \nis, far more volatile.\n  These concerns have been bipartisan. According to Democratic Senator \nBob Menendez, this agreement doesn't end Iran's nuclear program, it \npreserves it. According to Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer: ``If \nIran's true intent is to get a nuclear weapon, under this agreement, it \nmust simply exercise patience.''\n  Simply put, this agreement won't block Iran's path to a nuclear \nweapon. Instead, it leaves Iran's nuclear infrastructure intact and \namounts to a containment strategy. Settling for only containing a \nnuclear Iran is a grave mistake that leaves the long-term safety of the \nUnited States and our allies vulnerable to nuclear blackmail by Iran.\n  We are all familiar with the basic reasons for why this reckless \nagreement should be opposed. The agreement relies on a sure-to-fail \ninspections regime that falls well short of anytime, anywhere \ninspections that are so critically needed. It fails to deliver on the \ncommitment to dismantle Iran's nuclear infrastructure.\n  Iran actually receives a signing bonus that trades permanent \nsanctions relief for temporary limitations on its nuclear program. This \nwill provide Iran, the world's greatest state sponsor of terror--and \nthat is not up for debate; that is not disputed--with $150 billion, \nwhich they will no doubt use to fund terror through their proxies in \nHezbollah and Hamas, through Assad in Syria, and through cells in South \nand Central America--sunset provisions, which simply gives Iran a \npatient path to a nuclear weapon.\n  This agreement lifts conventional arms embargo in 5 years and \nballistic missile embargo in 8 years. Why were these even on the table, \nMr. Speaker? Mr. Speaker, I ask you: What do you use an \nintercontinental ballistic missile for? It is not to drop leaflets; it \nis not for humanitarian needs. It is to deliver a nuclear warhead to \nWashington, to New York, to Chicago.\n  I am perplexed because, Mr. Speaker, like many here in this body, I \nhave three children, and they have children. We have constituents that \nare out there. I have a 13-year-old, an 11-year-old, and an 8-year-old. \nBy the time my 8-year-old goes to college, she will not know a world \nwithout Iran having a nuclear weapon. The chants of ``death to \nAmerica'' in the streets, at some point in time, we have to take their \nword that that is exactly what they want to do.\n  When we look at this agreement, this legitimizes Iran's nuclear \nprogram and provides Iran's illicit nuclear pursuit with international \nstamps of approval. This is what Iran has been desperately\n\n[[Page H5878]]\n\nseeking; yet we have just handed it to them on a platter.\n  Let's remember, when the negotiations began, Iran was an isolated \nnation. Their economy was in ruins; they were under heavy sanctions and \nwere outside the international community, but this process has ended \nwith the administration isolating and hammering Israel and the \nadministration coercing Congress to accept a deal by asserting that the \nUnited States would otherwise be blamed for it falling apart.\n  On August 5, the President gave a speech to promote the Iran \nagreement, and he delivered the following line, which had its intended \neffect of isolating Israel and minimizing her concerns. Because this is \nsuch a strong deal, he said, every other nation in the world has \ncommented publicly, with the exception of the Israeli Government, that \nthey have expressed their support.\n  I understand my time has expired, Mr. Speaker, but I do want to just \nnote again that a nuclear-armed Iran is the greatest threat we have to \nour own national security going forward, and giving the international \nstamp of approval to them will make the world a less safe place and \njeopardize the United States of America, our citizens, and our allies \nabroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5878-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, there is a clear fact that \nthese are dangerous times and that the regime in Iran is a dangerous \nthreat to world peace. The President's legacy of failed policies of \nweakness has led to the Middle East in chaos, with refugee families \nfleeing for their lives and many drowning at sea.\n  It is not too late to stop a bad situation from getting even worse. A \nnuclear-armed Iran is a threat to every country everywhere. We need a \ndeal that is verifiable, enforceable, and accountable.\n  Is it verifiable? No. Because of secret deals, it will be the \nIranians who get to certify whether or not they are complying.\n  Is it enforceable? No, because the sanctions that have been effective \nin forcing them to the bargaining table will be lifted. Iran will then \nhave the money it needs to complete its nuclear programs, missile \ndevelopment, and expand their funding of terror. With future terrorist \nattacks, media should trace the funding to determine if the source is \nfrom this deal.\n  Is it accountable? No, because the deal permits Iran to keep \nthousands of nuclear centrifuges to enrich uranium.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President by his \nactions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5878-8", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     KEO 50TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION ON FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 2015\n\n  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the \nKauai Economic Opportunity, a nonprofit multiagency known as KEO.\n  For half a century, this agency has been providing services to \nthousands of Kauai residents in need, to ease the pain of poverty, and \nto help them achieve self-sufficiency. As the only human services \norganization on that island, they have been a lifeline for low-income \nfamilies and individuals who are looking for a second chance. In the \npast year alone, KEO has assisted over 5,000 individuals with housing, \neducation, food, medical services, legal services, child care, \ntransportation, disaster preparedness, employment opportunities, and so \nmuch more.\n  I would like to say mahalo nui loa to CEO MaBel Ferreiro-Fujiuchi, \nChair Brenda Viado, the board members, staff, volunteers, and everyone \nelse who selflessly dedicated their time, attention, and aloha to \nensure the people of Kauai always have a friend to help them in their \ntime of need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5878-9", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5878-H5879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                STOP THE BARRIERS OF OUR FOREST SERVICE\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, well, once again, with the end of a summer \nvacation that still has, in California and the West, the onset of fire \nseason, California has seen twice the number of acres of trees burned \nso far this year, and fire season is far from over.\n  While we are working to pass reforms to return responsible management \nto our national forests, the work doesn't stop when the fires are put \nout.\n  Every single day that a tree lies dead on the floor of the forest \nmeans it loses more and more of its salvage value and then becomes a \ncost of the taxpayers to remove later, and it is also more dangerous \nfuel for the next fire.\n  It is imperative that the Forest Service act rapidly to salvage these \ndowned trees and conduct replanting and forest recovery or we will \nsimply end up with more fuel on the ground the next time an area burns.\n  While the Forest Service estimates there are 12 million dead trees \nalready in the Sierra Nevada, virtually no work is being done to remove \nthese dead trees from these forests. We must stop the barriers to \ngetting the work done that is needed for our forests to be healthy and \nsafe.\n\n[[Page H5879]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5879-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                   JOINT COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ACTION\n\n  (Mr. MOULTON asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to ask a simple \nquestion of those who oppose the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n  Can you show me a viable alternative to this agreement that will lead \nto tougher international sanctions on Iran and prevent Iran from \nacquiring a nuclear weapon?\n  Scholars and diplomats, including President Bush's Iran negotiator, \nAmbassador Nicholas Burns, have stated before Members of this very body \nthat there is no way we will be able to keep Russia, China, and India \nin the sanctions regime if we reject this agreement. We tried secondary \nsanctions in 1996, and they failed. Our European allies have made it \nclear that, should the United States reject this agreement, we are on \nour own.\n  Despite these facts, it baffles me that some of my colleagues have \nconcluded that, by rejecting this agreement, we can somehow get a \nbetter deal with less leverage.\n  No deal is perfect, especially one negotiated among adversaries, but \nthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is the best option we have on \nthe table today.

They \nsupport the murderous Assad regime in Syria, they support Hezbollah \nterrorists in Lebanon, and they support the Houthi rebels in Yemen. \nIran-backed militias have killed American troops in Iraq.\n  Negotiation is founded upon trust, and there can be no trust for the \nmullahs who run Iran. To quote Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel: \n``Regimes rooted in brutality must never be trusted. And the words and \nactions of the leadership of Iran leave no doubt as to their \nintentions.''\n  In March, I joined with 366 of my fellow Members of Congress, \nincluding 130 Democrats, in a letter to President Obama. We agreed that \nany deal with Iran must last for multiple decades and include full \ndisclosure of Iran's past nuclear pursuits with anytime, anywhere \ninspections for verification.

Mr. Speaker, during the debate on repealing Don't Ask, \nDon't Tell 4 years ago, we noted that gay and lesbian Americans have \nfought with distinction in every war in our Nation's history, which is \ntrue. But while they fought to protect us, we failed to protect them.\n  Over 100,000 Americans were discharged from the military between 1945 \nand 2011 solely because of their sexual orientation. These discharges \nwere often less than honorable, which impacted their veterans benefits \nand served as a rebuke to their service and sacrifice.\n  We can and must do better.\n  The Department of Defense allows veterans who were discharged solely \nfor their sexual orientation to petition for an upgrade to an honorable \ndischarge. I encourage all of my colleagues to conduct research in \ntheir districts to inform veterans of this opportunity and to assist \nthem in their applications.\n  Congress should pass the Restore Honor to Service Members Act, \nintroduced by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Congressman Mark Pocan, to \ncodify this opportunity for veterans to remove this insult from their \nrecords.\n  A good and grateful Nation owes these brave Americans nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5879-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5879-H5880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n  (Mr. CRAWFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, ever since the Iranian agreement's \ncompletion, its proponents have insisted that the deal is based on \nverification, not on trust. That is because Iran is not a country that \ncan be trusted, evidenced by their funding of terror, detention of \nAmerican citizens, and past attempts of secretive nuclear armament.\n  However, as details are continuing to be revealed, it is clear that \nnegotiations were, in fact, based on trust. The verification this \nagreement hinges upon has been entrusted to the Iranians themselves, \nwhile objective inspections of their facilities can be delayed for \nweeks and weeks at a time. To top it all off, Congress still doesn't \nhave access to the agreement in its entirely.\n  It is entirely naive for supporters of this agreement to trust an \nunstable, hostile theocracy to self-certify on nuclear weapons when the \nFederal Government doesn't even trust our own American citizens, \nfarmers and ranchers, to self-certify on farm fuel storage.\n\n[[Page H5880]]\n\n  I strongly encourage all attempts to disarm Iran, but the Ayatollah's \naggressive actions and statements against the U.S. and our allies, \nparticularly Israel, have shattered their credibility in the \ninternational community. And the President's threat to veto alterations \nto his deal confirms his personal commitment to his own legacy rather \nthan the concerns of the American people and our closest allies.\n  Congress cannot accept the terms of this agreement which empower an \nuntrustworthy and hostile nation in an already dangerously unstable \nregion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5880-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                           DIEZ Y SEIS PARADE\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY.

Mr. Speaker, successful diplomacy requires \nstatesmanship, a mutual benefit, and a commitment to peace. None of \nthese elements are a part of the administration's deal with Iran.\n  On statesmanship, this administration's acquiescence has been met \nwith Iranian hostility. Just this week, the Ayatollah said Israel would \nbe destroyed within 25 years. Words matter, and we cannot discount \nIran's dangerous rhetoric.\n  Where is the mutual benefit?\n  Short of immediate access to a nuclear bomb, Iran has been given all \nit wants. It will receive billions of dollars it can use to fund \nterrorism against\n\n[[Page H5881]]\n\nour country and our allies. It will be allowed to reject ``anytime, \nanywhere'' inspections that are vital to verifying compliance and \nensuring our national security. In less than 15 years, Iran will be \nallowed to have a nuclear weapons program that is capable of attacking \ntargets anywhere in the world.\n  The fundamental question is: Are we willing to gamble that Iran's \nGovernment will end its destructive behavior and belligerent rhetoric \nin the coming days?\n  I, for one, am not willing to take that chance.

There is only one purpose for an ICBM, and that is to attack \nevery city in the United States.\n  Lastly, because this deal does not dismantle anything, in 13 years, \nIran could legally have a path for at least 100 ICBMs.\n  Those are the facts in voting for this bill when there are secret \ndeals that no Congressman has seen.

It is the bill we have got coming up, \nwhich points out that the President has not met his requirement.\n  The entire deal, together with the side agreements, puts the \nPresident and the banks and businesses that are doing business with \nIran--and who might start to do that--on notice that they are \npotentially civilly and criminally liable. We are going to use the \njudicial branch of the government to help keep America safe.\n  As I read on one of the signs on the lawn yesterday: What part of \n``death to America'' do you not understand?\n  The Iran deal is a bad deal, and it needs to be stopped, and we are \nfighting here in the House of Representatives to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5881-5", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PHILIPPI HEROES\n\n  (Mr. McKINLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. McKINLEY.

Mr. Speaker, this agreement with Iran \nwill bring the world closer to war.\n  Under this deal, Iran can make its centrifuges used to make nuclear \nweapons;\n  Iran is trusted to inspect itself;\n  The U.S. must come to the aid of Iran if there is sabotage against \nits weapons program, and in the meantime, Iran is buying anti-aircraft \nweapons and fighter jets from Russia to strengthen their military;\n  Iran will have the sanctions lifted with no proof required that they \nare in compliance;\n  The President himself admits this deal neither denies nor deters Iran \nfrom a nuclear bomb--only delays. Meanwhile, Iran continues to chant \n``death to America'' and ``death to Israel,'' and it continues to \nimprison four Americans--the same Iran that supplies weapons and help \nto terrorists throughout the world.\n  The Iran nuclear deal makes the Middle East and the world far more \nperilous and war inevitable. It is naive and dangerous to believe \notherwise. The American people rightly oppose this deal, and I oppose \nthis deal.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield \nthe customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman and my friend from New York \n(Ms. Slaughter), pending which I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is \nfor the purpose of debate only.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Texas delegation, I want to say to the \nSpeaker pro tempore, ``Happy birthday.'' We were celebrating your \nbirthday at the Texas lunch. We are sorry you were unable to attend.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, this rule would empower the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives with the opportunity to block this administration's \ndevastating nuclear deal with the country of Iran. It is my belief that \nthis deal needs to be ripped up word by word, line by line, and it is \nthis body that needs to help do that. The process is going on today and \ntomorrow, and it needs to continue until we kill this deal.\n  This rule includes three legislative items and is designed to give \nthe U.S. House of Representatives multiple opportunities to block this \ndisastrous Iran deal.\n  I want to make one thing perfectly clear from the beginning: There is \nnothing unprecedented about this rule. What is unprecedented is that \nthe administration, an administration of the United States, has \nnegotiated a deal that pardons a state that supports terrorism and \nturns it into a legitimate nuclear state in a matter of time.\n  There is nothing to hide in this rule; whereas, a significant part of \nthis so-called deal with Iran is still hidden, not just by side \nagreements, but in facts of the case that it was up to the United \nStates Congress to openly understand, to debate, and then to make \ndecisions on.\n  First, H. Res. 411 would find that the President has not complied \nwith the requirements of section 2 of the Nuclear Agreement Review Act \nof 2015, which passed Congress and became law of the United States of \nAmerica in May of 2015. This resolution simply says that the President \nshould follow the law--the law he signed only 4 months ago--and give \nCongress access to all parts of the deal as they pertain to this \nnuclear opportunity and deal that is being cut, including the IAEA and \nIran.\n  Second, H.R. 3460 would stop the administration from lifting \nsanctions placed currently on Iran.\n  Third, H.R. 3461 would allow for a vote to approve the deal that the \nadministration made with Iran regarding its nuclear program. While \nprevious legislation would have allowed Congress to disapprove this \ndeal, this legislation would not allow the deal to go\n\n[[Page H5883]]\n\nforward without congressional approval.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, what does the administration deal do? Well, first, \nthe deal guarantees permanent sanctions relief, but only temporarily \nblocks Iran from building a nuclear bomb. In other words, this deal \nwould inject--I assume really as a signing bonus--$150 billion into the \nIranian economy with almost completely no rules or regulations related \nto the use of the money, and it would allow Iran to build and possess a \nnuclear bomb in just a matter of a few, short, 15 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should not encourage the leading funder of terrorism \nin the world to have immediate access to billions of dollars now and \nbillions of dollars later. Let there be no doubt, this money will go to \nHezbollah, Hamas and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, groups that are \ndedicated to wiping out not only the United States but our friends and \nallies around the world, including their number one target, Israel.\n  Mr. Speaker, when I visited the Middle East in May of this year, we \nmet with our partners all around the region, and they were furious that \nthis administration was negotiating with Iran. Presidents from both \nparties have spent decades in the United States persuading countries \naround the region not to build a nuclear bomb, yet now this \nadministration wants to allow Iran to have access to that, that which \nwe have been protecting and holding away from even our closest of \nfriends. We will give that to this country that calls us the ``evil \nempire.''\n  Under this administration, for 6 years, America has led from behind. \nWe have led from behind when it should have been chosen to lead from \nthe front. Now this administration has decided to engage with a nation \nthat jails Americans and where ``death to America'' and ``death to \nIsrael'' is chanted every single day all over the streets of Iran and \nby its chosen leaders. Even worse, when the administration chose to \nengage with Iran, it chose to negotiate from a position of weakness. \nThis negotiation ended with a deal that gives Iran literally everything \nit wants and, as I see it, delivers nothing for the American people.\n  So what does this deal exactly do? Instead of allowing international \ninspectors into sites within 24 hours, the administration agreed to \ngive Iran 24 days' notice. The plan also ends restrictions on the \nIranian intercontinental ballistic missile, ICBM, program in just over \n8 years, which means, within a decade, Iran can go back to developing \nwarheads that could reach the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, they cheat on every single deal they make. Why would you \nnegotiate with someone you don't trust? Why would you give someone you \ndon't trust and who had a track record, give them everything they \nwanted?\n  Well, even worse, reports have indicated that there is also a side \ndeal, a side deal between Iran and the IAEA, that allows Iranians to \ninspect their own nuclear sites. Mr. Speaker, this will be like a \nperson in college or any school being allowed to grade their own test. \nThat is not the right way you handle international affairs. When the \nRepublicans say you negotiate with weakness, this is exactly what we \nare talking about.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, it is not clear what the American people would get \nfrom this deal. What is clear is that this deal will empower a stronger \nIran to be the strongest country in that region, to be competitive \nagainst the United States, and to have everything they want to pursue \nnuclear weapons in their future.\n  So what is at stake here? Congress is being asked to join in this \ndeal. They are being asked to endorse a plan that would eventually \nlegitimatize the Iranian nuclear state and fund its terrorism \nactivities and to support our President in doing this.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is why we are here today. We are going to debate \nit. We are going to pass this legislation, and we are going to put this \nHouse on record of where we would be.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me \ntime, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the vote on the Iran nuclear agreement has been touted \nby the majority as the most consequential of our careers, maybe even \nour lifetimes. We have had months of consideration, hearings, \nquestions, open debate following rules and customs of the House, more \nor less, surrounding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran, \nan agreement carefully negotiated by the United States, the United \nKingdom, France, Russia, China, and Germany to curb Iran's nuclear \nactivities.\n  As you listen this morning, you would think this was a negotiation \nbetween Barack Obama and the Ayatollah. Apparently, that is all that \nthey want to think. The other countries played major roles here, and \nthey are the most important economies in the world. This agreement is \nthe best available option for peacefully and verifiably cutting off \nIran's pathways to a nuclear weapon.\n  On Tuesday evening, the Committee on Rules had a hearing on the third \nfloor of the Capitol that lasted over 3 hours, and there was testimony \nfrom chairs and the ranking members of the relevant committees. We had \na robust discussion and a healthy back-and-forth. We prepared for the \nrule debate.\n  We had our statements written, but 12 hours later, the dissident wing \nof the majority's party emerged from a neighborhood bar, the Tortilla \nCoast, with a different path in mind. They rendered all our work moot, \nand the House was forced into a holding pattern all day yesterday while \nRepublican dissidents brought their party to its knees.\n  Once again, instead of regular order, in a perversion of our \nlegislative process, we are thrown into chaos by a majority chasing its \ntail in a last-minute ploy, throwing together three bills that might as \nwell have been scribbled on the back of a cocktail napkin.\n  These bills trivialize our institution. They have been whipped up in \nan afternoon to mollify the disgruntled wing of the majority's party \nthat shows no interest in governing. Their only goal with this trio of \nbills--which are contradictory, let me add, and I will say more about \nthat later--is to feed the monster seething within their own ranks.\n  There has been no committee action on these bills. There has been no \ndebate. There has been no time even to consider them.\n  Now, why didn't we do them in our regularly scheduled Tuesday night \nmeeting? It is because we didn't even know they existed. Instead of \naddressing an issue of international global importance, we are occupied \nwith the Republican Conference's internal politics, and it is an \nembarrassment to this country.\n  This dog-and-pony show has turned Congress into a stage to play out \nthe internal drama that diminishes our constitutional role. If the \nmajority cannot devise a process for a measure on which they agree, on \nwhich they have their vote unanimously, if they can't devise a process \nfor a measure like that, I shudder to think what is coming with act \ntwo, which we are hurtling toward, because we are days away from a \ngovernment shutdown.\n  We have no budget; our troops would not get paid; flights would be \ncanceled, and what is more, the last time we had a Republican-inflicted \nshutdown, $24 billion was lost to our economy at a time when we were \nstruggling even more than now to regain it.\n  Even so, here we are, forced to join in yet another pointless \nexercise, and the Senate has said they will not take up these bills, \nand so this nuclear agreement will be implemented, which leaves the \nRepublican Party with the majority in both houses, which they control, \nwith no consensus.\n  What is more, keeping Iran from building a nuclear weapon is a once-\nin-a-lifetime opportunity to silence the drumbeats of war. There is no \nopportunity to renegotiate this. With all you have heard this morning \nabout ``this won't do'' and ``we can't have it'' and ``it is awful,'' \nhave you heard a single alternative? There is not one. The possibility \nof peace in a powder keg region of the world should be considered \ncarefully.\n  Mr. Speaker, in May of 1946, shortly after World War II ended, when \nthe horrors of global violence were fresh in our collective memory, \nAlbert Einstein asserted that: ``The unleashed power of the atom has \nchanged everything save our modes of thinking, and thus, we drift \ntoward unparalleled catastrophe.''\n\n[[Page H5884]]\n\n  Very rarely do we have an opportunity to stop that so-called drift \ntoward catastrophe, but we do with this measure, and all of our allies \nhave agreed to it. Only we are trying to hold it up.\n  The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action provides for unparalleled \naccess to Iran's nuclear facilities. The agreement blocks all four \npossible pathways to a bomb. Contrary to falsehoods reported by the \nmedia, Iran will not be self-monitoring.\n  The inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency have \nunprecedented and continuous daily monitoring authority, and it is so \neasy, they tell me, to detect the radioactive material if they were to \nbreak this agreement.\n  Only certain sanctions will be lifted. Many will be kept in place, \nfor example, what they do with terrorist organizations and supplying \narms to other people. We are continuing those sanctions. If Iran fails \nto comply, all the nations involved in the negotiation have said they \nwill be reinstituted by using a snapback provision which is in the \nbill.\n  Let me repeat that. We have heard from ambassadors of almost all \nthose nations yesterday saying that their countries would absolutely \ncomply with reintroducing the sanctions.\n  Now, let me remind people that should the Iranians attempt to conceal \ntheir work, even a nanogram--a billionth of a gram--of dust of nuclear \nwork is detected.\n  Retired American military leaders, former Secretaries of State from \nboth parties, the Israeli security professionals, and even faith \nleaders have come out in full support of this accord. The former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Secretary of State \nunder President George W. Bush, retired four-star General Colin Powell, \ncalled this agreement ``remarkable.''\n  The former head of Israel's intelligence and special operations \nagency, the Mossad, Efraim Halevy, supports the agreement as well. He \nsaid recently to PBS' Judy Woodruff: ``I believe this agreement closes \nthe roads and blocks the road to Iranian nuclear military capabilities \nfor at least a decade.'' That is not a trivial thing.\n  Domestic faith leaders have implored this Congress to follow the Old \nTestament creed to ``seek peace and pursue it.''\n  The agreement was painstakingly negotiated by Secretary of State John \nKerry, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, and Secretary of Energy \nErnest Moniz representing the United States. When hailing this \nagreement, Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser to both \nPresidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush, said of this team: ``There \nis no more credible expert on nuclear weapons than Energy Secretary \nMoniz . . . when he asserts that the JCPOA blocks each of Iran's \npathways to a fissile material . . . responsible people listen.''\n  It is now clear, based on the declared supporters in the Senate, that \nthe effort to kill this agreement will end in the upper Chamber, and \nthe accord will survive and be implemented.\n\n  Regardless of that certainty, the House majority has nonetheless \nthrown us into disarray. We will vote today on two bills, another one \ntomorrow. It was decided that, first, there will be a bill to say that \nthe President cannot lift the sanctions and a bill on side agreements \nthat they think are out there that nobody else knows about, and then \nthe most interesting one is the bill tomorrow will be to approve it.\n  You have already had all this discussion on ``we won't have it, we \ncan't have it, the bill will not survive.'' They are going to approve \nit; but just in case, because the Senate won't take up an approval \nmessage, they kept another rule last night.\n  First, they did away with it, then they put it back so that, next \nweek, we can come up with a disapproval rule; but by next Thursday, it \nis all over, the 60 days are up, and the President may go ahead with \nthe agreement.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule and support this \nagreement.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nHarding Township, New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen), the chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN asked and was given permission to revise and \nextend his remarks.)\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule before \nus and in strong opposition to the Iranian nuclear agreement.\n  While there may be many reasons to stand against this deal, it comes \ndown to a fundamental reality. The Iranian nuclear agreement fails to \nachieve its critical objective, blocking all of Iran's pathways to a \nnuclear weapon. In fact, this deal provides Iran with an international \nendorsement of an industrial scale nuclear weapons program.\n  My colleagues, we must not forget where it started, with the \nPresident declaring Iran must never be allowed to achieve a nuclear \nweapons capability, but to get from that point to where we are today, \nour negotiators have made some inexcusable and dangerous concessions on \ninspections and verification and on Iran's missile defense program and \ntheir access to conventional weapons.\n  Worse than that, Iran will economically be strengthened by early \nrelief from sanctions, providing the Ayatollah with fresh resources \nwith which to fund the Quds Force and its global terrorism network.\n  Supporters of this agreement have proclaimed loudly that the only \nalternative to this agreement is war. I reject that notion and predict \nthis deal will lead to more Iranian aggression in the Middle East.\n  For our own part, the agreement talks about the normalization of \neconomic relations with Iran and states that the parties shall \nimplement the agreement in good faith based on mutual respect; but how \ncan there be respect for a regime that actively promotes regional \ninstability, publicly and constantly advocates for the destruction of \nthe State of Israel, and uses the phrase ``death to America'' as a \nmission statement?\n  Mr. Speaker, our first responsibility as Members of Congress is to \nprovide for our national defense. This deal is bad for our national \ndefense. I sincerely regret that this vote has been characterized as a \npartisan measure. It is not.\n  It is a vote of conscience far and above politics, and that is why I \nwill vote ``no'' on the motion to approve this disastrous agreement and \n``yes'' on the rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Rule before us and in \nopposition to the Iran nuclear agreement.\n  While there are many reasons to stand against this deal, it comes \ndown to a fundamental reality: the Iranian nuclear deal fails to \nachieve its critical objective: blocking all of Iran's pathways to a \nnuclear weapon. In fact, this deal provides Iran with international \nendorsement of an industrial-scale nuclear weapons program.\n  My Colleagues, we must not forget where we started: with the \nPresident declaring that Iran must never be allowed to achieve a \nnuclear weapons capability. But to get from that point to where we are \ntoday, our negotiators had to make numerous and serious concessions:\n  They dropped snap ``anywhere, anytime inspections'';\n  We will not receive credible information about the potential military \ndimensions of Iran's previous nuclear research efforts;\n  Existing restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile program will cease;\n  International sanctions targeting Iran's support for global terrorism \nand human rights violations have been eased.\n  Each and every one of these important elements was discarded as the \nObama Administration worked to achieve its landmark deal with Iran.\n  The reality is that this agreement will provide a legal path to a \nnuclear weapons capability to a country that remains a rogue state and \nhas violated a whole series of international obligations and U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions. Simply put, the Iranians have cheated \nbefore. We would be fools to assume they will not cheat again.\n  While the President insists ``this deal is not built on trust,'' key \nverification provisions are buried in confidential side agreements that \nallow Iran to conduct its own inspections of nuclear weapons research \nfacilities. This brings me to the conclusion that we would be better \noff with no deal, rather than this deal.\n  Worse than that, Iran will be economically strengthened by early \nrelief from sanctions--providing the Ayatollah with fresh resources \nwith which to fund the Quds Forces and its global terrorism network. If \nIran violates the agreement, building international support for new \nsanctions would take too long to be effective. And furthermore, our \nallies appear to be more interested in their own trade and commercial \ninterests than in halting Iran's nuclear aspirations.\n\n[[Page H5885]]\n\n  Supporters of this agreement have proclaimed loudly that the only \nalternative to this agreement is war. I reject that notion and predict \nthat this deal will lead to even more Iranian aggression in the Middle \nEast.\n  For our part, the agreement talks about normalization of economic \nrelations with Iran and states that the parties shall implement the \nagreement ``in good faith . . . based on mutual respect.''\n  But how can there be respect for a regime that actively instigates \nregional instability, publicly and constantly advocates for the \ndestruction of the State of Israel, and uses the phrase ``Death to \nAmerica'' as a mission statement?\n  Mr. Speaker, the first responsibility of each Member of this House is \nto provide for our national defense--and that includes confronting the \nworld's leading state sponsor of terrorism everywhere. If we fail to \nprevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon this year, next year or in \nthe next decade, we will have allowed the weakening of that defense. \nAnd we will have failed our children and future generations.\n  I sincerely regret that this vote has been characterized as a \npartisan measure. It is not. It is a vote of conscience far above and \nbeyond politics. And that's why I will vote ``yes'' on the resolution \nof disapproval.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nVermont (Mr. Welch).\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman, and I want \nto thank my colleagues. Mr. Frelinghuysen, I agree with many of the \npoints that you made. This is a vote of conscience for all of us.\n  The question is not whether we trust Iran. We don't. The question is \nnot whether we want Iran to have any pathway to a nuclear weapon. \nProponents of this agreement--I am one--and opponents of this \nagreement--there are many, my friend, Mr. Stewart--don't want Iran to \nhave a nuclear weapon. This question about trust, we have got to step \nback a minute.\n  One of the fundamental challenges that a strong and confident country \nfaces is to secure its national security. That requires the Commander \nin Chief, whose fundamental responsibility is to exercise his judgment \nabout what will work to increase our security, to enter into \nnegotiations with adversaries; and there may be no greater adversary to \nthe United States, to our allies, particularly Israel, than Iran.\n  Keep in mind, President Kennedy negotiated with the Soviet Union \nafter one of their leaders said they will bury this country, and he did \nthat, and it turned out that he was right to limit nuclear \nproliferation. President Nixon went to China when it was Red China, an \nabsolute adversary of this country and our way of life, and it has \nworked to the benefit of the national security of this country, and \nPresident Reagan did the same.\n  The fundamental question here is not at all about whether we trust \nIran. We don't trust Iran. It is not about whether you negotiate with \npeople you trust. You have to negotiate with people that are your \nadversaries.\n  The question is whether the terms and conditions of this agreement \nthat the President is recommending, along with our very close allies--\nGermany, France, Great Britain, and Russia and China--will improve our \nnational security and that of our allies, particularly Israel. My \njudgment is it will.\n  Number one, there is no pathway for Iran to have a nuclear weapon \nunder this agreement.\n  Number two, this is not based on trust. It is based on distrust and \nstrong verification provisions that will give us a heads-up if there is \nany effort of Iran not to comply.\n  Third, we have the opportunity to snap back the sanctions all of us \nsupported that brought Iran to the table. We don't have to get a \nmajority vote; we can do that unilaterally.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Then, finally, we do have to ask the question of not whether this is \nthe perfect agreement--undoubtedly, there could be a better agreement \nthat might give more satisfaction and security and peace of mind to all \nof us--it is a question of this agreement or no agreement. That is the \nquestion that we face.\n  The weight of the opinion and judgment is that, if we repudiate this \nagreement, the sanction regime that we constructed on the leadership of \nPresident George Bush and President Barack Obama would dissolve. What \nhappens then? Iran gets the money and they have no restraint on their \nability to get the bomb.\n  I urge us to support this agreement in the national security interest \nof the United States of America, Israel, and our allies.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Butler, Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), a member of the Ways \nand Means Committee.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today not \nto speak for Republicans, but to speak for America.\n  When 80 percent of the American people say ``no'' to this deal, how \ncan America's House, how can we who have been elected by the American \npeople, come here and say, ``You are wrong, and we are right''?\n  A vote for this deal is a vote against the American people. History \ntells us that in 1938, Chamberlain came home from meeting with Hitler \nand said, ``Peace in our time.'' Judas went to the Last Supper, pointed \nto the Lord, and they gave him 30 pieces of silver. We are not even \ngetting 30 pieces of silver.\n  President Obama says this is the best deal we could get. In my \nlifetime, anytime anybody comes back from a negotiation and says, \n``This is the best we could do,'' it means they lost. They did not get \nwhat they wanted. They got the best they could. In this case, it is the \nlosing hand.\n  This deal endangers the safety, security, and stability of not only \nAmerica, but the entire world. This deal comes with absolutely no \naccountability, no verification, and no enforceability.\n  I ask you, how can you sit in America's House, when the President's \nnumber one responsibility is to protect the American people, and say, \n``This is the best we could get.'' This gives the American people \nnothing. This gives Iran everything.\n  Now, in just 24 hours, we are going to commemorate the 14th \nanniversary of a terrorist attack on the United States, and we are \ngoing to grant the biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world $150 \nbillion to show how much we have turned a deaf ear to the cries of the \ndead and a blind eye to the destruction of America that day.\n  To sit here and even begin to think that somehow this is good for \nAmerica is false. To try and sell this to the American people is a lie. \nWe are sacrificing the safety of 330 million Americans for the legacy \nof one man. That is not what America wants. That is not who America is. \nThat is not who America should ever allow itself to be.\n  And to sit here and listen to somehow we have not done our job; \nladies and gentlemen, our main job is to protect the American people. \nIt always was. It always is. This has morphed into something greater \nthan that; I understand that. But at the base of the day, it is to \nprotect the American people.\n  And let me tell you, as tomorrow we have dawn and the sun comes up, \nall you have to do is turn your ears to the east and our enemies will \nbe shouting, ``death to the Great Satan,'' ``death to America,'' \n``death to Israel.'' And the Supreme Leader, himself, says that, within \n25 years, there will be no Israel.\n  The hypocrisy to stand before this House today, America's House, and \nsell the American people down the river because of one man's legacy is \na travesty of who we are. And it is more than that. It flies in the \nface of the 1.4 million Americans in uniform who have given their life \nto give us this opportunity to defend this great Nation.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Doggett).\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Almost every observer, even the host of candidates \nseeking the Republican Presidential nomination, recognize that \nPresident Bush's invasion of Iraq was a foreign policy disaster for \nwhich so many military families are continuing to pay a high price. And \nAmerican taxpayers will ultimately pay over a trillion dollars for that \nfailure, spurred on by some of the speeches like the one we just heard.\n  So we look next door to Baghdad, at Tehran, and we see a despicable \ngovernment there, just as there was one in Baghdad. We have ample \nintelligence evidence that that despicable government was pursuing a \nnuclear weapon program that is unacceptable to us. And we try to learn: \nIs there a way for America to use its other power, its diplomatic \npower, to stop that? Because\n\n[[Page H5886]]\n\nwe know our use of military power did not accomplish positive foreign \npolicy objectives by itself in a go-it-alone invasion of Iraq.\n  We found an approach that, in fact, had strong bipartisan support--\nimposing strong economic sanctions on the Iranians. It didn't work so \nwell originally, the first time that I and almost everyone else in this \nHouse voted for it, because America couldn't go-it-alone any more than \nit could be successful in a go-it-alone invasion of Iraq.\n  But when we brought the rest of the world along, including some \npeople that have been our adversaries, like Russia and China, to join \nin this sanctions regime, it finally forced Iran to the table to begin \nto deal with the critical elements of this nuclear weapon program.\n  Step by step, through very hard negotiations, by bringing the rest of \nthe world along to force those economic sanctions on Iran--all of which \nI supported--they began to move forward on trying to resolve this issue \nthrough diplomacy, through acting that way, rather than bombing first \nand asking questions later, as some of these folks have advocated. At \nevery step in that process, as we approached an interim agreement, we \nhad an ``object first, read later'' approach from those who are pushing \nthis rule.\n  The interim agreement was announced. They rejected it that night \nbefore they had even read it. It proved that their objections were \ntotally unfounded: We gained more in terms of intelligence; we came to \nunderstand better the Iranian program; and we put a stop to it in that \ninterim agreement. Our families are safer today because that agreement \nwas adopted.\n  And we come along to about March of this year, and the same folks \nthat are advocating this rule were out here telling us there was one \nthing this Congress had to do: It had to have the power to disapprove \nthis agreement if it did not feel the final agreement met the \nobjectives.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. That is how we began this week with the resolution of \ndisapproval. But yesterday, they brought their self-styled foreign \npolicy experts to Washington--Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, Donald Trump--\nand they said a resolution of disapproval is not enough.\n  So today, Republicans have abandoned the only tool they had to stop \nthis agreement--a resolution of disapproval; that is not even in this \nresolution--and they are off on a three-pronged approach to satisfy the \nmost extreme views that prefer to use war as the first instrument \ninstead of the last instrument.\n  We have a choice in this Congress, and it is the choice of using the \nstrong power of America, with verification, to prevent this program \nrather than calling on more military families to sacrifice for an \nunnecessary endeavor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, we will do everything in our power to try \nand stop this bad deal; you are darn right we will.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Farmington, Utah \n(Mr. Stewart), a member of the Intelligence Committee, the \nAppropriations Committee, and a member of the United States Air Force \nfor years and years, a veteran of this great Nation.\n  Mr. STEWART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that gracious introduction.\n  Mr. Speaker, this agreement is deeply, deeply flawed; and when you \ntalk to our friends across the aisle, in moments of honesty, they will \nadmit that it is deeply flawed.\n  This is the most important national security question of our \ngeneration. We have got to get this right, and we simply haven't done \nthat yet.\n  If I could elaborate on my background that leads me to this \nconclusion, as the chairman said, I sit on the House Intelligence \nCommittee. For 14 years, I was an Air Force pilot. I flew aircraft that \ncarried nuclear weapons. I worked for the implementation of various \nnuclear treaties. I understand that for any treaty to work, there has \nto be a modicum of trust. There has to be a kernel of trust between the \ntwo parties.\n  Let me ask you this: Do you think we can trust the Iranians?\n  I asked Secretary Kerry on two occasions to give me a single example \nof where the Iranians have worked with us or our allies in any positive \nfashion, and he could not do that. But I can give you a long list of \nwhere they have worked against us, where they have created death and \nchaos: Hezbollah, Hamas, assassinations in Central America. Hundreds of \nAmericans have been killed and maimed because of the Iranian-backed \nShia militia. This is what they do. And we are supposed to trust them?\n  And by the way, I believe they are going to cheat, because they are \ncheating even now. In the last few months, they tried to buy prohibited \nequipment from Germany. They refuse to answer questions from the IAEA \neven now.\n  Which brings me to my second question: Do you think we can trust this \nPresident?\n  I would ask you to give me a single example of what you consider a \nforeign policy success of this administration--give me a single \nexample--and then let me give you a long list of foreign policy \nfailures, beginning with China claiming much of the South China Sea; \nwith Russia, after the reset, going into Crimea, controlling much of \neastern Ukraine now, even now building military posts in Syria.\n  We went into Libya and created chaos and walked away. We snatched \ndefeat from the jaws of victory in Iraq. We are doing the same thing in \nYemen, the same thing in Afghanistan. Why should we trust this \nPresident?\n  I believe that most people think this agreement is doomed to fail; \nand I believe that when it does, we now have to turn towards the \nquestion of: What do we do when we have an entirely nuclearized Middle \nEast? When we have four or five countries in the next few years that \nhave nuclear weapons there, how are we going to deal with that, coming \nfrom a President who declared it was his goal to see the elimination of \nall nuclear weapons across the globe? It is a terrible irony that he is \ngoing to preside over the greatest and most dramatic expansion of \nnuclear capabilities in the most chaotic part of the world, that he \nwill preside over that, and that will be his foreign policy legacy.\n  We need to defeat this agreement while we still can.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), a distinguished member of the \nRules Committee.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this extremely \nconvoluted rule as well as the underlying legislation.\n  When I was a child in the 1980s, I remember my mother taking me to \nMothers Embracing Nuclear Disarmament rallies. I recall wondering why \nAmerica possesses enough nuclear weapons to blow up the entire world at \nleast seven times over. As an adult, I have never succeeded in finding \na satisfactory answer to why we want to be able to blow up the world \nseven times.\n  Now, we are all here because the potential for nuclear war is one of \nthe greatest threats to the future of humanity and perhaps to the \nfuture of life on the planet itself. That is why this agreement to make \nsure that Iran, a country that supports terrorism, does not acquire \nnuclear weapons is so important.\n  Let's be clear about what this deal is and what it isn't.\n  It is not a peace deal. It is not a deal that calls on us to trust \nIran or like Iran. In fact, the very reason we want to make sure that \nIran doesn't develop nuclear weapons is we see how much damage they \ncaused through their mischief-making through support of Hezbollah and \nothers on the conventional front. If that were compounded by nuclear \ncapabilities, it would significantly increase the chance of global \ndestruction.\n  This agreement is based on verification and enforceability. It is \nbuilt on extensive electronic monitoring and unprecedented access for \ninternational investigators at known or suspected Iranian nuclear \nsites.\n  Of course, there are things in this deal that I would change or you \nwould change. No deal is perfect. But perfection can't be our standard \nor we would never be able to support anything around here. Our job is \nto consider if this deal is better than the alternatives.\n\n[[Page H5887]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  If Congress rejects this agreement and it leads to a nuclear Iran, \nwhat then?\n  It was multilateral sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating \ntable, not American sanctions alone; and it is clear that Russia and \nChina will likely grant Iran sanctions relief, regardless of what the \nU.S. decides to do. We also worry about the dedication of our European \nallies in this regard.\n  With sanctions disappearing and Iran's money being unfrozen, the deal \nis moving forward. Shouldn't we want this agreement to proceed with the \noversight of the United States of America, to make sure that Iran \nabides by the very letter of this agreement not to develop nuclear \nweapons?\n  Instead of standing in its way, we, in Congress, should play a \nleading role in the implementation and rigid enforcement of this deal \nto prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.\n  This agreement is an unprecedented opportunity to stop Iran's nuclear \nweapons program cold and make the world a safer place. Of all our \noptions, it is the one most likely to succeed in preventing Iran from \nobtaining nuclear weapons.\n  I urge my colleagues not to stand in the way of this important deal, \nto make sure that Iran, a country that supports terrorism, has a \nterrible record of human rights violations at home, and even just 2 \ndays ago said that the State of Israel wouldn't last 25 years.\n  It is important that we ensure that they don't have access to the \nnuclear weapons that will allow them to carry through with their \nterrorist goals.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWindsor, Colorado (Mr. Buck).\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, President Obama negotiated with a band of \nvillains. The President believed Iran would change their ways because \nof his kind and forgiving nature, but we have seen Iranian hypocrisy \nfar too long to believe they can change. It is time to face reality and \nprevent them, at all costs, from acquiring nuclear capability.\n  Iran's leaders promised to wipe Israel off the map. They deny the \nHolocaust and refer to our country as the Great Satan. The Ayatollah \neven takes to Twitter to call for Israel's annihilation.\n  Iran's actions are as dishonorable as their rhetoric. The \nadministration has negotiated with Iran on nuclear nonproliferation as \nif they were an honorable country with honorable intentions, but it is \ncertainly not honorable when our Department of State lists Iran as a \nstate sponsor of terrorism, and no honorable country would occupy that \nunworthy distinction for the past 30 years, nor would an honorable \ncountry supply terrorists around the world with weapons to kill \nAmericans and Israeli. In fact, Iran supplied IEDs that killed and \nmaimed American soldiers and marines in the Iraq war.\n  On the day we remember the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil, we \nare going to vote on whether or not to allow billions of dollars of \nfunding to the world's largest state sponsor of terror. This deal is, \nat best, delusional and, at worst, despicable.\n  Iran is in pursuit of a nuclear weapon, and their intention for the \nUnited States is death.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge a vote in favor of this rule.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the agreement reached by \nSecretary Kerry and the international community because I believe there \nis no better alternative for preventing Iran from immediately \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon.\n  Since the first sanctions were imposed on Iran a decade ago, I have \nsupported tough economic measures as a means to bring Iran to the \nnegotiating table. In that respect, the sanctions worked, but sanctions \nalone will not stop Iran from moving toward nuclear weapons.\n  After strenuous review of the July 14 agreement and all its annexes, \nI have reached the conclusion that the agreement is the best option \navailable today for keeping nuclear weapons out of Iranian hands. Under \nthe agreement, Iran is bound ``under no circumstances ever to seek, \ndevelop or acquire nuclear weapons.''\n  Among other things, Iran must reduce its active centrifuges by two-\nthirds, give up 97 percent of its uranium stockpile, and reconfigure \nthe Arak reactor so it cannot produce weapons-grade plutonium.\n  The number of inspectors in Iran will triple. They will gain full \naccess to nuclear facilities, including the entire uranium supply \nchain, at any time. This is indeed the most intrusive inspection regime \nof any nonproliferation agreement in U.S. history.\n  That is important because it will give the United States and the \ninternational community far greater insight into the regime's behavior \nand enable us to monitor them closely.\n  It is true that Iran may try to cheat, but that is exactly why we \nneed this agreement. With severe restrictions and an aggressive \ninspections regime in place, we will be much more likely to discover \nany violations.\n  In that event, the United States will be authorized to reimpose \nsanctions on Iran immediately, and that applies not just to the U.S. \nsanctions, but to U.N. sanctions as well.\n  In summary, this agreement comprises harsh restrictions on Iran's \nnuclear activities, a strong monitoring system, and tough penalties for \nviolation.\n  A group of 29 leading American scientists, including Nobel laureates, \nhas called it ``a technically sound, stringent, and innovative deal \nthat will provide the necessary assurance in the coming decades and \nmore that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons.''\n  If we walk away from this agreement, the only remaining alternative \nis military action. We have been down that path for 15 years, and we \nhave seen the grave consequences of not allowing diplomatic efforts to \nmove forward.\n  Ronald Reagan said of the Soviet Union: ``Trust, but verify.''\n  This agreement is not rooted in trust but in our ability to verify \ncompliance and to deal with enforcement. I believe it meets the goals \nof our negotiations to deny a dangerous Iranian regime access to a \nnuclear weapon.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nSugar Land, Texas (Mr. Olson), a member of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. OLSON. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the worst parts of President Obama's agreement \nwith Iran is that it opens the door to nuclear bombs blowing up right \nhere in America.\n  This man is a terrorist from Iran. His name is Manssor Arbabsiar. He \ncomes from a family of hate.\n  In 2011, he approached the notorious Los Zetas drug cartel with a \nscheme to kill the Ambassador from Saudi Arabia right here in this \ncity. He offered them $1.5 million for that hit. Luckily, we caught \nhim.\n  President Obama's agreement gives Iran at least $100 billion to hire \nLos Zetas and others to unleash nuclear material and death on innocent \nAmericans. We caught them once. Will we catch them again?\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the rule today and tomorrow. Vote to \nreject President Obama's agreement with Iran.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).\n  Ms. LEE. Let me thank our ranking member for yielding me time and \nalso for your leadership on this vital global peace and national \nsecurity issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Res. 412, the rule \nproviding for consideration of three bills surrounding the nuclear \nagreement negotiated by this administration and the P5+1.\n  Make no mistake, these bills are nothing more than yet another \nattempt to purposefully and deliberately thwart the Iran deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, all of us have the same goal, to prevent Iran from \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon. Now, as one who has been involved in many \nnuclear nonproliferation efforts since the 1970s, I am convinced that \nthis deal brings us much closer to a nuclear-weapons-free Iran.\n  I believe that the President negotiated with our P5+1 partners--while \nnot perfect, this deal achieves that goal. The Joint Comprehensive Plan \nof Action cuts off all pathways to a bomb and ensures robust oversight \nand inspection. It is the best way to promote\n\n[[Page H5888]]\n\nregional security and global peace, and the majority of Americans \nagreed.\n  According to a recent University of Maryland poll, 55 percent said \nthat Congress should get behind this agreement. That is why we need to \nbe clear on the ramifications of rejecting the deal.\n  If the United States walks away, we will be walking away alone. As \nUnited Nations Ambassador Samantha Power stated in her recent Politico \nop-ed: ``If we walk away, there is no diplomatic door number two. No do \nover. No rewrite of the deal on the table.''\n  Rejecting the Iran deal will isolate the United States from our \ninternational partners and will not make us any safer, and it certainly \nwon't result in a better deal with Iran.\n  Instead, it would allow Iran to accelerate their weapons programs \nwith no oversight, and it will significantly undermine our ability to \nengage with our partners on critical issues like addressing \ninternational terrorism.\n  Simply put, rejecting this deal would isolate the United States and \nwould put us back on the path to war.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Simpson). The time of the gentlewoman \nhas expired.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. LEE. The Scriptures do say let us study war no more, so that is \nwhy it is critical for us to support the President and our diplomats \nand give this deal a chance to succeed.\n  This is a defining moment for our country and for the world. Let us \ncontinue to work for peace because the military option, that is always \nthere. Let us work for a world worthy of our children and future \ngenerations.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nFairhope, Alabama (Mr. Byrne), a distinguished member of the Rules \nCommittee.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Thank you, Chairman Sessions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and in strong \nopposition to the Iran nuclear agreement.\n  Mr. Speaker, President Obama has created a false choice by claiming \nthe only alternative to this deal is war.\n  First of all, this deal itself can most definitely lead to war. By \ngiving one of our biggest enemies access to nuclear weapons, \nintercontinental ballistic missiles, and billions of dollars in \nsanctions relief, we are effectively giving Iran the tools they need to \nlive out their dream of bringing ``death to America.''\n  The other flaw in the President's logic is that there are actually \nother alternatives than war. What about a better deal that includes \nanytime, anywhere inspections? What about increasing the sanctions \nwhich were clearly working to begin with? What about requiring the \nrelease of Americans held as political prisoners in Iran? These are \nclear alternatives.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the people's House, so I think it is critically \nimportant that we actually listen to the people. Last month, I held \nover 15 townhall meetings all across my district. At each and every \nstop, someone asked me what Congress is going to do to stop the Iran \nnuclear deal.\n  Just look at the public opinion polls. Only 21 percent of those \nsurveyed in a recent poll said they approve of this agreement. That is \nless than one in four Americans who believe this is a good deal.\n  I implore my colleagues to put the opinion of the American people \nover loyalty to some political party. I ask my colleagues to listen to \nour Nation's military leaders, who have made clear the serious \nconsequences of giving Iran access to ICBMs, instead of party bosses.\n  I plead with my colleagues to look past the short-term legacy of our \nPresident and, instead, look at the long-term ramifications this deal \nwill have on the safety and security of the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is no greater responsibility of this House than to \ndo everything we can to keep the American people safe.\n  With that in mind, I strongly urge my colleagues to stand strong and \noppose this deal.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), a distinguished member of \nthe Rules Committee.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Iran \nnuclear agreement and in strong opposition to this convoluted rule and \nprocess.\n  Today, the House should have already completed several hours of \ndebate on the Iran deal. Instead, we have before us a convoluted \nprocess with three measures that won't go anywhere in the Senate and \nwill never reach the President's desk.\n  The fact is that the President has the votes to move this historic \nagreement forward. We should be having a serious debate and moving \ntoward a vote in a timely fashion.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Instead, House Republicans have cooked up a series of votes to \nneedlessly drag this process out and appeal to their extremist base.\n  We all know how serious the Iran nuclear agreement is for the \nsecurity of the Middle East, the United States, and the world.\n  After reading and listening to many diverse views, I believe it is \nthe strongest available option to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear \nweapon and prevent yet another war.\n  These negotiations were never meant to solve all of the problems that \nwe have with Iran. Their purpose was clear from the beginning: to shut \ndown the pathways available to Iran to develop and produce a nuclear \nbomb, period.\n  Quite simply, is it better to have an Iran capable of producing a \nnuclear weapon by early next year or is it better to shut down that \ncapability for the next 10 to 15 years and even longer?\n  And let me be clear. The agreement is set up to ensure that Iran \nremains a nuclear weapon-free state with mechanisms for inspections and \nverifications that remain permanently in place.\n  Now I know that some hoped that a ``better deal'' might somehow be \nrenegotiated if we just keep increasing sanctions and threaten--or even \nuse--military force against Iran.\n  But we already know that 10 years of sanctions and military threats \nonly gave us a significant increase in Iran's nuclear capacity and that \nthe number of centrifuges needed to produce weapons-grade enriched \nuranium also increased.\n  Only when serious negotiations began 2 years ago did we see Iran's \nprogram stopped and then rolled back. The final agreement degrades even \nfurther Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon, blocks all pathways \nfor Iran to acquire the materials needed to develop a bomb, and imposes \nthe most comprehensive inspections regime of any nuclear arms control \nagreement to date.\n  In return, Iran will receive sanctions relief that is phased in over \nthe next decade, dependent on Iran's compliance.\n  Do I trust Iran? Certainly not. Iran doesn't trust us either. But, \nagain, that is the whole point of negotiations: for nations that don't \ntrust one another to sit down and to hammer out a deal that all parties \ncan live with and abide by.\n  Nelson Mandela is credited with saying, ``The best weapon is to sit \ndown and talk.'' This means compromise, for all parties to get \nsomething out of the final agreement.\n  For Iran, that is sanctions relief. For the world, that means an Iran \nwithout a nuclear weapon. It is not based on trust. It is based on \ntough inspections and verification.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not an accord between just the U.S. and Iran. \nSix of the world's major powers--Russia, China, France, Germany, the \nU.K., and the U.S.--hammered out this deal with Iran.\n  If the U.S. walks away now, we will never be able to put the pieces \nback together or get these nations to take a risk with us again. \nWithout this agreement, Iran could simply return to developing a \nnuclear weapon.\n  After 2 years of arduous negotiations, why would the U.S. insult the \nvery nations whose cooperation and commitment we need to ensure Iran's \ncompliance?\n  Why would we undermine our international standing as a good-faith \nnegotiating partner not just on this agreement, but on every other \nnegotiation we are engaged in now and in the future?\n  Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that the IAEA inquiry into Iran's past \nnuclear\n\n[[Page H5889]]\n\nactivities is a side deal. It is its own separate bilateral agreement. \nIt neither affects nor delays the P5+1 agreement's rigorous inspections \nand verification process or Iran's obligation to significantly degrade \nand dismantle its nuclear infrastructure before getting any sanctions \nrelief.\n  But, quite frankly, the U.S. long ago reached its own conclusions \nabout Iran's nuclear activities. We believe that, if left unchecked, \nIran would soon acquire enough weapons-grade plutonium and highly \nenriched uranium to make a nuclear bomb.\n  It is why we approved U.S. nuclear-related sanctions and supported \nsimilar international sanctions, and it is why the White House began \nserious multilateral negotiations with Iran to cut off every pathway \nIran might have to make a nuclear weapon. And we were successful. We \nwere successful.\n  Mr. Speaker, my support for the comprehensive agreement is not \nsomething I give reluctantly or grudgingly. I am proud to support this \ndeal and to cast my vote in support of the resolution of approval.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in \nopposing this rule, in supporting the resolution approving this \nhistoric agreement, and in rejecting both the Roskam and the Pompeo \nbills that seek to delay its implementation.\n  This is a good deal. It deserves our support.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), who serves on the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, \nNonproliferation, and Trade.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, when I was home during the August break, I talked to a \nlot of folks. Many of them were fearful. They were fearful about \nnational security. And it focused on the on deal, the Iranian deal that \nwe are here for today.\n  The Iranian deal, Mr. Speaker, is bad for America. It is bad for \nIsrael. It is bad for the Middle East. But, oh, what a deal for Iran.\n  If we approve this deal, there will be singing and dancing in the \nstreets in Iran, especially with the High Ayatollah leading the \ndancing. Why? Because it is wonderful for Iran.\n  The deal certifies a nuclear Iran, eventually. We can argue over \nwhen, but they are going to get nuclear weapons. How lovely is that. Is \nthe world going to be safer because of that? No.\n  We need to see the world for what it is. Iran is a wolf in wolf's \nclothing. They make absolutely no secret about they want us dead.\n  They want Israel dead first. They were preaching this while we are \nworking on this peace, peace, peace at any price deal, talking about \nhow they want to destroy us.\n  So why don't we just look at the law right now. We have heard a \nlittle bit about a side deal. Secretary Kerry was before our Foreign \nAffairs Committee.\n  I asked him about a side deal that came up about the IAEA deal with \nIran. He said he hadn't read it, he has been briefed on it.\n  Congress needs to read the side deals before we ever vote to approve \nthis deal. We have to read the fine print, like all of us are supposed \nto do when we sign a contract.\n  Now let's read what the law says. The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review \nAct is quite clear, Mr. Speaker. The President is obligated by law--the \nlaw he signed--to provide Congress ``the agreement itself and any \nadditional materials related thereto, including annexes, appendices, \ncodicils, side agreements, implementing materials documents, and \nguidance, technical or other understandings, and any related \nagreements.''\n  That is in the law. I haven't seen the side deal. I haven't seen \nanybody in Congress that has seen the side deal.\n  The law the President signed says we are to see all these side deals, \nagreements, before we even vote on whether or not to approve this deal; \notherwise, the clock doesn't start ticking for the 60-day approval \nrequirement.\n  So show us the side deal. Let us read it. I think Congress maybe has \nhad enough embarrassment over the years voting on laws where we haven't \nseen all of the information before we voted on it. Show us the side \nagreement. Let us go from there.\n  Of course the deal in itself is a bad deal for all of us. I don't \nunderstand why we are giving $150 billion to Iran while we have got $47 \nbillion in claims by Americans against Iran for terrorist activities. \nWhy don't we give them the money first?\n  And I know I am out of time. But let's not approve the deal. Let's \nvote for the rule and make sure, before we ever see any vote on the \nagreement, we see the side deal.\n  And that's just the way it is.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair advises the Members that the \ngentleman from Texas has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from \nNew York has 1 minute remaining.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of my colleague if he has \nfurther speakers? If not, I am prepared to close.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, in response to the gentlewoman, I have \nthree or four more speakers.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss what I \nbelieve will be one of the most consequential votes in the history of \nthis body.\n  A fundamental duty of the Federal Government--so much that it is \nenshrined in the preamble to our Constitution--is to provide for the \ncommon defense.\n  We must ask ourselves: Will this deal enhance the safety and security \nof the American people? The answer is clearly no. On the contrary, it \nimperils the United States and our allies around the world.\n  Look only to those who know Iran best, its neighbors, who universally \noppose the deal. Why? Because it is built on trusting a regime that has \ncheated on international agreements time and again and because it will \nlaunch a nuclear arms race in the most unstable region in the world.\n  So today we have a choice. To me, the choice is clear. We can support \nthis deal and stand with a regime that spreads terror around the world, \nleads its people in chants of ``Death to America,'' and whose leaders \nrefer to our country as the ``Great Satan,'' or we reject the deal and \nstand strong as a country, resolute in our pursuit of freedom and \njustice, stand with our allies, like Israel, and stand with the \nAmerican people, who overwhelmingly opposed this deal.\n  I know where I stand. I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting \nthis deal and sending a clear signal to the world that we will not \naccept a nuclear Iran.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Roe), a gentleman with compassion and healing, a \ngentleman who is a physician, a gentleman on from the Education and the \nWorkforce and Veterans' Affairs Committees.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nlegislation expressing disapproval of this proposed nuclear deal with \nIran.\n  Forty years ago I was a young soldier just south of the militarized \nzone in Korea when they did not have a nuclear weapon. Now that they \nhave joined the nuclear community, does the world feel safer with a \nrogue nation having a nuclear weapon?\n  I pose the question: What is in this agreement for America? Does it \nmake us safer?\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not a Republican or a Democrat issue. This is an \nAmerican issue. This affects all of us. It affects the Middle East, \nwhere our closest ally feels endangered, and I agree that they are.\n  And I pose the narrative question: What is it about ``death to \nAmerica'' this administration does not understand?\n  The President presents a false narrative: war or this agreement. I \ncould not disagree more. The sanctions brought the Iranians to the \nnegotiating table.\n  What kind of an agreement did we negotiate? What happened to \n``anytime, anyplace'' inspections? What happened to Americans actually \nbeing on the inspection team?\n  I think everyone, every thoughtful person, realizes this just slows \nthe process down. But, ultimately, the Iranians will develop a nuclear \nweapon.\n  I support the rule and the underlying bills.\n\n[[Page H5890]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nMiami, Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the former chairman of the Foreign \nAffairs Committee.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, we need to ask ourselves if this \nnuclear deal with Iran makes the United States safer. Does it make \nIsrael safer? Does it make the world safer?\n  As a result of this deal, Iran will be nuclear-capable, and its \nneighbors will not be complacent knowing that Iran can't produce a \nnuclear weapon.\n  The billions of dollars that the regime is set to receive will \nundoubtedly go towards building its military capabilities, not to \nmention its support for terror and other illicit activities.\n  Because this deal jeopardizes Iran's neighbors, the administration is \npromising Gulf countries military arms sales to defend against the \nincreased Iranian threat.\n  We then will be the major proliferator of nuclear and conventional \narms in the Middle East. Do we really believe that arming an extremely \nunstable and violent Middle East region to the teeth and having \nnuclear-capable Iran right there in the middle will make us or the \nworld safer?\n  The answer is clear, Mr. Speaker. This deal is dangerous. It is bad \npublic policy. We must oppose it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nWheaton, Illinois, (Mr. Roskam), the distinguished gentleman who spent \nseveral hours, 4 or 5 hours, with us in the Rules Committee last night.\n  Mr. ROSKAM. I thank Chairman Sessions.\n  Mr. Speaker, Secretary Kerry came and gave a briefing to a closed \nsession of Congress. Part of it was open for discussion. He said \nsomething provocative at the end. He said, ``Folks, what is the \nalternative?''\n  And I said to him in a question and answer session, ``You know, Mr. \nSecretary, for 2 years, the administration has been telling us that no \ndeal is better than a bad deal. And if no deal is better than a bad \ndeal, that means that there was an alternative.''\n  Secretary Kerry, during that same briefing, said that he walked away \nfrom the deal three times with the Iranians. And I said, ``Secretary, \nwhen you walked away from the deal, that means that there was an \nalternative.\n  So the administration does not get to argue today, Mr. Speaker, to \nthis Congress or to the American people that there is no alternative. \nThere is an alternative. And this House is prepared to offer \nalternatives.\n  I appreciate Chairman Sessions. I appreciate the Rules Committee \nbringing forth this package of bills that we can begin to discuss \ngetting us out from underneath a disastrous deal.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice).\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the \nrule and against the Iran nuclear deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, we cannot in good conscience accept a deal that is laden \nwith secretive side agreements brokered by this administration, nor can \nwe possibly grant $150 billion to the world's foremost sponsor of \nterror and, in the process, turn our back on Israel.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is because of this bad deal that the Supreme Leader \nof Iran now is publicly emboldened to say that Israel will not exist in \n25 years and that terror will continue to plague the Middle East, \nIsrael, and the entire world.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we approach September 11, I would ask my colleagues \nto please join me in rejecting this bad deal, and let's defeat \nterrorism rather than advance it.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Bost).\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the deal \nwith Iran. Iran is one of the world's largest state sponsors of \nterrorism.\n  It provides military and financial support to groups responsible for \nthe deaths of Americans and our allies. In addition, the regime is \nworking to undermine governments across the Middle East, including \nIran, Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon.\n  As Iranians rally behind ``death to America,'' I am left to wonder \nwhat other options we have but stopping them from obtaining the most \ndangerous weapons on Earth. Unfortunately, I believe this deal falls \nway short of that goal.\n  I pledge and will be working with my colleagues to make sure that we \noppose this deal and that we find other alternatives.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In closing, the weight of this decision falls heavily on this \nChamber. Instead of following regular order, the majority's insistence \non governing by crisis has once more taken over, and we are thrown into \ndisarray.\n  The Iran agreement is the best option that we have to curbing Iran's \nnuclear ambitions. People who know--nuclear scientists, ambassadors, \npeople of the military--have all said, including Colin Powell, I may \nadd, that this is a good bill, this is a good negotiation that will \nhelp to keep us safe.\n  The work ahead will be arduous, and it is going to take coordination \nwith our international partners who also negotiated this agreement with \nus, but peace is always preferable to war.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the agreement and vote ``no'' on this \nrule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I want to thank my distinguished colleagues, my friends on the Rules \nCommittee, both Mr. McGovern, Judge Hastings, and Ms. Slaughter, for \ntheir participation today. I thank you very much, Ms. Slaughter, for \nyour professional attributes in this very, very difficult debate in the \nlast few days that have taken many, many hours.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is clear to me that the deal that the administration \nnegotiated is a disaster. We have talked about that all morning. \nSpeaker after speaker after speaker after speaker spoke about the lack \nof benefit to the American people. It undermines American leadership \nabroad; it empowers the Iranian regime, and ignores what has been \ndecades of policy where Americans would not deal with terrorists.\n  By overturning the decades of this bipartisan national defense \npolicy, the administration is telling the world the United States is \nwilling to negotiate with rogue states, those people that say ``death \nto America,'' and give them exactly what they want. This will embolden \nfuture actors. It will limit the United States' ability to aggressively \npursue sanctions against other countries.\n  The rest of the world will take note of our weakness. This is not \nleading; this is weakness. If the United States is willing to lift \nsanctions against Iran, we will unilaterally limit our ability to \nresolve issues through democracy, diplomacy, and through peace.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to stop this deal, which is why \nRepublicans are on the floor today. We invite all of our colleagues to \nvote with us because it is the right thing, the adoption of this rule. \nObviously, the lengthy debate we are going to have today is going to \nlead us to the conclusion that the underlying piece of legislation must \nbe properly voted on.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, President Obama has sold our nation's \nsecurity for some magic beans. This Iran deal is a bad deal for our \nnational security. It is a bad deal for our allies--particularly \nIsrael.\n  Removing sanctions against ballistic missiles and conventional arms, \nwould happen before Iran halts its nuclear activity. If we try to re-\nimpose sanctions, Iran gets to walk away from the deal free of \nsanctions all together and keep its money and nuclear weapons.\n  The way I see it, Iran is the only one benefitting from this deal. \nPresident Obama wants people to believe this is the best deal possible. \nI say, if this is the best deal, then I don't want any deal at all.\n  I am voting NO on this deal because I made a promise to my children \nand grandchildren that I would fight to make this nation safer and \nstronger for the next generation. I cannot break that promise to my \ngrandchildren. This is a bad deal.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote YES on the rule and NO on passage of \nthis agreement.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.\n\n[[Page H5891]]\n\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 243, \nnays 186, not voting 4, as follows:\n\n

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 412, I call up \nthe resolution (H. Res. 411) finding that the President has not \ncomplied with section 2 of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of \n2015, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 412, the \nresolution is considered read.\n  The text of the resolution is as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 411\n\n       Whereas section 135(h)(1) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, \n     as enacted by section 2 of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review \n     Act of 2015, defined the term ``agreement'' as meaning ``an \n     agreement related to the nuclear program of Iran that \n     includes the United States, commits the United States to take \n     action, or pursuant to which the United States commits or \n     otherwise agrees to take action, regardless of the form it \n     takes, whether a political commitment or otherwise, and \n     regardless of whether it is legally binding or not, including \n     any joint comprehensive plan of action entered into or made \n     between Iran and any other parties, and any additional \n     materials related thereto, including annexes, appendices, \n     codicils, side agreements, implementing materials, documents, \n     and guidance, technical or other understandings, and any \n     related agreements, whether entered into or implemented prior \n     to the agreement or to be entered into or implemented in the \n     future.'';\n       Whereas section C(14) of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \n     Action requires Iran to implement the ``Roadmap for \n     Clarification of Past and Present Outstanding Issues \n     regarding Iran's Nuclear Program'' (referred to as\n\n[[Page H5892]]\n\n     the ``Roadmap'') which was agreed to with the IAEA;\n       Whereas the Roadmap identifies two separate, confidential \n     agreements between the IAEA and Iran, one to address \n     remaining outstanding issues related to ``Possible Military \n     Dimensions'' of Iran's nuclear program, and another \n     ``regarding the issue of Parchin'';\n       Whereas both of those agreements constitute side agreements \n     within the meaning of section 135(h)(1);\n       Whereas section 135(a)(1)(A) requires the President to \n     transmit the agreement, including any side agreements, as \n     defined by section 135(h)(1) to the appropriate congressional \n     committees and leadership;\n       Whereas the Executive Communication numbered 2307 and \n     captioned ``A letter from the Assistant Secretary, \n     Legislative Affairs, Department of State, transmitting a \n     letter and attachments satisfying all requirements of Sec. \n     135(a) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended by the \n     Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (Pub. L. 114-17), \n     as received July 19, 2015'', did not include the text of \n     either side agreement with the IAEA; and\n       Whereas the President has not subsequently transmitted to \n     the appropriate congressional committees and leadership the \n     text of the separate agreements identified in the Roadmap: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the President has not complied with section 2 of the \n     Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 because the \n     communication from the President did not constitute the \n     agreement as defined by section 135(h)(1) of the Atomic \n     Energy Act of 1954; and\n       (2) the period for review by Congress of nuclear agreements \n     with Iran under section 135(b) of the Atomic Energy Act of \n     1954 has not commenced because the agreement has not yet been \n     transmitted to the appropriate congressional committees and \n     leadership.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The resolution shall be debatable for 2 \nhours, equally divided and controlled by the chair of the Committee on \nForeign Affairs and the minority leader or their respective designees.\n  The gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) will control 1 hour. The \ngentleman from California (Mr. Schiff) and the gentleman from Maryland \n(Mr. Cummings) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce).\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 days to revise and extend and submit extraneous materials on \nthis measure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think we all know why we are here to debate this \nresolution today. The bottom line is that, for those of us that were \ninvolved in this agreement, we always thought that international \ninspections were going to be done by international inspectors, not by \nthe Iranians, not by those in the Iranian regime.\n  Whether you like the Iran agreement or not, one thing I think all \nMembers can agree on is that sound verification must be the bedrock of \nany viable agreement.\n  Iran cannot cheat and get away with it. And the reason this is an \nissue for us is because Iran has cheated on every past agreement. That \nis why the verification was so important.\n  The problem is key aspects of this verification agreement have not \nbeen presented to Congress to review. Indeed, there are two separate \narrangements agreed to between Iran and an arm of the U.N. here, the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\n  One is regarding the regime's past bomb work, of which there are a \nthousand pages of evidence that the IAEA tell us about, and the other \ninvolves access to the Iranian military base at Parchin, where that \nevidence shows that that testing took place.\n  In order to fully assess the agreement, Members of Congress should \nhave access to these documents. This is especially important since Iran \nwill almost certainly treat these arrangements as setting a standard \nfor future IAEA requests to access any suspicious sites, especially \nmilitary sites, since they have made it clear nobody is going to their \nmilitary sites.\n  Physical access by the IAEA to Parchin is critical to understanding \nIran's past bomb work. This is where ``Iran constructed a large \nexplosives containment vessel,'' to quote the IAEA.\n  Why did they do it? To conduct experiments related to the \ndevelopment, say the international inspectors, of nuclear weapons. Iran \nhas blocked the international inspectors' access to Parchin for years.\n  In the meantime, we are told by those inspectors that they watch on \nspy satellite as Iran bulldozes and paves over this site and then paves \nover the site again.\n  If the international inspectors cannot attain a clear understanding \nof the experimentation that took place, then the United States will \nhave great difficulty figuring out how long it would take Iran to rush \ntoward a nuclear weapon.\n  In recent congressional testimony, administration officials expressed \nconfidence in their access to suspicious sites that the agreement \nprovides the IAEA.\n  Yet, these separate arrangements have the potential to seriously \nweaken our ability to verify the agreement as a whole even is true, \nthat Iran is going to do self-inspections here, which is what Iran \nasserts.\n  Mr. Speaker, the history of Iranian negotiating behavior, as we know, \nis to pocket past concessions. And then what do they do? They push for \nmore and more and more.\n  The separate arrangement agreed to between the IAEA and Iran \nregarding inspection of the facilities at Parchin will almost certainly \nbe regarded by that government in Iran as a precedent for their IAEA \naccess to future suspicious sites in Iran.\n  In other words, if you don't get access to this site, you are not \ngoing to get access to other military sites where there is evidence \nthat the same type of thing has occurred.\n  So if Iran won't let international inspectors do the international \ninspecting today, what makes us think that the Iranians will allow \nintrusive terms to these agreements in the future after sanctions have \nbeen lifted when we find evidence of the next site?\n  I have little doubt that the side deals of today will become central \nto the agreement's verification provisions tomorrow. This makes it \nimperative that these agreements are made available to Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, 350 Members of this House, Democrats and Republicans--I \nthink we had the majority of the Democrats, and I think we had every \nRepublican--wrote to Secretary Kerry last fall.\n  Iran's willingness to resolve concerns over its bomb work, as we said \nin that letter, is a fundamental test of Iran's intention to uphold a \ncomprehensive agreement. That is why we all wrote that letter together, \nin order to make that point.\n  The administration once took the same position that we are taking \nright now on the House floor as well, but it gave that position away in \nnegotiations. It gave away that position.\n  Reviewing these side agreements is critical to understanding whether \nIran intends to pass that test. We need access to those agreements.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, after several years of difficult negotiations with a \ndangerous and malevolent regime, the administration and representatives \nof the other P5+1 nations reached an agreement with Iran over its \nnuclear program.\n  The primary objective of the United States in the negotiations was to \nprevent Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon. Given the \nunthinkable consequences of Iran, the world's foremost sponsor of \nterrorism, obtaining the bomb, this has been an overriding national \nsecurity imperative of the United States for decades.\n  As an American and as a Jew who is deeply concerned about the \nsecurity of Israel, it is also intensely personal.\n  I believe our vital interests have been advanced under the agreement, \nsince it would be extremely difficult for Iran to amass enough \nfissionable material to make a nuclear weapon without giving the United \nStates ample notice and time to stop it.\n  We will still need to guard against any Iranian effort to obtain \nnuclear material or technology from proliferators abroad, a reality \neven if Iran had given up all enrichment.\n  But the agreement likely gives the world at least a decade and a half \nwithout the prospect of an Iranian nuclear weapon and without going to \nwar to\n\n[[Page H5893]]\n\nmake that so. That is a major achievement.\n  The United States realized this objective by securing a number of \nimportant provisions in the agreement, including the power to snap back \nsanctions, in whole or in part, and not subject to a veto in the United \nNations.\n  The United States and its allies also procured an extensive and \nintrusive inspections regime that lasts for 25 years or more. By \napplying to the whole chain of the enrichment process, from the ground \nto the centrifuge, it realistically precludes Iran from developing a \nhidden and parallel enrichment process.\n  With respect to those inspections, I think it is very important to \nclarify something which I often hear the opponents obscure, and that is \nthere are inspections with respect to Iran's prior military work, \ninspections of known nuclear sites and inspections of other sites which \nwe may suspect Iran may conduct work in the future. And the mechanisms \nwith respect to each are different.\n  With respect to the known nuclear sites, there are 24/7 eyes on \nIran's enrichment activities that would be the most extensive and \nintrusive inspections any nation has seen of its nuclear program.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  With respect to its potential sites--that is sites we don't know, \nwhere we suspect in the future they may do work--we will have a \nmechanism to obtain inspections in a timely way and certainly in a \ntimely enough way that, if they were to ever utilize radioactive \nmaterial, they would be detected.\n  Finally, we have the inspections into their prior military work. I \nwill say this with respect to the prior military work, those of us that \nhave reviewed the intelligence know that we have an extensive bank of \ninformation about what Iran had been doing in the past. To the degree \nthat we need a baseline for what Iran's work has been, we have that \nbaseline, and I think that is a pivotal consideration going forward.\n  As recently as yesterday, the Director of National Intelligence \nstated that he has great confidence that we can determine if Iran fails \nto comply with the agreement.\n  For me, it is the size and sophistication of Iran's nuclear \nenrichment capability after 15 years that is the key challenge. At that \npoint, it is the work necessary to produce the mechanism for the bomb \nthat becomes the real obstacle to a breakout, and that work is the most \nchallenging to detect. Nevertheless, I have searched for a better, \ncredible alternative and concluded that there is none.\n  When it comes to predicting the future, we are all looking through \nthe glass darkly, but if Congress rejects the deal agreed to by the \nadministration and much of the world, the sanctions regime will, if not \ncollapse, almost certainly erode.\n  This does not mean that Iran necessarily dashes madly for a bomb, but \nit will almost certainly move forward with its enrichment program, \nunconstrained by inspections, limits on research, and development of \nnew centrifuges, metallurgy, or other protections in the deal.\n  In short, Iran will have many of the advantages of the deal in access \nto money and trade with none of its disadvantages. Instead of rejecting \nthe deal, therefore, Congress should focus on making it stronger.\n  First, we should make it clear that, if Iran cheats, the \nrepercussions will be severe.\n  Second, we should continue to strengthen our intelligence \ncapabilities to detect any form of Iranian noncompliance.\n  Third, we should establish the expectation that, while Iran will be \npermitted to have an enrichment capability for civilian use, it will \nnever, never be permitted to produce highly enriched uranium, and if it \nattempts to do so, it will be stopped with force.\n  Fourth, we will share with Israel all the technologies necessary to \nmaintain its regional military superiority and, if necessary, to \ndestroy Iran's nuclear facilities no matter how deep the bunker.\n  Finally, we are prepared to work with Israel and our Gulf allies to \nmake sure that every action Iran takes to use its newfound wealth for \ndestructive activities in the region will prompt an equal and opposite \nreaction, and we will combat Iran's malignant influence.\n  The Iranian people will one day throw off the shackles of their \nrepressive regime, and I hope that this deal will empower those who \nwish to reform Iranian governance and behavior. The 15 years or more \nthis agreement provides will give us the time to test that proposition.\n  Then, as now, if Iran is determined to develop the bomb, there is \nonly one way to stop it, and that is by the use of force; but the \nAmerican people and others around the world will recognize that we did \neverything possible to avoid war.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Nunes), chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, although the Obama administration has pitched \nthe Iran nuclear accord as a way to prevent the Ayatollahs from \ndeveloping nuclear weapons, the agreement lifts the key restrictions on \nIran's nuclear activities after 10 to 15 years. Many of my fellow \nMembers wonder how the administration can be so naive as to pave the \nway for an Iranian bomb in the course of trying to prevent an Iranian \nbomb.\n  Well, the answer is clear to me. The President is gambling. He is \nbetting that the very act of engaging with Iran will moderate the \nregime's behavior so that, in a decade or so from now, we won't have to \nworry about it anymore. He has called his engagement with Iran a \ncalculated risk. Indeed, it is a risk.\n  As I said, the President is placing a bet; but why would anyone bet \non the moderation of the Iranian regime? It has not changed one iota \nsince the Ayatollahs seized power in 1979. Thirty-six years later, Iran \nis the world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism. It is also \nresponsible for the deaths of thousands of U.S. soldiers in Iraq.\n  Obama has spoken of the Ayatollah Khamenei as possibly seeking to \nrejoin the community of nations. This is a thin reed to justify giving \nIran a path to the bomb in the near future. With their ritual ``death \nto America'' chants, I don't know how the Iranians could make it any \nmore clear that they do not want to rejoin the community of nations. \nThey want to blow up the community of nations.\n  Soon after the Iranian agreement was signed, Khamenei himself tweeted \na silhouette image of President Obama holding a gun to his head. I just \ndon't understand what is more clear that this regime could do to make \nits intentions clearer to the American people, but our President sees \nthings differently.\n  As he told The New York Times, if the nuclear agreement is signed, \n``Who knows? Iran may change.''\n  Well, consider this: if you are rolling the dice at a casino, who \nknows? You may roll a 7. If you are at the roulette wheel, who knows? \nIt may land on your number. When you are gambling, one thing is for \nsure; in the long run, the casino always wins.\n  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, this is not about a casino, nor is it \nabout a gambler losing money. This is about gambling on human lives, \nU.S. lives and our Western allies' lives.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Appropriations.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, reasonable people disagree about the merits \nand shortcomings of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n  In the strongest democracy in the world, we have a sacred duty to \nuphold the high standard of debate and govern responsibly. That is why \nI am profoundly disappointed by vitriolic personal attacks and \ncharacter assassinations on both sides of this debate; and I am \noutraged by the Republicans' attempt to score political points on this \ncritical issue of national and global security.\n  The threat to pursue wasteful litigation and to tie the hands of our \nPresident until the end of his term are particularly outrageous, when \nthe Senate has indicated it will not even consider these measures. I \nstrongly oppose the blatantly irresponsible partisan political measures \nbefore the House this week.\n\n[[Page H5894]]\n\n  As ranking Democratic member of the House Committee on Appropriations \nand the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, I have participated in \ndozens of classified and unclassified Iran briefings with the Obama \nadministration, including members of our negotiating team and \ncolleagues in Congress during the last 2 years.\n\n  I have thoroughly evaluated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \nreleased in July, met with foreign leaders, nuclear experts, and heard \nfrom thousands of thoughtful and passionate constituents.\n  After careful consideration, I will vote against approval of the \nagreement. Sufficient safeguards simply are not in place to address the \nrisk associated with this agreement, and it will not dismantle Iran's \nnuclear infrastructure.\n  First, in 15 years, Iran will become an internationally recognized \nnuclear threshold state capable of producing highly enriched uranium to \ndevelop a nuclear weapon.\n  Second, relieving U.N. sanctions on conventional arms and ballistic \nmissiles and releasing billions of dollars to the Iranian regime will \nlead to a dangerous regional weapons race and enable Iran to bolster \nits funding of Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and Bashar al-Assad.\n  Third, the deal does not explicitly require Iran to fully disclose \nits previous military work before sanctions relief is provided. \nInspectors will not have anytime, anywhere access to the most \nsuspicious facilities, particularly the Parchin military complex, with \na process that lacks transparency and could delay inspectors access for \nup to 24 days.\n  Finally, there are no clear accountability measures regarding \npunishment for minor violations of the agreement. In recent weeks, the \nadministration has responded to some of my concerns by committing to \nadditional security assistance to Israel and our Gulf partners and to \nimproving international cooperation on countering Iran's nonnuclear \ndestabilizing activities.\n  I will work in Congress and with the administration to expeditiously \nimplement these commitments to enhance--not just maintain--nonnuclear-\nrelated sanctions to establish stronger mechanisms to deter Iran and to \nensure Iran never develops a nuclear weapon.\n  One of my highest priorities will continue to be the protection of \nIsrael's qualitative military edge so that our closest ally in the \nregion can defend itself against all threats from Iran or its proxies.\n  In the same week, my colleagues, that Congress holds this important \nvote, Iran's Supreme Leader vowed again to annihilate the Jewish State \nof Israel and to vilify the Great Satan that he calls the United States \nof America.\n  It is my sincere hope that we can work together in a bipartisan way \nmoving forward. The security of the United States of America and our \nallies depends on it.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee \non the Middle East and North Africa and was the author of some of the \nIran sanctions laws that are in force today.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my esteemed chairman for his \nleadership on this critical issue. I also want to congratulate Mr. \nPompeo, whose resolution we are discussing.\n  Mr. Speaker, this deal will allow Iran to become nuclear capable in \njust a short order. It will allow Iran to grow and expand its military. \nIt will allow Iran to continue with its support for terror. These facts \nare indisputable.\n  What is also indisputable is that the regime in Tehran detests the \nUnited States, the West, and the democratic Jewish State of Israel, our \nsteadfast partner. The Supreme Leader of Iran constantly incites chants \nof ``death to America'' and ``death to Israel.'' Are we not listening?\n  Through its proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas, Iran seeks to make this \nthreat into a reality. Earlier this week, the Supreme Leader threatened \nthat Israel will no longer exist in just 25 years.\n  Because of this agreement, Mr. Speaker, the regime will now have the \nweapons; it will now have the capabilities to pose an even greater \nthreat to us, to Israel, and to our interests in the region. Giving a \nregime that openly calls for and works toward our destruction and the \ndestruction of Israel is insane. We are providing Iran a path to \nnuclear weapons and increased conventional weapons capability.\n  This isn't just bad policy. It is dangerous. It is naive to think \nthat this nuclear deal with Iran won't make us and the world less safe, \nless secure, and less peaceful. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, we must reject \nit.\n  I thank Chairman Royce and Mr. Pompeo for this resolution.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the distinguished assistant Democratic \nleader.\n  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action negotiated between the United States, the \npermanent 5 members of the United Nations Security Council plus \nGermany, the European Union, and Iran.\n  I support this deal because it is the best available option to \nprevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, an outcome that all of us \nagree must be prevented. The opponents of this agreement say that Iran \nsupports terrorism. I don't disagree with that.\n  This deal, however, is about only one issue--the issue that the \nentire world agrees is by far the most pressing--preventing Iran from \ngetting a nuclear weapon. It is precisely because Iran is so nefarious \nthat this deal is so important.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  As dangerous as Iran is and may remain, Iran would be far more \ndangerous if they acquired a nuclear weapon. This deal is the best way \nto prevent that unacceptable outcome.\n  The opponents of this agreement say that we can't trust the Iranians \nto abide by the agreement's strict restrictions on their nuclear \nprogram. That may be true. And I wouldn't be supporting the agreement \nif it required us to trust the Iranians, but it doesn't.\n  This deal is built around the strictest verifications ever devised. \nIf Iran tries to dash toward a bomb, we will be more likely to catch \nthem using the verification procedures under this deal than we would be \nwithout it.\n  With this deal in place, if you do catch Iran dashing toward a \nnuclear weapon, all options will be on the table to stop them. But \nmilitary force must always be a last resort. I have not heard any of \nthe opponents of this agreement present any realistic diplomatic \nalternative that would be anywhere near as likely to stop Iran from \ngetting a nuclear weapon, and if we reject this deal, military action \nwill become more likely.\n  Whenever we send Americans into harm's way, we must be able to look \nthem and their families in the eye and honestly tell them that we have \nexhausted every other option. This deal is a diplomatic option we must \nexhaust. This deal's opponents present no other.\n  The late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, said: ``You don't make \npeace with friends. You make it with unsavory enemies.''\n  We are now faced with three choices: this deal, a drastically \nincreased likelihood of military confrontation, or a nuclear Iran. I \nsupport this deal, and I ask my colleagues to join me in doing so.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nSmith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global \nHealth, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, what was previously \nunacceptable, an Iranian nuclear state, is now inevitable under the \nterms and conditions of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n  Tragically, the deal is riddled with serious flaws, gaps, and huge \nconcessions to Iran. Taken as a whole, the deal poses an existential \nthreat to Israel and other friends in the region--and is a significant \nrisk to the United States.\n  Not only is Iran now permitted to continue enriching uranium--a \nprevious nonnegotiable red line was no enrichment whatsoever--but under \nthis agreement, Iran will be able to assemble an industrial-scale \nnuclear program once the agreement begins to sunset in as little as a \ndecade.\n  And make no mistake about it, Iran's decades-long rabid hatred of \nIsrael\n\n[[Page H5895]]\n\nshows no sign of abating anytime soon. Yesterday, the Times of Israel \nreported that Iran's Supreme Leader said to Israel, ``You will not see \nthe next 25 years,'' adding that the Jewish state will be hounded until \nit is destroyed.\n  Mr. Speaker, inspections are anything but anytime or anywhere, the \nObama administration's previous pledge to the Nation and the world. We \nhave learned that the IAEA has entered into a secret agreement that \nprecludes unfettered, robust inspection. That also violates the Corker \nlaw. We have not gotten that information.\n  Mr. Speaker, Iran is the world's leading supporter of terrorism. This \nagreement provides tens of billions of dollars for weapons and war-\nmaking materiel.\n  The Supreme Leader also criticized any call to end its ballistic \nmissile program, another eleventh hour concession. The Supreme Leader \ncalled that stupid and idiotic, and that they should mass produce such \nweapons and means of delivery.\n  Countries build ICBMs, Mr. Speaker, to deliver nukes.\n  The administration was reluctant, but I held two hearings and the \nchairman held several hearings on the Americans being held hostage. \nPastor Saeed Abedini, Amir Hekmati, Jason Rezaian, and Robert Levinson \nremain in jail--abused, tortured, or missing. Why are they not free?\n  President Obama continues to tell Congress and the American people \nthat the Iran nuclear agreement is the best deal possible and advances \npeace. Such boasting collapses under scrutiny. What was previously \nunacceptable--an Iranian nuclear state--is now inevitable under the \nterms and conditions of what is officially known as the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action.\n  Tragically, the deal is riddled with serious flaws, gaps, and huge \nconcessions to Iran. Taken as a whole, the deal poses an existential \nthreat to Israel, our allies in the region--and even poses significant \nrisks to the United States.\n  Not only is Iran now permitted to continue enriching uranium--a \nprevious nonnegotiable redline was no enrichment whatsoever--under this \nagreement, Iran will not be required to dismantle its bomb-making \ntechnology and will have an internationally recognized, industrial-\nscale nuclear program once the agreement begins to ``sunset'' in as \nlittle as a decade.\n  And make no mistake, Iran's decades-long rabid hatred of Israel shows \nno sign of abating anytime soon. Yesterday, the Times of Israel \nreported that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said to \nIsrael: ``You will not see (the) next 25 years,'' adding that the \nJewish state will be hounded until it is destroyed.\n  On the inspections front, Supreme Leader Khamenei has stated that he \nwill ``never'' permit inspectors to inspect Iran's military bases. Even \nafter the agreement was signed, the Iranian Minister of Defense \nreportedly said that ``Tehran will not allow any foreigner to discover \nIran's defensive and missile capabilities by inspecting the country's \nmilitary sites.''\n  Inspections under this agreement are anything but ``anytime, \nanywhere''--the Obama Administration's previous pledge to the nation \nand the world. We have learned that the International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA) has entered into a secret side agreement to preclude \nunfettered, robust inspection, and in another bizarre concession by the \nAdministration and our negotiating partners, even allows Iran to self-\nmonitor in certain circumstances.\n  Yet the agreement itself contains many limits on access by IAEA \ninspectors to suspected sites, including a 24-day period in which Iran \nis allowed to continue to refuse the IAEA's request to visit a facility \nfollowed by a very long process needed to increase pressure on Iran to \npermit access if it still blocks access by inspectors. During this \nperiod, Iran will have sufficient time to remove, cover up, or destroy \nany evidence. ``Managed access'' would be better called ``manipulated \naccess'' as inspectors will get access to suspected sites only after \nconsultations between the world powers and Iran, over nearly a month.\n  Given Iran's repeated cover-ups of its clandestine nuclear program, \nits refusal to give the IAEA access to its Parchin military facility \n(where Iran is believed to have tested detonators for nuclear \nwarheads), and its stone-walling the IAEA concerning evidence that it \nhad done extensive research and development on a nuclear explosive \ndevice, verification is fundamental to ensure that Iran is abiding by \nthe agreement's terms. Secretary of State John Kerry, after an Iranian \nhistory of refusal to allow inspections at Parchin, would only assure \nus of inspections there ``as appropriate,'' whatever that means.\n  Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman has said that pledges by Obama \nAdministration officials that the agreement would guarantee ``anywhere, \nanytime'' inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities were only \n``rhetorical.'' Mere words without substance? Why would our allies in \nthe region trust us if our word--and negotiating positions--are indeed \nonly rhetorical flourish?\n  The key restriction on Iran's nuclear program--the ability to enrich \nat high levels--begins to expire in as little as 10 years. Once these \nrestrictions expire, Iran could enrich on an industrial scale and the \nU.S. and its allies will be left with no effective measures to prevent \nIran from initiating an accelerated nuclear program to produce the \nmaterials needed for a nuclear weapon.\n  Mr. Speaker, the IAEA has uncovered significant evidence that Iran \nhas engaged in activities related to the development of a nuclear \nweapon. Despite many agreements with the IAEA in which Iran has pledged \nto provide satisfactory information, the IAEA has repeatedly said that \nIran has given it virtually nothing. Secretary Kerry has said that the \nU.S. has ``absolute knowledge'' of Iran's past military activities \nregarding its nuclear program, but Gen. Michael Hayden, the former \nDirector of the CIA, recently testified to Congress that the U.S. did \nnot have that capability.\n  Furthermore, as witnesses testified at a joint hearing in July by \nthree Foreign Affairs subcommittees, there is ample evidence that Iran \nhas a longstanding nuclear collaboration with North Korea. In light of \nthe abundant evidence they will present, what gives the Administration \ncertainty that the Iranians won't at some point during this agreement \nacquire fissile material beyond what they are allowed to produce for \nthemselves or actual warheads from North Korea?\n  Why was the Iran-North Korea nuclear collaboration not factored into \nthe Iran nuclear agreement? Surely Secretary Kerry is aware of the \nIran-North Korea nuclear linkage. Assistant Secretary of State for \nPublic Affairs Douglas Frantz, previously a high-ranking Kerry Senate \naide, wrote a 2003 article about Iran's ties to the North Korean \nnuclear program. Are we to believe Frantz and Kerry never discussed \nthis issue? He dodged the question at today's committee hearing.\n  Mr. Speaker, in March 2007, the UN Security Council unanimously \nadopted Resolution 1747 which, inter alia, established an embargo on \nthe export from Iran of all arms and related materials, thereby banning \nall states and groups from purchasing or receiving arms from Iran. The \nresolution also called on all states to ``exercise vigilance and \nrestraint'' in their supply of any items covered by the U.N. Register \nof Conventional Arms to Iran.\n  However, reports indicate that Russia is eager to sell massive \namounts of military hardware to Iran. Major General Qassem Suleimani, \nIran's Revolutionary Guard leader, recently visited Russia. How will \nthis shape other regional conflicts in which Iran is currently \ninvolved, including Iraq, Syria, and Yemen? After the conventional arms \nembargo is lifted in just 5 years, what limitations, if any, will there \nbe on Iran's ability to export arms, specifically heavy weapons? \nBesides Russia, who else will sell weapons to Iran? China?\n  Moreover, the Administration and its supporters of the Iranian \nnuclear agreement downplay the possibility of Saudi Arabia, for \nexample, producing a nuclear weapon as part of a Middle East arms race. \nHowever, the Saudis are building King Abdullah City for Atomic \nRenewable Energy to train nuclear scientists and already have greater \nscience and mathematics capacity than Pakistan had when it developed \nnuclear weapons. Why couldn't and why wouldn't the Saudis join the \nnuclear arms race when faced with a more nuclear and conventionally \narmed Iran? Secretary Kerry would have us believe that the Saudis and \nothers in the region would prefer the current agreement to an effort to \nachieve a more effective one and would agree not to pursue nuclear \nweapons even though Iran is on the path to develop or acquire its own.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, ballistic missiles are a central component of any \ncountry's nuclear weapons program as they allow for the quick, accurate \ndelivery of nuclear weapons over long distances. While the agreement \ncalls for Iran to abide by all U.N. Security Council resolutions--\nincluding the requirement that ``Iran shall not undertake any activity \nrelated to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons,'' \nIranian Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's criticized the call for \nIran to end its ballistic missile program, characterizing it as ``a \nstupid, idiotic expectation'' and claiming ``The Revolutionary Guards \nshould definitely carry out their program and not be satisfied with the \npresent level. They should mass produce.''\n  In an 11th hour concession by the Obama Administration and others, \nthe agreement ``sunsets'' U.N. sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile \nprogram after 8 years, and also requires that the European Union do the \nsame. U.S. intelligence estimates Iran to have the largest arsenal of \nballistic missiles in the Middle East. Congress has received expert \ntestimony that ``no country that has not aspired to possess nuclear \nweapons has ever opted to sustain'' a costly, long-range missile \nprogram.\n\n[[Page H5896]]\n\nSimply put, countries build ICBMs to deliver nukes.\n  Under this agreement, the Iranians have stated they are under no \nobligation to stop developing ballistic missiles. In fact, this \nagreement would allow them the two things they need to advance their \nprogram: money and foreign assistance.\n  Iran dared to insert ballistic missiles and conventional weapons into \nthe nuclear negotiations without fear of disturbing the talks. \nMeanwhile, the Administration was reluctant to use its leverage during \nthe negotiations to free the four Americans held hostage in Iran today. \nPastor Saeed Abedini, Amir Hekmati, Jason Rezaian, and Robert Levinson \nremain in jail--abused, tortured or missing.\n  Mr. Speaker, the agreement requires ``full implementation'' by \nOctober 15 of the commitments in the ``roadmap'' made by Iran to the \nIAEA in their 2011 agreement, following which the IAEA is to provide \nits ``final assessment on the resolution of all past and present \noutstanding issues.'' However, there is no stated penalty if Iran \ncontinues to refuse to provide sufficient information to fully answer \nthe IAEA's questions, which Iran cannot do without admitting it had a \nsecret nuclear weapons program.\n  Iran has repeatedly agreed to answer the IAEA's questions regarding \nextensive evidence that it had a secret research and development \nprogram regarding a nuclear device, including fitting it onto a \nballistic missile. All that resulted was the Iranians stonewalling the \ninspectors.\n  Is the failure to resolve the possible military dimensions as \nrequired by the IAEA a violation of the agreement? Why would Iran \nprovide any information now when there is nothing in the agreement to \ncompel it to do so?\n  Iran currently is the world's leading supporter of terrorism, and \nthis agreement provides funding that will drastically expand Iran's \nregional destabilization efforts--from Israel to Iraq to Yemen to \nLebanon and elsewhere. The Administration disputes the figure of $150 \nbillion to be released to Iran, but even a portion of that amount would \nprovide significant resources to fund Iran's terrorism in the region--\nthreatening our allies in the region and global security.\n  Moreover, the Administration underestimates the revenue from both \nrising oil prices at some point and the tax revenues from increased \ncommercial investment and activity.\n  Congress should oppose in any way possible the Joint Comprehensive \nPlan of Action, reinstate comprehensive, robust sanctions and direct \nthe executive branch to resume the struggle to craft an enforceable \naccord to ensure no nuclear weapons capability for Iran--ever.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Defense.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for the Iran nuclear \nagreement.\n  As the ranking member of the Defense Subcommittee of the House \nAppropriations Committee, I am acutely aware of the harmful influence \nIran and its proxies have on the security situation in the greater \nMiddle East. However, despite my clear and deep distrust of Iran, I \nfirmly support the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, given the \nimprovement it works.\n  This hard-fought multilateral agreement will severely limit Iran's \nnuclear ambitions, establish a verifiable and robust inspection regime, \nallow for the timely reinstatement of sanctions for violations of this \nagreement, and in no way limit U.S. military options.\n  I cannot argue that the agreement is perfect, and I am frustrated at \nits limited scope. However, in any negotiation, especially one among \nsovereign nations, each having their own economic and security \nconsiderations, some compromise is necessary. Critically, I believe the \nagreement reached accomplishes the goal of preventing Iran from \nobtaining a nuclear weapon.\n  I concur with the sentiments of my esteemed friend and former Senator \nRichard Lugar, who recently wrote that congressional rejection of the \nIran deal would ``kill the last chance for Washington to reach a \nverifiable Iranian commitment not to build a nuclear weapon'' and \n``destroy the effective coalition that brought Iran to the negotiating \ntable.''\n  I believe it is vital for the duration of the agreement that the U.S. \nleads the international community to maintain focus on Iran's \ncompliance and ensure that Iran does not undermine regional stability \nthrough other pathways. To accomplish this, we must remain steadfast in \nour commitments to Israel and all our regional partners.\n  I ask all to constructively work to improve the security situation in \nthe Middle East, rather than using all of their energy to undermine the \nagreement. We cannot rely on force of arms alone to bring lasting \nstability to any region of the world.\n  In conclusion, I do hope that the exhaustive multilateral negotiation \nthat led to this agreement will serve as a template for future U.S. and \ninternational engagement on other outstanding issues that have led to \ninstability and violence in the region.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Poe), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, \nNonproliferation, and Trade.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman, the gentleman from \nCalifornia, for his leadership on this critical national security \nissue.\n  Mr. Speaker, this Iranian deal promises peace--peace in our time--by \nguaranteeing a nuclear weaponized Iran in our children's time.\n  Anyone who has read the Iran Nuclear Agreement Act should support \nthis legislation before us. The Iran Nuclear Agreement Act, known as \nthe Corker bill, is to allow representatives of the American people--\nus--to read what is in the deal before we vote on the deal. The nuclear \ndeal with Iran may be the most important international agreement in our \nlifetime.\n  The Corker bill is crystal clear when it comes to defining exactly \nwhat the President needs to provide Congress before the review period \nof 60 days begins. The President is obligated under the law--and let me \nread a portion of the law that the President signed. Here is what it \nsays:\n\n       Congress is allowed to have the agreement itself and any \n     additional materials related thereto, including annexes, \n     appendices, codicils, side agreements, implementing materials \n     documents, and guidance, technical or other understandings, \n     and any related agreements.\n\n  The logic behind this requirement is simple and essential: Congress \ncannot review an agreement without having access to everything, \nincluding the fine print. We need to see all the secret side deals, Mr. \nChairman.\n  Testifying before the Foreign Affairs Committee, Secretary Kerry, who \nwas making the deal for us, said that even he had not seen the secret \nside deals. And these secret deals are not just technical formalities. \nThe deals I am talking about are the IAEA agreement to let Iran inspect \nitself at the Parchin military facility. The Parchin facility is known \nas the place where Iran has worked to build nuclear warheads.\n  There is absolutely nothing normal about allowing Iran to inspect \nitself. That is what this side agreement apparently does, if we ever \nget to see the whole thing.\n  I was a judge in Texas for a long time. It is like having a burglar \ncoming to trial and saying: ``Judge, I want 12 burglars on my jury.'' \nWe would never let that happen, but we will let Iran inspect itself? We \nwant to see these side secret deals.\n  And these revelations may be only the tip of the iceberg. What else \nis included in these secret deals, these side deals? Well, we really \ndon't know because we haven't been furnished--by law--these deals.\n  It is the legal right of Congress to know all of those details before \nvoting to approve or disapprove this nuclear agreement. We in Congress \nare the representatives of the people. Isn't it about time we start \nreading all the information before we vote? I don't know that Congress \nhas learned that lesson.\n  The citizens of this country have a right to know absolutely about \nthese side deals. The President signed the Corker bill. It is the law. \nHe has to live by it, whether he likes it or not.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nIllinois (Ms. Schakowsky).\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. In 2002, the President of the United States and this \nCongress voted to address the perceived threat of a mushroom cloud \ncoming from Iraq by going to war, a war that unleashed massive violence \nin the Mideast and threatens the world even today.\n  The Obama administration, faced with the actual threat of a nuclear \nweaponized Iran, has chosen, instead,\n\n[[Page H5897]]\n\nthe path of diplomacy, the path of peace, and I am proud to support \nthis historic agreement.\n  As the President said: ``This deal demonstrates that American \ndiplomacy can bring about real and meaningful change--change that makes \nour country, and the world, safer and more secure.''\n  Voices inside and outside the Congress are calling for a rejection of \nthis historic agreement, among them the same neocons who stampeded the \nUnited States into war with Iraq. They were wrong then, and they are \nwrong now. Iran is now 2 to 3 months from being able to produce a \nnuclear weapon, and yet the critics have offered no credible \nalternative to a deal that blocks all the paths to a nuclear weapon.\n  Now, we know this deal is not perfect. Iran is a bad actor. The \nPresident and all of us would have much preferred a deal that prohibits \nIran from enriching any uranium forever and maintains sanctions until \nIran changes its behavior and becomes a responsible member of the world \ncommunity. But that deal didn't happen--because it never could have \nhappened.\n  This deal greatly improves the outlook for peace by blocking all of \nIran's paths to a nuclear weapon, and this is carefully spelled out in \nthe agreement itself, often in very technical language: Iran's \nstockpiles of rich uranium will be reduced from enough for 10 bombs to \nless than 1; the number of Iran's installed centrifuges is reduced by \nover two-thirds; and far from trusting Iran, the deal demands the most \nrobust, intrusive inspections regime ever in an international \nagreement.\n  We heard yesterday, many of us, from the ambassadors from five of our \nallies in the P5+1. These ambassadors said if the United States walks \naway, the deal collapses. Iran would be without any constraints to move \nahead with its nuclear weapons program. All paths would be open. There \nwould be no inspections whatsoever, no insight into Iran's activities. \nThe ability of the United States to build meaningful international \ncoalitions would be eroded for the foreseeable future.\n  I view this upcoming vote on Iran as one of the most important of my \ncareer, and, my colleagues, I would say that is true for everyone. It \nis one of the most important of my life. For me, the choice is clear: \ndiplomacy over war.\n  Colleagues, let's remember, nothing is off the table. But why \nwouldn't we choose peace and give peace a chance?\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Part of diplomacy is making certain that you have verification, and \nour problem here is that the Iranians are boasting right now that the \nU.S. is not going to have access--or any other international inspectors \nare going to have access--to their military sites where they do this \nwork. The problem is that inspectors don't get 24 hours' notice; they \nget 24 days' notice, and then they go through a process in which Iran \nand China and Russia can block.\n  The former head of the CIA Michael Hayden testified in front of the \nForeign Affairs Committee that we never believed that the uranium at \nIran's declared facilities would ever make its way into a weapon. We \nalways believed that that work would be done somewhere else, in secret.\n  So again, if you cannot get international inspectors into Parchin \nwhere they did that work, what makes you think, what makes us believe, \nthat in the future we are going to have international inspectors, once \nthat is the established premise, go anywhere else, go anywhere else?\n  As Hayden said, requiring consultations between the world powers in \nIran takes inspections from the technical level and puts it at the \npolitical level, which he calls a formula for chaos, obfuscation, \nambiguity, and doubt.\n  And we do not even know how bad the capitulation was in the site \nagreements, a capitulation that will undermine the ability to catch \nIranian cheating. That is why we are concerned about the way this was \nnegotiated.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. \nPompeo), the author of H. Res. 411.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Thank you, Chairman Royce. A great deal about what we \nhave learned has come out of your committee, about what we have learned \nabout this deal and what the Iranians' objectives are. So thank you for \nall the hard work that the Foreign Affairs Committee has done related \nto this agreement.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are lots of things to say about the Iranian deal \nthat this President has set up, but this bill is very narrow and very \nsimple and very straightforward. It is aimed to establish a simple \nprecedent, which says, if the President signs something into law, he is \ngoing to fulfill the obligation which he has made for himself.\n  I have listened to the debate so far today. I can tell you that we \nhave not had any Member of this House stand up and tell you that they \nhave read the entire agreement. I suspect that we will not. That is \nbecause there is no American who has read the entire agreement. That is \nright--not the President of the United States, not the Secretary of \nState, not Undersecretary Sherman. No Member of Congress, no member of \nthe public, no American citizen has read this entire agreement. And yet \nwe have got Members who say: This a great deal, and I am excited to \nvote for it.\n  I don't know how one can feel that way about an agreement that one \nhas not read.\n  We have Members of Congress stand up and demand that they see the \ntext of bills that rename post offices, and yet this is a historic \nagreement, and many of my colleagues are saying they are going to vote \nfor it without even knowing what the details are about important \ncomponents of how we are going to verify whether the Iranian regime has \ncomplied with this agreement. I think that is deeply troubling.\n  I think, as Representatives, we have a moral obligation to understand \nwhat it is we are voting on. I think we have a constitutional duty to \nrequire that the President comply with his obligations, and I know \nthere is a legal obligation for the President to turn over every \nelement of this deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, in July, Senator Cotton and I traveled to Vienna, where \nwe were informed by the Deputy Director of the IAEA of these two secret \nside deals. He looked us straight in the eye and said he had read them \nbut I wasn't going to get to.\n  I think that is wrong. I think that makes it impossible for a Member \nof Congress to support this agreement.\n  He informed me--that is, the Deputy Director of the IAEA informed \nme--that Iranians had read these two secret side deals, but Senator \nCotton and I weren't going to get to read them.\n  I have spent the intervening 50 days asking, cajoling, demanding, \npraying that this President would do what he is required to do under \nCorker-Cardin and what every Member of Congress is entitled to have--\nthat is, provide us with the deal. Well, we don't have that.\n  H. Res. 411 simply says we, as Members of Congress, are going to \ndemand that this President comply with what Corker-Cardin sets out. \nShow us the terms of the deal. Allow us the opportunity to read the \nagreement so that we can form judgments and the American people can \nform judgments about its scope.\n  In the absence of that, H. Res. 411 makes clear that the President \ncan't lift sanctions. That was the deal. In exchange for not demanding \nthat this be a treaty, Corker-Cardin said what we want is simple \ntransparency; just show us the simple terms of the deal. And this \nPresident couldn't do it.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to vote for H. Res. 411 and demand that \nthe President show us the secret side deals.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Becerra), the chairman of the House \nDemocratic Caucus.\n  Mr. BECERRA. I thank the ranking member, Mr. Schiff, for yielding the \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, the goal of America and the international community in \nour negotiations with Iran is and has been to prevent Iran from \nproducing and possessing nuclear weapons. By all accounts, Iran had \nalready reached a point where it was perhaps just months away from \ncrossing that nuclear threshold--I repeat, months away; not years, not \ndecades--months away.\n  So few votes can be taken more seriously than one intended to halt \nthe spread of nuclear weapons. That is why\n\n[[Page H5898]]\n\nthis Congress and the American people should support the agreement \nnegotiated to prevent Iran from producing and possessing nuclear \nweapons, and we should vote here in this Congress against any of these \ncongressional measures attempting to thwart its implementation.\n  The negotiated agreement provides for inspection and verification, a \nregime which Iran had to consent to and it must now submit to. That \nregime for inspection and verification is not just credible, it is \nenforceable, and those who have conducted nuclear inspections will tell \nyou that. Ask those who deal with nuclear materials, and they will tell \nyou that. And ask those who have butted heads with and had to negotiate \nwith Iran, and they will tell you that.\n  Our ability to respond as well, should Iran decide to regress from \nits obligations, is real and it is robust. Nothing in this negotiated \nagreement is based on trust. The inspections, the penalties, they all \nare mandatory and unambiguous in their terms.\n  No deal is perfect. We can all think of ways of making a deal better. \nBut thinking is not doing, and speculation won't stop Iran from \nreaching a nuclear weapons capability.\n  It should escape no one's notice that every measure, every economic \nsanction in place today against Iran has failed to stop Iran's lurch \ntowards a nuclear weapon--remember, perhaps only months away from that \nnuclear threshold.\n\n  It was time for America and our international partners to take this \nto another level before the only alternative available to all of us was \nthe use of military force. This is why the U.S., Great Britain, \nGermany, France, Russia, and China joined together to force and drive \nIran to the negotiated agreement.\n  How often, these days, can we utter the names of those six countries \ntogether working for the same cause?\n  This agreement constitutes a meaningful and enforceable check on \nIran's nuclear ambitions and any intentions it might have to cheat.\n  Back in July when this agreement was reached, I stated that it ``must \nconstitute measurable progress in halting nuclear proliferation, \ndriving the region and the world further away from nuclear \nArmageddon.''\n  The negotiated agreement meets that test, and with the support of \nGreat Britain, Germany, France, yes, even Russia, and, yes, even China, \nwe will hold Iran to that test. And that is why we should support the \nnegotiated agreement.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Mimi Walters).\n  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in firm \nopposition to the Iran nuclear deal. This deal represents a direct \nthreat to the United States, Israel, and the world.\n  Recently, I visited Israel and met with Prime Minister Netanyahu. \nPrime Minister Netanyahu was firm in his warning--this is a very bad \ndeal, and it could result in grave consequences for the world.\n  First, this deal allows Iran to continue to enrich uranium that can \nbe used to develop a nuclear weapon.\n  Second, this deal abandons the President's promise of anytime, \nanywhere inspections to a process that allows Iran to delay up to 24 \ndays.\n  Third, this agreement would result in the comprehensive lifting of \nthe economic sanctions that have stifled Iran's quest for a nuclear \nweapon.\n  Bottom line, this deal presents far too many risks for the U.S. and \nfar too many rewards for Iran. When the Ayatollah chants ``death to \nAmerica,'' he means it, and that should cause serious concern in every \nAmerican citizen.\n  It is time for America to wake up and understand the danger and \nthreat this deal presents to our national security.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  First, I want to address briefly the very strained interpretation I \nthink my friends are giving the Corker legislation. To accept the \narguments of the opposition to the deal, you would have to accept the \nproposition that the Corker legislation requires the administration to \nprovide an agreement between the IAEA and Iran to which the United \nStates is not a party, to which the United States has no obligation, \nand of which the IAEA is precluded from providing to the \nadministration. That seems to me a very farfetched interpretation of \nthe Corker legislation.\n  What's more, if you accept the argument that we can't have a vote on \nthe agreement until we have this document between the IAEA and Iran, \nthen why has the majority scheduled a vote on the agreement for \ntomorrow? So it is inconsistent with what their own majority has \nscheduled.\n  But finally, I don't think anyone is fooled by the nature of this \nprocedural motion or bill. No one expects, in the least, that anyone \nwho has voiced their opposition to the agreement is somehow going to \nchange their opinion if they have access to this private document \nbetween the IAEA and Iran. What's more, as we know, the IAEA enters \ninto these agreements with individual nations around the world, so this \nis not at all unique to the situation with Iran.\n  One final point I would like to make: We are now well into the debate \non the agreement, and for all the arguments that have been advanced as \nto why we should have concerns about provisions in the agreement or \nconcerns about Iranian behavior, many of which I share, there is one \nthing we have heard precious little about from the opposition to the \ndeal, and that is, what is the credible alternative?\n  So, I ask the question: What is the credible alternative?\n  And the answer, from what I am able to divine from the scarce \nattention that the opposition pays to this----\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk). The time of the gentleman \nhas expired.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. I yield myself an additional minute.\n  The answer, as far as I can discern from the opposition to the deal, \nis this: This is how the alternative would work.\n  Congress rejects the deal. Congress, the administration, then, \nsomehow goes out and persuades the rest of the world to maintain \nsanctions, even when we rejected an agreement adopted by the other \nmajor powers, and even when those other powers tell us explicitly that \nthere will be no new negotiations. But somehow we maintain the \nsanctions regime under this theoretical alternative.\n  And what? Iran gives up all enrichment and comes back to the table \nprepared to capitulate everything?\n  That seems so fanciful, so far removed from the reality of the \nsituation, that it is no surprise that the opposition devotes very \nlittle, if any, time to discussing a credible alternative, because, \nindeed, there is no credible alternative.\n  So, again, this is why I think it is so important for us to focus on \nhow we can strengthen the constraints in the agreement, mitigate the \nrisks that we will face, and that is a much more constructive path \nforward than rejection of this, seeing Iran going back to spinning up \nits centrifuges, picking up where they left off at 20 percent \nenrichment and going beyond, picking up where they left off with 19,000 \nmore centrifuges and thousands of kilos of uranium.\n  Is that really the path we want to go down? I think not.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  There was a credible alternative. There was a credible alternative \nthat this body passed by a vote of 400-20, bipartisan legislation which \nthe administration blocked in the Senate, legislation which would have \nput that additional pressure on the regime in Iran.\n  Knowing that the United States is the 800-pound gorilla, knowing that \ncountries do not have the option and companies around the world do not \nhave the option of making a choice when they have to make that choice \nbetween doing business with the United States or doing business with \nIran, they have to do business with the United States.\n  We have put that bill into the Senate. The administration blocked it. \nThat legislation would have ensured the type of pressure on Iran that \nwould have forced the Ayatollah to make a choice between real \ncompromise--real compromise--on his plan to construct a weapon or \neconomic collapse for that regime.\n  We would have had that leverage in this negotiation. That leverage \nwas\n\n[[Page H5899]]\n\ngiven up by this administration by blocking that bill in the Senate in \nthe last Congress. And, frankly, that option is still available to us.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is September 11, a solemn day in our history \nwhen thousands of Americans lost their lives in the worst terror attack \nin our history.\n  It is disturbing that we happen to be debating whether a state \nsponsor of terror should have a glide path to nuclear weapons at this \ntime. But we are.\n  I have been a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee for a long \ntime, almost 20 years now. I chaired the Subcommittee on the Middle \nEast and North Africa.\n  I can tell you without any reservation that this deal with Iran is a \ndisaster. It will weaken the security of our allies in the region, and \nit will make Americans less safe here at home.\n  If this deal goes through, Iran will receive up to $150 billion. That \nis 25 times what Iran currently spends on its entire military. Does \nthat seem like a good idea?\n  We are talking about the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism \nhere. This money will fund more and more terror across the globe and \nhere.\n  My district is the greater Cincinnati area. GE aircraft engines is \nheadquartered there. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is just up the \nroad. They have been top potential targets for ICBMs, intercontinental \nballistic missiles, since the cold war.\n  This deal allows Iran to get more sophisticated ICBM technology from \nRussia, which will allow them to target not only Tel Aviv, but \nWashington and New York and Cincinnati. This is just nuts.\n  What happened to the ``anytime, anywhere'' inspections? Gone. It will \ntake months to get the inspectors in. And, by that time, they will have \nmoved the incriminating evidence elsewhere.\n  The bottom line is the Obama administration wanted a deal, any deal, \nmore than the Iranian mullahs did. This administration was willing to \nsell out Israel and our allies in the region and make us less safe here \nat home.\n  This is a lousy, lousy deal, and it ought to be rejected.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume \njust to take a brief moment to respond to my colleague from California.\n  I wish it were so simple that a credible alternative was the passage \nof a bill in Congress that had not passed before that we could pass now \nand, through the mere act of our legislation, compel the rest of the \nworld to join us in a new negotiation and a stronger round of \nsanctions. We simply don't have that power to coerce the rest of the \nworld with a bill we pass here in Congress.\n  What is more, to imagine that a new sanctions bill will somehow force \nIran to come back to the table ready to concede its entire enrichment \nprogram is simply not credible. If that is what we are left with, we \nare really left with no really good alternative.\n  Again, I think that is precisely why we need to move forward with the \nagreement that has been reached between the world powers and Iran.\n  At this point, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, the Iran nuclear agreement is fundamental \nto the national security of the United States.\n  I applaud the tremendous efforts of Secretary Kerry and Secretary \nMoniz, who worked in concert with the world's most powerful military \nand economic nations to reach a verifiable agreement that will deny the \nability of Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.\n  In a past era, when politics was civil and foreign policy was \nbipartisan, this diplomatic agreement would have been championed by \nRepublicans and Democrats as a nonproliferation triumph, as it is today \nin Great Britain, our greatest ally. This agreement will prevent Iran \nfrom developing a nuclear weapon.\n  As an Israeli intelligence analyst has said, ``This is not about \ntrust and goodwill between sides. It is the strict inspection and \nverification regimes that will ensure the success of the agreement.''\n  And if Iran violates the agreement, sanctions will ``snap back'' and \nthe international community together will take action.\n  I strongly support this agreement, and I am grateful for President \nObama's unwavering leadership in the face of hostile and unprecedented \nattacks from Republicans and Israel's Prime Minister.\n  The New York Times calls the Republican efforts a ``vicious battle \nagainst Mr. Obama'' and an ``unseemly spectacle of lawmakers siding \nwith a foreign leader against their own Commander in Chief.''\n  I want to be crystal clear: I support our Commander in Chief.\n  The Republicans and Israeli opponents of this agreement are the same \nneocons who sold the war in Iraq to America based on lies, distortions, \nand misinformation.\n  And now what do the Republicans offer as an alternative? Nothing. \nThey have no plan, no plan other than to kill this agreement, which \nmeans that Iran will either obtain a nuclear weapon or the U.S. goes to \nwar to stop them. Well, let me tell you: I am not interested in another \nRepublican war in the Middle East.\n  Now is the time to put the national security of the American people \nfirst. Let's reject this Republican game playing and support a tough \ndiplomatic agreement that will stop Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice strong opposition to this fatally \nflawed Iran deal.\n  By signing the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, the \nPresident agreed to allow all documents, secret annexes, and side deals \nto be reviewed by the U.S. Congress.\n  But, once again, President Obama has not complied with the law of the \nland and, therefore, does not have the authority to waive sanctions on \nIran.\n\n  By lifting sanctions on the Iranian regime, a nation that finances \nthe likes of Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist groups will receive \nover $100 billion in assets and no doubt will continue to fund \nterrorist organizations at probably greater levels than they are able \nto do today, those terrorist organizations with the motto ``death to \nAmerica.''\n  Have we learned nothing from our past mistakes? The same person that \nnegotiated the deal with North Korea also led the discussions with \nIran.\n  We must ask ourselves, Is the world a safer place when unstable \nnations like North Korea are testing nuclear weapons?\n  The number one responsibility of the United States Congress charged \nto us in the Constitution is national security.\n  This agreement jeopardizes our security because I believe, as the \nPrime Minister of Israel believes, that this will ensure that Iran will \nget a nuclear weapon.\n  For the security of America and our friends and allies around the \nworld, we must oppose this agreement.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished minority \nleader.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \ncommend him for his extraordinary leadership as the ranking member on \nthe Intelligence Committee, which has served us so well.\n  His leadership has served us so well in this debate today and in our \ndeliberations leading up to this debate. It has served us well in the \nongoing as we use intelligence to protect the American people. So I \nthank the gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff).\n  I did not go to the well as usual for the leader, but I wanted to be \nhere because I have some materials that I want to share with you, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think today and tomorrow, the next 24 hours, is a \nvery, very special time in the Congress of the United States. Members \nwill be called upon to make a decision that affects our oath of office, \nto protect and support the Constitution and, of course, the American \npeople.\n  This is a moment that we are prepared for. That is what I have this\n\n[[Page H5900]]\n\nbinder here for, to say I commend my colleagues because they have spent \nthousands of hours reviewing the agreement, reviewing the annexes and \nthe classified materials, speaking with experts, gaining information, \nacquiring validation from outside sources other than the administration \nand the agreement itself, conversations with each other, conversations \nwith their constituents, all to have, again, a sense of humility that \nwe all don't know everything about this subject.\n  And we have to get our assurances from those whose judgment we \nrespect, as well as to support this agreement on the merits. It is a \nvery fine agreement.\n  I will take a moment just to talk about my own credentials because I \nsee that people are doing that in their statements. I read with \ninterest Senator Menendez' statement where he talks about his service \nin the Senate, and I will talk about mine in the House.\n  For over 20 years, I have served as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee both as a member of the committee, as the top Democrat on the \ncommittee, and as the Speaker and leader ex officio over the years, \nlonger than anyone in the history of the Congress.\n  I went to the Intelligence Committee because I had a major concern \nwhich sprang from my district, which was a very big interest there in \nstopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Plowshares, an organization dedicated to that purpose, was founded \nthere. They saluted President Reagan and the actions that he took when \nhe was President. And they are very actively supporting this agreement \nnow.\n  But I mentioned my credentials because I brought that experience to \nmake a judgment on the agreement after it was negotiated.\n  Of course we were briefed, as members of the committee and members of \nthe leadership, on the ongoing as to the progress that was being made \nin negotiations.\n  Again, having been briefed all along the way, I still was pleasantly \npleased to see what the final product was. What the President \nnegotiated was remarkable. It was remarkable in several respects.\n  One was that the P5, the permanent members of the Security Council, \nplus one--that would be Germany--the P5 nations negotiated this \nagreement with Iran: China, Russia, France, the U.K., the United \nStates.\n  This is quite remarkable, that all of those countries could come to \nagreement. And an important part of that leadership was the leadership \nof President Obama to have that engagement sustained over a couple-year \nperiod.\n  Now, President Bush took us a bit down this path, and that is \nreferenced in an op-ed that was put forth by Brent Scowcroft.\n  When he supported this legislation, he says that ``The deal ensures \nthat this will be the case for at least 15 years and likely longer.''\n  But he talks about the fact that this has been a goal, as what Ronald \nReagan did with the Soviet Union arms control and what President Nixon \ndid with China. It was a negotiation.\n  And he talked about the fact that this particular agreement was one \nthat was worked on under the presidency of President Bush. Actually, he \nplaces it in time.\n  So let me read his comment:\n  ``Congress again faces a momentous decision regarding U.S. policy \ntoward the Middle East. The forthcoming vote on the nuclear deal \nbetween the P5+1 and Iran (known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction, or JCPOA) will show the world whether the United States has the \nwill and sense of responsibility to help stabilize the Middle East, or \nwhether it will contribute to further turmoil, including the possible \nspread of nuclear weapons. Strong words perhaps, but clear language is \nhelpful in the cacophony of today's media.\n  ``In my view, the JCPOA''--as it is known--``meets the key objective, \nshared by recent administrations of both parties, that Iran limit \nitself to a strictly civilian nuclear program with unprecedented \nverification and monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency \nand the U.N. Security Council.''\n  He goes on for a couple of pages.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will submit for the Record Brent Scowcroft's \nstatement.\n\n              [From the Washington Post, August 23, 2015]\n\n   The Iran Deal: An Epochal Moment That Congress Shouldn't Squander\n\n                          (By Brent Scowcroft)\n\n       Congress again faces a momentous decision regarding U.S. \n     policy toward the Middle East. The forthcoming vote on the \n     nuclear deal between the P5+1 and Iran (known as the Joint \n     Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA) will show the world \n     whether the United States has the will and sense of \n     responsibility to help stabilize the Middle East, or whether \n     it will contribute to further turmoil, including the possible \n     spread of nuclear weapons. (Strong words perhaps, but clear \n     language is helpful in the cacophony of today's media)\n       In my view, the JCPOA meets the key objective, shared by \n     recent administrations of both parties, that Iran limit \n     itself to a strictly civilian nuclear program with \n     unprecedented verification and monitoring by the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency and the U.N. Security \n     Council. Iran has committed to never developing or acquiring \n     a nuclear weapon; the deal ensures that this will be the case \n     for at least 15 years and likely longer, unless Iran \n     repudiates the inspection regime and its commitments under \n     the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and \n     Additional Protocol.\n       There is no more credible expert on nuclear weapons than \n     Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, who led the technical \n     negotiating team. When he asserts that the JCPOA blocks each \n     of Iran's pathways to the fissile material necessary to make \n     a nuclear weapon, responsible people listen. Twenty-nine \n     eminent U.S. nuclear scientists have endorsed Moniz's \n     assertions.\n       If the United States could have handed Iran a ``take it or \n     leave it'' agreement, the terms doubtless would have been \n     more onerous on Iran. But negotiated agreements, the only \n     ones that get signed in times of peace, are compromises by \n     definition. It is what President Reagan did with the Soviet \n     Union on arms control; it is what President Nixon did with \n     China.\n       And as was the case with specific agreements with the \n     Soviet Union and China, we will continue to have significant \n     differences with Iran on important issues, including human \n     rights, support for terrorist groups and meddling in the \n     internal affairs of neighbors. We must never tire of working \n     to persuade Iran to change its behavior on these issues, and \n     countering it where necessary. And while I believe the JCPOA, \n     if implemented scrupulously by Iran, will help engage Tehran \n     constructively on regional issues, we must always remember \n     that its sole purpose is to halt the country's nuclear \n     weapons activities.\n       Israel's security, an abiding U.S. concern, will be \n     enhanced by the full implementation of the nuclear deal. Iran \n     is fully implementing the interim agreement that has placed \n     strict limits on its nuclear program since January 2014 while \n     the final agreement was being negotiated. If Iran \n     demonstrates the same resolve under the JCPOA, the world will \n     be a much safer place. And if it does not, we will know in \n     time to react appropriately.\n       Let us not forget that Israel is the only country in the \n     Middle East with overwhelming retaliatory capability. I have \n     no doubt that Iran's leaders are well aware of Israel's \n     military capabilities. Similarly, the Gulf Cooperation \n     Council (GCC) members have impressive conventional \n     militaries, and the United States is committed to enhancing \n     their capabilities.\n       Congress rightfully is conducting a full review and hearing \n     from proponents and opponents of the nuclear deal. However, \n     the seeming effort to make the JCPOA the ultimate test of \n     Congress's commitment to Israel is probably unprecedented in \n     the annals of relations between two vibrant democracies. Let \n     us be clear: There is no credible alternative were Congress \n     to prevent U.S. participation in the nuclear deal. If we walk \n     away, we walk away alone. The world's leading powers worked \n     together effectively because of U.S. leadership. To turn our \n     back on this accomplishment would be an abdication of the \n     United States' unique role and responsibility, incurring \n     justified dismay among our allies and friends. We would lose \n     all leverage over Iran's nuclear activities. The \n     international sanctions regime would dissolve. And no member \n     of Congress should be under the illusion that another U.S. \n     invasion of the Middle East would be helpful.\n       So I urge strongly that Congress support this agreement. \n     But there is more that Congress should do. Implementation and \n     verification will be the key to success, and Congress has an \n     important role. It should ensure that the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency, other relevant bodies and U.S. \n     intelligence agencies have all the resources necessary to \n     facilitate inspection and monitor compliance. Congress should \n     ensure that military assistance, ballistic missile defense \n     and training commitments that the United States made to GCC \n     leaders at Camp David in May are fully funded and implemented \n     without delay. And it should ensure that the United States \n     works closely with the GCC and other allies to moderate \n     Iranian behavior in the region, countering it where \n     necessary.\n       My generation is on the sidelines of policymaking now; this \n     is a natural development. But decades of experience strongly \n     suggest that there are epochal moments that should not be \n     squandered. President Nixon realized it with China. \n     Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush realized it with the \n     Soviet Union. And I believe we face it with Iran today.\n\n[[Page H5901]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Ms. PELOSI. I also want to quote another Republican--Brent Scowcroft \nserved in the administration of President George Herbert Walker Bush--\nSenator John Warner joined Senator Carl Levin. These are two chairmen \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee--one a Democrat, but before him, \na Republican, John Warner. They talk about they support this. They say:\n\n       The deal on the table is a strong agreement on many counts, \n     and it leaves in place the robust deterrence and credibility \n     of a military option. We urge our former colleagues not to \n     take any action which would undermine the deterrent value of \n     a coalition that participates in and could support the use of \n     a military option. The failure of the United States to join \n     the agreement would have that effect.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I submit Carl Levin and John Warner's statement for the \nRecord.\n\n                Why Hawks Should Also Back the Iran Deal\n\n                    (By Carl Levin and John Warner)\n\n       We both were elected to the Senate in 1978 and privileged \n     to have served together on the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee for 30 years, during which we each held committee \n     leadership positions of chairman or ranking minority member. \n     We support the Iran Agreement negotiated by the United States \n     and other leading world powers for many reasons, including \n     its limitations on Iran's nuclear activities, its strong \n     inspections regime, and the ability to quickly re-impose \n     sanctions should Iran violate its provisions.\n       But we also see a compelling reason to support the \n     agreement that has gotten little attention: Rejecting it \n     would weaken the deterrent value of America's military \n     option.\n       As former chairmen of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \n     we have always believed that the U.S. should keep a strong \n     military option on the table. If Iran pursues a nuclear \n     weapon, some believe that military action is inevitable if \n     we're to prevent it from reaching its goal. We don't \n     subscribe to that notion, but we are skeptical that, should \n     Iran attempt to consider moving to a nuclear weapon, we could \n     deter them from pursuing it through economic sanctions alone.\n       How does rejecting the agreement give America a weaker \n     military hand to play? Let's imagine a world in which the \n     United States rejects the nuclear accord that all other \n     parties have embraced. The sanctions now in place would \n     likely not be maintained and enforced by all the parties to \n     the agreement, so those would lose their strong deterrent \n     value. Iran would effectively argue to the world that it had \n     been willing to negotiate an agreement, only to have that \n     agreement rejected by a recalcitrant America.\n       In that world, should we find credible evidence that Iran \n     is starting to move toward a nuclear weapon, the United \n     States would almost certainly consider use of the military \n     option to stop that program. But it's highly unlikely that \n     our traditional European allies, let alone China and Russia, \n     would support the use of the military option since we had \n     undermined the diplomatic path. Iran surely would know this, \n     and so from the start, would have less fear of a military \n     option than if it faced a unified coalition.\n       While the United States would certainly provide the \n     greatest combat power in any military action, allies and \n     other partners make valuable contributions--not just in \n     direct participation, but also in access rights, logistics, \n     intelligence, and other critical support. If we reject the \n     agreement, we risk isolating ourselves and damaging our \n     ability to assemble the strongest possible coalition to stop \n     Iran.\n       In short, then, rejecting the Iran deal would erode the \n     current deterrent value of the military option, making it \n     more likely Iran might choose to pursue a nuclear weapon, and \n     would then make it more costly for the U.S. to mount any \n     subsequent military operation. It would tie the hands of any \n     future president trying to build international participation \n     and support for military force against Iran should that be \n     necessary.\n       Those who think the use of force against Iran is almost \n     inevitable should want the military option to be as credible \n     and effective as possible, both as a deterrent to Iran's \n     nuclear ambitions and in destroying Iran's nuclear weapons \n     program should that become necessary. For that to be the \n     case, the United States needs to be a party to the agreement \n     rather than being the cause of its collapse.\n       In our many years on the Armed Services Committee, we saw \n     time and again how America is stronger when we fight \n     alongside allies. Iran must constantly be kept aware that a \n     collective framework of deterrence stands resolute, and that \n     if credible evidence evolves that Iran is taking steps \n     towards a nuclear arsenal, it would face the real possibility \n     of military action by a unified coalition of nations to stop \n     their efforts.\n       The deal on the table is a strong agreement on many counts, \n     and it leaves in place the robust deterrence and credibility \n     of a military option. We urge our former colleagues not to \n     take any action which would undermine the deterrent value of \n     a coalition that participates in and could support the use of \n     a military option. The failure of the United States to join \n     the agreement would have that effect.\n\n  Ms. PELOSI. Again, I refer to the statements of my colleagues. They \nare thoughtful; they are serious, and they are courageous in support of \nthe agreement.\n  I would like to thank President Obama and the entire administration \nfor being available as Members sought clarification to respond to their \nconcerns. I want to thank the President, Secretary Kerry, Secretary \nMoniz, Secretary Lew, and so many others for their leadership and \navailability to us in a bipartisan way in our Democratic Caucus.\n  For years, Iran's rapidly accelerating enrichment capability and \nburgeoning nuclear stockpile has represented one of the greatest \nthreats to peace and security anywhere in the world. We all stipulate \nto that. That is why we need an agreement.\n  That is why I am so pleased that we have so many statements of \nvalidation from people. The experts say:\n\n       This agreement is one of the greatest diplomatic \n     achievements of the 21st century.\n\n  It is no wonder that such a diverse and extraordinary constellation \nof experts have made their voices heard in support of this--again, I \nuse the word--``extraordinary'' accord.\n  On the steps of the Capitol the other day with our veterans and with \nour Gold Star moms who have lost their sons, we heard the words of \ndiplomats and soldiers, generals and admirals and diplomats by the \nscore--Democrats, Republicans, and nonpartisan.\n  We heard from our most distinguished nuclear physicists; we heard \nfrom those scientists, and we heard from people of faith. I would like \nto quote some of them. More than 100 Democratic and Republican former \ndiplomats and ambassadors wrote:\n\n       In our judgment, the JCPOA deserves congressional support \n     and the opportunity to show that it can work. We firmly \n     believe that the most effective way to protect U.S. national \n     security and that of our allies and friends is to ensure that \n     tough-minded diplomacy has a chance to succeed before \n     considering other more risky alternatives.\n\n  That is the diplomats.\n  The generals and admirals wrote:\n\n       There is no better option to prevent an Iranian nuclear \n     weapon. If the Iranians cheat, our advanced technology, \n     intelligence, and the inspections will reveal it, and U.S. \n     military options remain on the table. And if the deal is \n     rejected by America, the Iranians could have a nuclear weapon \n     within a year. The choice is that stark.\n\n  Twenty-nine of our Nation's most prominent nuclear scientists and \nengineers wrote:\n\n       We consider that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action the \n     United States and its partners negotiated with Iran will \n     advance the cause of peace and security in the Middle East \n     and can serve as a guidepost for future nonproliferation \n     agreements.\n\n  I quote ``and can serve as a guidepost for future nonproliferation \nagreements.''\n\n       This is an innovative agreement, with much more stringent \n     constraints than any previously negotiated nonproliferation \n     framework.\n\n  They went on to say more.\n  Mr. Speaker, 440 rabbis urged Congress to endorse the statement, \nwriting:\n\n       The Obama administration has successfully brought together \n     the major international powers to confront Iran over its \n     nuclear ambitions. The broad international sanctions move \n     Iran to enter this historic agreement.\n\n  They urge support.\n  Mr. Speaker, 4,100 Catholic nuns wrote to Congress stating:\n\n       As women of faith, followers of the one who said, ``Blessed \n     are the peacemakers,'' we urge that you risk on the side of \n     peace and vote to approve the Iran nuclear deal.\n\n  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warned of the hazards of rejecting the \nagreement, reminding us that foreign governments will not continue to \nmake costly sacrifices at our demand. I say this in response to \nsomething that my distinguished colleague from California said:\n\n       Indeed, they would be more likely to blame us for walking \n     away from a credible solution to one of the world's greatest \n     security threats and would continue to reengage with Iran.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Instead of toughening the sanctions, the decision by \n     Congress to unilaterally reject the deal will end a decade of \n     isolation of Iran and put the United States at odds with the \n     rest of the world.\n\n  We certainly don't want to do that.\n  Today, something very interesting happened, Mr. Speaker. It was a \nstatement put forth by U.K. Prime Minister\n\n[[Page H5902]]\n\nDavid Cameron, French President Francois Hollande, and German \nChancellor Angela Merkel. They wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post \nand said:\n\n       This is an important moment. It is a crucial opportunity at \n     a time of heightened global uncertainty to show what \n     diplomacy can achieve.\n\n  This is not an agreement based on trust or any assumption about how \nIran may look in 10 or 15 years. It is based on detailed, tightly \nwritten controls that are verifiable and long-lasting.\n  They went on to say:\n\n       We condemn in no uncertain terms that Iran does not \n     recognize the existence of the State of Israel and the \n     unacceptable language that Iran's leaders use about Israel. \n     Israel's security matters are and will remain our key \n     interests, too. We would not have reached the nuclear deal \n     with Iran if we did not think that it removed a threat to the \n     region and the nonproliferation regime as a whole.\n       We are confident that the agreement provides the foundation \n     for resolving a conflict on Iran's nuclear program \n     permanently. This is why we now want to embark on the full \n     implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, \n     once all national procedures are complete.\n\n  Our own President wrote to Congressman Jerry Nadler:\n\n       I believe that JCPOA, which cuts off every pathway Iran \n     could have to a nuclear weapon and creates the must robust \n     verification regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear \n     program, is a very good deal for the United States, for the \n     State of Israel, and for the region as a whole.\n\n  Many of us share the views that had been expressed by those in a \nposition to make a difference on this agreement.\n  Tuesday night, again after the votes here in this House, dozens of \nMembers supporting the nuclear agreement stood on the steps of the \nCapitol. We were honored to be joined by military veterans and Gold \nStar families, men and women whose sacrifices remind us of the \nsignificance of putting diplomacy before war. They remind us of the \nsignificance of this historic transformational achievement.\n  Congratulations. These nuclear physicists, they congratulated the \nPresident on this agreement. I congratulate him, too.\n  Our men and women in uniform and our veterans and our Gold Star moms \nremind us of our first duty, to protect and defend the American people. \nI am pleased to say we achieve that with this agreement.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the agreement and to vote ``no'' on \nthe other items that are being put before us today.\n  I think we all have to, as we evaluate our decision, ask ourselves: \nIf we were the one deciding vote as to whether this agreement would go \nforward or that we would fall behind, how would we vote? None of us has \nthe luxury to walk away from that responsibility.\n  I am proud of the statements that our colleagues have made, the \nagreement the President has reached; and I know that tomorrow we will \nsustain whatever veto the President may have to make.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North \nCarolina (Mr. McHenry), the deputy chief whip and a member of the \nFinancial Services Committee.\n  Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on \nthis important matter of national security.\n  Today, I rise in opposition to this bad nuclear deal the President \nhas negotiated. I don't oppose it because the President negotiated it. \nI don't oppose it because it was brought forth by this administration.\n  I oppose it because it is bad for the security of America. It is bad \nfor the security of the world. It is bad for the security of our most \nsacred ally, Israel. It is bad for the nonproliferation strategies the \nworld has had to mean that we have fewer nuclear weapons on this \nplanet.\n  Now, you have to ask yourself a few basic questions: Has Iran \nwarranted the trust of the international community to enter into this \nagreement? The answer is no. It is very clear by their actions over the \nlast 20 and 30 years that they should not be trusted.\n  Number two, we hear the Supreme Leader of Iran saying, time and \nagain, ``death to America and Israel.'' He has declared his nation is \ncommitted to the destruction of Israel. He has called America the Great \nSatan.\n  Now, how can we believe a country is fully committed to our \ndestruction yet, at the same time, uphold their end of the bargain? We \ncan't. We must oppose this agreement based off of what is best for \ninternational security and what is best for our Nation's security.\n  We also have to oppose this because it will mean, during my lifetime \nor during my children's lifetime, we will have more nuclear weapons, \nnot fewer.\n  This is a bad agreement, and we should reject it.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to yield the balance \nof my time and the ability to control the time to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Cummings).\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, since 1998, I have had the privilege of sending a group \nof high school students each year to Israel where they are paired with \nIsraeli teens to learn about what life is really like in Israel.\n  When these students return, they have learned life lessons that stay \nwith them forever, but just as important, they have made friendships \nthat will also last a lifetime.\n  I am a proud and strong friend and ally of Israel, and I have been \nfor a very long time. This is why I believe we must support the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action and why I am here to oppose the \nresolution. The world cannot tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran, and I will \nnot stand by as Iran continues to gain ground towards that objective.\n  This agreement puts real, concrete steps in place to prevent Iran \nfrom obtaining nuclear weapons, steps that have already begun to \ndegrade Iran's ability to produce nuclear material.\n  According to the independent experts, this deal ``effectively blocks \nthe plutonium pathway for more than 15 years.'' These experts also \nassess that, without the deal, Iran may shrink its breakout time to a \nfew weeks or even days.\n  The steps outlined in the agreement complement existing prohibitions \non the development of a nuclear weapon by Iran.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Under this agreement, the international community will have \nunprecedented access to ensure that Iran never gets one.\n  This agreement will not be monitored merely according to the goodwill \nof Iran. Its enforcement mechanisms are verifiable and transparent.\n  Under this agreement, there will be more inspectors than ever in \nIran. These inspectors will have daily access to Iran's declared \nnuclear sites and will be able to have access to undeclared sites that \nthey suspect may be involved in nuclear activity. Inspections will be \nregular, and they will be invasive. They will not be oriented around \nIranian convenience but, rather, around compliance, ensuring that the \ninternational community remains safe and, indeed, informed.\n  If at any time Iran is found to be in violation of the agreement, the \nfull brunt of international sanctions will snap back, once again \nhobbling the Iranian economy.\n  It is important to note that many sanctions will still be in place. \nRelief will come only from those sanctions related to nuclear \nactivities. Bans on technology exports, restrictions against the \ntransfer of conventional weaponry and WMD technology, sanctions based \non terrorism activities, and bans on foreign assistance will all \ncontinue.\n  Without this deal, experts estimate that Iran will have enough \nnuclear material for weapons in 2 or 3 months. During negotiations, \nIran stopped installing centrifuges, but they will resume if this \nagreement falls apart, potentially accelerating that timeline.\n  The opponents of this agreement propose rejecting this deal and \npursuing a stronger one, but that plan could have grave consequences. \nIf the United States rejects this deal, Iran will continue developing \nmore sophisticated enrichment technologies. By the time any new \nnegotiations begin, Iran would likely already be a nuclear state. There \nis also no guarantee that Iran would return to the negotiating table \nafter having wasted 2 years on this agreement.\n\n[[Page H5903]]\n\n  Is this worth the risk? I do not believe that it is. We should \nsupport this agreement.\n  This agreement accomplishes a critical goal: establishing a set of \nverifiable provisions to prevent Iran from developing enough nuclear \nmaterial to build a bomb.\n  This deal does not change, in any way, our solemn commitment to \nprotecting Israel, nor does this prevent us from using any other \nmeasures if Iran should violate this agreement, including using the \nfull force of the strongest military in the world.\n  But the United States must lead not only with our military might; we \nhave worked diligently to achieve a peaceful resolution to this issue, \nand it is time for us to show our integrity and values for which we \nstand.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Sam Johnson), a true American hero who served this country \nwith distinction in Korea and in Vietnam and as a prisoner of war for \nnearly 7 years.\n  Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, at this grave hour, I come to express my opposition to \nPresident Obama's deal with Iran.\n  To this day, Iran chants ``death to America.'' In fact, Iran is the \nworld's leading state sponsor of terrorism. Its regime has the blood of \nAmerica's servicemembers on its hands.\n  Iran is our enemy.\n  The President asks us to trust Iran; but what has Iran done to earn \nour trust? Nothing. This is a deal of surrender, and, with it, Iran \nwill go nuclear.\n  The alternative isn't war. The alternative is to strike a better \ndeal. I say this as one of the few Members of Congress who has seen \ncombat, who has fought two wars, and who has spent nearly 7 years as a \nPOW.\n  So I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Do the \nright thing. Put country above party. Listen to the American people. \nUphold your most sacred duty--safeguard our Republic from those who \nseek to destroy it. Vote this deal down.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \ngentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).\n  Ms. NORTON. I thank my good friend for yielding to me on this \nimportant subject for our country today and in the foreseeable future.\n  Mr. Speaker, while many Republicans have been trying to find a way, \njust this very day, not to have a vote on the Iran agreement, I have \nbeen searching for a way to represent my 650,000 constituents by voting \non any version offered. Five nations, whose systems differ from one \nanother in every conceivable way, and the United Nations have approved \nthis deal, but the Republicans are torn on whether to even vote on the \ndeal at all.\n  No wonder.\n  Left with no credible argument against the deal, itself, Republicans \nhave changed the subject, even knowing that Iran is close to getting \nthe bomb as I speak and risking the loss of U.S. international \ncredibility. Instead, Republicans cite side agreements. However, they \nhave all of the information available to any nation on all nuclear \nagreements, or they cite issues not under negotiation at all, like \nIran's role in the Middle East.\n  Here is what my constituents cite, Mr. Speaker:\n  $12,000 in Federal taxes per resident--the most per capita in the \nUnited States--but no vote on the Iran deal or on anything else on this \nHouse floor. With statehood, D.C. would vote ``yes'' and be counted \njust as Uncle Sam counts our taxes every single year.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North \nCarolina (Mr. Pittenger), a member of the Committee on Financial \nServices.\n  Mr. PITTENGER. I thank the chairman for yielding this time. I thank \nhim for his strong leadership to reject this administration's agreement \nwith Iran.\n  Mr. Speaker, this deal is a dramatic reversal of U.S. policy in the \nMiddle East and towards the Iranian Government. For years, the Iranian \nGovernment has actively opposed U.S. interests in the region and has \ndirectly financed some of the world's most oppressive terrorist groups, \nmost notably, Hezbollah.\n  As a result of this agreement, over $100 billion will be released \nfrom repatriated oil profits back to the mullahs in Iran, and 46 banks \nin Iran will now be approved to transmit money through the \ninternational financial system. Look at what they have done previously \nwith their finances. We gave them $700 million a month as a \nprecondition just to come to the negotiations--$12 billion over a 16-\nmonth period. You can see their footprint in Lebanon; you can see it in \nIraq; you can see it in Yemen; you can see it in Syria; you can see it \nin South America.\n  Mr. Speaker, what we are doing today is going to translate into \nincreased, enhanced terrorist activities throughout the world. May we \nlook back on this day as one of the most consequential votes we will \ntake tomorrow in this Chamber, as consequential as what we did in \ndeclaring war against Japan and Germany. May we recognize the reality \nof what is taking place.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. DeSaulnier).\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. I thank the gentleman from Maryland, the \ndistinguished ranking member of the committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to speak as a freshman Member of this body who \nhas been able to learn a great deal about this difficult, difficult \narea of the world--a place where America has invested too many lives \nand too much money--and to talk about my journey in coming to the \ndecision to vote with the President and feeling like he deserves a \ncongratulatory note for this accomplishment in a very difficult and \ncomplex piece of diplomacy, perhaps equal to the difficulty and the \ncomplexity of this area of the world which has had so much turmoil and \nhistory.\n  I have spent the last 60 days taking every opportunity to listen to \nconstituents and experts.\n  I, with a small group of my freshman colleagues, have been personally \nbriefed at the White House by President Obama. I traveled to Israel for \nthe first time and met with high-level Israeli officials for almost 2 \nhours, including with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I learned about the \n3,000 years of history and animosity amongst groups and also of the \nvery close proximity in which those groups have lived for thousands of \nyears and shared their difficult history. I met with leaders of our \ninternational coalition, and I continue to be a staunch supporter of \nthe U.S.-Israeli relationship as, I believe, most of my colleagues on \nboth sides are.\n  I held six townhalls--a certain measure of masochism, perhaps, by a \nfreshman Member--that took hours, meeting with both pro and opponents \nin my district, in the San Francisco Bay Area. We received over 1,000 \nphone calls, emails, and constituent questions on this issue, and more \nthan 70 percent of them were in favor of the proposal.\n  Ultimately, at the heart of my decision in supporting a deal is the \npossibility that this deal promotes the long-term investment in peace \non this difficult part of our planet. In addition, it creates security \nand stability, ultimately, for the United States. I believe that this \naccord is our best option for achieving both of those goals.\n  As recently as yesterday, I was able to listen to advisers and \nleaders who represent our coalition partners. The sanctions regime, due \nin large part to the European Union's participation, deflated Iran's \neconomy and forced them to the negotiating table. In 2012, Iran's \neconomy shrank for the first time in two decades by almost 2 percent.\n  This is the final proposal, I believe, if the U.S. were to withdraw. \nOur coalition partners that helped negotiate this deal and create the \nability and the leverage to negotiate will not come back to the table. \nOur authority and standing in the world community will be severely \ndiminished.\n  There are some who say that Iran cannot be trusted, and I think we \nall agree on that. The future of this rollout is not black-and-white, \nand it has many unknowns and hypotheticals on both the supporters' and \nthe opponents' sides. We do not know if Iran will cheat, but we do know \nthat oversight and compliance is strong and consequential, and \nconsequences for cheating will be enforced by the international \ncommunity.\n  In my view, it is in the national security interests of the United \nStates of\n\n[[Page H5904]]\n\nAmerica to support this agreement. It is an opportunity to let \ndiplomacy work and to put it in action.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Guthrie), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee \nand the Education and the Workforce Committee.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disapproval of President \nObama's deal with Iran.\n  I ask myself this question: Has Iran earned the right to be trusted?\n  We must ask this because we know there are secret deals that my \ncolleagues and I were not privileged to. Therefore, a vote to support \nthis deal is a vote to trust Iran.\n  The behavior of Iran's leaders over the last 30 years offers no \nindication that the next decade will be any different; and now, with \nthese secret details, we cannot know if the deal is verifiable, \nenforceable, and accountable.\n  The people who know Iran best trust them the least. Iran's neighbors \nhave already requested additional arms from the United States to \nprotect themselves from this very deal. Any deal should include these \nthree powerful principles: safety, security, stability. This deal falls \nshort, and I cannot support it.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nRhode Island (Mr. Langevin).\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, this has probably been one of the most \ndifficult decisions I have had to make during my time in Congress. For \nthe record, I still have deep reservations about the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action.\n  However, while it is not without flaws or risks, I believe the plan \npresents our best chance to limit Iran's nuclear ambitions and protect \nthe security of the United States and our allies, particularly the \nState of Israel.\n  The preamble to the agreement is both critically important and \ncrystal clear when it states that ``Iran reaffirms that under no \ncircumstances will Iran ever seek, develop, or acquire any nuclear \nweapons.'' And we will hold Iran to it in perpetuity, as they have \ncommitted.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do not trust Iran. But this agreement is built on \nverification, not trust, and I believe that it includes the needed \nmonitoring and enforcement tools.\n  If Iran violates the deal in any way, increased international \nmonitoring will allow us to know quickly and act decisively. \nConversely, if we were to abandon this agreement despite the \ninternational community's support, Iran's nuclear ambitions could go \nunchecked, and that is not a risk I am willing to take.\n  Mr. Speaker, like many of my constituents, I still have significant \nconcerns with the agreement and with Iran's pattern of behavior, \nparticularly its support of terrorism.\n  That is why I am committed to exercising rigorous oversight of this \nplan's implementation, leaving no doubt that cheating will result in \nsevere repercussions.\n  As the President has said publicly and he has reiterated to me \npersonally, all of our options remain on the table when it comes to \nresponding to failed Iranian commitments, including military options \nand the reimposition of sanctions, either in whole or in part, either \nunilaterally or multilaterally.\n  Additionally, all the terrorism-related sanctions are outside the \nscope of this agreement and remain in force, and I am committed to \nproviding any further tools necessary to constrain Iran's destructive \nnonnuclear activities.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress should also establish an oversight commission \nor Select Committee to ensure Iranian adherence to the deal and \nrecommend courses of action in response to any breach of Iranian \ncommitments.\n  This would be in addition to the Oversight Committee related to \nIntelligence or the Foreign Affairs Committee or other committees, \nincluding the Armed Services Committee that might also have \njurisdiction.\n  The more eyes on Iran in this agreement in making sure that they are \nliving up to the commitments, the better.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to show our resolve and ability to execute the \nfundamental objectives of the JCPOA, preventing an Iranian nuclear \nweapon.\n  While I have deep concerns about aspects of the deal, rejecting it \nnow would potentially lead us down an even darker path without the \nsupport of the international community and with severe and \nunpredictable consequences.\n  I will vote to support this deal and what I believe is now our best \nchance to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear threat, our best chance \nfor an international community united in support of our interests, and \nour best option for peace. We must give diplomacy a chance to work.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nDonovan), a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I believe the House of Representatives will \nstand on the right side of history in rejecting this dangerous deal. I \nhave asked myself, as many people in this Chamber have asked, ``Why is \nthis a good deal for the United States?''\n  Iran is holding four Americans illegally hostage in their country. \nThat was not part of the negotiations. Iran continues to support \nworldwide terrorism. There is no restrictions on that in this deal.\n  Fifty billion dollars will be immediately released to the regime with \nno restrictions on its use. That was not part of the deal. They \ncontinue to develop ICBMs, intercontinental ballistic missiles, that \ncould reach the American mainland. There were no restrictions on that \nduring this deal.\n  We are told by the administration that, if we reject this deal, the \nrest of the P5+1 will not join us. Well, last week Iran's top cleric \nsaid America remains Iran's number one enemy.\n  Days after the deal was announced, Iran's Supreme Leader called for \n``death of America,'' not the death of France, not the death of Great \nBritain, not the death of Russia, not the death of China. It was the \ndeath of America.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hultgren). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield another 30 seconds to the gentleman.\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, since when is America afraid to stand \nalone?\n  I was one of the fortunate freshman that got to go to Israel recently \nand I sat with the Prime Minister, who told us this deal guarantees \nthat, in 15 years, Iran will have a nuclear arsenal. Just yesterday the \nSupreme Leader tweeted that Israel won't exist in 25 years.\n  I also visited the Holocaust Museum and, like many people who weren't \nalive during that historic tragedy, I asked myself, ``Why didn't anyone \nstop this?'' Well, my fear is that some day in the near future people \nare going to ask, ``Why didn't America stop Iran?''\n  The bottom line is that this is a bad deal for America. It is a bad \ndeal for Israel, and it is a bad deal for the world.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time each \nside has?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Maryland has 14 minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from California has 27 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Yarmuth).\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this historic \nagreement with Iran. It is good for America, absolutely critical for \nIsrael, and is a historic step toward a more stable Middle East.\n  We entered into P5+1 negotiations with one prevailing goal, to \nprevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. That is what this \nagreement does.\n  Under this deal, Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. I want to \nrepeat that because there has been a lot of false reports and \nfearmongering about Iran being able to build a bomb in 10 years or 15 \nyears. Under this deal, Iran can never have a nuclear weapon.\n  This is the third provision of the deal: ``Iran affirms that under no \ncircumstances will Iran ever seek, develop, or acquire any nuclear \nweapons.''\n  Iran has agreed to never have a nuclear weapon. With this agreement \nin place, we will have an unprecedented inspection regimen to guarantee \nit.\n  IAEA inspectors will have more access in Iran than in any other \ncountry\n\n[[Page H5905]]\n\nin the world. No nuclear site is off limits. They will have access \nwherever they need it, whenever they need it, and at every single stage \nof the process.\n\n  This agreement is built on verification and full cooperation. If Iran \nfails to meet either of those standards, if at any point inspectors \nbelieve that Iran is stonewalling or being uncooperative, the deal is \nviolated and strict sanctions return.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good deal, and there is no possibility of a \nso-called better deal. Our partner nations have made it clear that, if \nwe walk away from this agreement, they will not support the tough \nsanctions that have brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first \nplace.\n  That is the reality. As a result, a vote against this agreement is a \nvote to weaken international sanctions against Iran. It is a vote to \nallow them a clear path to a nuclear weapon, and it is a vote to make \nIsrael less safe and the Middle East more dangerous.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize that reality, to support this \nagreement and allow our President and our Nation to take these historic \nsteps toward a more peaceful world.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nLatta).\n  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to \nPresident Obama's disastrous Iran nuclear deal. This deal not only \nthreatens the safety and security of the United States, one of our \nclosest allies, Israel, it threatens the safety and security of the \nentire world.\n  It fails to prevent Iran from eventually having a nuclear weapon, the \nexact opposite of what it is intended to do. Iran now simply just has \nto wait a decade before becoming a nuclear power.\n  In the meantime, because Iran gets everything they need and want in \nreturn for so-called reductions in their nuclear capabilities, they can \ndramatically expand their dominance in the region, build up their \nballistic missile and weapons capabilities, grow their economy and \nmilitary, and have even greater ability to fund and promote terrorism.\n  Mr. Speaker, can we really expect to trust a government like Iran's \nwhose leaders chant ``Death to America''?\n  I strongly advise my colleagues to oppose this horrible deal. Our \nNation and our allies deserve better.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut (Ms. Esty).\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the Joint Comprehensive Plan \nof Action not as a perfect agreement, but as the only viable path \nforward to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. I do not come \nto this decision lightly or easily.\n  Iran is a deadly state sponsor of terrorism, and the Iranian regime \nhas repeatedly threatened America and our close ally, Israel.\n  Despite decades of sanctions by the United States, Iran has come \nwithin months of succeeding in its effort to acquire sufficient \nmaterial for a nuclear bomb.\n  Mr. Speaker, the question before us today is not, Is this a perfect \nagreement that addresses all of Iran's dangerous behavior? The truth is \nthere are no perfect options in dealing with this regime.\n  Instead, we must ask: ``Will this agreement verifiably prevent a \nnuclear armed Iran? Will this agreement advance American national \nsecurity interests in the region? Will this agreement advance the \nnational security of our ally, Israel?''\n  Through a very long and deliberate process, I have reached the \nconclusion that the answer to these three questions is yes.\n  I believe that it is better to have this imperfect international \nagreement that we can aggressively enforce than to have no agreement at \nall.\n  During August I spent a week in Israel meeting with political and \nmilitary leaders and hearing from ordinary citizens who are deeply \nconcerned about Iran's intentions.\n  As I stood on the Golan Heights, I could see the smoke rising from \nshelling in Syria. That smoke is a visible sign of the chaos and danger \nin the region for both the United States and for the entire Middle \nEast.\n  I am keenly aware of the very real threats Iran poses to Israel's \nsecurity and to our national security. I share the deep concerns of \nmany of my constituents, of many Jewish leaders, who distrust Iran.\n  That is why, Mr. Speaker, I believe that, after this week's vote, we \nhave another critical choice to make. It is an important choice to make \nfor our children, our grandchildren, and our men and women in uniform.\n  Our choice is this: Will we come together as Americans to enforce the \nIranian nuclear agreement in the years to come?\n  As the Iran nuclear agreement goes into effect, we must work \ntogether--no matter our vote this week--to enforce Iran's commitments \nand to stand prepared to act decisively when Iran tests our resolve. We \ncannot afford to cast a vote and walk away.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have the greatest opportunity to achieve stability in \nthe region when we lead our allies and work with other international \npartners, as we did when we created the international sanctions that \nhave brought Iran to the negotiating table.\n  The Iranian nuclear agreement is the beginning of a long-term, \nmultinational commitment. We must stand strong with our allies. We must \ncommit to ensuring that the inspectors have the access and resources to \ncarry out the agreement.\n  We must stand ready to act, to lead the world to respond to signs of \ncheating or other Iranian efforts to undermine its obligations.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Lance).\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge rejection of the \nunderlying Iranian agreement. The President did not submit to Congress \ntwo inspection side agreements secretly negotiated between the IAEA and \nIran.\n  Congress and the American people have no information on what these \nsecret side agreements entail, although news reports have suggested \nthat Iran will be able to inspect at least some of its own military \nfacilities.\n  Under the underlying agreement, the world's leading state sponsor of \nterrorism--an antagonist of the United States, of Israel, and of \nseveral Arab nations, a 35-year-old regime known for horrible human \nrights abuses--will receive at least $100 billion immediately, some of \nwhich will undoubtedly be used for terrorism.\n  A better underlying agreement can be negotiated, making sure Iran \ndoes not acquire nuclear weapons or ICBMs whose only purpose can be \nmilitaristic. It is important to note that a clear majority of the \nAmerican people and a clear majority of both houses of Congress--\nRepublicans and some Democrats, together the representatives of the \nAmerican people--oppose this deal.\n  This is the most consequential vote I shall cast as a Member of \nCongress on foreign policy since I have been privileged to be here.\n  I urge rejection of the Iranian agreement, which is not in the best \ninterests of the national security of the United States.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to just clear up some things. The IAEA's separate \narrangements with Iran are not part of the agreement within the \ndefinition of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. The separate \narrangements were negotiated between the IAEA and Iran to resolve \noutstanding issues. The arrangements between Iran and the IAEA are \nconsidered safeguard confidentials, meaning that the IAEA does not \nshare the information with member states.\n  The U.S. also has safeguard confidentials, arrangements with the \nIAEA, and we would not want any member state to be able to request \naccess to information about our nuclear infrastructure.\n  Beyond that, Mr. Speaker, IAEA Director General Amano has declared \nthat the arrangements between the IAEA and Iran are technically sound \nand consistent with the Agency's long-established practice. They do not \ncompromise the IAEA safeguard standards in any way.\n  Let's be clear. There is no self-inspection of Iranian facilities, \nand the IAEA has in no way given responsibility for nuclear inspections \nto Iran, not now and certainly not in the future. That is not how the \nIAEA does business.\n  Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n\n[[Page H5906]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Maryland has 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), a member of the Committee on Appropriations \nand the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against a deal \nwhich I believe will become one of the most dangerous mistakes in U.S. \nhistory. This deal does not stop Iran from pursuing a nuclear program. \nIt recognizes and legitimizes their nuclear program in short order.\n  It allows Iran to develop ballistic missiles and brings an end to the \narms embargo against that regime. It frees up hundreds of billions of \ndollars to fund and export terrorism. I am convinced that this deal \nwill also lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. This deal, \nMr. Speaker, is one of the biggest mistakes that we, our children, and \nour grandchildren will pay a very dear price for.\n  Mr. Speaker, history will record this deal as the moment that the \nUnited States and the world granted the largest, most dangerous sponsor \nof terrorism that which it covets the most, nuclear weapons and the \nmeans to deliver them.\n  I hope I am wrong, Mr. Speaker, but I fear that I am not.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear that this agreement isn't based on \ntrust. It is based on the most intrusive verification regimen in \nhistory. The international inspectors will have 24/7 access to \nsurveillance of enrichment facilities and reactors and regular \nnonrestricted access to all other declared sites.\n  Beyond declared facilities, the inspection provisions give the \ninternational inspectors the access they need, when they need it, to \ncarry out the most intrusive inspection system ever peacefully \nnegotiated.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Shimkus).\n  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, this Chamber has a lot of heroes. Sam \nJohnson is one of those. I am proud to have followed him, and I salute \nhim.\n  I have been fortunate to do many things. I was an Army officer in \nWest Germany, a high school teacher, and a local elected official. Now, \nas a Member of Congress, I am honored to cast votes for the people that \nI represent.\n  My constituents want the President to follow the law, as is his \nresponsibility under article II of the Constitution. The President did \nnot submit all the necessary documents as required under the law. I and \nmy constituents want to know what is in these side agreements.\n  To my colleague from Maryland, those assurances are not good enough \nwhen we are going down this path of peace and war to trust the IAEA \nwith no documents, not being able to see that.\n  Our primary responsibility here is to protect our citizens against \nall enemies, foreign and domestic. This deal gives Iran more money. \nThey will remain the number one state sponsor of terror. They will \ncontinue to chant ``death to America'' and ``death to Israel.'' They \nwill not free our citizens.\n  Now, we assure that Iran will get nuclear weapons; the region will go \ninto a nuclear arms race, and the world and the U.S. will be less safe. \nThis is a terrible deal, an embarrassing deal, and one we will regret \nin the future.\n  Vote to fully disclose this deal; vote against the deal, and vote to \nkeep the sanctions on.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Perry), a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, no one wants Iran to have a nuclear weapon; I certainly \ndon't think the President wants them to, but I think it is clear that \nthey are going to. The question is when. Clearly, the President tried \nto make a good deal. I don't think he thinks that Iran can be trusted, \nbut I do think he thinks that they won't cheat.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the road to hell was paved with good intentions, and I \nam sure that the administration had and has good intentions, but the \nfacts remain. Iran has been cheating, literally, for thousands of \nyears--or at least that region has--and certainly, we know the facts.\n  The facts are, for the last 36 years, Iran has cheated on every \nsingle agreement they have signed. They are cheating at this very \nmoment. An agreement that is based on that, that they wouldn't cheat, \nis an agreement that is fatally flawed.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the same country that won't cheat, this is the \nsame country that leaders recognize and recommend the stoning of women, \nthe hanging of homosexuals, the sponsor of mass terrorism. This is the \nnation that we have signed an accord with.\n  Mr. Speaker, the other side will tell you that this is a great \nagreement with robust controls and an inspection paradigm. With all due \nrespect, none of us know what that is; yet the pillar of this agreement \nis based upon solely that, an inspection paradigm that is so robust \nthat Iran can't cheat, and no one knows what it is. We are literally \nvoting for something and on something that we don't know what it is, \nand we are being urged to vote for it.\n  Mr. Speaker, Iran cannot be trusted. The blood will not be on my \nhands from these rockets that Hamas launches into Israel and these \nAmerican soldiers that come home in body bags in the future.\n  I just want to let everybody know that the blood will not be on my \nhands and the hands of those who vote against this agreement.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from California (Mr. Farr).\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to this debate all day, \nand I really have to be, I guess, angered by the amount of misstatement \nof fact here and about this House being so negative about this country \nand about our President.\n  You can't get away with criticizing Presidents or leaders of other \ncountries being negative about us when you are standing around being \nnegative about our own country and our own President.\n  This agreement is about trust, and it isn't about trust with Iran. It \nis about trust with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Nobody has \nspoken about what that Agency does, other than the chairman, about how \nimportant it is.\n  It has been around since 1957. We helped create it. It has 2,400 \nemployees. We probably trained most of them. They know about \ninspections. They are an international organization. They don't belong \nto anybody. No country owns them.\n  You can't go and trash all day that they have a secret agreement with \nIran when they have a secret agreement with the United States and with \nRussia and with China and with all the other signatories. That is their \nbusiness. They go in and verify.\n  We don't allow them to go into our top classified areas without some \nagreement of how you are going to handle that classified information. \nThey are not going to release that information to other countries. They \nwouldn't have any credibility.\n  When you are asking that the President release that information, he \ndoesn't have it. He doesn't own it. It is the IAEA and Iran. What if \nIran was saying, We don't want to enter into this agreement because we \ndon't know what the IAEA has entered into with the United States?\n  Stop trashing the process. Trust this organization. We have been \nproud of it for 58 years. It is the top cop on nuclear inspections, all \nthe 1,100 facilities around the world, nuclear power plants, military \nbases with nuclear equipment, weapons. They are the inspectors. They \nare the ones that trust and verify. Give them a chance.\n  Everybody in the world thinks this is the toughest agreement ever \nnegotiated. Why would we not be celebrating it? This is diplomatic \nhistory. We have done great things here, and you want to trash it, and \nyou want to trash the administration. That is not America. Give peace a \nchance.\n\n[[Page H5907]]\n\n  Vote ``no'' on this awful bill.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, some of us have seen this before. Some of us were around \nfor the North Korean nuclear agreement, and President Obama's Iran \nnuclear deal looks increasingly like the dangerous deal that we struck \nwith that regime in North Korea.\n  In 1994, the U.S. Government signed a deal with North Korea that, \naccording to then-President Clinton, would make the United States, the \nKorean peninsula, and the world safer, in his words.\n  The agreement, we were told, did not rely on trust, but would instead \ninvolve a verification program which would stop the North Koreans from \never acquiring a nuclear bomb. That sounds familiar today.\n  Unfortunately, the North Korean deal had holes that you could fire a \nballistic missile through. The deal did not dismantle North Korea's \nprogram. It committed the United States to rewarding North Korea with \nlarge quantities of fuel oil without requiring the regime to implement \nthe terms.\n  Worst of all, the deal relied on inspection provisions that were \nnaive and ultimately were worthless. The predictable result was that, \non October 4, 2002, North Korea revealed it had been lying all along \nand that it had continued to secretly develop nuclear weapons.\n  Four years later, North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong Il, ordered an \nunderground nuclear test, and today, North Korea is a global menace, \nand it supports and sponsors terrorism, and it is the most unstable \nnuclear power on Earth. There is a reason why some of us raise these \nissues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from North \nCarolina (Mr. Rouzer).\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this \nso-called Iran deal because it paves the way for Iran to obtain nuclear \ncapabilities that will not only threaten Israel and create an arms race \nin the Middle East, but will also be a direct threat to America.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Time and time again, the Government of Iran has demonstrated its \nunwillingness to be transparent and open regarding their nuclear arms \ndevelopment and fraudulent behavior. Let's not forget that we just \nrecently discovered two of their secret nuclear facilities, and who \nknows how many more they have.\n  The sanctions relief included as part of this deal guarantees that \nIran, the world's number one sponsor of terrorism, will have billions \nmore to fund their evil acts. And if there is any confusion, Iran's \nstated intentions of wiping Israel off the face of the Earth and its \npublic chants of ``death to America'' make their intentions very clear.\n  Mr. Speaker, America has always stood for what is right--the greatest \nforce for good mankind has ever known. Let's keep it that way and \ndefeat this agreement.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I stand in opposition to this deal. This is a \nterrible deal for America, for the Middle East, and for the world.\n  This is a deal that can't be verified. The IAEA, as so eloquently \ntalked about by my colleague across the aisle, is the same IAEA that \nhad their inspector buying nuclear material for North Korea.\n  This is a deal that will embolden Iran. It will make them stronger. \nThey are the number one sponsor of terrorism in the world, shouting, \n``Death to America.'' When they stop having the rhetoric from their \nAyatollah and from their President saying ``death to America'' and they \nstart denouncing terrorism and release our hostages, then we can go \nforward with this. But this will do nothing but embolden Iran, make \nthem stronger, and make the Middle East more unstable.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nZeldin), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution.\n  The Congress is not on the clock, because we haven't received the \nentire agreement. And for anyone out there who wants to be supportive \nof this deal, let's think what the President was telling the American \npublic and all of us.\n  The House has a deal that wasn't based on trust; it is built on \nverification. How do you support a deal based on verification without \nknowing what the verification is?\n  I would be happy to yield if anyone wanted to stand up and explain \nhow you support a deal without knowing what the verification is. You \ncan't. That is why we are asking for it.\n  And for those who say that opposing this deal is somehow negative \ntowards America, I took an oath to be an officer of the United States \nmilitary, willing to fight and die in protection of our freedoms and \nliberties. I love this country. I took an oath to serve here the \nmembers of my district because I love America.\n  So don't tell me that somehow opposing this deal is negative toward \nAmerica. I oppose this deal because I love my country.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nRoskam).\n  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, did you notice something? Did you notice \nthat, for the past 2 years, the President of the United States has said \nthat if we were going to have a deal, it was going to be based on full \ndisclosure?\n  Mr. Speaker, the President said that we were going to know all of the \ninformation. And the State Department submitted to the Congress a \ndocument that said: Here is all the information.\n  But after that, Mr. Speaker, you know what we found out? There are \ntwo secret deals. There are two secret side deals, side arrangements, \nthat we have not seen.\n  Now, think about it. There are two alternatives: either this is \nsacrosanct between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the \nIranian Government and no one is allowed to see it under the law--no \none absolutely; it is totally confidential--or it is not.\n  Now, how can it be, Mr. Speaker, that some elements of the \nadministration have been briefed on those documents but they have not \nbeen disclosed to Congress and they have not been disclosed to the \nAmerican public? How can that be?\n  I will tell you how it can be. Because this is absurd. The \nadministration has not disclosed material information.\n  And so why are we here today? Why is Chairman Royce managing this \ntime? Why are we contemplating this resolution that is brought forth by \nCongressman Pompeo and Congressman Zeldin? It is to say this: \nAdministration, you have not complied. Therefore, Corker-Cardin has not \nbeen invoked. Therefore, the House is not going to vote on this \nnefarious deal.\n  This is an awful deal, Mr. Speaker, and it should be wholeheartedly \nrejected with all urgency. I urge the passage of this resolution to \nmake it very clear that we are not going to be complicit. We are not \ngoing to be complicit, Mr. Speaker. We are not going to be midwives and \nbring into the world this awful thing. We won't be complicit.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  A few speakers ago, there was a statement made about folks loving \nAmerica. Well, guess what. We all love America. The fact that we may \nhave disagreements with regard to this proposal does not take away from \nour love of this great country. We may differ, but the fact still \nremains that we love our country. And I just want to make that clear, \nbecause it is sickening to hear those kinds of comments.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. \nEmmer).\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. The American people have spoken and \noverwhelmingly oppose this agreement. Our allies in the region, who \nknow Iran best, oppose this deal. The President, enabled by Senate \nDemocrats, continues to live in a fantasyland.\n  The President's track record in the region is appalling: Libya, \nYemen, Somalia, Benghazi, the reset with Russia, red lines in Syria, \nhis failed ISIL strategy, and his catastrophic withdrawal from Iraq, \njust to name a few, now handing billions, intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles, and a legal pathway to a nuclear weapon to Iran.\n\n[[Page H5908]]\n\n  The American people deserve the truth rather than lies and half-\ntruths about snapback sanctions; secret side deals; anytime, anywhere \ninspections; Iran's right to enrich uranium or plutonium; and, as we \nstand here today, Congress' role in this bad deal.\n  Members of Congress must ask themselves two questions: Does this deal \nmake us more secure? Does this deal make us more safe? The answer to \nboth questions is a resounding, no, it doesn't.\n  Secretary of State Kerry said ``no deal is better than a bad deal.'' \nI couldn't agree more.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Loudermilk).\n\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, let's be clear: Iran is an enemy to the \nUnited States of America, not by our declaration but by a proclamation \nof the most senior military leaders of that nation that have stated \ntheir destiny is to destroy the United States of America. Now, I was \nrecently told by the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, that \nwhen someone says they want to destroy you, believe them.\n  So what are we to trust? Are we to trust Iran, when they say that \ntheir destination, their goal, is to destroy the people of the United \nStates of America? Or do we trust them when they say that they will \ncommit to not develop a nuclear weapon? Or do we trust an international \norganization who has details about verification that they won't even \nshare with the representatives of the people of this Nation who would \nbe drastically affected by that?\n  Oh, yes, but I have been told it is not about trust; it is about \nverification. But the details of the most critical part of that \nverification are being kept secret from the Members of this Congress \nwho are expected to approve this deal that would have drastic effects \nupon the people of the United States.\n  I would submit to you that those who chant ``death to America,'' the \nleaders in Iran, know the details of it.\n  We must stop this now.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. \nBlackburn).\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the chairman for the work that he has done on \nthis issue and the awareness that he has helped to raise not only with \nMembers of this body, but with the American people.\n  The American people are speaking out. They do not want this Iran deal \nto be on the books. And there are goods reasons why.\n  As I was home and talking to my constituents, many are like me. They \nare a mom, they are a grandmother, and they fear for what this will do \nto our country. They fear for what it will do to the safety of our \nchildren and future generations. They are asking the right questions:\n  Does Iran deserve the right to be trusted? Absolutely not.\n  When their neighbors don't trust them, should we trust them? The \nanswer is of course not.\n  Is this a transparent agreement? Of course not. The secret side deals \nthat have been made, why would we do that? Why would we incentivize, \ncreate a pathway, for Iran to have a nuclear weapon?\n  I think what we should do is require the President to come forward \nwith every component to expose this so we know what kind of future this \ncreates for our children and our grandchildren.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Returning to an argument I was making earlier about this body's \nexperience with North Korea, it does look to me like many are willing \nto concede to Iran the same loopholes that we gave North Korea.\n  Supreme Leader Ayatollah has declared that his country would never \nagree to anywhere, anytime inspections. That is what is a little \nconfusing about this. Especially, he says, in Iranian military sites. \nWhat we are informed of is that Iran is going to do its own inspection \nat Parchin. Without a full picture of Iran's nuclear program, without \nfull ability to inspect these sites, we will be verifying in the dark, \njust as we were with North Korea.\n  The Ayatollah is also demanding sanctions be lifted before Iran \ndismantles its nuclear infrastructure. In short, the Supreme Leader, \nagain, is not going to let international inspectors into the places he \nbuilds his secret weapons, and yet he wants billions of sanctions in \nrelief that he could funnel into terrorist groups that he funds, \nincluding Hezbollah and Hamas.\n  Just like North Korea, Iran wants its rewards upfront. Again, like \nNorth Korea, what is Iran demanding? The best prize of all: the stamp \nof international legitimacy for its nuclear program.\n  The truly stunning thing about this nuclear deal is that even if Iran \nfulfills all of its commitments in a few short years, the mullahs will \nbe free from restraints, have international blessing for Iran's nuclear \nprogram, and will have billions of dollars that they will use, in my \nopinion, for destabilizing the region. Because the IRGC controls most \nof these business contracts, their military controls the contracts.\n  It is not too late to stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons, but to \ndo so, we need to learn from our mistakes; and if we don't, the \nAyatollah, just like Kim Jong-il before him, will have, in my view, an \neasy path to the bomb.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. May I inquire as to how much time we have remaining, \nMr. Speaker?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Maryland has 3 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from California has 8\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to make it clear that this agreement is not based \non trust; it is based on the most intrusive verification regimen in \nhistory.\n  There has been a lot of talk about $100 billion--others have floated \nother figures--in sanctions relief, but we know that it is more like \naround $50 billion, and it is conjecture as to how Iran will spend this \nmoney. Our terrorism sanctions will remain firmly in place to combat \nthe money that Iran passes to any terrorist groups.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  This is a good deal, not because the President says so, not because I \nsay so, not because anyone else in this Chamber says so. It is a good \ndeal because the experts say so.\n  Nuclear physicists, disarmament experts, antinuclear proliferation \nexperts, members of the intelligence community--including the former \nhead of Mossad--and our allies all agree that the right thing to do to \nprevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is to support this deal.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Weber).\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, Neville Chamberlain landed at Heston Aerodrome on \nSeptember 30, 1938, and spoke to the crowds. He said: ``The settlement \nof the Czechoslovakian problem has been achieved.''\n  He said, ``This morning I had another talk with German Chancellor, \nHerr Hitler, and here is the paper that bears his name on it, as well \nas mine.''\n  He went on to say, ``We regard the agreement signed last night and \nthe Anglo-German Naval Agreement as symbolic of the desire of our two \npeoples never to go to war again.''\n  Later that day, he stood outside of 10 Downing Street and read again. \nHe said: ``My good friends, for the second time in our history, a \nBritish Prime Minister has returned from Germany bringing peace with \nhonour.''\n  He said, ``I believe it is a peace for our time. We thank you from \nthe bottom of our hearts. Go home and get a nice quiet sleep.''\n  Mr. Speaker, we all know how that turned out.\n  My friends, if this deal passes--and make no mistake, it is quite a \ndeal for Iran--Americans will not get a quiet night's sleep.\n  As long as Barack Hussein Obama is in office aiding and abetting the \nIranian terroristic regime, we will not be safe and Americans will not \nsleep well.\n  This is a bad deal. You don't argue, you don't make deals with the \ndevil, deals with the enemy. Do we not learn from history?\n  Did we not learn anything from World War II?\n\n[[Page H5909]]\n\n  This is a bad deal. I urge my colleagues to vote this deal down. It \nis time to put America first.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from \nengaging in personalities toward the President.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Gohmert).\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we have heard some try to demean the \nimportance of what the chairman and others here on the Republican side \nare trying to do right now.\n  The fact is that, when we talk about the information that has not \nbeen provided about the outside agreements with the IAEA, it is not \nonly material, relevant, but it is also critical.\n  I am reading directly from the Iran deal. Eight years after the \nadoption date or when the IAEA has reached the broader conclusion that \nall nuclear material in Iran remains in peaceful activities, whichever \nis earlier--it goes on to talk about sanctions that will be lifted.\n  Another place, same thing, or when the IAEA has reached the broader \nconclusion that all nuclear material in Iran remains in peaceful \nactivities, then another protocol is lifted.\n  If we don't know what the agreement is with the IAEA, then these \nyears mean nothing. The IAEA, I have already heard say, as far as it \nknows, nuclear material is being used for peaceful purposes. That would \nmean that these years are worthless.\n  We have got to have the secret agreements.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time we have \nremaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Maryland has 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from California has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  With regard to what the gentleman just stated, I would refer him to \nSenator Bob Corker, who drafted the process that gave Congress the \nright to review the agreement. In talking about this situation that we \nare addressing today, he says that the motion is not worth considering. \nApparently, he feels satisfied that the arrangement with regard to the \nIAEA has been satisfied.\n  Let's also focus with the matter at hand, and the matter at hand is \npreventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, instead of working on \npointless partisan measures like this one and others we will be \nconsidering tomorrow.\n  This entire piece of legislation that we have been debating is about \naccusations that the President did not comply with the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act. Even, as I said a moment ago, the chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee does not believe that.\n  Let's get back to the business of the people and stop wasting their \nmoney and wasting their time.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I guess the point that I would begin by making is that Iran won't \nhave to cheat like North Korea did to get close to a bomb, and that is \nbecause the essential restrictions on Iran's key bomb-making technology \nexpire or, in the words of the agreement, sunset in 10 to 15 years.\n  After these restrictions expire, Iran will be left with an \ninternationally recognized industrial scale nuclear program. Iran could \neven legitimately enrich to levels near weapons-grade under the pretext \nof powering a nuclear navy. All these activities are permissible under \nthe nonproliferation treaty, and all would be endorsed by this \nagreement.\n  Indeed, to quote the President, President Obama said, of this \nagreement, in year 13, 14, 15, Iran's breakout times would have shrunk \nalmost down to zero.\n  A former State Department official testified to the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee that this sunset clause is a disaster. It is a disaster as it \nwill enable the leading state sponsor of terrorism to produce enough \nmaterial for dozens of nuclear weapons, all under the terms of the \nagreement.\n  As another expert witness pointed out, the bet that the \nadministration is taking is that, in 10 to 15 years, we will have a \nkinder, gentler Iran. The agreement does not dismantle Iran's nuclear \ninfrastructure. Iran doesn't have to dismantle any centrifuges or give \nup any of its nuclear facilities. Even Iran's once-secret facility at \nFordo, buried under a mountain top, does stay open.\n  Instead, the deal temporarily restricts elements of the program. It \ndoes do that. It restricts elements of the program, but it does it in \nexchange for something else that is permanent.\n  What is permanent in this, as opposed to temporary? What is permanent \nis the sanctions relief. Key restrictions begin to expire after only 8 \nyears.\n  If fully implemented, this agreement will destroy the Iran sanctions \nregime, which Congress has built up over decades, despite opposition \nfrom several administrations.\n  I will remind the Members again, this was a hard-fought case over \nseveral administrations; and, in point of fact, in the prior Congress, \nmyself and Eliot Engel had legislation which would have put additional \npressure on Iran that passed here by a vote of 400-20.\n  It was the administration and it was Secretary of State Kerry who \nmade certain that that bill was bottled up in the Senate and could not \nsee the light of day.\n  Now, the billions in sanctions relief that Iran will get up front \nwill support its terrorist activity, but those billions are just a \ndownpayment, as this agreement reconnects Iran to the global economy.\n  One of the things that bothers me most about this is that Iran is not \na normal country with normal businessmen running those companies. When \nthose companies were nationalized, they were turned over to the IRGC. \nThey were turned over, basically, to the leaders in the military, and \nthey were turned over to the clerics.\n  As future contracts go forward with Iran, it is that entity that is \ngoing to be rewarded. It is going to have the political power.\n  For those of us that hoped to see change in Iran, now the best \nconnected people in Iran are going to be the IRGC leaders. If we think \nfor a minute what that will mean for those that would like to see real \nchange, I think we lost a historic opportunity here to put the kind of \npressure that would have forced change, but we did not do that.\n  In a major, last-minute concession--and this is the final point I \nwould make--the President agreed to lift the U.N. arms embargo on Iran, \nand in 5 years, Iran will be able to buy conventional weapons and, in 8 \nyears, ballistic missiles.\n  Russia and China want to sell these dangerous weapons to Iran, and \nthat is why they pushed. That is why it was Russia pushing, at the \neleventh hour, after we thought this agreement was done.\n  The reason we were waiting those extra days is because Russia was \nrunning interference for Iran, saying: Oh, no, wait. We also want the \narms embargo lifted, including the ICBM embargo lifted.\n  As the Secretary of Defense of our country testified, the reason that \nwe want to stop Iran from having an ICBM program is that the ``I'' in \nICBM stands for intercontinental, which means having the capability of \nflying from Iran to the United States.\n  Ask yourself why Iran wants to build ICBMs, why it is that the \nAyatollah says it is the duty of every military man to figure out how \nto help mass-produce ICBMs.\n  Someone once asked President Kennedy the difference between our space \nprogram and the ICBM program that Russia was building at that time, and \nhe quipped ``attitude.'' Kennedy's answer was ``attitude.''\n  The answer here is that attitude counts for a lot, and the attitude \nin the regime, when they say they are not even going to be bound by \nthis and are now going to transfer rockets and missiles to Hezbollah \nand Hamas, tells us a lot about their attitude.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, for years, the Congress, the President, \nour European partners, and the international community have imposed a \nseries of tough economic sanctions on Iran with the goal of preventing \nIran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Those\n\n[[Page H5910]]\n\nsanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table and I commend President \nObama, Secretary Kerry, and the entire team, along with our P5+1 \npartners, for their efforts to negotiate an agreement to prevent Iran \nfrom building a nuclear weapon.\n  The question for Members of Congress, who will vote on this \nagreement, is whether it achieves its stated goals. Given the \nimportance of this question, I believe every Member of Congress has an \nobligation to thoroughly review the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \n(JCPOA), consider the testimony presented at the Congressional \nhearings, and listen to competing views before reaching a final \njudgment.\n  Since the JCPOA was submitted to Congress on July 19, 2015, I have \ncarefully reviewed all of its terms, attended the classified briefings \nand numerous presentations, and reviewed the transcripts of all the \nhearings that have been held in both the House and the Senate. I have \nalso met with opponents and supporters of the agreement. While I \nrespect the opinions of those on both sides of this issue, I have \nconcluded that this agreement advances the national security interests \nof the United States and all of our allies, including our partner \nIsrael. This agreement is the best path to achieve our goal--that Iran \nnever obtains a nuclear weapon. Indeed, I firmly believe that, should \nCongress block this agreement, we would undermine that goal, \ninadvertently weaken and isolate America, and strengthen Iran.\n  The benefit of any agreement must be measured against the real-world \nconsequences of no agreement. Many forget that when these negotiations \nbegan in earnest two years ago, Iran was a threshold nuclear weapons \nstate and remains so until and unless this agreement is implemented. As \nPrime Minister Netanyahu warned at the United Nations in 2012, Iran was \na few months away from having enough highly enriched uranium to produce \nits first bomb. Today, prior to the implementation of this agreement, \nit has a nuclear stockpile that, if further enriched, could produce up \nto 10 bombs. It currently has installed nearly 20,000 centrifuges that \ncould convert that fuel into weapons material. Indeed, many analysts \nbelieve that the combination of Iran's nuclear stockpile and its \ncentrifuges would allow it to produce enough weapons-grade nuclear \nmaterial for a bomb in two months.\n  In addition, Iran has been enriching some of its nuclear material at \nits deep underground reactor at Fordow, a very difficult target to hit \nmilitarily. Moreover, Iran was in the process of building a heavy-water \nreactor at Arak, which could generate plutonium to be used for a \nnuclear weapon. Finally, Iran has been operating for years under an \ninadequate verification regime that increases the risks of a covert \nprogram going undetected.\n  This agreement blocks all of these paths to acquiring weapons-grade \nnuclear material and puts in place an inspection system that assures \nthe detection of any violation and future dash to acquire a nuclear \nweapon. The Interim Agreement has already neutralized Iran's stockpile \nof highly enriched uranium that Prime Minister Netanyahu highlighted in \nhis speech. This final agreement will significantly scale back the \nremainder of its program. Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium will be \ncut from 9,900 kg to 300 kg, and that remainder will be limited to low-\nenriched uranium that cannot be used for a weapon. In addition, the \nagreement removes two-thirds of Iran's installed centrifuges. No \nenrichment activities may be conducted at Fordow for a period of 15 \nyears, and the facility at Arak will be permanently converted to one \nthat does not produce weapons-grade plutonium.\n  Taken together, these measures will extend the breakout time from \nabout two months to at least a year and put in place layers of \nverification measures over different timelines, including some that \nremain in place permanently. It is generally agreed that these measures \nwould allow us to detect any effort by Iran to use its current nuclear \nfacilities--Natanz, Fordow, or Arak--to violate the agreement. The main \ncriticism with respect to verification is that the agreement does not \nsufficiently guard against an effort by Iran to develop a secret \nuranium supply chain and enrichment capacity at a covert place. \nHowever, the reality is that the agreement permanently puts in place an \ninspection mechanism that is more rigorous than any previous arms \ncontrol agreement and more stringent than the current system. The \nagreement ultimately requires inspections of any suspected Iranian \nnuclear site with the vote of the United States, Britain, France, \nGermany, and the European Union. Neither the Chinese nor the Russians \ncan block such inspections in the face of a united Western front. Are \nwe really better off without this verification regime than with it?\n  In exchange for rolling back its nuclear program and accepting this \nverification regime, Iran will obtain relief from those sanctions that \nare tied to its nuclear program. However, that relief will only come \nafter Iran has verifiably reduced its nuclear program as required. \nMoreover, if Iran backslides on those commitments, the sanctions will \nsnap back into place. The snapback procedure is triggered if the U.S. \nregisters a formal complaint against Iran with the special commission \ncreated for that purpose. In addition, those U.S. sanctions that are \nnot related to the Iranian nuclear program will remain in place, \nincluding U.S. sanctions related to Iran's human rights violations, \nsupport for terrorism, and missile program.\n  There are some who oppose the agreement because it does not prevent \nIran from engaging in adversarial actions throughout the Gulf, the \nMiddle East, and elsewhere. That conduct, however, was never within the \nscope of these negotiations nor the objective of the international \nsanctions regime aimed at preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear \nweapon. President Reagan understood the distinction between changing \nbehavior and achieving verifiable limits on weapons programs. He \nnegotiated arms control agreements with the Soviet Union, not because \nhe thought it would change the character of ``the Evil Empire'' but \nbecause limiting their nuclear arsenal was in the national security \ninterests of the U.S. and our allies. That reality is also true today. \nAn Iranian regime with nuclear capability would present a much greater \nthreat to the region than an Iran without one. In fact, today, as a \nthreshold nuclear weapons state, Iran wields more influence than it \nwill under the constraints of this agreement. That is why our focus has \nappropriately been on reining in the Iranian nuclear program.\n  The lifting of the sanctions will certainly give Iran additional \nresources to support its priorities. Given the political dynamic in \nIran, some of those additional resources will likely be invested to \nimprove the domestic standard of living. But even if all the resources \nwere used to support their proxies in the region, respected regional \nobservers agree that they are unlikely to make a significant strategic \ndifference. Moreover, any effort by Iran to increase support for its \nproxies can be checked by the U.S. and our allies through \ncountermeasures. Finally, it is clear that any alternative agreement \nopponents seek would also result in the lifting of the sanctions and \nfreeing up these resources.\n  In my view, opponents of the agreement have failed to demonstrate how \nwe will be in a better position if Congress were to block it. Without \nan agreement, the Iranians will immediately revert to their status as a \nthreshold nuclear weapons state. In other words, they immediately pose \nthe threat that Prime Minister Netanyahu warned about in his U.N. \nspeech. At the same time, the international consensus we have built for \nsanctions, which was already starting to fray, would begin to collapse \nentirely. We would be immediately left with the worst of all worlds--a \nthreshold nuclear weapons state with diminished sanctions and little \nleverage for the United States.\n  I disagree with the view that we can force the Iranians back to the \nnegotiating table to get a better deal. All of our European partners \nhave signed on to the current agreement. Consequently, the U.S. would \nbe isolated in its quest to return to negotiations. And in the unlikely \nevent that we somehow returned to negotiations, the critics have not \npresented a plausible scenario for achieving a better agreement in a \nworld where fewer sanctions means less economic pressure.\n  The bottom line is that if Congress were to block the agreement and \nthe Iranians were to resume nuclear enrichment activities, the only way \nto stop them, at least temporarily, would be by military action. That \nwould unleash significant negative consequences that could jeopardize \nAmerican troops in the region, drag us into another ground war in the \nMiddle East, and trigger unpredictable responses elsewhere. Moreover, \nthe United States would be totally isolated from most of the world, \nincluding our Western partners. The folly of that go-it-alone military \napproach would be compounded by the fact that such action would only \ndeal a temporary setback to an Iranian nuclear program. They would \nlikely respond by putting their nuclear enrichment activities deeper \nunderground and would likely be more determined than ever to build a \nnuclear arsenal.\n  We don't have to take that path. This agreement will give us a long \nperiod of time to test the Iranians' compliance and assess their \nintentions. During that period, it will give us a treasure trove of \ninformation about the scope and capabilities of the limited Iranian \nnuclear program. Throughout that period and beyond, we reserve all of \nour options, including a military option, to respond to any Iranian \nattempt to break out and produce enough highly enriched material to \nmake a bomb. But we will have two advantages over the situation as it \nis today--a more comprehensive verification regime to detect any \nviolation and a much longer breakout period in which to respond.\n  As former Secretary Clinton has indicated, the fact that we have \nsuccessfully limited the scope of Iran's nuclear program does not mean \nwe have limited its ambitions in the region. We must continue to work \nwith our\n\n[[Page H5911]]\n\nfriends and allies to constantly contain and confront Iranian \naggression in the region. The United States and Israel must always \nstand together to confront that threat. The fact remains that Iranian \nsupport for their terrorist proxy Hezbollah continues to destabilize \nLebanon and poses a direct threat to Israel, as does its support for \nHamas. We must do all we can to ensure that our ally Israel maintains \nits qualitative military edge in the region, including providing \nincreased funding for Israel's Arrow anti-ballistic missile and Iron \nDome anti-rocket systems. Consideration should also be given to \npreviously denied weapons if a need for such enhanced capabilities \narises. We must always remember that some of Iran's leaders have called \nfor the destruction of Israel and we must never forget the awful past \nthat teaches us not to ignore those threats.\n  The threats Iran poses in the region are real. But all those threats \nare compounded by an Iran that is a threshold nuclear weapons state. \nThis agreement will roll back the Iranian nuclear program and provide \nus with greater ability to detect and more time to respond to any \nfuture Iranian attempt to build a nuclear weapon.\n  For all of the reasons given above, I've concluded that this is an \nhistoric agreement that should be supported by the Congress.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 412, I call up \nthe bill (H.R. 3461) to approve the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, \nsigned at Vienna on July 14, 2015, relating to the nuclear program of \nIran, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 412, the bill \nis considered read.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 3461\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. APPROVAL OF JOINT COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ACTION.\n\n       Congress does favor the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, \n     signed at Vienna on July 14, 2015, relating to the nuclear \n     program of Iran.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 3 hours \nequally divided and controlled by the chair of the Committee on Foreign \nAffairs and the minority leader or their designees.\n  The gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) will control 90 minutes. \nThe gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), the gentleman from Virginia \n(Mr. Connolly), and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters) \neach will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce).\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous materials on this measure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the Foreign Affairs Committee, we have held 30 \nhearings and briefings on Iran since these negotiations began. We have \nreviewed this\n\n[[Page H5912]]\n\nagreement in depth; but, Mr. Speaker, I can come to no other conclusion \nthan not only does it come up short, it is fatally flawed and, indeed, \ndangerous. I will oppose the measure before us. We should have gotten a \nbetter deal.\n  Indeed, when the House passed stiff Iran sanctions legislation--now, \nthis was in 2013--in the prior Congress, we passed this legislation, \nauthored by myself and Mr. Engel, by a vote, a bipartisan vote in this \nbody, of 400-20.\n  The intention of that legislation was to put that additional leverage \non Iran and force the Ayatollah to make a choice between real \ncompromise--real compromise--on his nuclear program and economic \ncollapse if he did not.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Unfortunately, the Secretary of State and the administration worked \nto ensure that the other body never took that measure up.\n  This legislation would have put more pressure, as I say, on Iran and \nmight have led to an acceptable deal; but instead of an ironclad \nagreement that is verifiable and holds Iran to account, we are \nconsidering an agreement that leaves Iran, in a few short years, only \nsteps away from a nuclear weapons program, one that would be on an \nindustrial scale.\n  Under the agreement, Iran is not required to dismantle key bomb-\nmaking technology. Instead, it is permitted a vast enrichment capacity, \nreversing decades of bipartisan nonproliferation policy that never \nimagined endorsing this type of nuclear infrastructure for any country, \nnever mind a country that lives by the motto ``death to America.''\n  While Members of Congress insisted on anywhere, anytime inspections, \nU.S. negotiators settled for something called managed access. So, \ninstead of allowing international inspectors into those suspicious \nsites within 24 hours, it will take 24 days, and that is to commence \nthe process.\n  Worse, there have been revelations in recent days about an agreement \nbetween Iran and the United Nations' nuclear watchdog. This agreement \nsets the conditions in which a key Iranian military site that is \nsuspected of nuclear bomb work--suspected in the sense that we have \n1,000 pages of evidence of that bomb work--will be explored.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we have heard, those details have been kept from \nCongress. We don't have those details in our hands; but it is reported \nthat, instead of international inspectors doing the inspecting, the \nIranians, themselves, will take the inspection lead. Iran has cheated \non every agreement they have signed, so why do we trust them now to \nself-police?\n  The deal guts the sanctions web that is putting intense pressure on \nIran. Billions will be made available to Iran to pursue its terrorism. \nIndeed, Iran's elite Quds Force has transferred funds--and this should \nbother all of us--to Hamas. It has committed to rebuild the network of \ntunnels from Gaza to attack Israel.\n  Mr. Engel and I were in one of those tunnels last year. They have \nagreed in Iran to replenish the medium-range missile arsenal of Hamas, \nand they are working right now, they claim, to give precision-guided \nmissiles to Hezbollah. I can tell you I was in Haifa in 2006 when it \nwas under constant bombardment by those types of rockets, but they \nweren't precision-guided. Every day, they slammed into the city, and \nthere were 600 victims in the trauma hospital. Now Iran has transferred \neightfold the number of missiles, and they want to give them the \nguidance systems. They need money to pay for those guidance systems.\n  Iran won late concessions to remove international restrictions on its \nballistic missile program and on its conventional arms, and that \nimperils the security of the region and, frankly, the security of our \nhomeland.\n  For some, the risks in this agreement are worth it as they see an \nIran that is changing for the better. As one supporter of this \nagreement told our committee, President Obama is betting that, in 10 or \n15 years, we will have a kinder, gentler Iran.\n  But that is a bet against everything we have seen out of the regime \nsince the 1979 revolution. Already, Iranian leaders insist that \ninternational inspectors won't see the inside of Iran's military bases \nand that Iran can advance its missiles and weapons without breaking the \nagreement. It is guaranteed that Iran will game the agreement to its \nadvantage.\n  So we must ask ourselves: Will international bureaucrats call out \nIran, knowing that doing so will put this international agreement at \nrisk? We are not calling them out now as they are transferring weapons.\n  Will this administration, which didn't even insist that four American \nhostages come home as part of this agreement, be any tougher on Iran in \nimplementing this deal?\n  Does this serve the long-term national security interests of the \nUnited States? Does it make the world and, frankly, the region more \nsafe? more stable? more secure?\n  Is there any other reason Iran--an energy rich country--is advancing \nits nuclear technology other than to make a nuclear weapon?\n  And why do its leaders chant ``death to America'' and ``death to \nIsrael''?\n  The New York Times ran a story on Quds Day, which is the national \nparade. It was some weeks ago. There was President Rouhani--the so-\ncalled moderate--marching in that parade. Behind him, the crowd was \nchanting. It was chanting ``death to America.'' In front of them, they \ncarried placards on either side of him that read, ``Death to Israel.'' \nWhy does their leader march in the Quds parade, and why does that \nrefrain constantly come from the clerics?\n  I hope that all Members will consider these questions as they \nconsider this vote.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Over the past 2 years, I have supported our negotiating team in the \nP5+1. I have favored giving time and space to achieve a diplomatic \nbreakthrough to foreclose Iran's pathways to a nuclear weapon. I am \ngrateful for the tireless efforts by President Obama, Secretary Kerry, \nSecretary Moniz, Secretary Lew, and Undersecretary Sherman. I \nappreciate the work of our P5+1 partners in concluding an agreement \nwith Iran.\n  But, unfortunately, I cannot support the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction, and I plan to oppose this resolution.\n  Let me say at the outset, I was troubled that Iran was not asked to \nstop enriching, while we were talking, despite several U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions calling for a pause; and after using this review \nperiod to assess the details of the agreement, I am not convinced that \nthis deal does enough to keep a nuclear weapon out of Iran's hands.\n  I have raised questions and concerns throughout the negotiating phase \nand review period. The answers I have received simply don't convince me \nthat this deal will keep a nuclear weapon out of Iran's hands. It may, \nin fact, strengthen Iran's position as a destabilizing and destructive \ninfluence across the Middle East.\n  First of all, I don't believe that this deal gives international \ninspectors adequate access to undeclared sites--24 days is far, far too \nlong a time. Iran can stall, and, in 24 days, they can cover up \nwhatever they have. I am especially troubled by reports about how the \nIranian military base at Parchin will be inspected. With these \npotential roadblocks, the IAEA inspectors may be unable to finish their \ninvestigation into the potential military dimensions of Iran's nuclear \nprogram. I don't think it is essential that Iran provide a full mea \nculpa of its past activities, but we should have a clear picture of how \nfar Iran has gotten in developing a nuclear weapon.\n  I also view as a dangerous concession the sunset of the international \nsanctions on advanced conventional weapons and ballistic missiles. I \nwas told that these issues were not on the table during the talks; so \nit is unacceptable to me that, after 5 years, Iran can begin buying \nadvanced conventional weapons and, after 8 years, ballistic missiles. \nWorse, if Iran were to violate the weakened provisions in this \nagreement, such an action wouldn't violate the JCPOA and wouldn't be \nsubject to snapback sanctions.\n\n  In my view, Iran is a grave threat to international stability. It is \nthe largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. It continues to \nhold American citizens behind bars on bogus charges, and our prisoners \nstill languish there. We have an agreement. Their release was not part \nof the agreement. Iran's actions\n\n[[Page H5913]]\n\nhave made a bad situation in a chaotic region worse.\n  Even under the weight of international sanctions these past few \nyears--when Iran had no money, when its currency was worthless, when \nits economy was in the toilet--Iran found money to support \ninternational terror. Iran has been able to support terrorist groups, \nsuch as Hezbollah, Hamas, and other violent extremists. Awash in new \ncash provided by sanctions relief, Iran will be poised to inflict even \ngreater damage in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon, Israel, and our Gulf \npartners. Iran's leadership has every interest in shoring up support \nfrom hard-liners. After all, if a deal goes through, hard-liners will \nneed to be placated.\n  I can tell you that, within the next few years--in the next Lebanon \nwar with Israel--Hezbollah will have missiles raining down on Israel, \nand some of those missiles will be paid for by the windfall that Iran \nis going to get as a result of sanctions being lifted. I think that is \nunacceptable.\n  We can have no illusions about what Iran will do with its newfound \nwealth. We can have no doubt about the malevolent intent of a country's \nleader who chants ``death to America'' and ``death to Israel'' just \ndays after concluding a deal. The ink was not even dry on the deal, and \n4 days later, the Supreme Leader led a chant of ``death to America.'' \nAfter negotiating with us and agreeing to this agreement, he could not \neven wait more than 4 days--back to the same old ``death to America.''\n  Finally and very importantly, I have a fundamental concern that, 15 \nyears from now, under this agreement, Iran will be free to produce \nweapons-grade, highly enriched uranium without any limitation. What \ndoes that mean? It means Iran will be a legitimized nuclear threshold \nstate after the year 2030, with advanced centrifuges and the ability to \nstockpile enriched uranium. So, in reality, this agreement does not \nprevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon; it only postpones it.\n  If Iran pursues that course, I fear it could spark a nuclear arms \nrace across the region. After years of intransigence, I am simply not \nconfident that Iran will be a more responsible partner.\n  Before I finish, I would also like to say a few words about the \ndebate surrounding this issue so far.\n  We can disagree on the issues. We should debate the details of any \nimportant policy, such as this one, and we must rely on our democratic \ninstitutions to carry us forward as they have for so long; but we \ncannot question the motives of any Member of Congress no matter where \nhe or she stands on this issue.\n  So, instead of using this time to grind a political ax, let's, \ninstead, look down the road. After all, we know that this deal is going \nforward, and when that happens, we need to ask how we can make this \nagreement stronger.\n  How do we ensure the security of Israel and our other friends and \nallies in the region? How do we keep resources out of the hands of \nterrorists as sanctions are lifted? What support does Congress need to \nprovide so that the United States and our partners can hold Iran to its \nword and ultimately keep it from getting a bomb?\n  The time to start answering these questions is now.\n  That is why, in the days and weeks ahead, I will reach out to \ncolleagues--Republicans and Democrats alike--to chart a path forward. I \nwill be working with Chairman Royce and others on both sides of the \naisle. I will develop new legislation to counter Iran as it dumps its \nsoon-to-be-acquired billions of dollars into terrorist groups and \nweapons programs. I will work with other lawmakers toward new \ninitiatives that support Israel and our Middle East allies so that they \ncan stand up to an unleashed Iran; and I will work here in Congress and \nwith the administration to make sure the deal is fully implemented to \nthe letter.\n  We need to focus on strengthening our deterrence in the region; and, \nmost importantly, we have to work hard to continue to enhance the U.S.-\nIsrael relationship. We must reinvigorate the bipartisan consensus \nwhich has been the foundation of America's relationship with Israel; \nand we must ensure that Israel is able to maintain its qualitative \nmilitary edge and its ability to defend itself.\n  The world is watching us this week. The United States is being looked \nto, not for rhetoric and outrage, but for leadership and resolve. So \nlet's present our arguments and cast our votes. Then let's work \ntogether to move forward in a productive way. I appreciate how we have \nworked together on the Foreign Affairs Committee with Chairman Royce.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the bipartisan relationship that \nall of the Members on the Foreign Affairs Committee have, but \nespecially today, the words of Mr. Engel that every Member of this \nHouse should be mindful that impugning motives, questioning the motives \nof those who disagree with us, is not conducive to an honest and fair \ndebate over these issues. I thank him for making that point on the \nfloor today.\n  At this time, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. \nScalise), the majority whip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, when the President started these \nnegotiations with Iran, I think, when you look at the fatal flaw in the \nbeginning of those negotiations, they should have started with one \nbasic premise. That premise, Mr. Speaker, ought to have been to finally \nforce Iran to dismantle their nuclear weapons program.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, that was not the objective of these \nnegotiations. In fact, if you look, it seemed there was more interest \non making sure that a deal could be reached that China and Russia and \nIran could finally agree to.\n  And the problem is, when you look at the fatal flaw of that \nnegotiation, what has it yielded? And why is there such strong \nopposition across the country from members of both parties to this \nagreement?\n  I think most Americans recognize that Iran cannot be trusted with a \nnuclear weapon. Just look at their own rhetoric. Just this week the \nAyatollah himself led the chant ``death to America.''\n  These are the people that the President is negotiating with to \nultimately end up at the end of this deal with the ability to develop \nnot just a nuclear bomb, but a nuclear arsenal, Mr. Speaker.\n  Just look at the tenets of the deal itself. One of the conditions in \nthe deal actually allows Iran to have more than 5,000 centrifuges. If \nthey comply with the deal, they can keep more than 5,000 centrifuges to \nenrich uranium.\n  It took Pakistan about 3,000 centrifuges to develop their bomb, and \nIran will have over 5,000 centrifuges if they comply with the deal, let \nalone if they cheat. And we know the history there.\n  Let's look at other components of the deal, Mr. Speaker. In this \ndeal, if there is a site that is undeclared and our intelligence along \nthe way over these next few years exposes the fact that there is \nsomething there that we want to go look at, that we question whether or \nnot they are cheating, Mr. Speaker, we have to get permission under \nthis deal and wait over 24 days.\n  Imagine all of the things that can be hidden in 24 days if we have \nthe intelligence that they are cheating. How could this be part of a \ndeal that we would agree to that is in the American best interest?\n  Ultimately, what we have to come to an agreement on is what is in the \nbest interest of the United States of America.\n  Mr. Speaker, we also ought to be concerned about our allies, Israel, \nand the other Arab states in the region that have deep, grave concerns \nabout this, others that are indicating that this will start a nuclear \narms race in the Middle East.\n  Within 10 years, you could have nearly a half a dozen states in the \nMiddle East with nuclear arms. This isn't the way we ought to go.\n  Then, of course, there are the secret side deals. We have seen \nevidence now that there are secret side deals that the President won't \ndisclose.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Carter of Georgia). The time of the \ngentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, under the law that President Obama himself \nsigned, the law actually says the President has to disclose to Congress \nand the American people all information\n\n[[Page H5914]]\n\nrelated to this deal, including ``side agreements.''\n  And now we are hearing at least two secret side agreements exist, one \nthat allows Iran to actually do their own inspections.\n  Mr. Speaker, these are the people that this deal is going to allow to \ninspect their own nuclear facilities. The President ought to release to \nthe American people the details of these secret side agreements right \nnow or withdraw this entire proposal.\n  President Reagan said, ``Trust, but verify.'' Under this agreement, \nPresident Obama is saying trust Iran to verify. You cannot allow this \nto go through.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to reject this deal. The President lays \nout a false premise that it is this deal or war.\n  I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, there is a much different approach, a \nmuch better approach, and that is to go get a better deal that protects \nthe interest of the United States of America for today and for decades \nto come.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Sherman), a very valued member of our committee and one \nof the subcommittee ranking members.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, when I came to this House in 1997, a few \nmonths after I started serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee, I said \nback then that the Iran nuclear program was the greatest single threat \nto the security of Americans. It was true then. It is true now.\n  On July 14, a few hours after the deal was published, I came to this \nfloor and said that what this House ought to do is consider a \nResolution of Approval of the nuclear deal and to vote it down by a \nlarge vote. That is exactly what we will do tomorrow morning.\n  Let me go through a number of points that proponents and opponents of \nthis deal can both agree on. The first is this resolution is quite a \nbit different than the one we have been thinking about for the last \nmonth.\n  This is a Resolution of Approval. And even if we vote it down, the \nPresident can and will carry out this agreement.\n  That is very different from the Resolution of Disapproval that we \nhave all talked about and made commitments about.\n  We don't have any commitments on this resolution. It is a totally new \nresolution. This resolution will express the feelings of Congress, but \nwill not prevent the President from carrying out the deal.\n  Second, we can agree this deal is better during the next year and a \nhalf than it is the next decade. The controls on Iran's nuclear program \nare much stronger for the first 10 years than they are thereafter.\n  Whether you like the deal or hate the deal, you have got to agree \nthat it is better up front than it is in the out-years.\n  The third thing we can agree on is that the President only promised \nIran that he would sign the deal and that he would carry out the deal \nand that he would use his veto, as he has threatened to do and has \nsuccessfully done, in effect--that he would carry out the deal using \nhis powers to do so. That is already settled.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President never told Iran that Congress would \napprove this deal. Why should we give Iran more than they bargained \nfor? They bargained for the President's signature together with his \nfreedom to carry out the deal. That is already settled. Why should we \ngive Iran something extra in return for nothing?\n  We should not vote to approve this deal.\n  The next thing we can all agree on is that this deal is not a binding \nagreement as a matter of U.S. Constitutional law or international law.\n  The Constitution defines a treaty. This is not a treaty and certainly \nwouldn't get a two-thirds vote confirmation in the Senate.\n  If you look at the Vienna Convention on the law of treaties, this is \nnot a ratified treaty, it is not an unratified treaty, it is not a \nlegislative executive agreement. It is simply an agreement between the \nexecutives of the respective governments.\n  Mr. Speaker, the next thing we can agree on is that we don't know \nwhat the best policy for America is in the next decade. Let's keep our \noptions open. Iran is not legally bound by this agreement. Even if they \nwere, they would conveniently ignore that any day of the week.\n  We cannot feel that we are legally bound. Now, as a legal matter, we \nare not. But appearances matter. And if this agreement that has been \nsigned by the President gets a positive vote of approval in this House, \nthere will be those around the world who believe that it is binding on \nthe United States, even while, as a legal matter, it is not binding on \nIran and, oh, by the way, their legislature hasn't voted to approve it.\n  So we need freedom of action. What form will that action take? Will \nwe demand that Iran continue to limit its nuclear program beyond year \n10, beyond year 15?\n  After all, we are continuing the sanctions relief all through the \nnext decade. I don't know if that will be the right policy or not.\n  Mr. Speaker, the current President's hands are untied. He gets to \ncarry out his policy for the remainder of the term. Vote no on this \nresolution. Because if we vote yes, we are tying the hands of future \nPresidents in a decade to come.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. \nRos-Lehtinen), chairman emeritus of the Committee on Foreign Affairs \nwho currently chairs our Subcommittee on the Middle East and North \nAfrica.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to highlight the hard work of \nour esteemed chairman, Mr. Royce of California, and our ranking member, \nMr. Engel, who have done an incredible job throughout--I don't know how \nmany hearings we have had in our Foreign Affairs Committee--\nhighlighting the many flaws of this deal and giving the other side the \nopportunity to present what is good about this deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, after all of those hearings in our Foreign Affairs \nCommittee led by Mr. Royce and Mr. Engel, it is simple to realize what \nis before us today. This deal paves the way for a nuclear-armed Iran in \nas little as 15 years.\n  This deal lifts the arms embargo. This deal lifts the sanctions on \nIran's ballistic missile program. This deal releases billions of \ndollars that will allow the regime to increase funding to support \nterror, as it has been doing, to support its regional hegemonic \nambitions.\n  If all of that were not bad enough, with this deal, the P5+1 \ncountries will actually be obligated to help Iran modernize and advance \nits nuclear program. Yes. You heard that right. This is important \nbecause this modernization requirement gets lost with all of the other \nmany flaws of this deal.\n  We actually have an agreement before us to help Iran strengthen its \nability to protect against nuclear security threats, to protect it \nagainst sabotage, to protect all the physical sites.\n  Incredibly enough, we will be helping Iran with its nuclear program. \nSo now, not only do we have to allow Iran to enrich, not only do we \nhave to allow Iran to become a nuclear threshold state, but, yes, we \nmust actually protect Iran's nuclear program from sabotage and outside \nthreats.\n  Mr. Speaker, how does a rogue regime that has been in violation of \nits nonproliferation treaty obligations for decades, a rogue regime \nthat has been in violation of--one, two, three, four, five--six United \nNations Security Council resolutions and a regime that violates other \ninternational obligations get to be the beneficiary of such protections \nfrom the U.S. and other P5+1 countries?\n  This is madness, Mr. Speaker. It simply defies logic. We must oppose \nthis deal. Let's vote that way.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Deutch), a very important member of the committee, the \nranking member of the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. I \nthank the chairman for his leadership in the committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, there have been a lot of points made during this debate. \nI would like to set some context for the rest of the evening.\n  Iran's regime is anti-American. They are anti-Israel. They are \nhomophobic. They are misogynistic. They violate the human rights of \ntheir people.\n  Iran's support for terrorists has led directly to the deaths of \nAmerican citizens. It actively works to destabilize\n\n[[Page H5915]]\n\nthe Middle East. It vows to destroy Israel.\n  It is responsible for the death of civilians and members of the \nmilitary from Beirut to Buenos Aires. It has assisted in Assad's \nslaughter of 300,000 of his own people.\n  As we gather here today, four Americans--Jason Rezaian, Amir Hekmati, \nSaeed Abedini, my constituent Bob Levinson--are in Iran, held by the \nregime and unable to return home to their families.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is well known that I oppose this deal. On the nuclear \nissue, it does not dismantle Iran's nuclear program. It pauses it.\n  Now, inspections in Nantanz and Fordow are very positive, as is the \nmonitoring of the fuel cycle and the reduction in enriched uranium. But \nwe cannot access other suspected nuclear sites in less than 24 days.\n  If we find Iran in violation of this agreement, we cannot restore \nsanctions to the punishing level of today and, if we snap back \nsanctions, Mr. Speaker, Iran has the right to cease performing its \nobligations under the agreement altogether.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  While there has been a lot of speculation about what could happen in \nthe absence of a deal, we know that, under this deal, the regime will \nget billions of dollars to support terrorism; we know the arms embargo \nwill be lifted, meaning that the most advanced weapons will be \navailable to the regime; and we know that the ban on the development of \nballistic missiles will be lifted.\n  Now, I have heard a lot of criticism of those of us who oppose the \ndeal. I don't want war, Mr. Speaker. To the contrary, I want to prevent \nIran from using billions of dollars to cause more violence and its \nsurrogates to cause more bloodshed.\n  I don't want the start of an arms race. To the contrary, I want to \nprevent Iran from developing advanced centrifuges and an industrial \nnuclear program with an unlimited number of centrifuges so that other \nnations will not seek nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't oppose this deal because of politics or my \nreligion or the people who live in my district. I have simply concluded \nthat the risks are too great.\n  Now, these past few weeks have been challenging for all of us. \nReasonable people can disagree, and I am saddened by the often \nvitriolic comments hurled at those of us with different views on both \nsides. I also disagree with the decision by the Republican leadership \nto make up new rules, ignoring our ability to have an impact right now \nthrough the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act that passed 400-25.\n  The consequences of this deal, Mr. Speaker, present us with some \nharsh realities, but rather than denying them, it is now time for \nCongress to begin the work of defying them, and it will require \nbipartisan support to do it.\n  That means ramping up intelligence sharing and counterterrorism \ncooperation with Israel and our Gulf partners and making clear to our \nallies that Iran's violent activities in the region will not be \ntolerated. It means enhancing Israel's qualitative military edge and \nmaking Iran know that the penalties should it cheat and break out to a \nbomb will be punishing.\n  It means intensifying sanctions already enshrined in U.S. law for \nIranian support for terrorism and violation of human rights. President \nObama rightly made this point last week: nothing in this deal prevents \nthe United States from sanctioning people, banks, and businesses that \nsupport terrorism, and we must do so together.\n  What happens next? I will vote against the deal. Mr. Speaker, there \nwill be a day after the final resolution of this nuclear deal, and on \nthat day, this House must work together to ensure that Iran's terrorism \nis checked and that Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon. On that, we \nall agree.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. McCaul), chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and a \nmember of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, for the last decade, Congress has passed \nbipartisan sanctions to get to the point where we are today, and the \npurpose of these sanctions was to dismantle Iran's nuclear weapons \nprogram.\n  This agreement does not achieve that goal. In fact, this agreement \nputs Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terror, on a glidepath \nto a nuclear bomb. Proponents say it is the only alternative to war, \nbut I believe that is a false choice.\n  I recently met with Prime Minister Netanyahu, and he agreed that our \ngoal should be a good deal, but that we cannot put our security at risk \nfor a bad deal. Make no mistake, this is a bad deal for America and for \nour allies.\n  It will not stop Iran's nuclear program. It will leave Iran with the \ningredients for a bomb and infrastructure to build it, and it will \nspark a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. It will give Iran a cash \nwindfall, freeing up over $100 billion to fuel the regime's global \ncampaign of Islamist terror.\n  Incredibly, this agreement lifts restrictions on Iran's ballistic \nmissiles, which the Ayatollah himself said that they will mass-produce. \nThere is only one reason to develop an ICBM, Mr. Speaker, and that is \nto deliver a nuclear warhead across continents, which means the United \nStates.\n  A top Iranian general bragged recently that his country will have ``a \nnew ballistic missile test in the near future that will be a thorn in \nthe eyes of our enemies.''\n  President Reagan's famous negotiating advice was to ``trust, but \nverify.'' We can't trust a regime that has cheated on every deal. \nPresident Rouhani says his country's centrifuges will never stop \nspinning and that they will ``buy, sell, and develop any weapons we \nneed and will not ask for permission or abide by any resolution.''\n  Now, the White House is counting on verification measures spelled out \nin secret side deals between Iran and the IAEA, which Secretary Kerry \ntestified to me that even he has not seen. Astoundingly, the AP reports \nthat the side deal allows Iran to self-inspect its nuclear sites.\n  Now, the American people, through their representatives in Congress, \nare expected to vote on this measure without seeing these secret deals, \nwhich goes to the heart of verification. This, in my judgment, is \nnothing short of reckless.\n  Let's be clear-eyed about what we are debating. This was not a \nnegotiation with an honest government; it was a negotiation with \nterrorists who chant ``death to America'' and are responsible for more \nthan a thousand American casualties in Iraq alone. If we allow this \ndeal to go forward, we are putting the security of the world at grave \nrisk.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, for the sake of our Nation's security and in \ndefense of the free world, I cannot in good conscience support this \nagreement.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Florida, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the motion \nto approve this agreement. After a thorough review process, I believe \nit is in the best national security interests of the United States and \nour allies for Congress to support the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction.\n  I have been a public official for nearly 23 years. This is the most \nconsequential vote I have taken and the most difficult decision I have \never faced. I have spent the review period methodically going through \nthe agreement, raising concerns with the administration, and speaking \nwith independent sources, including nuclear nonproliferation experts, \neconomists, and foreign ambassadors.\n  I also held a series of meetings and spoke with many constituents who \nfervently hold very strong and differing positions. My goal was to \ndetermine whether the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is the most \nlikely path to prevent Iran from achieving their nuclear weapons goals.\n  This agreement is clearly not perfect. It is one tool that we have to \ncombat Iran's nuclear ambitions. Ultimately, my support is based on \nsubstance. Importantly, my Jewish identity and Jewish heart weighed \nheavily in my decisionmaking process.\n  As we listen to Iran's leaders call for the destruction of the Jewish \npeople in Israel, history offers a brutal reminder of what happens when \nwe do not listen.\n\n  Iran continues to be a leading state sponsor of terrorism, but an \nIran with a nuclear weapon or Hezbollah or Hamas with a nuclear shield \nis far\n\n[[Page H5916]]\n\nmore dangerous. With the JCPOA in place, we will have Iran's nuclear \nprogram under the most intrusive monitoring and inspection mechanisms \nin place, while we continue to combat Iran's terrorist reach.\n  I have personally spoken with the President and my colleagues about \nsteps that we must and will take to continue strengthening Israel's and \nour other allies' intelligence and military capabilities. Opponents say \nwe must press for a better deal, but after thoroughly investigating \nthis prospect, I am left with no evidence that one is likely or even \npossible.\n  I heard directly from our allies, top diplomats, and analysts from \nacross the political spectrum that the sanctions regime that we have in \nplace now will erode, if not completely fall apart. Moreover, our \npartners will not come back to the negotiating table, and neither will \nIran, and no one opposed to this deal has produced any evidence to the \ncontrary.\n  I cannot comprehend why we would walk away from the safeguards in \nthis agreement, leaving Iran speeding toward a nuclear weapon. \nSafeguards like 24/7/365 access, monitoring all of Iran's previously \ndeclared nuclear sites, eliminating 98 percent of Iran's highly \nenriched uranium stockpile, and the unprecedented standard of \nmonitoring every stage of the nuclear supply chain.\n  Even if Iran cheats, we will know much more about their nuclear \nprogram, allowing us to more effectively eliminate it if that ever \nbecomes necessary.\n  As a Jewish mother and as a Member of Congress, nothing is more \nimportant to me than ensuring the safety and security of the United \nStates and Israel. I am confident that supporting this agreement is the \nbest opportunity that we have to do that.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have an expression in Judaism, may the United States \ngo from strength to strength, and as we say in synagogue, the people of \nIsrael live--am Yisrael chai.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Hensarling), chairman of the Committee on Financial Services.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to President \nObama's nuclear deal with Iran. Now, the President says it is a good \ndeal; and you know what, he is right. It is a very good deal for Iran; \nbut it is a very bad deal for America.\n  I fear, in his rush to try to build a legacy, the President has \nclearly given up far too much for far too little. He has done this at \nthe expense of our security, as well as the security of our friend \nIsrael and other U.S. allies.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a deadly serious matter. The first thing the \nPresident does in his agreement with Iran is to give them some startup \ncapital. An estimated $120 billion held abroad will now be repatriated \nback to Iran's central bank, $120 billion to a regime whose Supreme \nLeader, to this day, calls for the annihilation of Israel, a regime \nthat still chants ``death to America,'' a regime that has put bounties \non the heads of American soldiers and has the blood of American \ncitizens on its hands, a regime whose sponsorship of Hezbollah has left \nour closest ally in the region, Israel, with 80,000 rockets trained on \nit.\n  In sum, it is a regime that simply represents the world's largest and \nmost dangerous state sponsor of terrorism.\n  Now, President Obama would have us believe that waiving sanctions \nagainst this regime would make the world safer, but this is the very \nsame President that dismissed the Islamic State as the JV team, and we \nsee what that has gotten us.\n  This is simply not an administration whose assessment of national \nsecurity threats is credible, and the stakes involved with a nuclear \nIran leave zero room for error.\n  In truth, Mr. Speaker, I fear it is we who sent the JV team to \nnegotiate with Iran. Sadly, they were outplayed, outmaneuvered, and \noutwitted; and the result of their failure is the dangerous agreement \nwe have before us today.\n  It is such a flawed agreement that the President, yet again, tells \nCongress we have to pass something to actually find out what is in it. \nIn other words, the President has utterly failed to provide the secret \nside agreements.\n  President Obama once told us we cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear \nweapon, but under his deal, Iran's nuclear program will not be \ndismantled, only temporarily slowed, and that is if the Iranians don't \ncheat; but the President's team has failed to achieve anytime, anywhere \ninspections. Thus, it will be impossible to ensure the Iranians aren't \ncheating.\n  Ah, but don't worry, Mr. Speaker, we are told the Iranians will turn \nthemselves in if they cheat--really? In short, the President's \nagreement rewards Iran's terrorist-sponsoring regime with billions of \ndollars in relief without any guarantee of compliance.\n  When you look at the record, Mr. Speaker, I don't trust this \nadministration. I don't trust the Iranians. Why would we ever trust the \ntwo together? For the sake of our national security, I urge all of my \ncolleagues to reject this flawed, dangerous agreement.\n  Mr. ENGEL. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina \n(Mr. Price).\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong \nsupport of this historic nuclear agreement reached by the United States \nand our negotiating partners with Iran. For the sake of our national \nsecurity and that of our allies, we must seize this unique opportunity.\n  In the midst of all these wild charges, let's just try to get some \nperspective. In fact, this agreement goes far beyond any negotiated \nnuclear deal in history.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  It will reduce Iran's stockpiled uranium by nearly 98 percent; it \nwill permanently prevent the plutonium pathway to a nuclear weapon at \nArak; it will disable and mothball two-thirds of Iran's enrichment \ncentrifuges, including more advanced models; it will terminate all \nenrichment at Fordow; and it will provide for intrusive inspections of \nnuclear sites in perpetuity.\n  This is an unprecedented degrading--not just a freezing, a massive \ndegrading--of Iran's nuclear program. No military strike or strikes \ncould achieve as much.\n  I challenge any of the agreement's detractors to present a viable \nalternative that achieves the same result and will verifiably prevent a \nnuclear-armed Iran for the foreseeable future. They won't--and they \nhaven't--because they can't. There simply isn't a viable diplomatic or \nmilitary alternative for preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon.\n  The notion that we could somehow unilaterally reject the agreement \nand still compel the P5+1 to resume negotiations is pure fantasy. Our \ninternational partners have made clear that reinstating the effective \nsanctions regime that brought Iran to the negotiating table would be \nimpossible. For Congress to scuttle the deal would destroy our \ncredibility as a negotiating party and would very likely put Iran right \nback on the path to developing a weapon.\n  The stakes couldn't be higher. The nuclear issue should transcend \npolitical opportunism and partisan rancor. We should be working \ntogether across party lines to ensure the swift and effective \nimplementation of the JCPOA. We should be exploring ways that we can \nenhance cooperative efforts with Israel and the international community \nto address Iran's support for Hezbollah and its gross abuse of human \nrights as well as other critical challenges in the Middle East.\n  Today, we can start down that path by supporting the agreement. I \nurge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the resolution of approval.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina \n(Ms. Foxx).\n  Ms. FOXX. I want to thank my colleague from the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee for his leadership on this work.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong opposition to this \nlegislation that would clear the way for the President's misguided deal \nwith Iran.\n  The United States must continue to stand between Iran and nuclear \nweapons capability, but instead, the deal legitimizes Iran's nuclear \nachievements and strengthens its extremist regime.\n  The agreement gradually removes the key barriers that prevent Iran \nfrom obtaining nuclear weapons capabilities, from growing its economic \ninfluence in the Middle East, and from continuing its state funding of \nterrorist organizations that threaten the security of the country and \nthe well-being of our allies.\n  This deal lifts critical economic sanctions that have limited Iran's\n\n[[Page H5917]]\n\nscope of influence in the region, removes the arms embargo, and lifts \nmissile program restrictions.\n  For these reasons, I oppose the President's deal and urge my \ncolleagues to oppose this legislation.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire how much time I have \nremaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ENGEL. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nLipinski).\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, the Iran nuclear agreement should be \njudged on what is best for our national security and what is more \nlikely to produce peace. I believe that peace has a better chance if we \nreject this deal, keep sanctions on, and go back to the negotiating \ntable to get a better agreement.\n  This agreement was supposed to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear \nweapon, but, at best, Iran will be a nuclear threshold state in 15 \nyears. By practically guaranteeing and legitimizing this access, there \nwill be a rush by others in the region to gain their own nuclear \nweapons, creating an enormously dangerous arms race in the most \nvolatile part of the world.\n  The inspections protocols in the agreement are troubling because they \ngive Iran 24 days to delay inspection requests at suspected nuclear \nsites, a far cry from ``anytime, anywhere.'' And the agreement contains \ndeeply concerning sanctions relief on Iran's acquisition of \nconventional weapons and ballistic missile technology in 5 and 8 years, \nrespectively.\n  These are just some of my concerns that lead me, after careful \nconsideration, to oppose this agreement.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should and we can do better. I urge my colleagues to \nreject this resolution.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nTrott).\n  Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking \nMember Engel for all of their hard work.\n  The fact that we are even debating whether to enter into this \nagreement is very troubling.\n  Let's be clear what we are talking about. The United States of \nAmerica is going to enter into a deal with a rogue nation who refuses \nto release the four Americans they are holding, who has cheated on \nevery deal they have been party to over the past 30 years, who is a \nparty to secret deals we cannot see, who calls all of us the Great \nSatan, who calls for death to our citizens and wants to wipe Israel off \nthe face of the Earth. And we are told the deal is necessary because \nthe United States of America has no other option.\n  Has it really come to this? We have options. One option is a better \ndeal, and a better deal looks like this: release the four Americans, no \nsunset clause, and inspections just like we were promised--anytime, \nanywhere. And if these terms are unacceptable to Iran, then the United \nStates of America will use all of its economic might to put tough \nsanctions back in place.\n  If we do this deal, let's look at what the next 25 years looks like.\n  Immediately, in the next 12 months, Iran will get their hands on $50 \nbillion to $150 billion. The money will not be used for their citizens. \nIt will be used to perpetuate terror around the world. Iran will get \nits money; we won't get our four Americans.\n  Over the next 12 months, they will start to cheat and they will get a \nbomb or two. Over the next 12 months, we are going to start an arms \nrace in the Middle East. Over the next 1 to 5 years, we will try and \nsnap back sanctions, but that will be ineffective because all the long-\nterm contracts will be grandfathered in.\n  In 5 years, Iran will be buying conventional weapons. In 8 years, \nthey will have a ballistic missile. In 10 years, because of their \ncheating, they will have a ballistic missile with a nuclear bomb \npointed at the United States of America. And in 25 years, our \nfriend and ally Israel may not exist.\n\n  I was in business for 30 years before I got here, and the one thing I \nknew is you cannot do a good deal with a bad guy.\n  We cannot do this deal with Iran.\n  Mr. ENGEL. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nNadler).\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution of \napproval of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n  Throughout this debate, there have been accusations questioning the \nmotives and loyalties of Members in making this decision. It is \nprecisely because I believe this agreement is in the interest of the \nUnited States and because I have been a strong supporter of Israel my \nentire life that I am supporting the Iran nuclear agreement.\n  This must not be a vote of politics but of conscience. I, for one, \ncould not live with myself if I voted in a way that I believe would put \nthe lives of Americans and Israelis at greater risk of an Iranian \nnuclear bomb.\n  My priority and overriding objective in assessing this agreement has \nbeen to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. The interests of \nthe United States and of Israel in this respect are identical. In \naddition to constituting an existential threat to Israel, a nuclear-\narmed Iran would make Iran's conventional threats more dangerous and \ndifficult to counter and pose a greater danger to the United States, to \nthe region, and to the world.\n  The question before us is not whether this is a good deal. The \nquestion is which of the two options available to us--supporting or \nrejecting the deal--is more likely to avert a nuclear-armed Iran. I \nhave concluded, after examining all the arguments, that supporting the \nIran nuclear agreement gives us the better chance of preventing Iran \nfrom developing a nuclear weapon.\n  The agreement will shut Iran's pathways to developing the necessary \nfissionable material for a nuclear bomb for at least 15 years. The \ninspection and verification procedures against illicit plutonium \nproduction or uranium enrichment are airtight.\n  The questions that have been raised about inspection procedures--the \nso-called side deals, the alleged self-inspection--do not relate to the \ncentral issue of production of fissionable material. And without \nfissionable material, you cannot make a bomb.\n  Even after 15 years, when some of the restrictions will be eased, we \nwould still know instantly about any attempt to make bomb materials \nbecause the inspectors and the electronic and photographic surveillance \nwill still be there. The options available to a future President for \nstopping Iran then would be better than the options available now if \nthe deal is rejected because we would have more access, instant \nintelligence, and more knowledge of the Iranian program.\n  The argument that if we reject the deal, we can force Iran back to \nthe negotiating table and obtain a better deal is a fantasy. It is not \na viable alternative. The other countries that have joined us in \nmultilateral sanctions against Iran have made it clear that they will \ndrop their sanctions if we reject the deal; and American sanctions, by \nthemselves, have been proven ineffective in coercing Iran.\n  We must be very clear that, if necessary, the United States will use \nmilitary force to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb; but the odds of that \nbeing necessary are significantly less with approval of this deal than \nwith rejection of the agreement.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ENGEL. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. NADLER. Going forward, it remains vital that we continue to \npursue ways to further guarantee the security of the United States, of \nIsrael, and of our other allies in the Middle East. This will require \nstrict and diligent oversight of the implementation of the agreement, \nmaintaining Israel's qualitative military edge, and countering Iran's \nsupport for terrorism and other destabilizing conduct.\n  We must be ready to take action against Iran's nefarious behavior, \nand Iran must know that the United States will never allow it to pose a \nnuclear threat to the region and the world.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nDent), chairman of the Committee on Ethics.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill and the \nunderlying Iran nuclear agreement.\n  Despite entering into these negotiations from a position of \nstrength--that would be the United States--the deal before us fails to \nachieve the goal of preventing Iran's capacity to develop a nuclear \nweapon. It simply contains or manages Iran's nuclear program.\n\n[[Page H5918]]\n\n  By agreeing to a lax enforcement and inspections regime and fanciful, \nunrealistic snapback sanctions, the administration has accepted that \nIran should remain 1 year away from a nuclear bomb. I am not prepared \nto accept that. The sanctions relief will provide Iran with billions of \ndollars of funds that will bolster the Revolutionary Guard and nonstate \nmilitant groups. The deal ends the conventional arms embargo and the \nprohibition on ballistic missile technology. Not only will this result \nin conventional arms flowing to groups like Hezbollah, it concedes the \ndelivery system for a nuclear bomb.\n  This agreement will provide Iran with nuclear infrastructure, a \nmissile delivery system, and the funds to pay for it all. And, by the \nway, the I in ICBM means ``intercontinental.'' I don't believe that New \nZealand and Mexico are the intended targets. That would be us.\n  This deal cripples and shatters the current notion of nuclear \nnonproliferation. If Iran can enrich uranium, which they can under this \nagreement, their Gulf Arab neighbors will likely want to do the same.\n  I do not want a nuclear arms race, a nuclearized Middle East, a \nregion of state instability in irrational nonstate actors. Someone \nexplain to me how deterrence works under that scenario. We should not \nreward the ayatollahs with billions of dollars and sophisticated \nweapons in exchange for temporary and unenforceable nuclear \nrestrictions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have always supported a diplomatic resolution to the \nIran nuclear issue, but this is a dangerously weak agreement. I urge my \ncolleagues to reject it.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Vargas).\n  Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Joint Comprehensive \nPlan of Action between the P5+1 and Iran. The deal fails to dismantle \nIran's nuclear program. It fails to guarantee intrusive enough \ninspections to ensure that Iran does not cheat, it fails to keep Iran \nfrom achieving nuclear threshold status, and it rewards Iran's horrific \nbehavior.\n  In the initial phase of this agreement, Iran would quickly receive a \nwhopping sanctions relief package potentially totaling $150 billion. We \nall know that Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism \nand that this money will embolden a regime openly committed to \nconfronting the United States and destabilizing the Middle East.\n  In 8 years, Iran legally begins expanding its ballistic missile \nprogram and continues expanding its intercontinental ballistic missile \nprogram under the guise of satellite testing.\n  And who do we think these missiles are aimed at?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ENGEL. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman.\n  Mr. VARGAS. As recently as yesterday, Ayatollah Khamenei declared: \n``I am saying to Israel that they would not live to see the end of \nthese 25 years. There will be no such thing as a Zionist regime in 25 \nyears.''\n  This is a bad deal, and we should reject it.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Conaway), chairman of the Committee on Agriculture.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. I thank Chairman Royce for yielding time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the approval process that \nis going on and the underlying deal with Iran. It is one of the most \nconsequential foreign policy issues that we will confront, certainly \nsince I have been here and, I expect, for the next several decades.\n  This is a terrible deal. I can't state it any more forcefully.\n  We have seen this movie before. In 1994, President Bill Clinton made \na deal with North Korea. His deal with North Korea would rid the Korean \nPeninsula of nuclear weapons and would usher North Korea onto the stage \nas a responsible citizen of the world's nations. That didn't happen. \nThis is the exact same verbiage we heard on this floor then that is \nbeing said tonight, and this is the exact same outcome we will get with \nIran and their nuclear program.\n  Look at their current record. Chief sponsor of state terrorism around \nthe world. As their economy improves with the dropping of the sanctions \nand the resources they will get, do you realistically think that this \nayatollah will, in fact, become a moderate voice within his country?\n  Do you not think he will take those resources and expand the mischief \nand terror that he has conducted around the world already under the \nsanctions that were in place?\n  The other side has already given up on the snapback provisions. They \nhave argued very eloquently that those won't happen because we can't \nreinforce the sanctions that were the heart of what got Iran at the \ntable today.\n  Mr. Speaker, this deal ushers in a world that is less safe, less \nstable, and less secure.\n  Trust must be earned. I trust Iran's word when they say that Israel \nmust go away. I trust Iran when they say ``death to America.'' I do not \ntrust Iran when they say they will abide by this agreement.\n  I wouldn't play golf with these people because golf is one of those \nevents where you have to self-assess your penalties. They will not do \nthat in playing golf, and they are not about to do it with respect to \nthis nuclear program that is going on.\n  We have no way of knowing what their covert activities might be over \nthe next several years. They will cheat. They have cheated, and they \nwill continue to cheat. We cannot trust these people with a deal.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion of approval and \nreject this deal. Tell the world where we stand. Whether our partners \naround the world can see the clear-eyed threat that these folks \nrepresent to the world for the next several decades, we can see it, and \nwe must vote ``no.''\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Hinojosa).\n  Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.J. Res. \n64, which disapproves of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \nnegotiated by the P5+1.\n  I reviewed the agreement thoroughly, participated in classified \nbriefings, and listened to the many details and intricacies present by \nthe nuclear and security experts on all sides. This agreement may not \nbe perfect, but it is the most viable option we have in reducing Iran's \ncapability of acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  The JCPOA prolongs Iran's nuclear weapon breakout time, reduces their \nnumber of operating centrifuges, and decreases Iran's current stockpile \nof low enriched uranium.\n  More importantly, the agreement allows the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency the ability to access and inspect Iran to verify and \nensure compliance.\n  Should Iran cheat, the international community will come together and \nonce again reimpose the sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating \ntable.\n  In every situation that involves the possibility of using military \nforce to overcome a threat, I will always side with exploring and \nexhausting every possible avenue towards a diplomatic resolution first.\n  I support the JCPOA because it provides a reasonable, balanced, and \ndiplomatic solution rather than a worst-case scenario.\n  In closing, with the support of 36 retired generals and admirals and \n29 of the Nation's top scientists, I am confident we are on the right \ntrack with this plan. All of these highly distinguished and experienced \nleaders agree that this agreement is the most effective means currently \navailable to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Messer), the chair of the Republican Policy Committee.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this legislation and \nthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear \ndeal. A chief reason for this opposition is important, yet simple: The \nIran nuclear deal doesn't make America safer, it doesn't make Israel \nsafer, and it doesn't make the rest of the world safer either.\n\n[[Page H5919]]\n\n  Whatever your thoughts on this Iran nuclear deal, we should all be \nable to agree, the world will be a much more dangerous and unstable \nplace if Iran were to obtain a nuclear weapon. Unfortunately, the deal \nthe President negotiated won't stop that from happening.\n  Instead, under this deal, Iran gets to keep its nuclear facilities. \nAmazingly, it will be allowed to self-police those facilities and \nreport directly to the IAEA, an idea that would be laughable if it were \nnot so crazy.\n\n  Iran will get to enrich uranium, all while receiving sanctions relief \nto the tune of $150 billion--$150 billion pumped into a $400 billion a \nyear national economy; $150 billion that will no doubt be used by Iran \nto bankroll terrorist organizations, further destabilize the Middle \nEast, and continue their work to wipe Israel off the map.\n  It was Ronald Reagan who said ``trust but verify'' during arms \ncontrol negotiations with Communist Russia more than a generation ago, \nbut it seems the Obama administration is asking us to trust Iran and \nthen trust some more. Well, I'm not willing to do that, and the \nAmerican people aren't willing to do that either.\n  We need to stop this bad deal before it is too late and negotiate a \nbetter deal, a deal that stops Iran's nuclear program and ensures the \nsafety of America, Israel, and the rest of the world now and into the \nfuture.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nEngel) has expired.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and \nagainst the resolution--well, actually, in favor of the resolution of \napproval.\n  I must say, in starting, we are at a paradoxical moment. The fears, \nthe haunting specter, a terrible thing, the existential threats posed \nby a nuclear Iran are all legitimate fears and legitimate haunting \nspecters, regional hegemony to be avoided.\n  But ironically, those concerns and those fears and those outcomes \nraised by my friends on the other side of the aisle and the opponents \nof this agreement actually come true and are realized if we do what \nthey want us to do, which is to reject this agreement.\n  The alternative to this agreement is an opaque, unconstrained Iranian \nnuclear program, Mr. Speaker, hanging like the sword of Damocles over \nall of our heads. And the security of the United States and Israel and \nregional partners, who knows?\n  The false hope offered by the critics is let's return to the \nnegotiating table to seek a better deal. A man that I respect, at one \nof our hearings that Chairman Ed Royce chaired on the House Foreign \nAffairs Committee, former Senator Joe Lieberman, said just that.\n  I said: How did that work? He said: Well, let's just go back to the \npartners and Iran and say, we just couldn't sell it; let's start over.\n  The proposition that we would renounce our own agreement that we \nnegotiated, wrought by more than a year of tough negotiations, and \nexpect that our negotiating partners, including Russia and China and, \nof course, Iran itself, would sit back down at the table and start all \nover again under our leadership is specious, if not delusional, as an \nargument.\n  We cannot be naive about the scenario in which Congress rejects this \nagreement brokered by our own country. Among our allies, we divest \nourselves of the goodwill that undergirded these negotiations; and \namong our adversaries, we would confirm their suspicion we cannot be \ntrusted.\n  The international sanctions regime that drove Iran to the negotiating \ntable would collapse, and our diplomatic leverage would be diminished \nin all future U.S.-led negotiations.\n  Most concerning of all, we would return, once again, to the situation \nwe are at, one of deep anxiety and uncertainty regarding Iran's nuclear \nambitions.\n  Critics of the agreement have offered no alternative and have tried \nto define that agreement by what it is not. It is not a perfect deal \nthat dismantles every nut and bolt of the Iranian nuclear development \nprogram, peaceful or otherwise.\n  It is not a comprehensive resolution of the entire relationship and \nthe myriad issues the U.S. and our allies have with the repressive \nregime in Tehran and its reprehensible support for terrorist \ninsurgencies in the region. No one ever said it would be.\n  What arms control agreement in the history of our country has ever \nattempted to circumscribe every aspect of a relationship with an \nadversary?\n  And certainly not this one. In other words, this agreement is the \ndiplomatic alternative we sought to attain when we entered into these \nvery negotiations.\n  The deal adheres to the high standards of verification, transparency, \nand compliance on which any acceptable agreement with Iran must be \nfounded. That isn't just my word. That is what former Republican \nSecretary of State Colin Powell says. That is what Republican former \nNSC Adviser Brent Scowcroft says. That is what former Republican \nSenator John Warner from my State says.\n  The agreement erects an unprecedented and intrusive inspection regime \nthat provides the IAEA with access to declared nuclear facilities and \nsuspected covert nuclear development sites.\n  Additionally, they will be able to monitor Iran's entire nuclear \nprogram supply chain, including uranium mines, mills, centrifuges, \nrotors, bellows production, storage facilities, and dedicated \nprocurement for nuclear-related or dual-use materials technology.\n  The agreement also rolls back major components and places strict \nrestrictions on the Iranian nuclear program. If these restrictions are \nnot adhered to, the United States can, at any time, unilaterally revive \nthe sanctions currently in place.\n  Congress should immediately begin to conduct close oversight to \nensure those terms are implemented and that Iran is living up to its \nobligations.\n  This isn't about trust. It was Ronald Reagan who said ``trust, but \nverify.'' Former Secretary of State Clinton today kind of echoed those \nwords, saying ``distrust and verify,'' and that is why she supports the \nagreement. It does just that.\n  More broadly, the United States must signal to Iran that its \ncondemnable record on human rights, terrorism, and regional subversion \nwill not be tolerated; nor will we hide, with this agreement, that \naction and our response to it. In fact, quite the opposite. We will \nredouble our efforts to stop them in that egregious behavior.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, article I, section 8, clause 11, of the \nConstitution vests Congress with the duty to authorize war.\n  Implicit in that text is Congress' additional responsibility to \nexhaust all reasonable alternatives before committing the American \npeople and our men and women in uniform to such a fateful path.\n  The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action represents our best endeavor \nto provide just that alternative. It is the product of earnest \ndiplomacy. Congress should put aside partisanship and support it for \nthe sake of our country.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, several Members spoke of Iran's commitments under this \nagreement. While it is true that Iran has committed to taking certain \nsteps under the agreement, it is also true that Iranians have never \ncomplied with any agreement related to its weapons program.\n  So let's start with considering what Iran's leaders have been saying \ntoday about this agreement. This is what they say. They say that Iran \ncan pursue the development of missiles without any restrictions. How \ncan that be, given what is in this agreement?\n  Well, President Rouhani--the supposed moderate here--has argued \nrepeatedly that the only restrictions on Iran's missile developments \nare in the U.N. Security Council resolution.\n  Endorsing the deal, he says, it is not in the agreement itself. They \ndon't recognize the Security Council resolution. So he says: We are not \nrestricted by this agreement. So what the gentleman is quoting, they \nsay they are not restricted by that.\n  Mr. Speaker, Iranian leaders say that Iran can violate the U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions without violating the agreement. Sanctions \ndo not, therefore, snap back if Iran violates\n\n[[Page H5920]]\n\nthe U.N. Security Council resolutions, according to Iran, and that Iran \nintends to violate the U.N. Security Council restrictions on weapons \nsales and on imports.\n  This is President Rouhani again:\n\n       We will sell and buy weapons whenever and wherever we deem \n     it necessary. We will not wait for permission from anyone or \n     any resolution.\n\n  So Iran's defense minister has said that Iran is negotiating right \nnow to purchase Russian fighter jets. We know they are negotiating in \nterms of ballistic missiles right now. They are in violation of the \nagreement, yet we don't see any intention to enforce that.\n  So we have got to ask ourselves: Just what kind of agreement is this? \nWho is this agreement with?\n  As the committee heard yesterday, it is an agreement with a regime \nwhose world view was founded in large part on a fiery theological anti-\nAmericanism and a view of Americanism as Satanism.\n  I don't have to tell the Members here. I mean, they hear it every \nweek, those of you that are watching what is coming out of Iran ``death \nto America'' every week.\n  Mr. Speaker, this agreement gives up too much too fast with not \nenough in return, and we have to judge it on the long-term national \nsecurity interests of the United States.\n  Does it make the region and the world more safe, secure, stable? In \nmy mind, clearly it does not. So I don't feel this is worthy of the \nHouse's support.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford).\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I too rise in opposition to the so-called \nIran nuclear accord. I do so for all the reasons that have been well-\narticulated over the last couple of hours.\n  But I also do so based simply on the reason of history. And it is a \nhistory that is actually shared with the chairman, in that we were here \ntogether in the 1990s.\n  Then-President Clinton at that time met with North Korea. They formed \nan accord that basically said: We will give you benefits now for the \npromise of becoming a responsible member of the world community going \nforward. The benefits went and accrued to North Korea. The responsible \nmembership in the world community never came.\n  In that regard, though, the President is certainly well-intended in \nhis efforts. This promise will prove as real as this notion of, if you \nlike your health insurance, you can keep it.\n  His intentions were good in that regard, with regard to providing \nhealth insurance, but it just didn't pan out. I don't think it will be \nany different in this particular deal.\n  In that regard, I think it is important to think about what neighbors \nthink of neighbors. In this case, it is important to look at what the \nPrime Minister of Israel has said in that he believes this is a mistake \nof ``historic proportions.''\n  I think in many ways it mirrors what we saw in 1938. At that point, \nNeville Chamberlain negotiated with Hitler and gave away Czechoslovakia \nin the process.\n  But there in the Munich accords there was this promise of peace, \nlasting peace in our time. The peace lasted less than a year, and it \ndid not materialize.\n  I think that the saying is that those who don't learn from history \nare destined to repeat it.\n  I think we would be very well-advised to look at the recent history \nof the 1990s in the North Korea deal, the history of the 1930s, and a \nwhole lot of history across the last 1,000 years that say trading off \npeace for security is never something that works so well.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, before I recognize the gentleman from New \nYork, I would simply say I think that last analogy is invidious.\n  The history of World War II is the fact that people ignored warnings \nfor so long that, by the time Munich happened, it most certainly was \nappeasement.\n  What should have happened was active engagement to preclude that ever \nhappening. That is precisely what this administration has done.\n  It will prevent a Munich. It will prevent appeasement. It will \nprovide the dynamic engagement we need to prevent a nuclear Iran.\n  I now proudly yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nMeeks).\n  Mr. MEEKS. I thank the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. Speaker, Dr. King once said, ``On some positions, Cowardice asks \nthe question, `Is it safe?' Expediency asks the question, `Is it \npolitic?' Vanity asks the question, `Is it popular?' But Conscience \nasks the question, `Is it right?' And there comes a time when one must \ntake a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but one \nmust take it because one's conscience tells one that it is right.''\n  I have often reflected on those words when faced with tough \ndecisions.\n  Today's vote on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is one of the \nmost consequential votes we will take as Members of Congress.\n  My support for the Iran agreement is about doing what is right for \nAmerica, our allies, and the world. It is, indeed, a matter of \nconscience.\n  Mr. Speaker, since the conclusion of the agreement, I have traveled \nto 10 nations and vetted this deal from every angle I could think of so \nthat, at this moment of decision, I could act without reservation and \nwith full understanding.\n  As I listen to this debate, I am deeply disheartened that we are not \nadequately weighing the realities of our globalized world.\n  After years of effort toward a more unified approach to addressing \nIran's nuclear ambitions, key partners in the Middle East region and \nmost of our allies consider the Iran agreement as an important next \nstep in diplomatic efforts.\n  Former U.S. ambassadors; former Israeli military; former U.S. \nSecretaries of State, including Colin Powell; and so many others from \nan array of vantage points have expressed support for this landmark \ndeal, as have over 100 nations.\n  We should not ignore the considered judgment of scientists, security \nexperts, renowned diplomats, and our allies. The consensus is that this \nis a good deal.\n  Now, some of my colleagues believe that, despite the risk, rejecting \nthis deal can lead to a better deal down the road. Others oppose the \ndeal out of reckless political gamesmanship.\n  But what has become clear to me in my assessment of the risks \ninvolved in supporting or rejecting the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction is that, if Congress derails this deal, history will record such \nact as a monumental mistake and the alternatives would not change \nIranian nuclear and weaponization pursuits.\n  Mr. Speaker, rejecting the plan and resorting to unilateral sanctions \nwould prove futile, as it has in the past, while relying on military \naction would not curb Iran's ambitions or erase its technical \nknowledge.\n  Critics also assert that this deal does not address concerns about \nissues with Iran that are outside the scope of the plan. We know from \npast experience that reaching an agreement on one critical issue does \nnot preclude us from working on other serious concerns by other means.\n  We negotiated with the Soviet Union during Strategic Arms Limitation \nTalks, which took place in the midst of the Vietnam war that was waged \nagainst us with Soviet-made arms, yet those agreements lessened the \ndanger of nuclear confrontation.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration has shown tremendous \nleadership on the world stage by choosing diplomacy first. Leadership \nis never easy. By definition, it is a lonely and sometimes an unpopular \nexercise.\n  Today we must show leadership, we must display fortitude, and do what \nis right. And what is right in this scenario is that we support the \nIran agreement.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Lamborn).\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, this deal is a capitulation by the greatest \nnation in the world to the most rogue nation in the world.\n  What makes the deal so bad is that Iran doesn't even have to cheat to \nemerge in 10 or 15 years with an industrial-sized nuclear program and \nwith little or no breakout time to achieve nuclear weapons \ncapabilities.\n  By lifting the financial sanctions, we are literally financing the \nvery weapons and terror that will be directed at us and our allies by \nthe biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world today.\n\n[[Page H5921]]\n\n  Amazingly, we are abandoning the arms embargo and the ballistic \nmissile embargo against Iran for good measure.\n  Not only is our national security threatened, but our close ally, \nIsrael, fears for its very existence under this deal. We simply cannot \nabandon Israel.\n  Let history record that I stand against this weak and dangerous deal \nwith a regime that hates the U.S. and hates Israel.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards).\n  Ms. EDWARDS. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution approving the \nJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action regarding the nuclear program of \nIran negotiated by the Obama administration in concert with five other \nnations, the P5+1.\n  I want to commend President Obama's Secretary Kerry, Under Secretary \nSherman, Secretary Moniz, and their teams for their leadership and \ncontinued, persistent engagement with our international partners and \nMembers of Congress to make this moment possible.\n  None of us comes to this decision lightly. It is perhaps the most \nimportant decision of our public life, no matter what decision we come \nto.\n  But after reading the agreement and the classified and unclassified \nunderlying documents, taking part in numerous briefings at the White \nHouse and here on Capitol Hill, meeting with constituents, and studying \nthe analyses of experts, I am confident that this strong diplomatic \nachievement provides the only option that prevents Iran from obtaining \na nuclear weapon and, by some estimates, in as few as 2 to 3 months. \nThis is not achieved by trust, Mr. Speaker, but through verification.\n  Mr. Speaker, after 14 years of continuous military engagement for our \narmed services, this agreement cuts off all pathways to an Iranian \nnuclear weapon and does so without unnecessarily risking American lives \nin yet another military action, even as the agreement preserves that \nultimate option, should it become necessary in the event of Iran's \ndefault.\n  This agreement sends a clear message to Iran that the global \ncommunity stands united today and well into the future in ensuring that \nIran never obtains a nuclear weapon.\n  Much has been said of Iran's capacity after 10 to 15 years. And even \nthere, the agreement places Iran in the confines of a nuclear non-\nproliferation treaty, just as the rest of us are.\n  If Iran violates the agreement, they will, without question, face \ncomplete isolation, even more severe repercussions, and the U.S. \nretains our ability to engage unilateral sanctions and our military \noption.\n  It is true that this agreement is not perfect. But if this agreement \ndoes not go forward, there is no better deal, Mr. Speaker. In fact, \nthere is no deal. No sanctions, no international partners, no \ninspections, no deal. This is a negotiation which is, by definition, \nnot perfect.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  It is my hope that we will divorce ourselves from the hyperbole and \nthe rhetoric in favor of the seriousness this issue deserves. I have \nconcluded that the agreement is the best path forward.\n  This is not just my considered judgment; it is the judgment of the \nhighest levels of the military, nonproliferation experts, nuclear \nscientists, and our diplomatic partners who join in their overwhelming \nsupport of the agreement.\n  As a Congress, we can only do our best and our part to move forward \nto provide the necessary resources for proper oversight to ensure \neffective monitoring and aggressive verification. If Iran cheats, we \nwill know it; we will know it quickly, and we will act decisively.\n  Once again, the world turned to the United States for our leadership \non dealing with Iran and its nuclear program. This agreement, reached \nthrough rigorous diplomacy, in conjunction with our partners, provides \nthe tools we need to ensure a pathway to peace and security for the \nUnited States, for Israel, the region, and the world.\n  I will vote to approve the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would just note that over 200 retired generals, flag officers, and \nadmirals signed a letter in opposition; and we have heard continuously, \nincluding this week, from retired generals, officers, and admirals \nabout their concerns about this agreement.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. McMorris \nRodgers), the Republican Conference chair.\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, the votes this week on the \nPresident's nuclear deal with Iran are some of the most important we \nhave taken in years. As the world's largest sponsor of terror, Iran \ncontinues to play an enormously destructive and destabilizing role in \nthe world.\n  Iran's actions are destroying the lives of millions of vulnerable \ninnocents. The current refugee crisis in the Middle East and Europe is \nonly the most recent example.\n  Iran has been propping up Assad's regime in Syria for the past 4 \nyears, sending weapons and thousands of fighters there to brutalize the \nSyrian people. ISIS has exploited these conditions, and now, millions \nof Syrians have been displaced, many of them going to unimaginable \nlengths to seek refuge in Europe. Iran bears responsibility for this.\n  This deal is not reform. This deal is incentivizing bad behavior. A \nvote in favor of this deal is a vote that favors party politics over \nthe will of the American people and global security. It is a terrible \nway to do business.\n  The American people deserve full transparency from the White House on \nthis deal, as required by the law and even basic respect for American \nvoters.\n  The President is required to turn over all the agreements--even the \nside deals made with third parties--and he has yet to do that.\n  While I was home the last few weeks in my district in eastern \nWashington, not a day passed that I didn't hear grave concerns about \nthis deal. It wasn't Republicans versus Democrats, liberals versus \nconservatives; it wasn't anti-President Obama. People are sincerely \nworried about what this deal means for our safety and security.\n  We were told by the administration early on that no deal was better \nthan a bad deal. Now, the President claims it is either this deal or \nwar.\n  Mr. Speaker, we aren't asking the President to stop his efforts to \nreach an agreement with Iran. We need a better deal. We are asking the \nPresident to continue and strengthen his efforts so that we get a deal \nthat, first, truly denies Iran a path to a nuclear weapon by \ndismantling its extensive infrastructure; second, includes a robust \ninspections process, not one that is conducted by Iran itself; and, \nthird, compels Iran to cease its support of terrorist organizations and \nbrutal dictators like Assad, whose actions are destabilizing the entire \nregion, as well as Europe.\n  Until this deal includes, at a minimum, these three components and \nthe President has made his obligations under the law, I will continue \nto oppose it, and I will urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto do the same.\n  Let's send the President back to the negotiating table.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Maybe the President could get some advice from the leadership of the \nRepublican Conference in how to figure out what resolution to bring to \nthe floor.\n  I now proudly yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. \nCicilline), my friend.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, the question before us today is whether \nor not this body will approve the negotiated agreement to prevent Iran \nfrom obtaining a nuclear weapon. It is one of the most consequential \nissues of our time and requires serious and sober consideration by \nevery single Member of this body.\n  You would think, Mr. Speaker, that in a matter of such gravity \ninvolving the foreign affairs of our Nation and the safety and security \nof our allies, particularly Israel, we could set aside urges to score \npolitical points and avoid dangerous hyperbole and instead debate the \nmerits of this agreement.\n  I regret that the process for considering this agreement has \nsometimes devolved into a sad show of partisanship. Our Nation is \nbetter than this.\n\n[[Page H5922]]\n\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, I am mindful of President Kennedy's inaugural \naddress, which he delivered from the east front of the Capitol, just a \nfew hundred feet from this Chamber. Addressing the threat from the \nSoviet Union, President Kennedy said: ``Let us begin anew--remembering \non both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness.''\n  He went on to say: ``Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us \nnever fear to negotiate.''\n  Those words still ring true today. This agreement shows the power of \ndiplomacy to advance our national security interests and ensures that, \nbefore being required to send our brave men and women into a dangerous \nmilitary conflict, that we have had the courage to exhaust every \npossible alternative.\n  Like all of my colleagues, I have spent the last 2 months carefully \nstudying the terms of this agreement that the United States and our \nnegotiating partners reached to prevent a nuclear Iran; meeting with \nmilitary, scientific, and nonproliferation experts; participating in \ndozens of classified briefings and committee hearings; meeting with the \nPresident and members of his administration, as well as meeting with my \nconstituents.\n  After a great deal of serious deliberation, I believe that the United \nStates and the world are safer with this deal in place than without it.\n  I fully recognize that this agreement is not perfect--far from it--\nbut like any decision in life, we have to confront the choices we face, \nnot the one we would rather have before us or like to imagine.\n  I believe approval of this agreement is the most responsible and \neffective way to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. By its \nvery terms, it affirms that under no circumstance will Iran ever seek, \ndevelop, or acquire any nuclear weapons.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to consider what we \nwill be giving up if we reject this deal. This agreement requires Iran \nto submit to the most intrusive and rigorous inspections regimen ever \nnegotiated. This is in stark contrast to the complete lack of access \ncurrently available to the international community to monitor Iran's \nnuclear program.\n  If Congress rejects the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, it will \nmean zero restrictions on Iran's nuclear ambitions, no limitations on \ntheir enrichment activities or centrifuge production, and no ability \nfor international inspectors to monitor Iran's nuclear program.\n  Many experts agree that rejection of this agreement would mean Iran \ncould develop a nuclear weapon in just a matter of months, the worst \npossible outcome.\n  Approval of this agreement does not end our responsibility, Mr. \nSpeaker. Congress must work closely with the administration to ensure \nthat we take additional steps to mitigate the risks reflected in the \nagreement, to discourage Iran from escalating its destabilizing \nactivities in the region, and to enhance the likelihood that Iran \ncomplies with all the terms of the agreement.\n  Additional resources have to be devoted to supporting, monitoring, \nverification, and intelligence gathering activities.\n  Above all else, we must make it absolutely clear to Iran that any \nviolation of the agreement will be met with swift and decisive action \nby the United States and the international community.\n  I look forward to working with the administration and my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to make certain that all of this happens.\n  In the end, this was not an easy decision or one I arrived at \nquickly. There is risk in accepting this agreement, and it contains \nreal tradeoffs. No responsible person should claim otherwise.\n  I am certain, Mr. Speaker, that rejecting this agreement would \npresent even greater and more dangerous risks to our national security \nand our allies than the risks associated with going forward. Because of \nthis, I intend to support the resolution of approval and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte), chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce for his \noutstanding leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, our Founding Fathers included in the preamble of the \nUnited States Constitution the intention of our government to provide \nfor the common defense. Protecting and defending our Nation was not an \nafterthought; it was a first thought.\n  The defense of America and our allies has always been a strategic and \nmoral goal. The agreement we have before us today, however, primarily \nmeets Iran's goals. Sanctions are lifted; nuclear research and \ndevelopment continues, and America's safety is compromised. Under this \ndeal, in a matter of years--likely in our lifetimes, but certainly in \nthe lifetimes of our children and grandchildren--Iran will have a bomb.\n  The President of the United States has said that this agreement is \nnot based on trust, but on verification. I wish that was true because \nthis agreement shouldn't be based on trust. I certainly do not trust a \ngovernment that has acted as a bank for terrorists.\n  Any agreement should be based on verification; but where is the \nsimple assurance of anytime, anywhere inspections? We don't have \nverification. What we have is misplaced hope, hope that Iran has \ndisclosed all of its past nuclear activities, hope that Iran will be \ntransparent, hope that Iran has somehow changed.\n  Earlier this year, 367 bipartisan Members of Congress sent a letter \nto the President outlining several conditions that any final nuclear \nagreement must address. Unfortunately, the agreement we have before us \ndoes not meet congressional standards and has numerous fatal flaws.\n  For example, in 2012, Congress barred Iranians from coming here to \nstudy nuclear science and nuclear engineering at U.S. universities. One \nwould think that is a good policy, given that they are seeking to get a \nbomb.\n  In one of the most outrageous provisions of this deal, the Department \nof Homeland Security and the Department of State will no longer be \nallowed to enforce the bar. This deal will actually make the U.S. an \naccomplice to Iran's nuclear weapons program by granting Iranians the \nability to come to the U.S. to acquire knowledge instrumental in their \nbeing able to design and build nuclear bombs.\n  Other concerns include giving Iran a signing bonus, lifting the arms \nembargo, failure to cut off Iran's pathway to the bomb, and the lack of \nprotection for not only our own safety, but for the safety of the \nworld. A nuclear Iran is a threat to our great ally, Israel, but is \nalso a threat to the rest of the Middle East, America, and the world.\n  While the administration has said that any deal is better than no \ndeal, Thomas Jefferson once said, ``Delay is preferable to error,'' and \nI agree with Jefferson.\n  Had our negotiators remained at the table a while longer, perhaps we \nwould not be where we are today; yet, as it stands, this so-called \ndeal, if it goes through, will likely mark the pages of history as a \ngreat error.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am reminded back to Churchill. He said it is always better to jaw-\njaw than to war-war.\n  I now yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank Representative Connolly \nfor yielding me time and, really, for your tremendous leadership on \nthis very vital issue. Also, I must salute our Leader Pelosi for her \nunwavering support and hard work for global peace and security.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3461, a resolution to \napprove the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n  Now, in the last two Congresses, mind you, I introduced the Prevent \nIran from Acquiring Nuclear Weapons and Stop War Through Diplomacy Act, \nwhich called for the appointment of a high-level special envoy to \naddress Iran's nuclear program and an end to the no-contact policy \nbetween our diplomats.\n  Since the 1970s, quite frankly, I have worked on many nuclear \nnonproliferation issues and believe very strongly that the deal that \nPresident Obama and our P5+1 partners negotiated demonstrates how \neffective diplomacy can be. It will lead us closer to a world where our \nchildren and future generations can live without the fear of Iran \nacquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\n[[Page H5923]]\n\n  The JCPOA, supported by the majority of Americans and key \ninternational allies, including France, Germany, and Britain, though \nnot perfect, it is the best way to prevent Iran from ever acquiring a \nnuclear weapon.\n  The Iran nuclear deal puts into place the most intrusive inspection \nsystem, including a 24/7 surveillance of Iran's enrichment facilities \nand reactors; it cuts off all of Iran's pathways to a nuclear weapon, \nand it will enhance regional and global security.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power stated in her recent \npolitical op-ed: ``If we walk away, there is no diplomatic door No. 2, \nno do-over, no rewrite of the deal on the table.''\n  Rejecting the Iran deal will isolate the United States from our \ninternational partners. It will not make us any safer, and it certainly \nwon't result in a better deal with Iran. Instead, it would allow Iran \nto accelerate its weapons programs with no oversight. That is \nunacceptable. We cannot afford the alternative to this deal.\n  This is a defining moment for our country and for our world. Let us \ncontinue to work for peace. We all know that the military option is \nalways there. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution \nof approval.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), a member of the Committee on Financial \nServices.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution and \nagainst this disastrous nuclear agreement with Iran.\n  The actions that Iran will be allowed to pursue under this agreement \nare a direct threat to the United States and to our allies, and it \nfalls far short of the commitment the President made to the American \npeople, which is to verifiably prevent Iran from getting a nuclear \nweapon.\n  Under the deal, Iran will maintain a robust nuclear infrastructure. \nThey will be able to conduct research on advanced centrifuges that are \ncapable of rapidly enriching uranium and developing ballistic missiles \nthat are capable of carrying a bomb to Israel, Europe, or the United \nStates. Instead of anytime, anywhere inspections, the bureaucratic \nprocess ensures lengthy delays, which will allow Iran to cover its \ntracks.\n  This troubling deal will provide billions of dollars to fund Iran's \ninternational terror enterprise even as they call for Israel's \nannihilation and chant ``death to America.''\n  It is time to lead the world to a better deal that will result in \nIran's forever abandoning its threats to the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, while this House actually votes on the merits of this \ndeal, I know what happened today in the other House of Congress--the \nSenate. There, almost all Democrats have joined to block a vote on this \ndeal. One Democrat who wanted to vote was Senator Schumer of New York. \nSenator Schumer released a statement last month that showed he \nunderstands the serious defects of this deal--from the inadequate \ninspections to the billions that will flow into Iran's terror \nenterprise. Because of these defects, Senator Schumer concluded, we \nwill be worse off with this agreement than without it.\n  But there is another choice, Mr. Speaker--a better deal--one \nnegotiated with a clear understanding of the nature of our enemy.\n  I ask my colleagues to reject this deal, to encourage the President \nto go back to the negotiating table, and to vote ``no'' on this \nresolution.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, it was John Kennedy who negotiated the \nfirst nuclear Test Ban Treaty successfully with our archenemy that \nthreatened to bury us--the Soviet Union. He said that we should never \nnegotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).\n  Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the P5+1 nuclear agreement \nwith Iran, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. \nLike my vote against the Iraq war, this decision is one of the most \nimportant foreign policy votes I will take during my time in Congress.\n  The intent of sanctions and negotiations has always been to \ndiplomatically cut off Iran's pathways to a nuclear weapon and to \nverifiably increase the transparency of their nuclear activities. It is \nclear to me, as well as to numerous nuclear, diplomatic, and national \nsecurity experts around the globe, that this agreement achieves these \ncritical goals.\n  It not only cuts off all pathways to a nuclear weapon, but it also \nimposes unprecedented and permanent inspections, and it ensures we can \nautomatically reinstate international sanctions if Iran violates the \nagreement.\n  In contrast, defeating this deal would allow Iran to resume its \nnuclear program with no restrictions or oversight, increasing the \nlikelihood of military conflict and a regional nuclear weapons race--\nprecisely the scenario sanctions were designed to prevent.\n  Another costly war in the Middle East would put American lives at \nrisk and undermine the security of our Nation and our allies, including \nIsrael.\n  While the risks of a nuclear-armed Iran are unquestionably dire, \nthere is simply no scenario in which these risks are reduced by \nrejecting this deal.\n  There are no decisions I take more seriously than those that involve \npotentially sending American troops into harm's way. This is, \nundeniably, one of those decisions. Under this agreement, every option \nis and will remain on the table, including that of military force; but \nwe have a solemn obligation to ensure that every diplomatic avenue is \nexhausted before military action is taken. That is why I opposed \nauthorizing the Iraq war and why I support this nuclear deal with Iran.\n  This deal has certainly not been perfect, but perfect is not and \nnever has been an option. Those who are urging the defeat of this deal \nhave a responsibility to propose a viable alternative, yet no such \nalternative has been put forward. This agreement before us is the best \npath available. It has my full support.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. DeSantis), a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, in 2012, when the President was running \nfor reelection, he said: Look, with Iran, it is very simple. We will \nremove the sanctions when they dismantle and give up their nuclear \nprogram.\n  That was a promise he made to the American people, but this deal \ndoesn't even come close to that. Iran is allowed to maintain a vast, \nvast nuclear infrastructure.\n  Two years ago in this House, we passed more robust sanctions, which \nwould have further tightened the screws on the Iranian regime. I think, \nat that time, Iran desperately wanted to get out of the sanctions. If \nyou had asked Iran what they wanted, they would have, obviously, wanted \nthe sanctions relief because they needed the money--the regime needed \nit to solidify themselves in power--but they also would have wanted to \nkeep their nuclear program. Then, of course, they would have wanted to \ncontinue to fund terrorism.\n  This agreement basically gives Iran everything it wants, so I join my \ncolleagues who have urged that we resoundingly reject this agreement.\n  I want to point out something that, I think, is very personal to a \nlot of veterans.\n  If you look right here, this is an up-armored Humvee in Iraq in, \nprobably, the 2007-2008 time period. It has been ripped to shreds by an \nEFP device--an explosively formed penetrator. This is something wherein \nthe explosion will cause these pieces of metal to go 3,000 meters per \nsecond. It will ravage the individuals who are in the Humvee, and it \nwill even go through the armor. These devices caused the deaths of \nhundreds of our servicemembers, and they wounded many, many more.\n\n  Why do I bring that up?\n  Because this was perpetrated by this man, Qasem Soleimani, who is the \nhead of the Quds Force--Iran's Revolutionary Guard terrorist outfit. He \nwas orchestrating those attacks on American servicemembers. That is \nenough, right? We are doing a deal with a country that has a lot of \nAmerican blood on its hands.\n  It is even worse than that. This deal relieves the international \nsanctions on\n\n[[Page H5924]]\n\nQasem Soleimani and the Quds Force. It empowers the very people who \nharmed our servicemembers in Iraq. I think that that is an insult to \nthe memories of the people who lost their lives on our behalf and an \ninsult to their families.\n  For that reason, in addition to all of the other great ones that have \nbeen mentioned, we need to resoundingly reject this deal.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I would simply point out for the record \nthat Soleimani remains on the list.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  Mr. ELLISON. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, in 2012, Prime Minister of Israel Netanyahu went to the \nU.N. with a graph, much like the one right beside me. It was a picture \nof a bomb with a red line. The Prime Minister said: ``The red line must \nbe drawn on Iran's nuclear enrichment program.''\n  This deal does that.\n  Today, we can say that Iran cannot produce or stockpile highly \nenriched uranium, and it has to get rid of 98 percent of its low \nenriched uranium. To make sure that they don't achieve a nuclear \nweapon, we have the strictest inspection regimen in the history of \nnuclear agreements. The impetus for 2 years of negotiation has been \nachieved.\n  So what is the problem?\n  The gears of war are halted when we prove that negotiation and \ndiplomacy are the best methods of achieving peace. This deal is a \ntriumph of diplomacy over military conflict. It is a win for those who \nreject the misconception that diplomacy is weakness.\n  In 2003, Vice President Cheney said: ``I have been charged by the \nPresident with making sure that none of the tyrannies in the world are \nnegotiated with.'' The ensuing decades of war brought 6,840 U.S. \nsoldiers home in coffins and squandered trillions of hard-earned, \nAmerican tax dollars.\n  Yet, we have learned from that.\n  We have learned our lesson that we must negotiate, that we must talk \nit out before we begin to shoot it out. The fact that a majority of \nAmericans supports this deal means that people are tired of sacrificing \nso much for the bankrupt idea that a conversation is capitulation.\n  This agreement keeps nuclear weapons out of Iran's hands for decades. \nIn 2003, Iran had 164 centrifuges. In 2005, they had 3,000. In 2009, \nthey had 8,000. By 2013, they had 22,000. While we were rattling sabers \nand making bravado-type comments about what we were going to do to \nthem, they were making centrifuges. When the President got down to the \nbusiness of negotiation, we had brought that process to a stop.\n  We will continue to sanction human rights violators wherever they \nare, including in Iran, and we will also continue to confront people \nwho export terrorism; but the best way to empower reformers within Iran \nis to engage. Diplomatic victories require playing the long game. You \nneed patience, and you need unshakable courage in your convictions.\n  Let me say that I remember the moment in 2007 when then-Senator Obama \nsaid he would engage in personal diplomacy with leaders in the Middle \nEast in order to stop bloodshed in the region. That is the moment that \nI knew I would vote for him, and I am proud to stand here nearly a \ndecade later to congratulate the President for this diplomatic victory.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Curbelo).\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, many of our colleagues have come to the floor today and \nhave stated that this is the most important vote or the most important \nseries of votes that we will take in this Congress. I agree with them \nbecause these votes boil down to the fundamental question:\n  What kind of a world do we want to live in?\n  What kind of a world do we want for ourselves? for our children? for \nour grandchildren? for future generations?\n  Do we want to live in a world where we legitimize the most radical, \nthe most extremist, the most terrorist government in the world--a \ngovernment that has a long and well-documented history of lying to the \nworld? of holding Americans hostage? of hanging homosexuals from \ncranes? of executing juveniles?\n  Do we want to empower that government with an investment of at least \n$56 billion, a portion of which will surely go to terrorist activities \nnot just in the Middle East but all over the world?\n  Do we want to guarantee that whether it is in 10 years or in 13 years \nor in 15 years or in 20 years that that same government will have the \nability to build a nuclear arsenal?\n  Do we want to afford that same government--the mullahs in Iran--the \nability to have intercontinental ballistic missiles? Those aren't for \nIsrael. Those aren't for the Middle East. Those are for us. The only \npurpose of those missiles is to carry a nuclear warhead.\n  What kind of a world do we want to live in?\n  I believe, Mr. Speaker, that, many years from now, my daughters, ages \n5 and 3, will look up how their dad voted on this critical issue. I \nthink--and I am very hopeful and I am confident--that they will thank \nme, because this is a bad deal. This is a deal that not only endangers \nour allies in the Middle East, it endangers us. This is a deal where we \nhave to ask ourselves who we are, what we stand for, and what kind of a \nworld we want to live in.\n  For that reason, I am opposing the Iran deal, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, our friend from Florida asks the right \nquestions. He has just got the wrong answer. I can answer those \nquestions.\n  I want a world that rolls back the nuclear capability of Iran, not a \nworld based on a false hope that we can make it work somehow without a \nplan.\n  That is what puts the world at risk. That is what puts my children \nand grandchildren at risk. I am not willing to take that risk\n  Mr. Speaker, before I recognize Mrs. Davis of California, can I \ninquire how much time is left on both sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Fortenberry). The gentleman from \nVirginia has 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from California \nhas 42\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Forty-two?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Okay. What a lucky man my friend from California is.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis).\n  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, after much deliberation and \nsoul searching, I am convinced that the P5+1 Joint Comprehensive Plan \nof Action creates a viable path to reduce Iran's nuclear weapons \ncapability.\n  For that reason, I believe this agreement is in the best interest of \nthe United States. Of course, the agreement must also be in the best \ninterest of our friends in the Middle East.\n  As someone who has lived in Israel and has returned many times since, \nI understand that, for Israelis and Americans with close ties to \nIsrael, Iran threatening to wipe Israel off the map is not an abstract \nconcern.\n  It has been less than a hundred years since the Jewish people nearly \nsuffered such a fate. The threat of annihilation is very real to \nIsraelis, and it is very real to me.\n  I would never take a vote that I thought could leave my grandchildren \na world without a strong, safe Israel.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am under no illusions that this agreement will end \nIran's hegemonic ambitions, but I can't allow their destabilizing \nbehavior to have the protection of a nuclear umbrella.\n  I agree with the former head of the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force, \nthe head of that intelligence agency, Amos Yadlin, that, if we walk \naway from this agreement, Iran will remain closer to a nuclear bomb in \nthe coming years, and the chances of a collapse of the sanctions regime \nwill increase.\n  Nobody in this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, trusts Iran. That is why we need \nand we must have and take the responsibility to come together after \nthis vote to make sure that the United States is exercising all of its \ninitiative to implement this agreement and to address what we know will \ncome, those inevitable challenges.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Heck), \na member of the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees.\n  Mr. HECK of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, when President Obama announced that \nthe P5+1 had reached an agreement on\n\n[[Page H5925]]\n\nIran's nuclear program, he stated that the deal was not built on trust, \nthat it was built on verification.\n  This was a clear acknowledgement by the administration that the Iran \nregime is not a trustworthy negotiating partner and that any agreement \nmust contain stringent verification guidelines to ensure that Iran \nadheres to its obligations.\n  Unfortunately, the verification procedures in the Joint Comprehensive \nPlan of Action are impotent at best. While the agreement does allow for \n24/7 monitoring of declared sites, it includes a provision that gives \nIran up to 24 days to grant inspectors access to suspected undeclared \nfacilities.\n  According to former IAEA officials, this greatly increases the \nprobability that nefarious nuclear activities could escape detection.\n  While this verification scheme is already embarrassingly weak, it \ngets worse when one considers the secret side deals that prevent \ninspection of the Parchin military complex and allow Iran to inspect \nitself. This is not the ``anytime, anywhere'' inspections the \nadministration claimed it was pursuing.\n  The fact is that, in spite of claims of the administration, this \nagreement is not built on verification. It is built on trust.\n  It requires us to trust a regime that is the largest exporter of \nterrorism in the world, that has already violated the interim nuclear \nagreement and whose Supreme Leader just today stated that Israel will \nnot exist in 25 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the President himself has said, no deal is better \nthan a bad deal. Mr. Speaker, this is a bad deal, and I urge my \ncolleagues to reject it.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Cohen).\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, in 1963, President Kennedy, who served in \nthis Chamber, spoke at American University about preventing nuclear war \nand that to do so it was necessary to deal with our most feared and \ndistrusted enemy at the time, the Soviet Union, as mistrusted and evil \nin the eyes of Americans then as Iran is today. As you recall, Prime \nMinister Khrushchev boldly stated, ``We will bury you.''\n  President Kennedy understood, though, that in negotiations with an \nenemy, ``We must avert those confrontations which bring an adversary to \na choice of either a humiliating retreat or nuclear war.''\n  President Obama, along with the other five nations at the negotiating \ntable in Vienna, confronted the same reality.\n  When President Reagan engaged in detente with the Soviet Union, he \nalso was negotiating with our most feared and distrusted enemy.\n  In negotiations with Iran, it has been the same for President Obama \nas it was for President Kennedy in negotiating with the Soviet Union.\n  Both President Kennedy and President Obama had the same goals as \nAmerica has had for over a half a century, and that is to prevent \nnuclear war. And to do so, it has been necessary to deal with an \nuntrusted foe.\n  I have listened to my constituents. I have been privy to many \nclassified briefings. I have spoken personally to President Obama and \nSecretary Kerry.\n  I have met with officials in Vienna at the headquarters of the IAEA \nand with diplomats and officials from Europe and Asia and considered \nthe opinions of renowned physicists and military generals.\n  Over those past several weeks and months, I have often thought about \nPresident Kennedy's eloquent words at American University in August of \n'63 when he said that, in the final analysis, ``We all inhabit the same \nsmall planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our \nchildren's future. And we are all mortal.'' The same holds true today.\n  I support this agreement based upon the information I have gleaned \nfrom the aforementioned individuals and groups and with the \nunderstanding there is no more important mission than preventing \nnuclear war.\n  Mr. Speaker, our people and our planet are in the balance. I am \nconvinced this is the most effective way that Iran will not build a \nnuclear weapon.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), \nchairman of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from \nCalifornia, the chairman of the committee, for yielding me time and for \nthe excellent job he has been doing tonight during the debate on this \nparticular issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, this week is a somber week for our Nation. September the \n11th reminds us of the sacred responsibility we, in Congress, have to \nprotect the American people from those who want to kill us. That is why \nwe must oppose the Iran deal.\n  This deal only emboldens our enemies at the expense of our friends \nand our own national security. So it is no surprise that a majority in \nCongress oppose this deal, as do most Americans, for many reasons.\n  First, it allows Iran to develop nuclear weapons in the future.\n  Second, it lists sanctions and frees up as much as $150 billion in \nassets for Iran. These funds inevitably will be used by Iran to export \nterrorism as even the President himself has admitted.\n  Third, the longstanding arms embargo against Iran will be lifted. \nThis enables Iran to buy long-range surface-to-air missiles from Russia \nby the end of the year.\n  Fourth, there is no credible way to conduct inspections of Iran's \nnuclear weapons-building sites. Under the proposed deal, Iran is given \nweeks, if not months, of advanced notice of any inspection. This \nprovides ample time for Iran to hide evidence of nuclear weapons \nactivities and violate the agreement.\n  Secret deals that the administration has hidden from Congress and the \nAmerican people have now been revealed. One secret deal permits Iran to \nconduct its own inspections at a military facility suspected of ties to \nnuclear weapons.\n  Finally, by increasing the odds of a nuclear Iran, this deal directly \nthreatens the security and future of Israel. The Iran deal destabilizes \nthe Middle East, jeopardizes America's security, and endangers the \nworld. The Iran deal must be opposed now and in the future.\n  Remember, this is not the law of the land. This deal is a nonbinding \nexecutive agreement. Only the Constitution is the law of the land.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I hope our fellow Americans \nunderstand what is really at stake here: engagement and the rollback of \na nuclear threat or the kinetic option, which is military intervention \nthat takes us down a path that will lead to more terrorism, more \nviolence, and the necessity of troops on the ground. I choose the \nformer, and I believe our fellow Americans will, too.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nBishop).\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise my \nvehement objection to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and to \ncall on my colleagues to do the same.\n  In March, I joined 346 of my bipartisan colleagues in a letter \noutlining the issues needed to be addressed by Iran in a comprehensive \nnuclear agreement.\n  The last sentence of that agreement said: Congress must be convinced \nthat the agreement's terms foreclose any pathway to a bomb, and then \nand only then will Congress be able to consider permanent sanctions \nrelief.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have read this entire agreement, and I am profoundly \ndisappointed to say that it falls remarkably short of foreclosing a \npathway to a bomb.\n  To the contrary, this agreement brings Iran to the brink of becoming \na nuclear weapons state and 8 short years from now provides them a \npathway to acquiring technology to strike Europe and well beyond.\n  To ease the concerns of my noncommittal colleagues, the President has \npromised a military option remains on the table.\n  I am simply awestricken by the fact that my colleagues on the left \nhave fallen for these assurances. It is the same administration that \npromised the red line in Syria.\n  It is the same empty rhetoric that has sustained the Syrian civil \nwar, the Libyan civil war, ISIL's control of western Iraq, and, of \ncourse, the imperialist Vladimir Putin that has annexed the sovereign \nterritory of the Ukraine.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to reject this deal and any deal that \nenables\n\n[[Page H5926]]\n\na belligerent state sponsor of terror to have access to hundreds of \nbillions of dollars and nuclear weapons that will allow its atrocities \nto continue in perpetuity, all the while four Americans, one of them a \nnative of the State of Michigan, my home State, Amir Hekmati, is being \nheld hostage.\n  Mr. Speaker, in no other world, public or private, would this \nagreement be considered credible.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Fleischmann). The time of the gentleman \nhas expired.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. I was saying that, in no other world, Mr. \nSpeaker--and to all of you--having served in the public and in the \nprivate sector, have I ever seen an agreement where we are negotiating \nwith a party that has no respect for the other party.\n  In this case, the Supreme Leader of the State of Iran as late as \nyesterday referred to the United States as the Great Satan and called \nfor us to be wiped off the face of the Earth, not just Israel.\n  We are the Great Satan. They are Satan, according to the Ayatollah. \nWe are the Great Satan. I object to entering into an agreement with a \ncountry that has no respect.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by thanking Democratic Leader \nPelosi for her tireless and unyielding advocacy for the Iran nuclear \ndeal agreed to between Iran and six major world powers, with the \nunanimous support of the U.N. Security Council.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  I very much share the leader's view that diplomacy and peace must be \ngiven every chance in our dealings with Iran before we contemplate the \nuse of any other options.\n  I also want to acknowledge the fact that, acting with the President's \nfull support, Secretary of State John Kerry has done a masterful job of \nholding the P5+1 coalition together. It was far from certain that \nRussia and China, intent as each of them is on reducing America's \ninfluence in the world, would continue their participation in the tough \nmultinational effort necessary to get us to this point.\n  This agreement proves that world leaders, despite being divided on a \nrange of issues, can still work together and reach an agreement with \nprofound implications for international peace and security. This is \ntruly extraordinary.\n  I support this agreement not because it is perfect, but because it is \na deal that stands up extremely well as a barrier against nuclear \nproliferation for at least 15 years. It also establishes an intrusive \ninspections regimen to ensure that Iran's program remains heavily \nmonitored and exclusively peaceful for even longer.\n  One of the most important provisions of this deal allows any \npermanent member of the U.N. Security Council who can show that Iran \nhas violated the agreement the ability to snap back the tough sanctions \nthat had previously been in place.\n  Now, I know there are critics who believe that, by rejecting the deal \nand increasing sanctions on Iran, that the U.S. can somehow coerce the \nleaders of Iran to completely dismantle its nuclear program. As \neffective as the current sanctions have been in bringing Iran to the \ntable to negotiate, they have not stopped Iran from becoming a \nthreshold nuclear state.\n  If Congress rejects this deal, it will not lead to a better one. If \nthe U.S. walks away from this deal, we will have squandered the best \nchance we have to solve this problem through peaceful means. In fact, \nU.S. rejection of the deal is more likely to isolate the United States \nrather than Iran from the rest of the world.\n  It would reinforce questions around the world about our commitment to \nmultilateralism and American political dysfunction. Furthermore, it \nwould seriously undermine our ability to lead any future diplomatic \nefforts on terrorism and on a range of other issues important to our \nnational security interests.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, which is necessary \nfor the success of the nuclear deal, the preservation of the \ninternational financial sanctions architecture, and for maintaining the \ncredibility of U.S. diplomatic commitments in the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Palmer).\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this ill-conceived \nagreement between our current administration and the fanatical regime \nruling the nation of Iran.\n  I find it impossible to understand how those who are sworn to protect \nthe security and interests of the American people could enter into such \na one-sided deal. This is a deal that expands the lethal potential of a \nruthless regime by giving them a path to a nuclear weapon; a regime \nwhose stated objective is the destruction of the United States; a \nregime committed to the complete and utter destruction of Israel, our \nmost trusted friend and ally in the Middle East; and a regime that \nalmost no one believes will honor this deal.\n  It is incomprehensible that we would so blindly ignore the warnings \nof the world's most aggressive supporter of terrorism by allowing them \naccess to $150 billion in assets and allowing them to use those assets \nto project their war against our Nation and our allies.\n  If the rantings of this regime are not enough to cause us to reject \nthis deal, then we should let history instruct us. This regime has been \nresponsible for the deaths of hundreds of American soldiers. This \nregime has been responsible for the deaths of innocent civilians in \nIsrael and other nations. In 2009, this regime murdered their own \ncitizens who courageously advocated for the freedom of the Iranian \npeople. The actions of the Iranian regime speak for themselves.\n  Mr. Speaker, history is a great teacher, and I believe the past \nmistakes of world leaders who failed to recognize the lethal danger \nposed by ruthless and ambitious regimes have been written in the pages \nof history with the blood of millions upon millions of people.\n  We must not allow our Nation to take rank with those nations and \nleaders who chose appeasement over courage, who chose to take what \nappeared to them to be the easy path, instead of bearing the \nresponsibility of making the harder decision because it was the right \ndecision.\n  If the administration is correct that allowing the ruling regime in \nIran to become armed with nuclear weapons will pose no threat to \nAmerica and Israel, then no one will remember how the Members of this \nCongress voted; but if this administration and the supporters of this \nagreement are wrong and we suffer a catastrophic loss of lives, no one \nwill ever forget what we did here. We will bear the burden of this vote \nfor the rest of our lives.\n  America's foreign policy is at a crossroads. I am reminded how a \ngreat President described how we should deal with dangerous nations. \nPresident Theodore Roosevelt said we should speak softly and carry a \nbig stick. He described this approach as the exercise of intelligent \nforethought and of decisive action sufficiently far in advance of any \nlikely crisis. This deal does not meet that standard.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the time when the burden of leadership that has \nbeen entrusted to every Member of Congress falls most heavily upon us. \nThe American people look to us to do our duty and bear this \nresponsibility without regard to party or politics, to put their safety \nand security first and foremost. I urge all the Members of this House \nto put aside the politics and partisanship that otherwise divide us and \nstand together in opposition to this deal.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, the goal of the negotiations between world \npowers and Iran has always been to prevent them from developing a \nnuclear weapon. I think we have to be realistic about this.\n  This agreement, as opposed to rejecting the agreement, takes us very \nfar toward that goal; and I think accomplishes that goal in a way that \nwe should all be able to live with and accept. The alternative is just \ntoo treacherous, I think, for us to even imagine.\n  I have been involved in this issue for as long as I have been here, \nthis last 2\\1/2\\ years that I have been in Congress. I,\n\n[[Page H5927]]\n\nas many Members, have had countless hours of briefings. I have read the \ndocuments; I have read the classified reports, and I am confident that \nthis agreement, simply put, makes the world a safer place, both for the \nU.S. and our allies.\n  What this agreement does not do, however--and I think it is important \nto keep in context--this agreement does not make Iran a good actor on \nthe world stage. It is intended to tamp down their nuclear aspirations.\n\n  It doesn't mean that Iran can be trusted. In fact, the very nature of \nthe agreement is that it will rely on inspections; it will rely on the \neyes of the world to be on Iran to ensure that the agreement is adhered \nto with robust inspections.\n  Like any negotiated agreement, it is not perfect. If Iran cheats, we \nwill know it through inspections. If Iran violates the agreement, our \nallies and the United States will be able to put back in place those \nsanctions that were so important to get them to the negotiating table \nin the first place. In fact, even if our allies don't agree, we would \nhave the ability to unilaterally take steps to reinstate those \nimportant sanctions.\n  Finally, I think, importantly, under this question, the U.S. will be \nin a much stronger position than we are today if, in fact, military \nintervention ultimately is required because we will have allowed the \ndiplomatic process to work, I believe, and I think most Americans \nbelieve, it strengthens our hand, it strengthens our standing in the \nworld if, in fact, the necessity of military action does come upon us. \nThe fact that we gave diplomacy a chance, I think, is a really \nimportant point.\n  Now, I have heard, from friends on both sides of the aisle, concern \nabout the Americans that are being held, and this is a subject that I \nknow something about. I represent the family of Amir Hekmati, and I \nappreciate the efforts of Members on both sides to call upon Iran to \nrelease the Americans that they hold.\n  I personally thank Chairman Royce for his effort through his \nleadership on the Committee on Foreign Affairs to assist me in \ndeveloping a resolution that allowed this House to speak with one voice \non that question.\n  It would be a mistake, as some have suggested, to have included the \nfreedom of innocent Americans as one of the provisions of an agreement \nbecause, by the very nature of an agreement through negotiation, in \norder to secure a concession, in order to secure the release of those \nAmericans in exchange for something else that was negotiated at the \nbargaining table, we would have had to exchange something that makes \nthe world a less safe place.\n  Don't take my word for it. Listen to the position taken by that \nyoung, brave man that I represent, that young marine, Amir Hekmati, who \nhimself has said that the onus is on Iran to unilaterally release him \nand not to include him as part of a transaction that deals with Iran's \nnuclear capabilities.\n  That is the position that I take because I think it is the right \nposition, but I think it is important to note that that is also the \nposition that this brave young man, who for 4 years has been sitting in \nan Iranian jail cell, also takes.\n  Finally, we have to be honest with ourselves about the question that \nis before us. Now, if I were to have written this agreement by myself, \nit would be a different agreement, and I am sure that is true of \nvirtually everybody in this House.\n  The fact of the matter is, when evaluating our position on this \nquestion, we have to first search our own conscience, but we have to \nmeasure the effect of this agreement and the consequences of adhering \nto it and enacting this agreement with the consequences of walking away \nfrom a multilateral negotiated agreement with no prospect.\n  Listen to the voices of the other nations involved, with no prospect \nof being able to come back to the negotiating table.\n  The conclusion, I think, that I have come to in examining my \nconscience is that we are in a far better position as a world and we \nare far more secure through this agreement than we would be with the \nuncertainty of walking away from the diplomatic process and allowing \nIran to pursue a nuclear weapon in the next months.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional \n30 seconds to the gentleman.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, this is the conclusion that I have come to, \nbut this is also the conclusion that experts on both sides of the \npolitical spectrum have come to.\n  Ambassadors from across the world--former Secretary of State \nMadeleine Albright thinks this is the right path forward; former \nSecretary of State Colin Powell thinks this is the right path forward.\n  I understand that individuals in this House may come to different \nconclusions after examining the facts. The only thing I ask and \nencourage my colleagues to do is to vote your heart. Vote what you \nthink is right.\n  Examine the documents and do what you think is in the best interests \nof this country and of the world, and the conclusion that I have come \nto is that supporting this agreement is the right thing.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would also point out, though, that we have heard from many experts. \nWe have heard from many generals, admirals, and there are over 200 \ngenerals and flag officers, admirals who have come to the opposite \nconclusion, who have come to the conclusion that this makes the country \nless safe, and throughout the course of the afternoon and evening here, \nsupporters of this agreement have argued that we will be aggressive \nagainst Iran, aggressive against Iran on its regional aggression, \naggressive against Iran on its human rights violations.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  I will just bring up some concerns I have for the consideration of \nthe body here.\n  I don't see it. This administration was silent during Iran's Green \nrevolution, when the Iranian people were in the streets revolting \nagainst the regime at the time of the stolen election there in Iran. \nThey needed U.S. leadership the most at that time.\n  And since the administration began its negotiations with Iran, we \nhave had a grand total of three human rights abuse designations from \nthe administration--three designations against the backdrop of a record \nnumber of executions under the so-called moderate Rouhani, more \nexecutions this year than under alternative leadership in the past.\n  So if you are seeing unparalleled levels of repression and executions \nand we don't see that being countered forcefully, I come to a certain \nconclusion. I see the same thing with the administration not \nconfronting Assad's mass murders. Assad is Iranian-backed.\n  From my standpoint, if the administration is locked into an \nagreement, I will tell you how I think. I presume the administration \nwill defend that agreement, and I presume that that will mean ignoring \nIran's abuses at home and probably ignoring Iran's aggression abroad. \nThe negotiations were a constraint on the administration taking action \nand protesting, and I presume that the new agreement is going to be a \nconstraint on the administration's taking action against Iran.\n  I am just pointing out my view of this, based upon what I have \nobserved going back to the Green revolution and this desire for a \nrapprochement with Iran. I wish that the administration would take on a \nnew life in confronting Iran. I don't see it. And we will have a really \nbad deal to contend with.\n  The other part about the deal, and other points were made here \ntonight, but sanctions relief provided to Iran under this agreement \nwill enable them to increase the size and scope of their ballistic \nmissiles.\n  So the other observation I would make is the medium-and long-term \nthreat of an Iranian ballistic missile that can reach the United States \nis very real. That is what we have heard from so many retired officers \nand what we have heard from the Pentagon, and yet the administration \nhas been reluctant to ensure that the United States has adequate \nprotective measures to guard the homeland against the Iranian ballistic \nmissile threat.\n  The missile defense program has suffered greatly under President \nObama. One of his first major decisions was to cut funding for the \nMissile Defense\n\n[[Page H5928]]\n\nAgency. Then there was the unilateral abrogation of signed missile \ndefense agreements with our allies Poland and the Czech Republic in \nterms of the interceptor program that was supposed to defend Europe and \nthe United States against any future Iranian potential launch.\n  And contrary to the representation provided to Congress as part of \nthe New START, the President canceled phase 4 of the European missile \ndefense plan, which was specifically designed to increase protection of \nthe U.S. homeland.\n  So now that this agreement will pump resources and technology \nadvancements into the ballistic missile threat to the U.S. by Iran, my \nother hope is that this institution will have uniform opposition to the \nadministration's record of cutting missile defense and support \nproactive measures to protect the U.S. homeland. Because I will remind \neveryone here, Iran claims today that they are not bound in this \nagreement on the issue of ballistic missiles. They do not recognize the \nU.N. sanctions on their ballistic missiles, and they are claiming we \ndid not put it specifically into the agreement. So as far as they are \nconcerned, they are moving forward. They are moving forward with their \nballistic missile program.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Coffman).\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Iran agreement.\n  In 2009, I was able to visit Israel and was in separate meetings with \nPrime Minister Netanyahu, then-President Peres, and the Israeli Chief \nof Staff of the IDF, or Israeli Defense Forces. I asked the same \nquestion: What would it take to stop Iran from gaining a nuclear \nweapon? And they all gave me the same answer. They said: You have to \nimpose economic sanctions that are tough enough that the Government of \nIran fears a collapse of the economy and a resulting loss of power. And \nthat is the only thing short of war that will cause them to give up \ntheir quest for a nuclear weapon.\n  The Obama administration, merely to bring them to the negotiating \ntable, threw them a lifeline and relaxed economic sanctions. And then, \neven before going to the Congress of the United States, they went to \nthe United Nations to unravel economic sanctions on Iran.\n  Michael Oren, Ambassador to the United States from Israel, said that, \neven though the President has tried to box the Congress in--the United \nStates has a $17 trillion economy, and that by the United States \nimposing economic sanctions on Iran, that in fact other countries will \nbe forced to follow in order to be able to do business with the United \nStates.\n  This is really the hope and change applied to American national \nsecurity. The hope and change is that the conduct of Iran will change \nover time; that the ruling mullahs will in fact somehow become \nenlightened. And that when they say ``death to America,'' it is more of \na cultural expression.\n  In 1983, 241 marines died from an Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerilla \nin a truck bomb.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. COFFMAN. In 1996, 19 airmen died in the Khobar Towers by an \nIranian-backed attack.\n  When they say ``death to Americans,'' they mean death to Americans.\n  In 2005, I was in Iraq with the United States Marine Corps, and we \nwere losing soldiers and marines on the ground due to IEDs, but we up-\narmored our vehicles and we did better route reconnaissance and \nsecurity. Iran introduced what was called an EFP--a shape charge, or an \nexplosive force penetrator--that was designed to penetrate the thickest \nhulls of our vehicles and killed hundreds of soldiers and marines on \nthe ground. When the Iranians say ``death to Americans,'' they mean it.\n  This deal will threaten the stability of the region, the security of \nthe United States and of Israel, and I would urge my colleagues to vote \n``no.''\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).\n  Mr. LYNCH. I want to thank the gentlewoman from California for \nleading this debate on our behalf, and I want to thank her for the \ngreat work she has been doing on all of this.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3461, legislation to approve \nthe Iran nuclear agreement. While I will admit this deal is not \nabsolutely perfect, I believe it does offer the best chance of \npreventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Iran nuclear agreement is an opportunity, the likes \nof which we could not even imagine a few years ago: a chance to stop \nIran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and to do so without engaging in \nanother costly and bloody war.\n\n  Now, I did not reach this conclusion lightly. I did so only after \nclosely examining the deal and the classified and unclassified \nsupplementary documents. I also spoke to experts and numerous officials \nwho were closely involved in the talks, including one of the IAEA \ninspectors, and carefully weighed the arguments from both sides.\n  While I still have some concerns, I simply do not see an alternative \nthat will constrain Iran's nuclear program and maintain the global \ncooperation needed to enforce these limits.\n  Mr. Speaker, the plain language of this agreement explicitly states \nthat ``under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop, or acquire \nany nuclear weapons.'' There is no waiver, no exception, no qualifier \nor sunset. Iran may never have a nuclear weapon, period. That is what \nthe agreement says.\n  Now, of course, nobody believes a simple affirmation alone is enough, \nespecially with Iran's history, which is why this deal imposes tough \nlimitations on Iran and includes safeguards to better ensure that if \nIran cheats, we will know and can respond by reimposing economic \nsanctions, or, as the President has indicated, the military option \nremains on the table.\n  I want to note some of the limitations that are in the agreement.\n  Iran must cut its low enriched uranium stockpile by 96 percent. It \ncurrently has 7,500 kilograms of low enriched uranium. It has to cut \nthat to 300 kilograms--from 7,500 to 300.\n  Iran must cut its centrifuge capacity by over 66 percent--from 19,000 \ncentrifuges to 6,104; and of the 5,000 it may run, all must be the \nlower efficiency, first generation centrifuges.\n  The reactor core in the heavy water plant at Arak must be removed and \nfilled with concrete, making it unusable for nuclear weapons, and it \nmust be redesigned for nuclear energy purposes only.\n  Mr. Speaker, we all know that this deal is not based on trust. In \nfact, it assumes Iran will try to cheat. That is why the inspections \nregime is so intrusive. In addition, IAEA inspectors will have full \naccess to all declared sites and use of the most advanced technology \navailable.\n  It also subjects Iran's entire nuclear fuel cycle to inspections, \nfrom uranium mining to waste disposal and every stage in between. No \nother member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is subject to that \nscrutiny, nor would we be inspecting Iran's whole fuel cycle if we \ntrusted them.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's be clear about something. The United States did \nnot negotiate this agreement alone. This was a joint effort with the \nUK, Germany, France, China, Russia, and the EU. Those countries are in \na more vulnerable position than the United States if Iran should \nviolate this agreement.\n  Now, any observer of foreign affairs will tell you that in recent \nyears it has been next to impossible to get this mix of countries to \nagree on anything, much less a deal with such significance as this. Yet \nthat is what we have here--an agreement that major global powers back \nand are ready to enforce the agreement. And if we sabotage it now, if \nwe are the only country to say ``no'' to diplomacy and ``yes'' to \nmilitary action, we may very well do so alone.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I stated earlier, this agreement is not perfect. \nHowever, no one got everything they wanted in this agreement. For every \ncritic who says the P5+1 gave away too much, there is one in Iran who \nsays the Iranians did the same.\n  This deal has vast potential, but its success will ultimately hinge \non its implementation. It would be better use of our energies to focus \non ensuring that this deal succeeds and that the IAEA has what is \nnecessary to carry out its mandate.\n  One final point, if some of the critics are right and we eventually \nhave to resort to a military option with or without our international \nneighbors, I\n\n[[Page H5929]]\n\nthink it would be much better for us to have had hundreds of inspectors \non the ground inspecting nuclear and nonnuclear facilities.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield the gentleman an additional \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. LYNCH. It would be far better for us and our international allies \nto have had international inspectors--hundreds--on the ground in Iran, \nso that if we do have to take military action, we have that \ninformation, we have that intelligence, so that any military action \nthat eventually is necessary will be much more effective.\n  But I agree that this agreement is our best chance, this opportunity \nfor diplomacy, and I ask my colleagues to support it.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Westerman).\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in strong disagreement \nwith the President's deal.\n  Tonight is the eve of the 14th anniversary of attacks on America by \nradical Islamic terrorists. These were direct, premeditated attacks on \nour soil that targeted and murdered thousands of Americans, just \nbecause they were Americans.\n  It was a dirty, cowardly act that reflects the lack of civility and \nvalues of all terrorists, those who finance terror, those who plan \nterror attacks, and those who carry them out.\n  Who would have thought we would be here at this time debating whether \nto approve an agreement with the number one state sponsor of terrorism \nin the world, a deal with a country that chants ``death to America'' \nwhile holding four American hostages, a deal that removes sanctions and \nallows billions of dollars to flow into a regime that wants to \nannihilate us and our allies, a deal that allows thousands of \ncentrifuges to continue spinning and enriching nuclear fuel that can \nand most likely will be used in nuclear weapons.\n  There is a better way to deal with this regime, by not making any \nconcessions until Iran ends their support of terrorism and demonstrates \nthey can be civilized and trusted. They must earn our trust.\n  Mr. Speaker, America's $18 trillion to $19 trillion economy dwarfs \nIran's $400 billion economy, and some sell America short to say that \nthe world would stand with Iran over us if we kept our sanctions and \nshowed resolve.\n  Mr. Speaker, I never thought I would see the day when America \nnegotiated with terrorists, and I certainly never thought I would see \nthe day when those who swore to protect her would agree to a deal \nshrouded in secrecy--not Congress' deal, not the American people's \ndeal, the President's and the minority that supports its deal that \njeopardizes so much of our safety and security and gains so little.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman another 30 seconds.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I encourage a strong ``no'' vote on this \ndeal. I encourage this Chamber, the Senate, and the administration to \ndo the right thing by rejecting this deal in its entirety; and I pray \nthat God would intervene and help us.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster).\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, as the only Ph.D. physicist in Congress--in \nfact, the only Ph.D. scientist of any kind--I have taken very seriously \nmy responsibility to review the technical aspects of the proposed \nagreement.\n  After over a dozen briefings, many of them individual classified \nbriefings by the technical experts who have supported our negotiators, \nI have come to support this deal not based on trust of Iran, but based \non science.\n  I would like to take a moment to make four technical points that \nunderpin my support of this deal.\n  First, in regards to the claim that ``Iran gets to be in charge of \ninspecting itself'' in investigations of its past weaponization \nactivities, this is simply not true. The investigations will be carried \nout by a team of IAEA inspectors, using equipment and sampling kits \nprepared by the IAEA, with samples being sent to the international \nNetwork of Analytical Laboratories, of which a number of U.S. \nlaboratories are members.\n  I urge my colleagues who harbor doubts about this inspection regime \nto avail themselves of classified briefings on the details. What I can \nsay publicly is that our technical experts have full confidence in the \ntechnical inspection capability of the IAEA.\n  Secondly, in regards to the 24-day inspection delay, which has been a \nsource of concern for many, including myself, under the proposed \nagreement, Iran's declared nuclear facilities will be available for \nanytime, anywhere inspection.\n  However, for undeclared facilities, including military facilities, \nIran has the opportunity to contest what is normally a 24-hour \ninspection regime under the nonproliferation treaty and additional \nprotocol for a period of up to 24 days. This is clearly not ideal. It \nis a negotiated number.\n  However, when I look closely at the many steps that must be taken to \nproduce and to test a nuclear weapon, the ability to detect activities \nin a window of 24 days versus 24 hours has limited operational \nsignificance.\n  This is because, while many steps toward weaponization can \nunfortunately be hidden from even a 24-hour inspection, things like \ndesign and testing of nonnuclear components, but the moment that Iran \ntouches nuclear materials, it will be subject to detection by the IAEA, \neven months after any attempted scrubbing of the facility.\n  Thirdly, I support the administration's estimate of a 1-year minimum \nbreakout time. This is the reaction time that the world community will \nhave for a diplomatic, economic, and military response if Iran decides \nto resume its nuclear weapons program.\n  Because of the importance of this issue, I have spent a great deal of \ntime and effort personally vetting this estimate. The breakout time \ncalculation is complex because there are many possible paths to obtain \nthe fissile material for a first weapon, and each of these must be \nexamined.\n  After many hours of study and detailed questioning of our experts, I \nhave concluded that the 1-year estimate for the minimum breakout time \nis accurate.\n  Fourth, in regards to the weaponization timeline, this is the time \nneeded by Iran from the point that it possesses a sufficient quantity \nof nuclear material for a first weapon, to the time that it will take \nthem to assemble and to test that first nuclear weapon.\n  Unfortunately, Iran has made significant progress toward \nweaponization, including such items as the multipoint initiation system \nfor implosion devices that is referenced in the IAEA report of 2011.\n  Moreover, if Iran breaks out of this agreement, it will resume the \nweaponization activities during the same year that it takes to \naccumulate fissile materials for a first weapon.\n  Therefore, I concur with the assessment that, in the context of a 1-\nyear breakout effort, the additional time for weaponization may be \nsmall. However, at the end of this agreement, when the breakout time to \nobtain fissile material is shortened, the weaponization activities \nbecome the dominant factor in the time line.\n  This underscores the importance of maintaining maximum visibility \ninto all aspects of the Iranian nuclear capability, a position that is \nsurely strengthened by the adoption of this agreement and, also, of \nsignificantly strengthening the nonproliferation treaty for Iran and \nfor all other nuclear threshold countries.\n  This must be the work of the coming decade, so that by the end of the \nmain terms of this agreement, Iran and its neighbors in the Middle East \nand around the world will be bound by a much stronger and more \nverifiable nonproliferation treaty.\n  As was emphasized by former Senators Dick Lugar and Sam Nunn, two \ngentlemen who have actually reduced the threat of nuclear war, instead \nof just talking about it, that this is not a perfect deal, but it is \nthe best path forward and our best chance to achieve our goal of \npreventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction as the best opportunity to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. \nRemember, we did not negotiate this deal alone, but if we walk away, we \nwalk away alone.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n[[Page H5930]]\n\n  We did not negotiate this deal alone. Also negotiating this deal was \nIran and was Russia and was China--true enough--but when it comes to \nthe question of inspections, I do not have the document that indicates \nhow these inspections will be done; but what I do know is what is \nreported to be the procedure and what is asserted also by the Iranians \nto be the procedure.\n  As reported, it is Iran, not international inspectors, who will \nprovide the agencies the photos of the locations. It is Iran that will \nprovide the Agency videos of the locations. It is Iran, not \ninternational inspectors, who will provide the Agency the environmental \nsamples. It is Iran that will use Iran's authenticated equipment, not \nthe equipment of the international inspectors.\n  The point I make, again, is that one of the reasons we wanted to have \nthe agreements, the side agreements, the two side agreements, including \nthe one addressing the 12 questions that have never been answered about \nthe thousand pages of bomb work that the IAEA had in its possession, \nthat Iran supposedly conducted at Parchin, was to get Iran to answer \nthese questions. To this day, to my knowledge, scientists in Iran are \nnot available to answer these questions.\n  Now, perhaps if we obtain these documents, these two side agreements, \nwe will have the details that assure us that, finally, these 12 \nquestions have been answered, but I can tell you, during the interim \nagreement, we only got half of the first question answered, and after \nthat, Iran shut it down. There was to be no more discussion about their \npast bomb work.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. \nKelly).\n  (Mr. KELLY of Mississippi asked and was given permission to revise \nand extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my \nopposition to the Iran nuclear agreement.\n  On the eve of September 11, I remember the American lives lost to \nterrorism and the unfortunate reality that people want to do America \nharm.\n  Based on my review of the agreement, combined with my personal \nexperience of being deployed in the Army in Iraq in 2005 and, again, in \n2009 and 2010 and seeing firsthand the Iranian influence there, I have \nno reason to believe that Iran will act in good faith in this \nagreement.\n  It is not just my concerns that I have regarding this deal, but it is \nalso my concerns I have consistently heard throughout the August work \nmonth from my constituents, regardless of party affiliation, that did \nnot support this agreement with Iran.\n  Lifting economic sanctions that Congress has imposed for more than \ntwo decades only gives Iran, a recognized state sponsor of terrorism \nsince 1984, access to billions of dollars to finance terrorism \nactivities in the region and to get closer to their ultimate goal of \nbuilding a nuclear weapon.\n  I oppose with all my heart and soul the Iran nuclear agreement \nbecause I do not believe the agreement negotiated by the administration \nis in the best interest of our national security, nor is it in the best \ninterest of our allies in the Middle East, nor is it in the best \ninterest of America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition to the \nadministration's Iran nuclear agreement.\n  On the Eve of September 11, we remember the lives lost and \nunfortunate reality that people want to do America harm.\n  Based on my review of the agreement combined with my personal \nexperience of being deployed to Iraq in 2005 and again in 2009-2010 and \nseeing firsthand the Iranian influence there, I have no reason to \nbelieve Iran will act in good faith\n  It is not just concerns I have regarding the deal, but concerns I \nconsistently heard from constituents, regardless of party affiliation, \nduring the August work period.\n  Just this week, Iran's Supreme Leader said America remains the \n``Great Satan'' and reiterated his desire to wipe Israel off the map. \nCommon sense would prevail that the goal of Iran's nuclear program is \nnot to promote peace but exactly the opposite.\n  Lifting economic sanctions that Congress has imposed for more than \ntwo decades only gives Iran--a recognized state sponsor of terrorism \nsince 1984--access to billions of dollars to finance terrorist \nactivities in the region and get closer to their ultimate goal of \nbuilding a nuclear weapon.\n  Increased access to wealth coupled with a lack of ``anytime, \nanywhere'' inspections will only allow Iran to increase their support \nof terrorism in the region to groups like Hamas and Hezbollah and is \nnot nearly sufficient in stopping their pursuit of a nuclear weapon.\n  I oppose the Iran nuclear agreement because I do not believe that the \nagreement negotiated by the administration is in the best interest of \nour national security nor is it in the best interest of our allies in \nthe Middle East.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to \nthe gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, this agreement is the best option available \nto prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The alternatives are \nsimply too risky and too costly, which is why the deal's opponents have \nfailed to articulate a realistic alternative.\n  During my time in Congress, I have voted for every bill that imposed \ncrippling sanctions on Iran, which brought the regime to the \nnegotiating table and united the world to stop Iran's pursuit of a \nnuclear weapon.\n  Sanctions were meant to be a tool to ensure negotiations; that is \nexactly what they have done, but as we have learned from the past \ndecade, sanctions alone are not enough to stop Iran from expanding its \nnuclear program.\n  Before negotiations began, Iran greatly increased its enrichment \nstockpile and centrifuge capacity, despite sanctions. That is why a \nverifiable agreement that will cut off Iran's ability to build a \nnuclear weapon is necessary.\n  The International Atomic Energy Agency will have nearly continuous \naccess to Iran's declared nuclear facilities and can gain unprecedented \naccess to other suspicious, undeclared sites in as little as 24 hours.\n  Under this agreement, Iran will dismantle two-thirds of its installed \ncentrifuges, remove over 97 percent of its uranium stockpile, and make \nchanges to its Arak plutonium reactor before it receives sanctions \nrelief.\n  United States Department of Energy Secretary and nuclear physicist \nErnest Moniz has confirmed that the agreement increases Iran's breakout \ntime significantly for well over a decade, from 2 to 3 months today to \nat least 12 months moving forward. This additional time will give us \nample opportunity to catch and stop Iran should it choose to pursue a \nnuclear weapon.\n  Some have suggested that we need to reject this deal in order to get \na better one, but I have found no evidence to believe that a better \ndeal is possible.\n  It is clear that some of our negotiating partners and other allies do \nnot want more sanctions. If we reject this deal, the robust \ninternational sanctions regime would certainly erode, if not unravel \nentirely.\n  In the meantime, Iran could move forward with its enrichment program \nwithout inspections; limitations on manufacturing, installation, \nresearch, and development of new centrifuges; and constraints on its \nenriched uranium stockpile. Simply put, no deal would mean no \ninspections and no constraints on Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n  Some have suggested that we cannot make an agreement with a country \nthat we do not trust, but we must remember that this deal is not based \non trust, but rather the most intrusive inspections regime upon which \nwe have ever agreed.\n  We did not trust the Soviet Union, especially when we negotiated an \narms reduction treaty with them as we fought in devastating proxy wars \naround the world.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Today we are not debating whether to trust Iran. We are debating \nwhether and how we should enhance monitoring of its nuclear program.\n  I remain committed to working with the administration and my \ncolleagues here in Congress to contain Iran's conventional capabilities \nthat threaten stability in the region and throughout the world, but \nknow that this deal is the best option to take the nuclear issue out of \nthe equation.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve this agreement.\n  Again, I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, in terms of viewing this as the most intrusive regime, I \nremember South Africa. We put the kinds of sanctions on South Africa \nthat we tried to get the administration to put on Iran.\n\n[[Page H5931]]\n\n  We had legislation here by a vote of 400-20 to do that, and the \nadministration blocked that legislation in the Senate. That would have \ngiven us real leverage.\n  Why do I think so? Because in South Africa, when we put those \nsanctions on, it actually gave the regime a choice between compromise \non its nuclear program and dropping apartheid and changing its system \nor economic collapse.\n  The choice was made in South Africa to turn over their nuclear bomb \nto the international inspectors. Now, I would consider that an \nintrusive regime. I wouldn't consider this one.\n  In the case of Libya, they turned over their weapons programs to \ninternational inspectors, allowed them in, allowed them to take them \nout.\n  I don't know why we say this is the most intrusive regime. It seems \nto me that, clearly, in cases where we actually forced the issue, where \nwe actually in South Africa put the totality of sanctions in place, \nthat Congress both in the House and the Senate in a bipartisan way felt \nwere mandatory to force the South African hand.\n  In that case, yes, we got them to give up their nuclear capabilities \nand their right to enrich and all of that. I don't see that here.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett).\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, for months now, the President has made \npromises that we have heard that would prohibit Iran from obtaining \nnuclear weapons through strict oversight.\n  Unfortunately, we see now that this deal does not do that at all. The \nIranian regime has done nothing to earn the trust of the international \ncommunity, yet this agreement rewards Iran with sanctions relief.\n  I was a member of the Iran Sanctions Conference Committee, and I \nsupport tough, strict sanctions against this regime.\n  You see, the Iran sanctions were designed to force a peaceful \nresolution to this ongoing situation. It was clear to many that the \nsanctions were working.\n  Iran had an inflation rate of 35 percent, the value of its currency \nwas falling, and its monetary reserves were dwindling.\n  Iran had no choice but to come to the negotiation table. So the U.S. \nwas in a position of power to negotiate a good deal.\n  Instead, we have a deal which allows Iran to continue to use \ncentrifuges, a deal that allows them to continue to enrich uranium, a \ndeal where, after 15 years, it will be unclear what, if any, access the \ninspectors will have to their facilities, and a deal where Iran can \ndispute inspections and delay for 24 days.\n  This is not, by the way, ``anytime, anywhere'' inspections that the \nadministration also promised us.\n  The President may claim that this deal is built on verifications. \nThat is simply not true. We now know that Congress hasn't even received \nall the details related to the deal. There are side deals as well.\n  So what makes us believe that Iran will abide by the agreement that \nwe see, let alone by the side deals that we have not seen?\n  This deal asks us to trust a country that holds American hostages, \nthat tortures its own people, and that has called for the destruction \nof the United States and its allies. It is not a surprise that Iran and \nits allies are celebrating.\n  However, it is obvious that this deal does little to advance U.S. \nsecurity. We can still reject this severely flawed deal. There are \nstill alternatives. The U.S. can use sanctions, sanctions that have \nworked to negotiate a good deal.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk). The time of the gentleman \nhas expired.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield the gentleman an additional 10 seconds.\n  Mr. GARRETT. We can use those sanctions, those sanctions from the \nvery committee that I was on, to negotiate a good deal.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in protecting the security of the \nUnited States and protecting the security of our allies as well by \nrejecting this misguided deal.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how \nmuch time I have left?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Schweikert).\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, first I would like to thank Chairman \nRoyce. He has actually dealt with this and done this very honorably.\n  It has been powerful to watch. There has been amazing testimony given \nto us. There have been great speakers here. But I fear something very \nimportant has not gotten enough understanding and enough focus.\n  Who in this body is going to take responsibility when the Iranian \nregime is flush with cash and the death and destruction that is coming \nwith that?\n  Who here is going to take responsibility for the displaced people \naround the region?\n  Who here is going to take responsibility for what some of the experts \nhave told us, the potential financing of a Sunni-Shia war in the \nregion, the amount of death, whether it be the $59 billion the \nadministration talks about or the $150 billion that sits in accounts \naround the world that is about to be handed back to the regime?\n  I hold up this board next to me so you can see this is more. This is \nso much more than just the neighbors around Iran.\n  The bad acts have been happening all over the world. Tell me why \nthere is Iranian Revolutionary Guard money, Quds Force money showing up \nin our hemisphere.\n  Earlier this year I was at a series of meetings in Panama. We had \nparliamentarians from the region speaking to us, telling us that they \nare actually seeing Iranian money moving through their banks, financing \nbad actors in their region, creating death and destruction, trying to \nfinance the overthrows of their governments. That is in our own \nhemisphere.\n  Are we prepared as a body, particularly those who will vote for this, \nto step up and take responsibility for the lives that are about to be \nlost, for the governments that are going to be overthrown and the \ndestruction and displaced people, the refugees, the cascades that are \ngoing to come from that?\n\n  We are about to hand billions and billions and billions of dollars to \na regime that is committed to destroying our way of life, but also to \ndestroying their own neighbors.\n  That is what is on the line right now. We are about to execute a vote \nhere that is going to kill, maim, destabilize not only the region; the \nworld.\n  Those who are about to vote for this, I expect you to step up and be \nresponsible for what you have done.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the \nbalance of my time.\n  We have heard a lot in these debates that have gone on today. I would \nlike to take this opportunity to try to reinforce the tremendous \nsupport that we have for this deal.\n  I would like to also debunk the idea that somehow this administration \nis not concerned enough about the security of this country.\n  Let me just share with you the tremendous support that this deal has. \nI will do that by reading some excerpts from and insert into the Record \nan open letter signed by 36 retired U.S. generals and admirals who make \nthe case that addressing the risk of a nuclear conflict with Iran \ndiplomatically is far superior than trying to do it militarily.\n  In their letter, these retired military leaders say about the nuclear \nagreement with Iran, ``There is no better option to prevent an Iranian \nnuclear weapon,'' ``If the Iranians cheat, our advanced technology, \nintelligence and the inspections will reveal it, and U.S. military \noptions remain on the table. And if the deal is rejected by America, \nthe Iranians could have a nuclear weapon within a year. The choice is \nthat stark.''\n  Recognizing the importance of strong multilateral coordination and \naction, the retired military leaders go on to say, ``If at some point \nit becomes necessary to consider military action against Iran, \ngathering sufficient international support for such an effort would \nonly be possible if we have first given the diplomatic path a chance. \nWe must exhaust diplomatic options before moving to military ones.''\n\n[[Page H5932]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, while I have great respect for all of the \nMembers of this House, for the most part, I do not accept the notion \nthat Members who have not served in the way that these generals and \nadmirals have served this country would know better about our security.\n  So I would like to insert that letter into the Record.\n\n  The Iran Deal Benefits U.S. National Security--An Open Letter From \n                     Retired Generals and Admirals\n\n       On July 14, 2015, after two years of intense international \n     negotiations, an agreement was announced by the United \n     States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China and Russia \n     to contain Iran's nuclear program. We, the undersigned \n     retired military officers, support the agreement as the most \n     effective means currently available to prevent Iran from \n     obtaining nuclear weapons.\n       The international deal blocks the potential pathways to a \n     nuclear bomb, provides for intrusive verification, and \n     strengthens American national security. America and our \n     allies, in the Middle East and around the world, will be \n     safer when this agreement is fully implemented. It is not \n     based on trust; the deal requires verification and tough \n     sanctions for failure to comply.\n       There is no better option to prevent an Iranian nuclear \n     weapon. Military action would be less effective than the \n     deal, assuming it is fully implemented. If the Iranian's \n     cheat, our advanced technology, intelligence and the \n     inspections will reveal it, and U.S. military options remain \n     on the table. And if the deal is rejected by America, the \n     Iranians could have a nuclear weapon within a year. The \n     choice is that stark.\n       We agree with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     General Martin Dempsey, who said on July 29, 2015, \n     ``[r]elieving the risk of a nuclear conflict with Iran \n     diplomatically is superior than trying to do that \n     militarily.''\n       If at some point it becomes necessary to consider military \n     action against Iran, gathering sufficient international \n     support for such an effort would only be possible if we have \n     first given the diplomatic path a chance. We must exhaust \n     diplomatic options before moving to military ones.\n       For these reasons, for the security of our Nation, we call \n     upon Congress and the American people to support this \n     agreement.\n         GEN James ``Hoss'' Cartwright, U.S. Marine Corps;\n         GEN Joseph P.

And, further, I would like to share \nwith you something from someone that I came to know very well. It is a \nWashington Post article that I am going to quote from.\n  The quotes will be from Republican and former Treasury Secretary \nPaulson. He will not only make very strong statements about his support \nfor this deal, he slams the naysayers of this Iranian deal.\n  Let me read from the Washington Post article from August 14 in which \nformer Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson was asked what he thought about \nthe viability of maintaining multilateral nuclear sanctions against \nIran if the United States decided to walk away from the nuclear deal \nthat has just been agreed to between Iran and the international \ncommunity.\n  It is important to note that former Secretary Paulson, a Republican, \nwas in charge of administering the administration's sanctions under \nPresident George W. Bush during the period when the international \ncommunity was just beginning to enact the current regime of punitive \nsanctions over Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n  This was his response, ``It's somewhere in between naive and \nunrealistic to assume that after we, the United States of America, has \nnegotiated something like this, with the five other parties, and with \nthe whole world community watching, that we could back away from that--\nand that the others would go with us, or even that our allies would go \nwith us.''\n  Paulson also viewed as far-fetched the idea that the United States \ncould force other nations into lockstep on a more hard-line approach to \nIran by threatening them with secondary sanctions.\n  Again, Mr. Paulson said:\n  `` `I think it's totally unrealistic to believe that if we backed out \nof this deal, that the multilateral sanctions would stay in place,' \nPaulson said. `I'm just trying to envision us sanctioning European \nbanks or enforcing them, or Japanese banks, or big Chinese banks.' ''\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  In fact, the former Treasury Secretary could barely hide his disdain \nfor those who think they could strike a path to a better deal than one \nthat has been reached.\n  Further, he said: ``I had a seat in Washington when we dealt with a \nbig, intractable, messy problem, where there weren't any neat, \nbeautiful, elegant solutions.''\n  He said: ``You were deciding between doing something that \nobjectionable or doing nothing at all, which could even be more \nobjectionable. So I don't particularly like it when people criticize \nsomething that's big and important that's been done if they don't have \na better idea.''\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 14, 2015]\n\nRepublican and Former Treasury Secretary Paulson Slams Naysayer of Iran \n                                  Deal\n\n                         (By Karoun Demirjian)\n\n       Not many high-profile Republicans have anything nice to say \n     about the Iran deal.\n       But former Treasury secretary Hank Paulson--the guy who was \n     in charge of the government's sanctions operation under \n     President George W. Bush, when the international community \n     was just setting up this regime of punitive measures over \n     Iran's nuclear ambitions--thinks at this point, it would be \n     pretty ill-advised to back away.\n       ``It's somewhere in between naive and unrealistic to assume \n     that after we've, the United States of America, has \n     negotiated something like this with the five other, you know, \n     parties and with the whole world community watching, that we \n     could back away from that--and that the others would go with \n     us, or even that our allies would go with us,'' Paulson said \n     during a forum sponsored by the Aspen Institute on Thursday \n     night to discuss his new book on China.\n       ``And unilateral sanctions don't work, okay?'' Paulson \n     continued. ``They really have to be multilateral.''\n       Paulson was responding to a question from the moderator of \n     the event, who had asked what Paulson thought about the \n     viability of maintaining sanctions against Iran, should the \n     United States walk away from the agreement struck in Vienna \n     last month. Congress will vote on that very question next \n     month, but naysayers need a veto-proof, two-thirds majority \n     in both houses to kill the deal--a formidable hurdle to \n     clear.\n       In Congress and on the campaign trail, the critics of the \n     deal--many, though not all of them Republicans--have been \n     advocating ripping up the agreement and either leaving the \n     U.S. sanctions in place or stepping them up to make the point \n     to Iran and the international community that the United \n     States means business. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Charles \n     E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), and candidates have even suggested that \n     the United States could force other nations into lockstep on \n     a more hardline approach to Iran by threatening them with \n     secondary sanctions.\n       Paulson thinks that idea is farfetched.\n       ``I think it's totally unrealistic to believe that if we \n     backed out of this deal that the multilateral sanctions would \n     stay in place,'' Paulson said. ``I'm just trying to envision \n     us sanctioning European banks or enforcing them, or Japanese \n     banks, or big Chinese banks.''\n       Sanctions against Iran have become far more extensive since \n     Paulson left office. And Paulson's comments, delivered in a \n     resort city in Colorado, may not carry that much weight among \n     his GOP colleagues in Washington.\n       The former Goldman Sachs chief executive came to the \n     Treasury Department in 2006 on the eve of a colossal \n     financial crash and left as a controversial figure for the \n     policies he spearheaded. Since leaving that post, he has \n     broken from the mainstream GOP party line to advocate for \n     more attention to issues like climate change.\n\n[[Page H5933]]\n\n       Even others in the Bush administration probably wouldn't \n     agree with Paulson: His former boss, George W., advised \n     against lifting Iran sanctions this spring.\n       But Iran sanctions are Paulson's wheelhouse, and while he \n     didn't direct any darts toward specific politicians or give \n     his own point-by-point assessment of the merits of the deal, \n     Paulson's disdain for those who think they can strike a path \n     to a better solution than the one reached in Vienna was \n     apparent.\n       ``I had a seat in Washington when we dealt with a big, \n     intractable, messy problem, where there weren't any neat, \n     beautiful, elegant solutions,'' Paulson said. ``You were \n     deciding between doing something that was objectionable or \n     doing nothing at all, which could even be more objectionable.\n       ``So I don't particularly like it when people criticize \n     something that's big and important that's been done if they \n     don't have a better idea,'' Paulson said.\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, having said that, I \nwould like to discuss a point that I do not think has been given enough \nattention yet in this debate. Iran could move in any direction over the \nnext 15 years and the postagreement dynamics in Iran would play out in \na number of ways. We are aware of the less benign scenarios.\n  There is also the scenario in which the agreement helps to amplify \nthe voices of those in Iran who want peace in regional and \ninternational accommodation. I have hope with respect to this latter \npossibility, and I will tell you why.\n  It is because more than half the population of Iran today--almost 55 \npercent--is under 30 years old, and the youth unemployment rate is \nsomewhere between 27 and 40 percent. I hope that these young people, \ngiven the opportunity to work, to achieve prosperity, and to live \npeacefully, will, in fact, help animate the kind of change in Iran that \nwill, indeed, move it to become a responsible member of the world \ncommunity.\n  This is a possibility that I urge Members to keep in mind when they \nvote on the resolution before us today.\n  I have no more time, but I would just urge my colleagues to support \nthis important deal and agreement, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, to begin with, I would like to also submit later for the \nRecord a letter by 200 retired generals and flag officers and admirals \nin terms of why they are opposed to this deal and why they feel it \nwould make the national security challenges for the United States more \nproblematic.\n  The second point I would make is that Nasrallah, who is the head of \nHezbollah, says this about this deal:\n\n       Iran will become richer and wealthier and will also become \n     more influential under the deal reached this week. This will \n     also reinforce the position of its allies. A stronger and \n     wealthier Iran in the coming phase will be able to stand by \n     its allies and especially the Palestinian resistance more \n     than at any other time in history.\n\n  What does that mean? I can tell you what it means because, in 2006, \nwhen I chaired the Terrorism Subcommittee, we were in Haifa when \nNasrallah was firing off the Iranian-made rockets with 90,000 ball \nbearings in the warheads into the town of Haifa; there were 600 victims \ninside the trauma hospitals, and now, Iran has transferred over 80,000 \nmissiles.\n  What is it Nasrallah wants that he doesn't have currently? He wants \nguidance systems so that those missiles will hit targets, such as \nindividual buildings in Tel Aviv, the airport, Jerusalem. That is what \nhe needs. That is what Iran is telling Nasrallah it will provide.\n  It needs the hard currency and with this agreement will come the hard \ncurrency. It is also committed to restock the inventory that Hamas used \nwhen it fired off its rockets into Israel from Gaza and to rebuild the \ntunnels; all of this is what the Iranians seek to fund, but to do that, \nthey need the sanctions lifted.\n  When they lift those sanctions, who is going to be the primary \nbeneficiary? It is going to be people such as the Iranian Revolutionary \nGuard Corps that will be strengthened.\n  Look, Mr. Speaker, if this agreement goes through, Iran gets a cash \nbonanza. It gets a boost to its international standing. It gets a \nlighted path toward nuclear weapons. With sweeping sanctions relief, we \nhave lessened our ability to challenge Iran's conduct across the board. \nAs Iran grows stronger, we will be weaker to respond.\n  The question before us today is whether temporary constraints on \nIran's nuclear program are worth the price of permanent sanctions \nrelief. When I say the Revolutionary Guard is going to be the \nbeneficiary, I say that because they are the ones that have taken over \nso many of the major companies in Iran and they are working to \ndestabilize the entire Middle East.\n  That organization fuels the Assad regime in Syria today. Those \nrockets are being launched by the Quds Force into Israel. They are \ngoing to provide them with more weapons and more military personnel. \nThat organization backs the Houthi rebels. There were 200 Quds Forces \nthat were on the vanguard when they overthrew our ally in Yemen, and \nthey overran that country.\n  It is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops in \nIraq. The IRGC exports terrorism throughout that region. It holds sway \nover Iran's nuclear program. It brutally, brutally represses internal \ndissent, and as part of the Iranian agreement, the IRGC is going to be \nbolstered in a big way, and I will explain how else. It is going to \nhave the funds to build up its tanks, its fighter jets, and the \nintercontinental ballistic missiles.\n  The European sanctions on the elite Quds Forces--this is the group \nthat does the political assassinations, assassinations outside Iran, \nand does the terrorist work outside of Iran--that is going to be lifted \non the European side.\n  The administration signed off on these concessions. The deal will \nallow sales of aircraft and parts to Iranian airlines, which the Quds \nForce uses to move its people and weapons throughout the region. The \nIRGC controls key parts, as I said, of the Iranian economy--the largest \nconstruction companies, the telecom sector, shipping.\n  Ninety current and former IRGC officials and companies will be taken \noff the sanctions list as a result of this deal. Even sanctions on the \nhead of Iran's elite Quds Force, General Soleimani, will be coming off. \nSoleimani had been involved in the plot to assassinate the Saudi \nAmbassador here in Washington, D.C.\n  While still under a UN travel ban, Soleimani traveled to Moscow on \nJuly 24, 10 days after the Iran nuclear agreement was announced, and he \nheld meetings with the Russian Defense Minister and with President \nVladimir Putin. Believe me, those meetings are about weapon systems, \nwhich the Russians want to sell to the Quds Force, to the Iranians.\n  The IRGC is the biggest sponsor of terror throughout the Middle East \nand even tried to carry out a terrorist attack here. Under the nuclear \nagreement, as Iran is reconnected to the global economy, the IRGC is \ngoing to be the biggest winner.\n  The agreement helps legitimize Soleimani and gives additional \nresources to the mastermind behind the world's foremost state sponsor \nof terrorism and eyeing future weapon sales.\n  It was Russia that teamed up with Iran in the eleventh hour, after we \nthought this deal was done, to insist on one more thing, the lifting of \nthe arms embargo. I just ask you: If they did that, whose side do you \nthink Moscow is going to take when Iran tests this agreement?\n  Now, we talked a little bit about the younger generation in Iran. \nYes, yes, 55 percent is under 30, but it is not those 55 percent under \n30 that are going to be empowered. The ones holding the strings now--\nbecause of the way the Iranian economy works--are the generals, are the \nclerics. They are the ones that have taken over the companies.\n  When you have got $60 billion to $100 billion, depending upon whose \nfigure you use, and you lift the escrow on that and that money goes \nback to Iran, it is their accounts that it is going to go into, and \nthey are going to control the contracts going forward.\n  How is that going to liberalize the economy or work to the benefit of \nthe next generation in Iran? No, it makes it more certain that the \ntyranny that this theocracy imposes is going to be strengthened.\n  We reverse decades of bipartisan U.S. policy; we remove the Security \nCouncil resolutions against Iran's illicit nuclear program, and we okay \nIran as a nuclear threshold state. That is what has been done here.\n  You and I know that, once that process is underway, Iran is going to \nproduce nuclear weapons on an industrial scale when they are at the end \nof\n\n[[Page H5934]]\n\nthat process, unless they cheat before they get to the end of the \nprocess.\n  Secretary Kerry had previously said we do not recognize Iran's right \nto enrich and that there is no right to enrich in the NPT. However, \nthis agreement legitimizes Iran's vast nuclear program, including its \nright to enriched uranium, which can be used to produce a nuclear \nwarhead.\n  I guarantee you that everybody in the region is going to be looking \nat that and saying: We want the same agreement Iran had. We want that \nsame exemption to the NPT.\n  After the agreement's temporary limits expire, Iran's nuclear program \nwill be treated in the same manner as that of any other nonnuclear \nweapon state party to the NPT. Okay, so we are going to treat Iran like \nit is Holland, but it is not Holland. It has been caught cheating. That \nis why we are here. It has been caught cheating in the past, over and \nover, on their agreements.\n  Iran can have a peaceful nuclear program without the ability to \nenrich uranium. This is something we all understand. Many countries \nhave this. It is this key bomb-making technology that is so \nobjectionable.\n  We had no problem with the idea of letting them have a peaceful \nnuclear program; but why give up the right to enrich? Preventing the \nspread of this dangerous technology has been the foundation of our \nnonproliferation policy for decades.\n  As a result, over 20 countries have peaceful nuclear energy programs \nwithout a domestic enrichment program. In fact, buying fuel for nuclear \npower plants abroad from countries like Russia is much more cost \neffective than producing it domestically.\n  You have to ask: Why do they want to produce it domestically? If this \nagreement is allowed to go forward, the United States will recognize \nthe ability of Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, to \nenrich uranium.\n  Despite claims to the contrary, this will set a dangerous precedent; \nit will greatly undermine longstanding U.S. efforts to restrict the \nspread of this key bomb-making technology. How can we tell our allies \nthey can't have it if we do this?\n  If fully implemented, this agreement will destroy the Iran sanctions \nregime, which this Congress has built up over decades, despite \nopposition from several administrations. We did that in Congress. We \npushed this. The billions in sanctions relief that Iran will get will \nsupport its terrorist activity, and those billions are just a \ndownpayment.\n  Under this agreement, European sanctions on the Iranian Revolutionary \nGuard and the leader of its elite Quds Force--Soleimani, again--are \nremoved, and their job is to export the revolution. That means their \njob is to export terrorism.\n  General Dempsey--I will close with this--testified that Iranian \nmilitias, such as those trained and equipped by Soleimani, killed 500 \nU.S. soldiers in Iraq. Removing sanctions on Soleimani and the IRGC is \nso shocking that, when the deal was first announced, many thought that \nit was a mistake, thought that that was not the case.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, like my vote against the Iraq War, \nconsideration of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is one \nof the most consequential foreign policy votes I will take during my \ntime in Congress. After careful consideration I have decided to support \nthe JCPOA because it is the best way forward to prevent Iran from \nobtaining a nuclear weapon and advance the national security interests \nof the United States and our allies.\n  The intent of sanctions and these negotiations has always been to \ndiplomatically cut off Iran's pathways to a nuclear weapon and to \nverifiably increase transparency of their nuclear activities. After \nreviewing the agreement and its classified documents, participating in \nclassified briefings with Secretaries Kerry, Moniz, and Lew, and \nlistening to the insights of experts on all sides, it is clear that \nthis deal achieves these goals.\n  The JCPOA will ensure that Iran will not have the materials or \ncapability to build a nuclear weapon and extends the breakout time for \nbuilding a nuclear bomb from two or three months as it currently stands \nto at least a year. And if Iran violates the agreement, unprecedented \ninternational inspections will ensure we know about it and can \nautomatically reinstate international sanctions.\n  In contrast, blocking this deal would allow Iran to resume its \nnuclear program with no restrictions or oversight, increasing the \nlikelihood of military conflict and a regional nuclear weapons race--\nprecisely the scenario sanctions were designed to prevent. Another \ncostly war in the Middle East would put American lives at risk and \nundermine the security of our nation and our allies, including Israel.\n  There are no decisions I take more seriously than those that involve \npotentially sending Americans into harm's way. This is undeniably one \nof those decisions.\n  Under the JCPOA, every option is--and will remain--on the table, \nincluding military force. But as a Member of Congress I have a solemn \nobligation to ensure every diplomatic avenue is exhausted before \nmilitary action is taken. That is why I opposed authorizing the Iraq \nWar and why I support the JCPOA.\n  This is a pivotal moment. We must certainly remain vigilant in the \nyears and decades to come to ensure the deal is strictly enforced and \nthat Iran upholds its end of the bargain, but the terms of this \nagreement are strong, verifiable, and long-lasting.\n  The JCPOA is certainly not perfect, but perfect is not an option. \nThose who are urging the defeat of this deal have a responsibility to \npropose a viable alternative--yet no such alternative has been put \nforward.\n  While the risks of a nuclear armed Iran are unquestionably dire, \nthere is simply no scenario in which these risks are reduced by \nrejecting this deal This agreement is the best option available and it \nhas my full support.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am in strong opposition \nto House Resolution 3461, the to Approve the Joint Comprehensive Plan \nof Action, signed at Vienna on July 14, 2015, relating to the nuclear \nprogram of Iran.\n  The President's failed legacy to execute a strategy of peace through \nstrength has resulted in mass murders throughout the Middle East. We \nhave seen his failure to take action after Syria violated the \nPresident's declared ``red line'' and used chemical weapons against its \ncitizens. We have seen it in his failure to recognize ISIL/DAESH as a \nsignificant threat to Americans, not as the ``JV'' team. When it comes \nto Middle East policy, the President has been dangerously inaccurate, \nputting American families at risk.\n  In South Carolina's Second District, I hosted three town hall \nmeetings on the deal, and the response from my constituents was \noverwhelming--the American people know this deal is dangerous in the \ntradition of Neville Chamberlain.\n  This week's vote on the Iranian nuclear deal is of historic \nproportions. If allowed, this deal would economically and militarily \nreenergize a regime bent on the destruction of democracy all over the \nworld. It will put the young people of Iran who seek change at risk. We \nmust act immediately to stop this deal and vote against the Resolution \nof Approval.\n\n\n                           Iran Nuclear Deal\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to begin with a couple quotes from \nthe President about the agreement:\n  ``There is nothing more important to our security and to the world's \nstability than preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and ballistic \nmissiles.\n  ``It does not rely on trust. Compliance will be certified by the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.''\n  Mr. Speaker, you would be forgiven if you thought I was quoting \nPresident Obama. However, I was quoting President Bill Clinton lauding \nhis nuclear agreement with North Korea in 1994. Additionally he stated, \n``This agreement will help to achieve a longstanding and vital American \nobjective: an end to the threat of nuclear proliferation on the Korean \nPeninsula.''\n  Mr. Speaker, we now know that reality turned out to be very \ndifferent. Despite assurances from President Clinton, the North Koreans \nviolated the deal, began a clandestine program to enrich uranium and in \n2006 conducted its first underground test of a nuclear weapon.\n  Once again we are told by a Democrat President that an agreement will \nprevent an adversarial country from acquiring a nuclear weapon. We \nwould be fools to believe that they will not violate the Obama \nagreement just as North Korea violated the Clinton agreement. The \nstakes here are even higher. Iran is a regime that will not hesitate to \nuse nuclear weapons to achieve its long-stated goals: the destruction \nof both Israel and America.\n  The Iran Nuclear Deal that was agreed to by President Obama is wholly \ninadequate and unacceptable. The deal gives up-front, permanent \nsanctions relief to the Iranian mullahs and allows Iran to have an \ninternationally recognized nuclear program after 15 years that could \nquickly produce a nuclear weapon.\n  Most laughable are the ``anytime, anywhere'' inspections. In fact, \nthe agreement grants the Iranians 24 days to allow the IAEA access to \nundeclared nuclear facilities. This gives Iran ample opportunity to \ncheat and continue its march toward a nuclear weapon. We have\n\n[[Page H5935]]\n\nalso learned that the Iranians will be able to provide their own \nsamples from their military base at Parchin to international \ninspectors. This is essentially asking the fox to guard the henhouse.\n  I also have great concerns about what happens once sanctions are \nlifted and billions of dollars are flowing back into Iran. While the UN \nSecurity Council resolutions allegedly prevent Iran from shipping arms \nto terrorist organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah, and to Assad in \nSyria, nothing prevents them from sending money. In an incredibly \ndangerous concession, the U.S. even agreed to shorten the length of the \narms embargo against Iran. There is no question that this will \nnegatively impact regional stability as well as the U.S. Navy's access \nto the Persian Gulf. An article in the Washington Post pointed out that \nthe funds available to Iran immediately upon implementation of this \ndeal would equate to approximately 10% of its GDP. That would be \nequivalent to a $1.7 trillion injection into our economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do not believe this agreement will prevent Iran from \nacquiring nuclear weapons. I believe it will do just the opposite. In \nno way should a country that vows to wipe Israel off the map and chants \n``Death to America'' be allowed nuclear capabilities. Today marks a \nturning point for the future of one of our greatest allies, Israel. If \nthis deal goes through, President Obama and Democrats in Congress will \nown the consequences of allowing the Iranian regime to become a nuclear \npower.\n  We can and must have a better deal. A deal that truly allows for \nanytime/anywhere inspections. A deal that would keep restrictions on \nIran's nuclear program for decades. A deal that forces Iran to end its \nmissile development program. A deal that allows Iran truly limited \nenrichment capability. A deal that releases U.S. hostages in Iran. It \nis a catastrophic failure that President Obama did not insist on these \nprovisions in the nuclear deal. We should be embarrassed that as the \nleader of the free world and the most powerful country on earth, this \nis the best deal President Obama could negotiate.\n  We have been presented with a false choice of accepting this deal or \ngoing to war. We should reject this deal and return to work, not to \nwar. We cannot allow the sanctions to be lifted, we must reject \napproval of the deal and we must have all the information--including \nside agreements--before the clock can begin on the deal. I urge my \ncolleagues to stand with our ally Israel and with the American people. \nThe consequences of these votes are truly life and death.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, an Iran with a nuclear weapon would \npresent an existential threat to Israel, destabilize the region and \nundermine U.S. security interests. This agreement is our best option \nfor avoiding such a scenario. If Congress rejects this agreement, there \nis a high probability Iran will continue developing weapons grade \nplutonium and uranium.\n  That could result in American military action--something I believe we \nshould avoid--and that the American people oppose. A U.S. strike would \nbe costly, causing loss of life on both sides--and could lead to \nattacks on Israel. Yet, it would only postpone Iran's nuclear weapons \ndevelopment by a few years.\n  Clearly, a strong, enforceable diplomatic solution is superior. Let's \nbe clear--this agreement is enforceable. The monitoring and inspection \nprovisions are more intrusive than any previous agreement. Most \nimportantly, they will prevent Iran from producing fissionable material \nwithout the international community knowing.\n  There are some who suggest that even with this agreement Iran might \nstill acquire nuclear weapons in the long term. While some provisions \nof this agreement are indeed time limited and the world will need to \nrevisit this issue, this agreement remains our best chance of thwarting \nthe immediate threat. Many estimates suggest Iran is two to three \nmonths away from acquiring a nuclear weapon--and this agreement \naddresses that very imminent threat.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have heard from constituents on all sides of the \nissue. I respect the opinions of those who do not support it. However, \nI believe this agreement is our best option.\n  Support the agreement. Vote yes.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise after careful \nconsideration and review of the Joint-Comprehensive Plan of Action \n(JCPOA) and would like to extend my full support of the deal negotiated \nbetween Iran and the P5+1 countries. This historical agreement between \nthe United States, China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, plus \nGermany, is in the best interest of our country, our major ally in the \nMiddle East, and the global community.\n  The agreement, which will face Congressional scrutiny, has won \nendorsement by more than one hundred former American diplomats. The \ngroup that contains Republicans and Democrats described the deal, \nnegotiated by Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Energy Dr. \nErnest J. Moniz as a ``landmark agreement.'' It would make no sense to \nreject this diplomatic movement towards stability and peace in the \nregion.\n  Twenty-nine top American scientists have also endorsed the deal, \nnoting that it will ``advance the cause of peace and security in the \nMiddle East, and can serve as a guidepost for future nonproliferation \nagreements.'' The group of scientists includes six Noble Laureates. In \na letter to President Barack Obama, they pointed out that Iran was only \n``a few weeks away'' from having fuel for nearby weapons. The agreement \nwould stop Iran's nuclear program, the scientists wrote.\n  In the JCPOA, Iran agrees that it will not develop or acquire a \nnuclear weapon. The deal also includes a permanent ban on Iran's \ndevelopment of key nuclear weapon components and is based on four clear \nobjectives; blocking the highly enriched uranium route, allowing no \npath to plutonium, intensive monitoring, and incentives for compliance\n  Without the agreement, there will be no restraints on Iran's nuclear \nprogram. There will more than likely be an arms race to acquire and \ndevelop nuclear weapons by various nations in the Middle East. Such a \nclimate would not be in the best interest of our country, and certainly \nnot in the best interests of our ally, Israel, and the global \ncommunity.\n  It is my firm belief that if this deal is not implemented due to a \nCongressional blockade, we risk devastating military conflict. I am \nhopeful that we can continue on this trajectory of peace and diplomacy \nas opposed to an unavoidable nuclear arms race and armed conflict in \nthe region. As we move to the next phase and allow Congress to study \nand debate this agreement, we must listen to the non-proliferation \nexperts who have worked tirelessly to move the deal forward. I urge my \nCongressional colleagues to support the deal. It would be negligent to \nwalk away from a nuclear deal at this point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5935-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter), my good friend.\n\n\n                         Iran Nuclear Agreement\n\n  Mr. CARTER of Texas. I thank my friend from Arizona for recognizing \nme.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have been having a really great conversation here, \nand I hope that everyone who has the responsibility of casting a vote \non this so-called deal that the President has brought us has been \nlistening very closely.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President wants Congress to approve what I would \ncall an absurd deal that eases the path for an avowed enemy of the \nUnited States of America's and our allies to unleash a nightmare on the \nworld.\n  I want us to take a look--and I ask the supporters of this deal to \ntake a look--at what Iran has done to merit our trust.\n  We first saw these guys way back in the Carter administration when \nthey stormed our American Embassy and took our people hostage and held \nthose people for, I believe it was, 42 days. They abused them in every \nway they could think of. Quite honestly, they finally released them \nafter pressure was placed on them. Since that time, I cannot think of a \nsingle instance where dealing with Iran has been a positive thing. In \nfact, let's look at the public face they put on.\n\n[[Page H5936]]\n\n  They still chant ``death to America.'' I heard them chant ``death to \nAmerica'' last night on television and ``death to Israel,'' one of our \nallies. They still support terror groups, and we just heard from the \nchairman of the committee of all of the terror groups that they will be \nable to support after this deal is done. They are still governed by \ncabal fanatics who are hellbent on spreading their perverted view of \ntheir faith.\n  Now, is this a nation we should choose to strike a deal with--to make \na nuclear deal?\n  To those people who say they support this, I would like you to make \nsure you have confidence in the people we are making a deal with. I \ndon't know what the rest of the world calls a deal, but, generally, \nwhen you are making a deal, both sides have some kind of benefit. I can \nsee all kinds of things that we are giving to these folks, to Iran, \nincluding a big bucketful of money--billions of dollars. Basically, we \nhave given them everything that they desired as far as going forward. \nOur inspections are questionable.\n  My question is: What is the United States of America getting out of \nthis deal?\n  We are getting a promise from a regime that has a long history--\nalmost 50 years--of lying whenever it serves their purpose. We are \ntaking their word that they are going to do certain things, and we are \ngetting nothing else from this bill but their word.\n  Think about the cost if this is not the right deal. Those of you who \nare really thinking about America, think about the cost. To make a \nmistake on this vote is, quite honestly, catastrophic. Then there is \nthe horror that would come to pass if they actually were to detonate a \nnuclear device if, for some reason, our failure to do the right thing \ncaused them to get on the fast track to get their hands on it. The \nblood will be on the hands of those who didn't take the time to decide: \nAre these trustworthy people for us to be dealing with? I would argue, \nthey have no track record by which to argue that they are trustworthy.\n  Tomorrow's vote is probably as important a vote as anyone in this \nChamber will ever take because it is a vote that could unleash nuclear \nwar in the Middle East as a result of our failure to cut a real deal. I \nurge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to think about this--to \nstand with America, to stand with Israel, to stand with those who \noppose state sponsors of terrorism, and to oppose President Obama's \nirresponsible and dangerous Iran agreement.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I thank Judge Carter.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is something I, actually, have never done; but have \nyou ever had one of those moments in your life when you want to come to \nthe microphone and share it with whomever is willing to listen?\n  This has been a tough few days here. Many of us, as we come to these \nmicrophones, have these heavy hearts because we are fearful that what \nis going on around us may be one of those momentous moments where we \nremember this for the rest of our lives, where it is one of those \nvotes--one of those debates--where you affect the world. There is \nanother side to this on a personal basis where you realize how \nincredibly honored, lucky, blessed you are to get to be behind this \nmicrophone.\n  Last week, a woman from my community passed away. We all in our lives \nhave those handfuls of people who actually make a difference and affect \nour lives. She is partially responsible for my being behind this \nmicrophone.\n  A woman named Elanor Benson, from Fountain Hills, died last week--I \nbelieve at age 95--and she changed my life. I was a 20-, 21-, maybe 22-\nyear-old kid. I was selling real estate in our little town as a way to \nfinance my way through Arizona State University at night. She, in her \nretirement at that age, decided to take on another job at our little \noffice.\n  She sat me down, and she knew I had an interest in conservative \npolitics. I still to this day remember her looking at me and saying: \n``David, I like you. You are going to be the next president of the \nlocal Republican club.'' I tried to explain to her there was no way I \nwould have time for such a thing, and she looked at me and said: \n``Don't worry. I will help.''\n  This is a woman who moved to our little community on the side of \nScottsdale, I believe, in the late seventies, and had such an impact. \nFor years, I used to believe maybe a third of the town--half the town--\nhad become involved in politics, mostly Republican politics, because of \nher passion, her energy. You could not stop her.\n  She got me to be president of the local club and stood by me when I \ndid dumb things and applauded me when I did good things and scolded me \nwhen I didn't say the right things and walked me through how to be more \nsensitive instead of being so caffeinated, which is a family problem.\n  I realized, in the chaos of doing this job, that I failed to tell her \nhow much I loved her and how much she affected my life, because I don't \nbelieve I would be here today if it weren't for Elanor Benson, who not \nonly changed my life but who, actually, I believe--with her work at the \nFountain Hill Chamber of Commerce, her work for so many causes, her \nwork for her church--made my community a much, much better place. We \nare all better in our part of Arizona because of her life. It was a \nlife well lived. It was a long life. She was beautiful to the day she \npassed, and I wish I had let her know how much we cared.\n  So, Elanor, if you are out there, thank you. Thank you for changing \nmy life. Thank you for making my community a better one.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5936-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5936-H5937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN MEMORY OF HELEN BURNS JACKSON\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

She was surrounded by her loving family and \nher friends.\n  A native of Greenville, South Carolina, Ms. Burns Jackson instilled \nin her children a sense of dignity, self-respect, and loving justice in \nthe face of the inhumane treatment of African Americans in the \nsegregated South.\n  Born in 1925, she endured the hardships of poverty, the hardships of \nracism, to raise two sons of great accomplishment, great distinction, \nan American hero and civil rights legend, the Reverent Jesse Louis \nJackson, Senior, and the Motown music phenomenon Charles Jackson. A \ngifted singer of world renowned.\n  Mrs. Burns Jackson herself was a singer and dancer, and she passed on \na scholarship to a great college to raise her two sons.\n  Her life, Mr. Speaker, was the quintessential American story of \novercoming the odds with an unbreakable will and a deep, abiding faith.\n  She planted the seeds of courage, the seeds of perseverance, and the \nseeds of hope in Reverend Jackson and in his brother, Charles.\n  Reverend Jackson would go on to not only free American hostages, but \nbecame the freedom fighter for those who are oppressed and those who \nare poor all around this globe.\n  It is on this very day, September 10, 2015, that I rise before the \nHouse of Representatives to pay tribute to this beautiful and \nextraordinary Movement mother.\n  Mrs. Jackson was a cosmetologist by profession, and she was known as \na towering pillar of her community. Her home became the central station \nof the civil rights movement.\n  Mr. Speaker, she often provided me with great encouragement when she \ntraveled to Chicago to visit her son and his family.\n\n[[Page H5937]]\n\n  As a young activist, I certainly was inspired by her words of wisdom. \nAs a young activist, she inspired me to commit myself to serving \nothers.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has been said that trees are the Earth's endless \nefforts to nurture life. Mrs. Helen Burns Jackson was a beautiful tall \ntree among all of us who has returned to the heavenly glory of her God, \nour God Almighty.\n  Her spirit lives not only in her children, her grandchildren, and in \nher great-grandchildren, but her spirit also lives in the righteous \nfruits that may be found in those of us who were touched by the endless \nlove, the great kindness, the great grace, and the tremendous wisdom of \nMs. Helen Burns Jackson.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of the First Congressional \nDistrict and on behalf of my loving wife, Carolyn, we pay tribute to \nthis remarkable and special woman, this great tree, this inspiration to \nall of us, Ms. Helen Burns Jackson. She is indeed a mother of the \nmovement.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5937-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5937-H5939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, a wonderful tribute from a man that knows \ncourage. He has it, he has shown it, and he knows what it is to stand \nup for what he believes in.\n  A lot of great examples have served in this body, and that is what we \nneed right now. We face as important an issue as we have had, certainly \nsince I have been here, and possibly decades.\n  A deal with the devil is what it comes down to, a deal with what \nRonald Reagan would say is evil. It makes the evil empire of the Soviet \nUnion pale in comparison to the evil that Iran's leaders have \nperpetuated, and this administration has done a deal with them.\n  Chairman Ed Royce has eloquently pointed out that Iran has violated \nevery international agreement they have entered since 1979.\n  So wouldn't it fill the definition of insanity if another deal is \nentered by what used to be the lone superpower with the one and only \ncountry in existence right now in the world that has broken every \nagreement it has entered since 1979?\n  If someone were standing back as a historian and looking at what is \ngoing on right now and were totally objective, he or she would probably \nsay: Well, it looks like the fools running the United States are going \nto get what they deserve. They have made a deal with sheer evil. These \nevil leaders have lied. They have broken every agreement they have ever \nentered, and these fools running the United States are going to get \nwhat they deserve. It is going to happen again. People are going to die \nin greater numbers than ever before.\n  What grieves me more than anything is what seems to be the idea of \nsome in the House and Senate that: Gee, since Iran is going to get \nnuclear weapons, surely they are going to cheat. They are going to get \nthem. They are going to get them sooner rather than later. This deal is \nnot going to allow anybody to stop them.\n  So what is important here is to provide political cover to \nRepublicans. We can do that by acting like we are fighting real hard in \nthe House, acting like we are fighting real hard in the Senate. Then we \nlose.\n  Then when Iran gets nukes and kills hundreds of thousands or millions \nof people, you say: See, we told you. We did what we could. But the \ntrouble is that is not good enough because lives in this country and in \nthe nation of Israel are all at stake here.\n  We have been told that: Gee, the 15 nations heading up the U.N. \nSecurity Council, they have agreed; so, it should be binding against \nthe United States.\n  That argument was attempted to be made by the Secretary of State and \nthe President himself, that: Gee, we have to go along because the U.N. \nhas already voted.\n  Well, yeah, that would be true if there were not something called the \nUnited States Constitution under which our first President under the \nConstitution took office in 1789.\n  And since this has been in effect--our U.S. Constitution, Article II, \nSection 2, second paragraph, has been in effect, he, talking about the \nPresident, shall have power by and with the advice and consent of the \nSenate to make treatise, provided two-thirds of the Senators present \nconcur. It is very clear.\n  And we also know it is very clear that you cannot have a treaty like \nthe Non-Proliferation Treaty. The international agreement that was \nlauded by so many over such a long period of time--you cannot amend an \ninternational treaty like that unless it is with another treaty. You \ncannot amend that with an executive agreement. You cannot amend that \nwith an agreement that is nonbinding.\n  Therefore, it is exceedingly clear that what the President and \nSecretary Kerry and Wendy Sherman that did such a good job helping with \nthe North Korea deal so they got nuclear weapons--they say it is not a \ntreaty. But absolutely it is a treaty.\n  So if we are going to uphold our oath of office, we have to \nacknowledge that this is a treaty and implore the Senate to announce \nthat, even though the President has not submitted this treaty to them \nfor ratification under Article II, since it is a treaty, they had the \npower to bring it up.\n  And, yes, there is a convenient Senate rule called cloture that Harry \nReid actually suspended numerous times in the matter of some \nconfirmations so they could get judges on the bench that would uphold \nwhatever interpretation of the Constitution this administration cared \nto bring before them.\n  But there is a time when the Republicans in the Senate must say: You \nknow what. This is too important to let a gaggle of minority Senators \nfrom the minority party keep us from voting on the most important bill \nof our time. We are not going to let a rule that we make, that we put \nin place, that we can suspend, keep us from having a vote on the most \nimportant bill of our time, the treaty with Iran.\n  So the Senate can suspend, as Harry Reid did, the cloture rule with a \nvote of 51 Senators. Once they have the 51 that suspend cloture in this \nIranian treaty, then bring the treaty to the floor for a ratification \nvote, it will not get two-thirds.\n  And then, once and for all time, it will be clear to everyone, except \nperhaps the President and Secretary Kerry--it will be very clear, as it \nis to constitutional law professors I have talked to--that we are not \nbound by the Iranian treaty with the only country in the world that has \nbroken every international agreement they have had since 1979.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  The resolution that I had filed with numerous great cosponsors, it \npoints out that the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015--that is \nthe Corker-Cardin bill--does not apply to the Joint Comprehensive Plan \nof Action regarding Iran--that is the Iran treaty--submitted to \nCongress on July 19, 2015, because the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction is a treaty, and pursuant to article II of the United States \nConstitution, the Senate must give its advice and consent to \nratification if the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is to be \neffective and binding upon the United States.\n  It also states--because it is a fact--on March 11, 2015, Secretary of \nState John Kerry, in describing the administration's nuclear \nnegotiations with Iran, clearly stated that it was ``not negotiating a \nlegally binding plan'' with Iran, and therefore, it does not have to be \nsubmitted to Congress.\n  If it were not legally binding, then, no, Secretary Kerry and the \nPresident do not have to submit it to Congress; but the President and \nthe Secretary of State have already given this facade, this charade \naway because they have already said: Well, gee, if Congress doesn't go \nalong with it, we will be in breach of the agreement because the U.N. \nhas already voted on it.\n  A-ha. You said it wasn't legally binding what you were negotiating, \nand now, you are telling us that is not true.\n  I mean, it conjures up memories of other statements like: ``If you \nlike your insurance, you can keep it. If you like your doctor, you can \nkeep it.'' It conjures up sermons by this administration and this \nPresident how we had to take out Qadhafi out of Libya for stability of \nthe area, that it would\n\n[[Page H5938]]\n\nmake the place so much better in North Africa.\n  We saw what happened. Qadhafi would not have been removed without \nPresident Obama bombing on behalf of the rebels that were infused with \nal Qaeda that would end up ultimately attacking our consulate in \nBenghazi and killing four Americans.\n  We now see, as I did last week when I was in north Africa, this \nPresident, this State Department have created massive instability \nacross north Africa. It has put tens of millions of people in fear. \nWhat do you think this crazy migration started from?\n  It started from the policies of this President in declaring that \nsomething that they love calling the Arab Spring but ended up becoming \na cold, harsh killer of a winter was going to be helped along by the \nUnited States.\n  Some in north Africa reminded me of our President's statement that \nPresident Mubarak had to go. The President declared he has to go. He \ninterfered with what was going on in Egypt. He interfered with an ally, \nnot a great guy at all. He created massive instability that allowed the \nMuslim Brother Morsi to take over. Yes, he was elected. Yes, as \nconfirmed again this past week, there were plenty of fraudulent votes. \nHe alleged to have 12 million or so votes.\n  After a year as President of usurping the power under the \nConstitution, totally disregarding the Constitution, taking powers that \nweren't his, moving to become dictator, over 30 million Egyptians rose \nup, went to the street. These were moderate Muslims; these were \nsecularists, Christians, Jews that came to the streets and said, with \none accord, one heart, one voice: We don't want radical Islamists \nrunning Egypt.\n  Our Muslim friends in Afghanistan in the Northern Alliance said the \nsame thing, We don't want radical Islamists running Afghanistan, but \nthe Egyptian people did it on their own. It may have been the greatest \npeaceful--it was the greatest peaceful uprising in the history of man. \nThere have never been that many people peacefully demonstrating.\n  What was not peaceful was the Muslim Brotherhood because they want \nthe world caliphate. They thought they were on the way with the help of \nPresident Obama. They were taking Libya. They felt like they were \ntaking Algeria, Tunisia, and come on around north Africa and the Middle \nEast, they were on their way to that world caliphate they were \npromising they would have, the same world caliphate that the former \nadviser to the Secretary of Homeland Security here in the United States \ntweeted out after another American had his head cut off that the \ninternational caliphate was inevitable, Americans just needed to get \nused to the idea, a man that I had been warning was a Muslim Brother \nand was a top adviser in this administration and needed to be out.\n  Finally, after he made it clear to even the most dense in this \nadministration that he was in favor of an international caliphate, \nfinally, they had to let him finish his term and let him go by \nretiring.\n  Well, the President is still getting that kind of advice, and the \ntruth is that it is a disaster. It has done so much damage to this \ncountry. Those who say this is a great deal are the same people that \nsaid we had to remove Qadhafi. It created massive instability. It \ncreated a situation where you have so many deaths as people try to flee \nfrom north Africa.\n  Where do you think they are coming from? What do you think laid the \ngroundwork for this? It was this President's intervention in Libya, \nthis President's meddling in Egypt.\n  We heard the President himself say on national television--\ninternational television because ISIS heard it, that ISIS is junior \nvarsity, they are JV. I played on the JV, and I played on the varsity, \nand there is a vast difference. ISIS knew there was a difference. This \nPresident did not.\n  He said, if we could just arm the vetted moderate Syrian rebels, that \neverything would be fine in Syria. We have seen that he has created \nmore chaos. He has created tens of thousands of more refugees because \nof his failed policies born out of massive ignorance--or somebody that \nis advising him is not ignorant, they know what they are doing--but it \nis setting the Middle East and north Africa, figuratively speaking, on \nfire and, in many cases, literally speaking.\n  We heard over and over of instances where the President's vetted \nmoderate Syrian rebels that we spent millions and millions and millions \nof dollars training and arming, they kept having all that incredibly \nupgraded equipment taken over by ISIS. I have been over there. I met \nwith the Kurdish commanders. They are begging for up-armored equipment \nso they can at least have some way to stay on the battlefield with ISIS \nthat this President has armed through the so-called vetted Syrian \nmoderate rebels.\n  Well, we heard tonight that Madeleine Albright thinks this is a good \ndeal. Well, wow, I feel so much better that Secretary Albright that \nsaid, along with Wendy Sherman, that helped negotiate the deal with \nIran, that, Gee, the key to keeping North Korea from having nuclear \nweapons is to give them nuclear power plants, give them the nuclear \nmaterial they need because they are willing to promise, in writing, \nthat they won't develop nuclear material or nuclear weapons if we will \ndo all that for them. Well, that didn't work out so well.\n  People advising this President that were part of the advice--and we \nhear Madeleine Albright thinks that is a good deal? Then if there was \nany doubt in any Republican's mind--I don't think there is--but any \ndoubt in any Republican's mind just how horrendous this deal is, that \nhad to be completely dispelled tonight when we heard from our friend on \nthe Democratic side that Hank Paulson, the former Secretary of the \nTreasury, thinks this is the thing to do.\n\n  This is the guy that gave us TARP. This is the guy that said when we \nasked, Well, if you don't know how much mortgage-backed securities are \nworth, how do you know you need $700 billion, and in our conference \ncall with other Republicans, the answer to that question was, Well, we \njust needed a really big number.\n  That is the guy that we are told, tonight, is assuring us that this \ndeal with Iran is the way to go.\n  On August 6, 2015, White House press secretary Josh Earnest, at a \nWhite House press briefing, stated: ``We don't need Congress to approve \nthis Iran nuclear deal.''\n  On July 28, 2015, Secretary Kerry, at a hearing before the House \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs, stated the reason why the Iran nuclear \nagreement is not considered a treaty is because it has become \nphysically impossible to pass a treaty through the United States Senate \nanymore. It has become impossible to schedule. It has become impossible \nto pass.\n  Two days after Secretary Kerry testified to that, that that was the \nreason he didn't bring this treaty as a treaty, well, the United States \nformally ratified the amendment to the Convention on the Physical \nProtection of Nuclear Material when Henry S. Ensher, the Department of \nState's Ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, delivered \nthe United States' instruments of ratification to the IAEA. Whoops--it \nturns out Secretary Kerry's testimony was not true. I don't think he \nlied. I just think he was that ignorant.\n  On June 4, 2015, less than 2 months before Secretary Kerry testified \nit had become physically impossible for the Senate to ratify treaties, \nhe stated the Department of State is ``preparing the instruments of \nratification of several important treaties'' and that he wants ``to \npersonally thank the U.S. Congress for their efforts on the \nimplementing legislation for the nuclear securities treaties.''\n  Well, I don't think he was lying or ignorant. I just think he forgot \nthat he had just thanked us for passing these treaties--or at least the \nSenate for ratifying these treaties. He forgot that he had just done \nthat when he said it is physically impossible to ratify a treaty \nanymore.\n  May 7, 2015, the Senate held a vote on the Iran Nuclear Agreement \nReview Act of 2015, commonly referred to as the Corker-Cardin bill, in \nwhich every Senator voted on that bill with the understanding that the \nIran nuclear agreement was an executive agreement, not a treaty, and \nthe United States' sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program would \nremain in place.\n  The Corker-Cardin bill actually states:\n\n\n[[Page H5939]]\n\n\n  \n\n       It is the sense of Congress that United States sanctions on \n     Iran for ballistic missiles will remain in place under an \n     agreement related to the nuclear program of Iran that \n     includes the United States.\n\n  The Corker-Cardin bill was intended as a review of the application of \nstatutory sanctions against only Iran's nuclear program. The Corker-\nCardin bill prescribes a process for congressional review only of \n``agreements with Iran related to the nuclear program of Iran.''\n  Under subsection (b) and (c) of section 135 of the Atomic Energy Act \nof 1954, as added by the Corker-Cardin bill, lawmakers may resolve to \napprove, disapprove, or take no action on nuclear agreements with Iran.\n  Under section 135(d) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as added by \nthe Corker-Cardin bill, it calls for ``congressional oversight of \nIranian compliance with nuclear agreements.''\n  It is pretty easy to recall for those of us with a half-decent memory \nthat actually, under the bill, the treaty being proposed by this \nadministration, the Iran treaty actually doesn't allow Congress \noversight.\n\n                              {time}  2145\n\n  Not only does it not allow Congress the oversight, it says the IAEA \nis going to have oversight, not Congress, and we don't even know the \narrangement that has been negotiated or is being negotiated between the \nIAEA and Iran.\n  But we do know this. My friends across the aisle said in debate \ntoday--and I was amazed that this statement would be made--that if Iran \ncheats, we will know it. That was a quote from one of my friends across \nthe aisle.\n  Well, if Iran cheats, we won't know it. We don't even know if the \nIAEA has a decent agreement. But we know this. Iran has made clear they \nwill not allow the IAEA inspectors to go to their military sites. They \nmade that clear in every communication they have had since this treaty \ncame forward. And then we find out, actually, Iran has said: We are \ngoing to provide samples to you.\n  Oh, so, as my Democratic friend said, if Iran cheats, we will know \nit. What that means is when Iran cheats, they are going to bring \nsamples from the area they won't let the IAEA inspect and say: Here are \nthe samples that let you know we cheated, because our Democratic \nfriends in Congress knew if we cheated, we would let you know we are \ncheating.\n  Seriously? Is that how naive this government has gotten?\n  We were told in debate by a Democratic friend that it would have been \na mistake to demand the release of U.S. hostages. Oh, yeah, that would \nhave been a mistake, that before we enter any negotiation, they have to \nshow good faith by releasing the hostages so that we know that they are \na country with whom we can deal? Of course that was the right thing to \ndo.\n  And $100 billion to $150 billion going to Iran under this deal is \nmore money than we have given or used to help Israel with since Israel \ncame into being again in the late 1940s. And yet we are going to give \nit not to our close ally Israel. We are going to give it to their worst \nenemy that has even said this past week that they were plotting to \noverthrow Israel. This week they have said that they are plotting to \noverthrow Israel, and they are coming for the United States.\n  I have heard people, I believe, Mr. Speaker, wrongly compare Neville \nChamberlain to the current situation that the President and Secretary \nKerry have proposed. I would submit that that is a grossly unfair \ncomparison for Neville Chamberlain, because at the time Neville \nChamberlain had that paper that he got Hitler to sign that caused him \nto say, ``This is peace for our time''--a lot of papers messed it up \nand said ``peace in our time''; he said ``peace for our time''--at the \ntime Chamberlain did that, Hitler had not violated every international \nagreement he had entered. He hadn't done that. Iran has.\n  At the time Neville Chamberlain said, ``This is peace for our time,'' \nHitler had not been saying, ``Death to England''; ``death to France''; \n``death to the countries in Europe.'' He had not been saying that. \nIranian leaders have been, including the Ayatollah.\n  At the time Neville Chamberlain said this agreement means ``peace for \nour time,'' Hitler had not publicly stated he was plotting the \noverthrow of any of the countries in the area. Iran has. They are \nplotting the overthrow of Israel and to take out the United States.\n  Our friend Tom Cole said in the Rules Committee this week that he was \nconcerned that this agreement will cause an arms race, and he is \nexactly right. That was confirmed again this past week as I was over \nthere talking to people that know in the Egyptian Government.\n  The Saudis are already working a deal to buy nukes. The Saudis know \nthey have got to have them because Iran is going to have them under \nthis Iranian treaty if we don't stop the treaty.\n  You stop the treaty by the Senate voting on it as a treaty and not \ngetting to two-thirds. That means it is not binding against the United \nStates. Other countries in the area--Jordan, Egypt, even Libya, \nLebanon, and all these countries--know they are going to have to have \nnukes if they are going to survive the area.\n  It is going to create the proliferation of nuclear weapons like there \nhas never been in the world. And as someone said, mutually assured \ndestruction with Russia was a deterrent, but with Iran, it is an \nincentive.\n  This is such a dangerous time. But the Iranian treaty amends the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in several places. You can't amend a \ntreaty unless you are amending it with another treaty.\n  This is a treaty the Senate needs to step up and say it is a treaty. \nAnd for heaven's sake, this is far more important a situation where we \nsuspend the cloture rule so that we do not allow a small segment of \nradicals supporting Iran to keep us from voting on the most important \nbill of our time. And then vote, and when you don't get two-thirds it \nis not ratified.\n  What the House is doing this week is actually not a bad strategy for \nthe House because, as a treaty, we don't get a vote. But if we stand \nidly by and let the President treat it as if it has been ratified, then \nIsrael will have to defend itself. Under the Iranian treaty, we will \nhave to defend Iran, not Israel, and the unthinkable will happen, and \nthat is the United States and Iran will be on the same side against \nIsrael. We have got to stop that.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/house-section/article/H5939-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATE BILLS REFERRED\n\n  Bills of the Senate of the following titles were taken from the \nSpeaker's table and, under the rule, referred as follows:\n\n       S. 349.
