Mr. Speaker, we talk a lot in this Chamber about the \nnegative impacts of overly burdensome rules and regulations handed down \nby bureaucrats in Washington.\n  Nowhere are the potential negative consequences more evident than the \n700-page rule proposed by the Department of Labor. Among other things, \nit expands the Department's complex pension rules to cover IRAs as well \nas changes the definition of who is classified as a financial adviser. \nUltimately, I believe this rule will restrict access to advice and \ndrive up costs for small businesses.\n  It also illustrates a fundamental difference between Republicans and \nDemocrats. Democrats want everyone to end up in the same place with \nidentical outcomes, and Republicans believe in providing individuals \nwith the same level of opportunity. This rule seeks guaranteed outcomes \nfor everyone, but there are inherent risks associated with investing.\n  While I am open to modernizing current rules in order to protect \nconsumers against predatory practices that pose unnecessary risks, I \nwill not support efforts that make it harder for American families to \nsave and plan for retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4495-7", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4495-H4496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING J.C. KILMER\n\n  (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, Tom Brokaw once said:\n\n       It's easy to make a buck. It's much harder to make a \n     difference.\n\n  Today I rise to honor someone who made a difference as a \nschoolteacher for 50 years. He began his career a half century ago at \nRoosevelt Junior High School in Port Angeles, Washington, where he \ntaught seventh grade homeroom and coached football.\n  I have met so many people who had him as a teacher; I think he may \nhave taught my entire hometown. But the common themes from his former \nstudents that I have met have been these: He was a great teacher. He \ncared about me as a student. He didn't just teach me English and \ngeography; he taught me to be a better student and a better person.\n  Earlier this week, he finished out his career at the Chrysalis School \nin Woodinville, Washington, and yesterday he had his first well-\ndeserved day of retirement.\n  Mr. Speaker, the teacher that I rise to honor today is named J.C. \nKilmer, and he is my dad.\n  Mark Twain remarked that the two most important days in a person's \nlife are the day he is born and the day he figures out why. My father \nwas born to teach. And like so many fantastic educators, he has \naffected so many lives in so many ways.\n\n[[Page H4496]]\n\n  So today I hope you will join me in thanking a teacher. I want to \ncongratulate him for being a great educator, a difference maker, and a \nterrific dad.\n  Happy retirement, Dad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4496-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REPEALING THE MEDICAL DEVICE TAX\n\n  (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of repealing \nthe medical device tax, a burdensome tax on medical devices that \nincreases costs, stifles investment, slows the race for cures, and \nultimately makes health care more expensive for patients.\n  The tax has resulted in less spending on research and development, \nescalating costs on the newest technologies, a reduction in capital \ninvestments, and, ultimately, is a factor in the loss of jobs in our \nNation's vital life science sector, which is critical to keeping the \nUnited States a leader in the world and is crucial to my home State of \nNew Jersey.\n  One of the major newspapers in our area editorialized recently in \nsupport of our efforts, the Easton Express-Times, pointing out that the \nmedical device tax is having a depressing effect on a sector of the \neconomy that until recently was doing well. Some are looking to \nrelocate overseas.\n  I thank my close friend, Congressman Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, and \nthe Ways and Means Committee for sponsoring this legislation. I urge \nthe House to pass repeal of the medical device tax and work with our \nSenate colleagues to send this measure to the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4496-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS\n\n  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, the night before last, with the whole world \nwatching, my home team, the Golden State Warriors, brought the O'Brien \nTrophy back to Oakland.\n  The Warriors, led by NBA MVP Stephen Curry, showed the power of \npersistence and teamwork both on and off the court.\n  The finals against the well-matched and talented Cleveland Cavaliers \nwere a thrill to watch. These games were basketball at its best, with \nboth teams showing real passion on the court.\n  It has been 40 years since Oakland last brought home the \nchampionship, and throughout this long journey, Warrior fans have \nstayed loyal and faithful.\n  Thank you to the Warriors team for making our dreams of another \nchampionship a reality. I have no doubt that this remarkable team will \ngo down in Oakland's history. Thank you to head coach Steve Kerr, \nStephen Curry, Clay Thompson, finals MVP Andre Iguodala, and all of the \ntalented players who brought this championship home.\n  I can't wait to celebrate this win with all the Warriors fans and \nplayers at the victory parade tomorrow morning in Oakland.\n  Go Warriors. Go Oakland. Go Dub Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4496-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN HONOR AND MEMORY OF CLEMENTA PINCKNEY\n\n  (Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to highlight the familiar \npredicament Congress has found itself in because the Republican \nleadership continues to govern by crisis.\n  As of today, we have only 4 legislative days until the Export-Import \nBank expires. This bank helps American businesses of all sizes and \nmarkets around the world.\n  China's businesses have the support of their country's export-import \nbank, and we need to give our businesses the same certainty.\n  For years, the Ex-Im Bank has helped level the playing field for \nbusinesses in my district and across this Nation, empowering and \nsupporting them to grow and conduct business overseas.\n  I have had the opportunity to work with colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to support businesses and create jobs in my home district in \nSan Bernardino County.\n  There is no reason we can't continue working together to reauthorize \nthe Ex-Im Bank so American workers and businesses have the opportunity \nto play a role in the global economy.\n  We cannot force American businesses and workers to pay the price for \nCongress' inaction. The Ex-Im Bank doesn't cost taxpayers a cent and \nhas created or maintained 1\\1/2\\ million private sector jobs since \n2007. We need to stop the political games and reauthorize the Ex-Im \nBank.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4496-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PREGNANCY DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT ACT\n\n  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, in the 21st century workplace where women \naccount for nearly half of the workforce, it is vital that our policies \nreflect today's new realities. Specifically, the 1978 Pregnancy \nDiscrimination Act, PDA, is in need of modernization.\n  Recently, the act was litigated before the Supreme Court, but even \nthe Justices were unable to fully resolve how to apply the PDA. That is \nwhy Senator Murkowski and I have introduced the Pregnancy \nDiscrimination Amendment Act. It says working moms-to-be should have \naccess to reasonable accommodations from their employers if health \nissues arise from pregnancy.\n  Unlike other proposals that will create more mandates, confusion, and \nlitigation, my bill simply clarifies existing law to ensure the 21st \ncentury workplace works for families, employers, and expectant mothers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4496-6", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4496-H4497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAN\n\n  (Mr. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as we approach the \ndeadline of negotiations with Iran to stress that any agreement must \nunequivocally guarantee that Iran cannot obtain nuclear weapons.\n  While a diplomatic solution is the ideal method of stopping Iran's \nillicit nuclear weapons program, we owe it to the American people of \nthis country to end up with not just a good deal, but a great deal.\n  A great deal means giving inspectors robust access to nuclear \nfacilities to promptly verify compliance. A great deal means Iran \nacknowledges the full extent of its nuclear weapons program. A great \ndeal would remove tools that\n\n[[Page H4497]]\n\ncould leave Iran with a pathway toward nuclear weapons and provide a \nlong-term solution. Finally, a great deal phases in sanctions relief so \nwe aren't rewarding Iran for deception and noncompliance.\n  A nuclear Iran is one of the greatest threats to the United States; \nour greatest ally, Israel; and to regional stability in the Middle \nEast. I cannot stress enough how important it is that Iran must not, \nunder any circumstance, be able to obtain a nuclear weapon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4497-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMEMORATING AMERICAN EAGLE DAY\n\n  (Mr. ROE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to once again \nrise to join in commemorating June 20, 2015, as American Eagle Day and \ncelebrate the recovery and restoration of the bald eagle, the national \nsymbol of the United States.\n  On June 20, 1782, the eagle was designated as a national emblem of \nthe United States by the Founding Fathers at the Second Continental \nCongress. The bald eagle is the central image of the Great Seal of the \nUnited States and is displayed in the official seal of many branches \nand departments of the Federal Government.\n  The bald eagle is an inspiring symbol of the spirit of freedom and \ndemocracy of the United States. Since the founding of the Nation, the \nimage, meaning, and symbolism of the eagle have played a significant \nrole in art, music, history, commerce, literature, architecture, and \nthe culture of the U.S. The bald eagle's habitat only exists in North \nAmerica.\n  I hope my colleagues will join in celebrating June 20, 2015, as \nAmerican Eagle Day, which marks the recovery and restoration of the \nbald eagle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4497-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  0915\n                         INTERNATIONAL YOGA DAY\n\n  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Ms. GABBARD.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 426 of the \nCongressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I make a \npoint of order against consideration of the rule, House Resolution 321.\n  Section 426 of the Budget Act specifically states that the Rules \nCommittee may not waive the point of order prescribed by section 425 of \nthat same Act.\n  House Resolution 321 states that it ``shall be in order . . . to \nconsider in the House, without intervention of any point of order, a \nmotion . . . that the House concur in the Senate amendment with the \namendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying \nthe resolution.''\n  Therefore, I make a point of order pursuant to section 426 that this \nresolution may not be considered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The gentlewoman from New \nYork makes a point of order that the resolution violates section 426(a) \nof the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The gentlewoman has met the threshold burden under the rule, and the \ngentlewoman from New York and a Member opposed each will control 10 \nminutes of debate on the question of consideration. Following debate, \nthe Chair will put the question of consideration as the statutory means \nof disposing of the point of order.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I would like to take a \nmoment, if I may, to mourn the horrific loss of life in Charleston, \nSouth Carolina.\n  Places of worship used to be places of sanctuary, but there are no \nmore sanctuaries in the United States from gun violence. Whether it is \nan elementary school, a college, a hospital--anywhere in the world--gun \nviolence is there among us. We want to all give our condolences to our \ncolleague Jim Clyburn, who represents that area in Charleston.\n  I have a personal interest in it as a very good friend of mine, who \nhad been pastor of Baber AME Church for decades in Rochester, left us \nto go to pastor that church and is still an elder there. So our hearts \ngo out to all of them for all of the grief. We hope that we will see \nbrighter days when people can go to a sanctuary place of worship in \npeace.\n  Now to the matter before Congress today, Mr. Speaker, our Chamber and \nour Nation are off balance. There is something drastically wrong when \nMembers of the people's House are asked to vote on greasing the skids \nfor a trade deal they are discouraged from reading and, even if they do \nread, cannot discuss with their constituents, the people who sent them \nhere.\n  That is what we are being asked to do today regarding a massive trade \ndeal: abdicate our authority by approving fast track and to give the \nsimple vote of ``yea'' or ``nay'' on an issue that is not simple at \nall. In fact, it could not be more complex or more far-reaching. Unlike \nthe Senate action on this measure, Members of the House were totally \nunable to have any amendment or very much discussion of what is going \non here.\n  Mr. Speaker, fast track is an anachronism that needs to die. There is \nno longer any need for it at all. It came as a matter of convenience in \nthe seventies when the United States was the biggest manufacturer on \nthe face of the Earth and when we were pretty sure we always would be. \nSo it was decided by the powers that were in place then that the \nCongress would just hand it over to the administration to go ahead and \nnegotiate whole trade agreements despite the fact that the Constitution \nof the United States gives us that power. We allowed the administration \nto do it. One committee, Ways and Means, got to see it. There was no \namendment, and the only vote we can take on a trade bill is ``yea'' or \n``nay.''\n  Mr. Speaker, it is not just we who are forbidden, basically, to see \nwhat is in this bill and to talk about it. It is also the countries of \nAustralia and New Zealand. Let me read from a report on that.\n\n[[Page H4498]]\n\n  They are very much concerned there with the fact that this TPP--what \nthey had found leaked out, that what PhRMA is doing here is to extend \nall of their patents for 12 years so that they can not only raise those \nprices here in this country but for all of those countries involved in \nthe trade agreement.\n  Jane Kelsey, who is on the faculty of law of the University of \nAuckland, described what was happening here as one of the most \ncontroversial parts--that is, the pharmaceutical part--because the U.S. \npharmaceutical industry used a trade agreement to target New Zealand's \nPharmaceutical Management Agency, PHARMAC, which is their health \nsystem.\n  This transparency act will erode the process and decisions of \nagencies that decide which medicines and medical devices to subsidize \nwith public money and by how much. The leaked test shows that TPP will \nseverely erode PHARMAC's ability to continue to deliver affordable \nmedicines and medical devices as it has for two decades.\n  The parliamentarians in Australia and New Zealand are under the same \nrestriction as we are, only theirs is even worse. A member of that \nParliament who goes to read the trade agreement has to sign a paper \nthat he will not discuss it for 4 years.\n  I make this point because two of the great democracies on this \nplanet--the United States of America and Australia--have given over the \nright of the people's elected Representatives to know what is in these \ntrade deals that will have such devastating effects on all of the \npeople they represent. How in the world can this continue, and how can \nwe let it go on?\n  If we don't do anything in this Congress--and we may not--I would \nreally like to see us do away with the whole idea of fast track. We \ncan't afford it any longer. At least I am sure, when it began, there \nwas no problem with certain corporations deciding that they were going \nto make the main decisions as we have had made known by leaks here. I \nhave not gone to read the bill. I do not want to be hamstrung by \nanything that I can discuss and concerns that I have with the people \nwhom I serve. This is one of many reasons, I think, this trade bill is \nbad.\n  Let me say I have a few more here that I would like to go over, and I \nneed to make sure that everybody understands this. When you vote for \nTPA today, you are voting for things that were in that Customs bill. \nAgain, hardly any of us knew anything about it.\n\n  Let me just tell you what they are:\n  Preventing action on climate change. This is going to be written in \nthis bill. Nobody anywhere can even bring up climate change. It is a \ngreat step backward, and they managed to get this in, and the Pope is \nin sync, too. That is very interesting.\n  Secondly and most grievous to many of us who have worked so hard on \nhuman trafficking, including Members on both sides of this House with \nwhom I have worked, it weakens the language on human trafficking. They \nhad to do that because the nation with the worst standards on human \nrights and human trafficking is Malaysia, which is one of the countries \nwith whom we want to be allied.\n  Third, they ignore currency manipulation, which we have been told for \na decade or more is one of the most serious acts against the United \nStates from countries that trade with us, which is changing their \ncurrency. As one of my colleagues has pointed out, Mrs. Dingell, one \nautomobile company made more money from its trade manipulation than it \ndid by selling its cars. We don't want to expand that. We don't want \nthat to go on.\n  There is also a strong anti-immigration provision that we are being \nasked to vote on today, and we won't do that--giving up our rights as \nthe elected Representatives of the people of the United States. It says \nthat trade agreements do nothing to address the immigration. They may \nnot.\n  Then Democratic priorities, such as ensuring that Dodd-Frank would \nnot be affected by the trade agreement, because we have heard that \nfinancial services is very heavily involved here, were rejected in the \nSenate and were not included in this bill. We are very much concerned \nabout that.\n  We are very much concerned about where we are going, but the fast-\ntrack deal will be an absolute rubber stamp to disaster.\n  As I mentioned before, it has been negotiated in a cloud of secrecy \nby multinational conglomerates and the financial services industry and \npharmaceutical companies that have one priority, and that is the bottom \nline. What we know, again, is all we have heard from leaks. Not a lot \nhas made its way to the light of day, but what has has been appalling, \nand it does certainly give anyone who wants to vote pause to think \nabout what that vote means before he gives it, because we don't know \nwhat is in that bill.\n  One of the things that some of us are very much concerned about is \nfood safety and prescription drugs, the erosion of environmental \nprotections, and the degradation of the financial sector. This deal is \nheaded down the wrong path. Not only would the TPP certainly ship good-\npaying American jobs overseas, but it would endanger the food on our \ntables by weakening the safety standards. Ninety percent of the seafood \nconsumed in America is imported, but only 1 to 2 percent is inspected, \nmuch of it from countries with little controls on sanitation and water \nquality that American consumers expect.\n  One of the biggest threats comes from shrimp imported from Vietnam, a \nTPP partner. The dangerous bacteria in Vietnamese shrimp is really \nubiquitous and has included shrimp contaminated with MRSA, which is \nfatal, and drug-resistant salmonella. What is more, the TPP report \nincludes due deferential preference to rules negotiated by drug \ncompanies extending their patents, as I have said, in an unfair way for \n12 years. They are rigging the system in a way that would make it \nharder for people in TPP countries to have access to life-saving drugs.\n  Now, we have got a history to warn us about this. This thing has been \nmodeled after NAFTA, which cost us over 5 million jobs. My part of the \ncountry is just now recovering from NAFTA a little bit, and we don't \nwant to see this happen again. All over this country, there are \nfactories that are closed and cities that are gone--places where there, \nliterally, is no work.\n  Even doing TAA, which is very important to us, would be training \npeople for jobs, in most cases, that don't even exist; but this has \nbeen hidden away from the American people and certainly has been hidden \naway from the Congress, the people who represent them. It is causing a \nstir all the way around the world. As I pointed out, other countries \nare looking at this with great interest.\n  Let's follow what our minority leader said last week. Let's put this \nthing to rest and negotiate openly a trade agreement that we can be \nproud of. We all believe in trade. Everybody talks about free trade. I \nwant to change that now to fair trade that will be enforceable and that \nwill benefit everybody involved.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition to the point of \norder and in favor of consideration of the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise with a sad heart regarding \nthe occurrences and the things which happened in South Carolina last \nnight. I know, I join the gentlewoman as well as all the Members of \nthis body to express our condolences and our sorrow with the things \nthat have happened. I know that later in the day we will take time to \noffer those formally by the members of the South Carolina delegation.\n  Mr. Speaker, the question before us is, should the House now consider \nHouse Resolution 321. That is what we are here for. While the \nresolution waives all points of order against consideration of the \nmotion to concur with the amendment, the committee is not aware of any \nviolations of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. This is simply a \ndilatory tactic that the gentlewoman wants to use to talk further about \nthe issue at hand. I get that.\n  We have spent weeks talking about this. The United States Senate \nspent weeks talking about this issue. The gentlewoman wanted to use her \ntime to talk about all the things that she believes are wrong with the \nbill, and that is okay. That really doesn't bother me.\n\n[[Page H4499]]\n\n  But the bottom line to the entire matter is that we are using our \nresponsibility under the Constitution for the Congress of the United \nStates to establish the laws and to direct the President of the United \nStates that we believe is very constitutional to say to the President \nof the United States, we want you to go engage the world in a trade \ndeal, and we are going to tell you the parameters, some 160 different \nparameters about how we believe you should engage the foreign countries \nin these trade deals.\n  The gentlewoman is right, there are some difficult piece parts in \nthere, as the gentlewoman mentions about immigration. Yes, I made sure \nthat was in there because I don't believe this should be about \nimmigration or visas. I believe this should be about trade. And, yes, \nthere is language that is in there about climate change because I don't \nbelieve this should be about the United States in a political \ncircumstance trying to push our ideas on a trade deal about global \nwarming or these considerations that might be related to that issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman is right, there are piece parts of this \nagreement, the trade promotion authority, that not everybody likes, but \nlet's not act like you didn't have an opportunity to read the bill or \nunderstand the bill. But much like any contract--and that is what we \nare engaging here in. We are engaging in saying to the President, we \nwant you to go sign a contract, an agreement with these foreign \ncountries that are in the Far East who have not only large populations, \nbut growing economic circumstances to buy our products, and us to make \nsure that we lower tariffs or taxes on those products to where they are \navailable to us.\n  Yes, we understand currency manipulation is a problem, and primarily \nthat is a problem with perhaps two countries. Neither of those \ncountries do we have a free trade agreement with, and one of them we \nwant to have a free trade agreement with. Another country simply, I \ndon't believe, understands rule of law or intellectual property, and I \nthink they are thugs and don't care. They are a country that steals \nopenly hundreds of billions of dollars from the United States, and they \ndo not respect any rule of law or international agreements. So we \nprobably won't sign an agreement with them.\n  But this is a good deal. It is a good deal. The last 10, 20 countries \nthat America has had a trade agreement with, we have a $10 billion \nsurplus with those countries because those countries want American \nproducts, because the American worker does a great job, and we have the \nbest engineering and manufacturing and pricing, but the product is \nworthy in the world market and will sell.\n  The State of Texas, which I am from, sells $289 billion of Texas-made \nproducts overseas every year. That is an example of how important trade \nis.\n  This trade deal contract that we are wanting to empower the \nPresident--whoever that may be for the next 7 years--is to say let's go \ncut a deal that is good to that country and to America. In the process, \nMr. Speaker, we added some language for those of our friends that are \nwatching along with you, Mr. Speaker, as I address my comments to you.\n  Section 8, subsection A on page 101 says:\n\n       United States law to prevail in event of conflict.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, it lays it out right here:\n\n       No provision of any trade agreement entered into under \n     section 3(b) nor the application of any such provision to any \n     person or circumstance that is inconsistent with any law of \n     the United States, any State of the United States, or any \n     locality in the United States shall have effect.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, what I am trying to suggest to you is, there are a lot \nof things about this bill; some that some people like, some things that \nothers don't like. But we had a chance to read it; we had a chance to \nunderstand it. This is a contract that we have not even agreed to yet. \nWhy would someone go and publicly talk about a deal that they haven't \nmade?\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I believe that what is happening right now is that \nwe should say that this point of order should not prevail. I think that \nwhat we should do is move to the direct discussion that we are going to \nhave to allow the House to continue its business, and I urge Members to \nvote ``yes'' on the question under consideration.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas will state his \ninquiry.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, my inquiry: In the underlying bill, is \nthere anything to prevent taxpayers from having to pay out hundreds of \nmillions of dollars for the privilege of enforcing the very laws that \nthe gentleman from Texas says this agreement would preserve, any local \nordinance, any State agreement like happened in Canada recently, that \nthe taxpayers end up having to pay the bill for simply enforcing \nexisting law?\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is not stating a parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I urge a ``yes'' vote. I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New York will state her \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I need to inquire from you, if my colleague was \nreading from the trade bill, what he had read and is forbidden to speak \nabout. It is classified, you know. Did he reveal classified \ninformation?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman will suspend. The \ngentlewoman has not stated a parliamentary inquiry. Now, if the \ngentlewoman has a parliamentary inquiry, please state it.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. My concern is that he is reading from a classified \ndocument. I need to know if that is the case.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Section 8 of the TPA. I did not say TPP.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe we have pretty well beaten this dead donkey to \nits point. Its logical conclusion is we now move forward. I urge a \n``yes'' vote on the question of consideration of the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  The question is, Will the House now consider the resolution?\n  The question of consideration was decided in the affirmative.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) is \nrecognized for 1 hour.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield \nthe customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. \nSlaughter), my friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is \nfor the purpose of debate only.\n  Mr. Speaker, once again, I believe that our comments this morning \nshould be tempered with a reminder about the events of South Carolina \nand how much this body and its Members offer their prayers and \nconsideration not only of our colleagues but all the people of South \nCarolina, the men and women, law enforcement, and people of faith all \nacross this country. I want to, once again, express my consideration of \nthose ideas.\n  Mr. Speaker, before I go through my opening statement, I yield 2 \nminutes to the gentlewoman from Irvine, California (Mrs. Mimi Walters).\n  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. I thank the gentleman from Texas for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have spent considerable time debating the merits of \nTPA in this body. I want to bring us back to the fundamentals of this \ndebate. I want to talk about why trade is so important to our economy, \nwhy trade is a conservative cause, and why trade is so vital to our \nNation. Simply put, free trade empowers the individual to make \ndecisions in his or her best interest without undue government \ninfluence.\n  Look around at your house or at your car. Without question, there are \nimported products. Free trade allows you, as an individual, to make the \nbest economic choice for your family. When economic enterprise is free \nfrom unnecessary government interference and all enterprise is treated \nequally, the most competitive actors will rise to the top.\n\n[[Page H4500]]\n\nThat means higher quality products and lower prices, which translates \nto improved standards of living and economic growth.\n  Opponents of free trade will say we need protectionist measures to \nmaintain certain industries, but that is a flawed argument. \nProtectionist measures may benefit a few in select industries, but \nultimately protectionism is more harmful to the Nation's economic \nhealth. Protected industries become inefficient. Consumers are denied \nchoice, and American businesses face retaliatory trade measures \noverseas. Bottom line, protectionism is an abandonment of the free \nmarket in favor of government intervention.\n  I believe that when American businesses and entrepreneurs are placed \non an equal playing field, when we eliminate tariffs and protectionist \nbarriers at home and abroad, American businesses can compete and win \nagainst any of their foreign competitors. The famed economist Milton \nFriedman said: Free trade ultimately forces competitors to put up or \nshut up.\n  Mr. Speaker, let us set the table for free trade. Let us pass TPA. I \nknow American businesses will put up.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut (Ms. DeLauro), who has been so effective on this bill.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this fast-\ntrack bill, which is only made worse by a gimmick of it being attached \nto unrelated legislation designed to help Federal public safety \nprofessionals. I might add, as has already been mentioned, the general \npresident of the International Association of Firefighters, which this \nrule addresses as well, has said: We urge you to oppose this rule.\n  For 20 years, our Nation's trade policy has been failing American \nworkers and the businesses that want to invest in this country. It has \ndriven away jobs, pushed down wages, and exacerbated inequality. A vote \nfor fast track is a vote to continue that bad trade policy for another \ngeneration because if we approve fast track today, we rubberstamp the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership agreement.\n  The Trans-Pacific Partnership asks American workers to compete with \nlabor in developing countries like Vietnam, where the minimum wage is \n56 cents an hour. It does nothing to combat the biggest source of lost \njobs--currency manipulation--which The Economist's Fred Burcksen has \nsaid has cost us in the United States up to 5 million jobs. People lost \ntheir jobs and lost their livelihoods. It allows thousands of foreign \ncorporations to challenge U.S. laws on food safety, drug safety, \nenvironmental protection, health care, labor rights, the minimum wage, \nand, indeed, any domestic law on any subject.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  The gentleman on the other side of the aisle said that that is not \nthe case. Just witness what happened last week when the majority in \nthis body voted to repeal country of origin labeling so that we know \nwhere our meat, our poultry, and our pork comes from because the World \nTrade Organization and Canada and Mexico ruled against us. So we are \ngoing to give up our domestic law.\n  This is a trade agreement that has been crafted by lobbyists for the \nspecial interests and industries that stand to gain the most by \nweakening U.S. regulation and shipping jobs overseas, yet the \nadministration has shown absolutely no interest in improving this deal \nor even listening to our concerns. That means that when the Trans-\nPacific Partnership comes to this House, we need the ability to amend \nit. At the very least, it must include sanctions against currency \nmanipulation, enforceable labor, environmental standards, and include a \ntransparent process.\n  If we vote for fast track today, we throw away our ability to make \nany of those amendments, and we turn our backs on our commitment to \nAmerican workers: to their jobs, to their families, and to their \neconomic security.\n  We must make this a vote, and this vote must be a turning point so \nthat at long last the American public can say that those of us in this \nHouse opposing fast track demand policies.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. The vote last Friday and today's vote are critical in \nletting the American public know where we stand and that, in fact, we \nprioritize their economic security, their jobs, their increased wages \nand that we are opposed to special interests. And that is what this \nTrans-Pacific Partnership is all about.\n  We must reject this bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of confusion down here. Everybody thinks \nwe are now talking about ObamaCare, and we are not.\n  The gentlewoman talked about diminishing wages, diminishing job \nopportunities for the future, diminishing opportunities for American \nworkers to have higher wages. There is no bill that I have ever seen \nthat diminished wages or people's opportunity to work the hours that \nthey would like to work more than ObamaCare. But we are not debating \nthat today.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are here--and I want to be clear--about trade \npromotion authority, TPA--not TPP, not any of the other bills. We are \nhere for TPA today, exactly the same bill that this House passed last \nweek. That is what we are here for.\n  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nSunnyside, Washington (Mr. Newhouse), a member of the Rules Committee.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the rule and the underlying trade \npromotion authority bill.\n  Look at my State of Washington. We have jobs, economic growth, and \nincreased exports because of trade. Those benefits and the example of \nthat can be applied to our entire Nation.\n  By passing TPA, Congress will set priorities to ensure that any \nagreement levels the playing field with our trading partners and \ncreates jobs here at home. Without it, the administration will be \nsetting those priorities, and we, Congress, will have no say and little \noversight.\n  In my State, we export coffee, many agricultural products, aircraft, \nfootwear, and software. We export, fully, 30 percent of our apples, 60 \npercent of our hops, and over 85 percent of our wheat.\n  TPA is about instructing our trade negotiators to reduce the trade \nbarriers that American farmers and manufacturers face so that we can \ncreate and sell openly around the world.\n  Right now, our American wines face very stiff tariffs in Japan, but \nChilean and Argentinean wines face none. Our beef faces a 38 percent \ntariff; oranges, 16 percent. TPA will instruct our trade negotiators to \nwork on lowering these tariffs.\n  The reason to vote on TPA and why it is so important is that it will \nmake the deal public and give the American people several months to \nreview any negotiated deal. Without passing this, there is no review \nperiod. The deal can stay secret.\n  Some have objected that their voices have not been heard on this \nmatter, but for months, the House Ways and Means Committee and the \nRules Committee have considered dozens of amendments to three different \ntrade-related bills. There has been ample time for debate.\n  Mr. Speaker, this rule and the underlying bill are critical to our \neconomy. Without it, our country will continue to face enormous \nbarriers; but with it, we can grow our businesses, create more jobs, \nand ensure the American economy remains the most competitive and \nstrongest in the world for decades to come.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nIllinois (Ms. Schakowsky).\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. The administration seems to think the Democrats and \nthe coalition that is opposing the TPP would reject any trade deal. We \nare called protectionists. We are called unreasonable. But that is not \ntrue. Rather than these fancy parliamentary manipulations, we should \ntake the time now to fix it.\n\n[[Page H4501]]\n\n  Some of the most odious positions that we know that are in the TPP \nwhich this fast track will speed us to are U.S. negotiating positions. \nOur trading partners are not clamoring for the extrajudicial investor \ndispute resolution authority, allowing huge corporations to challenge \ntheir hard-fought consumer protections, worker and environmental laws, \net cetera. These are our negotiating positions. We could drop them and \nthat would be welcomed abroad among our trading partners.\n  Countries want the opportunity and the right to protect their food \nsupplies--and that includes us. Decrease smoking; promote Buy America; \nincrease the minimum wage; control the cost of drugs; protect our \nenvironment. We could reset the balance of the intellectual property \nrights and access to lifesaving, affordable medicines by rewriting the \npharmaceutical chapter, which I did look at.\n\n  More than a trade bill, this establishes a new regulatory regime that \nfavors the wealthiest and the most powerful corporations. We could \nchange that.\n  These votes we are taking today are not the end of the track. It is \nbeginning the track to a new negotiation. It is the beginning of an \nopportunity for us to sit down and make sure that we get the best for \nworkers, consumers, and our trading partners, and that we benefit our \neconomy not just for the very few at the top that can go to some \nextrajudicial court and challenge our regulations, but for everyone. \nThis is a bill that we can make better.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman knows that in the TPA agreement there is \nan agreement that she can go and attend every single round of the \ndiscussions and negotiation, by law. She can be right there. She can \nwatch it as it happens. We can be engaged in this, as Members of \nCongress, the entire way. That is what this agreement is about. This is \nabout TPA, not TPP.\n  The fear factor, Mr. Speaker, is incredible. Let's go and do the \nright thing for the American worker and our future. That is what we are \ndoing now.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Raleigh, North \nCarolina (Mr. Holding), from the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, my good \nfriend, the chairman of the Rules Committee, for yielding.\n  Here we go again, Mr. Speaker, debating what should be the United \nStates' future role in the global economy.\n  We have heard a lot over the past few months about the economic \nbenefits associated with free and fair trade, but trade is just as \nimportant to our Nation's foreign policy as it is to our bottom line. \nThere is no question that trade is an important, strategic soft-power \ntool.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't think for one second China isn't watching this \nvery debate right now, waiting to see how serious we, the Congress, are \nabout America's economic future and commitment to retaining our \nposition of global leadership. In fact, Mr. Speaker, I would venture to \nguess they have been focused on what a deal like the TPP would mean for \ntheir sitting and future ambitions in the Asia Pacific region for a \nlong time now.\n  The United States can either be in a position where we can write the \nrules for the future trade agreements and develop closer bilateral ties \nwith our negotiating partners, or we can sit on the sidelines.\n  Passing TPA is about expanding our influence in a critical region of \nthe world with the TPP and solidifying our alliances with our partners \nin Europe with the TTIP. Failing to pass TPA, I fear, will confirm many \nof our allies' own fears that America is in retreat from the global \nstage.\n  But we can send a strong signal today, Mr. Speaker, that while our \nNation's foreign policy has recently been adrift, the House of \nRepresentatives--and the United States--supports closer economic ties \nwith our partners and wants to see an America that is engaged on the \nworld stage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this rule and support for the TPA \nlegislation later today.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards).\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this rule. It is such a danger, \nMr. Speaker, that the majority is trying to move through the back door \nwhat it could not get through the front door on the floor of this House \nlast week. And they are doing it in the most shameful way, Mr. Speaker: \nhiding behind our first responders. That is right; hiding behind \nfirefighters and emergency personnel.\n  The International Association of Firefighters, representing more than \n300,000 firefighters and emergency room personnel, oppose what is being \ndone here today on this floor, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  There is one thing that I agree with the gentleman from Texas about. \nThis is a donkey that died last week when we stood up for American \nworkers, small businesses, and American jobs. And right now that donkey \nis like roadkill, and we are going to kill it right here on the floor \nof this House of Representatives.\n  We know that this body can pass legislation that in fact is not just \nabout free trade, but is about free trade--and they are not doing it \ntoday--protecting our workers, protecting our climate, protecting our \nBuy America provisions for our procurement.\n  And so, Mr. Speaker, even as we are just getting word of the Pope's \nencyclical on climate change and overwhelmingly recognizing the human \ncost to us all, we have a letter from our U.S. Trade Representative, \nMichael Froman, saying that this deal doesn't do anything to deal with \nthe authority of the administration to negotiate climate change. That, \nin fact, is shameful. And what we are doing here today is against \nAmerican workers, against American businesses, and against American \njobs.\n  It is time to kill this donkey once and for all by putting it to rest \nand coming back to the table to reset for the American workers.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nButler, Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), one of the most exciting new Members \nof Congress from the Ways and Means Committee. I have visited and \nwatched this young man as he not only ably represents a proud group of \npeople, but is a strong American.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, in this House, we have a duty to legislate based on \ntruth, not fiction. We cannot afford to be uneducated, uninformed, or \nuntruthful when it comes to PTA. Maybe the problem is we labeled it \nwrong. Maybe we should have called it ``Congressional Trade Authority \nOversight.'' Maybe that is what we should have called it.\n  There is a great misunderstanding--and I hope it is a \nmisunderstanding--about what this does for us. There is no way America \ncan compete in the global economy without strong trade agreements. When \nCongress sets the parameters and very carefully constructs what the \nagreement has to contain, there is no mystery, there is no bogeyman, \nthere is nobody hiding under the bed, there is nobody hiding in the \ncloset. You don't have to have a secret decoder ring. You don't have to \nhave some magical knock at the door to read all these different items. \nIt is there for you to look at.\n  For crying out loud, will you stop pushing a false narrative if it is \nabout growing our economy? The only way we can grow is protecting what \nwe have and then going into the global economy and increasing our \nmarket penetration. It is that simple.\n  If you want America to grow, then you must allow America to grow. And \nyou must allow America to lead, because when America leads, America \nwins. And when America wins, the rest of the world wins. It is just \nthat simple.\n  Why in the world fast track? It is not fast track. If you want to \ncall it slow track, that is fine, because you are going to have 60 days \nto read it. That is pretty slow, at least around here. You want to call \nit smart track? That is what it is. It is smart track. It is safe \ntrack, and it is sure track. The other thing, it puts America back on \nthe track to economic prosperity.\n  Pass TPA today and put America back on the track to protect American \njobs. Allow the economy to grow, and allow our workers not just to \nproduce\n\n[[Page H4502]]\n\nand distribute products at home, but around the world. That is how we \nwin, and that is how the people who depend on us win. When America is \nstrong, America leads.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  When we are not strong, we create a vacuum at the top of the world \nthat is going to be filled with bad actors.\n  Please stop using a false narrative. If you are not informed, get \ninformed; if you are not educated, get educated, but for God's sake, \ndon't be untruthful.\n  I urge passage of the TPA.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their \nremarks to the Chair and not to others in the second person.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman for \nthe time.\n  Members, what I really dislike about this whole debate is that there \nis so much invective thrown around, claims of untruth.\n  Now, here is the truth. The reality is that, if we pass trade \npromotion authority, we will have nothing more than an up-or-down vote \nat the end of the process. They don't have to take our amendments. They \ndon't have to listen to what we say. Very likely, what will happen is \nthat whatever has been negotiated already will be what the deal is.\n  For some Members to try to claim that others don't get it or they are \nnot being honest is, quite frankly, insulting and does not add one \nthing to the quality of the debate.\n  The American people deserve to know that if trade promotion authority \npasses, there is a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote that will happen at the end \nof the process, and nobody here will be able to impact it through the \nnormal course of events. We can go to some meetings; we can write some \nletters; but can we actually legislate? No.\n  Now, the reason that this is a very bad outcome is because the United \nStates Constitution delegates Congress, this body, with the power to \nregulate commerce with foreign nations. It says: ``Congress shall have \npower . . . to regulate commerce with foreign nations.''\n  What we are doing here is taking that constitutional authority and we \nare handing it to the Executive and hoping for the best.\n  Now, the people who have been negotiating the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership all along are a body of about 600 multinational lawyers and \nbusinesspeople. The voice of the workers haven't been there. The voice \nof the environment has not been there. The voice of ordinary citizens \nwho have every reason to want a better world and impact this process \nhave been muted in favor of big multinational corporate types. We must \nvote ``no'' on TPA today.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany), a member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee and an awesome free trader.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Rules \nCommittee for giving me time.\n  Let's set the facts straight here. Liberal union leaders, radical \nenvironmentalists, some of our friends on the other side have been \nrelentless in pushing misinformation to confuse and distract the \nAmerican people. It undermines the confidence that the American people \nhave in this body, the people's House.\n  Let's look at the facts. TPA, trade promotion authority, it is not a \ntrade agreement. It is the process by which we get the best possible \ntrade agreement, the best possible agreement on behalf of the American \nworker and the American farmer.\n  This is Congress asserting its constitutional authority by setting \nthe priorities for our negotiators. We are robustly involved in the \nnegotiation process, and this TPA version is even better than previous \nones because it empowers all Members of Congress, not just the Ways and \nMeans Committee or the Senate Finance Committee.\n  TPA has been public. It has been public for months for anybody and \neverybody who wants to read it. Just go to congress.gov. It is not \nsecret.\n  They are trying to deliberately confuse TPA, trade promotion \nauthority, with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is a trade \nnegotiation underway and not completed yet. We want a strong TPP--\nTrans-Pacific Partnership--agreement for the American workers and for \nfarmers. We won't get that without TPA.\n  TPA puts a strong check on the President, placing the Congress in the \ndriver's seat with 150 negotiating objectives that must be addressed or \nelse the final agreement won't be brought up for a vote. We will kill \nit. We have the power, not the President.\n  It contains strong protections against the President from putting in \nany new immigration authority in violation of American law. It prevents \nthe President from subverting U.S. sovereignty and all these urban \nmyths that are out there.\n  Frankly, the misinformation is disturbing, and it undermines the \ntrust of this body. We have to put the facts on the table for the \nAmerican people. This has been supported by a wide number of groups--\nbusiness groups, conservatives, many other groups.\n  If you support transparency, if you support placing a check on the \nPresident, if you support robust oversight, and if you support getting \nthe best deal for the American worker, knocking down barriers--whether \nthey are tariff or nontariff barriers in these other countries--to give \nthe American worker a break, open markets, then you support TPA.\n  TPA is a catalyst for economic growth. It opens the door for a robust \ntrade agenda for the United States.\n  We created the global trading system after 1945. Are we going to walk \naway from it? We only have 20 agreements--with 20 countries, that is, \nfree trade agreements. These are important agreements. Other countries \nhave 40, 50, hundreds of them.\n  Why are we sitting on the sidelines? We have been sitting on the \nsidelines for decades. It is time for American leadership. We can't \nwalk away from the trading system we created. Our partners around the \nworld want us engaged.\n  This is the catalyst for American leadership. This is an important \npart of our national strategy and an important part of our foreign \npolicy.\n\n  You want a strategy? You want economic growth? You want fairness for \nthe American worker? Support TPA as a catalyst for growth and \nleadership.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Pocan).\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the time.\n  I am not going to go into the exact same debate we had 1 week ago \nbecause the facts are still the same. If we pass fast track authority, \nthe facts are identical around the fact we will lose jobs here in this \ncountry and we will depress our wages here in this country. We will \nlose our sovereignty and control over our laws, and we will have \nproblems with everything from food safety to intellectual property \nrights and so many other laws.\n  What is different about this week from last week is this is not the \nsame trade promotion authority. This trade promotion authority will \ntake away American jobs, but it lacks the trade authority that gives us \nthe assistance and the dollars to help those people find other jobs.\n  This includes all of the amendments that affect us from taking away \nthe provisions the Senate put in around currency manipulation, take \naway the amendments around human trafficking, and specifically say that \nwe cannot address climate change in these trade negotiations.\n  Now, that alone is an issue that I want clarity from the White House \non. I have been in and looked at the language, and I will not talk \nabout classified language on the floor, but the amendment \nspecifically--we need clarity about where we are on climate change in \nthis agreement.\n  This is not the same TPA. It will cost jobs. It will lower our wages. \nIt will not provide any protections for those workers who lose their \njobs because of this. Now, because of last week's actions, the bill \nbefore us is a far, far worse bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues, let's let the American \npeople have a say. The only way they will is if Congress retains our \nauthority to amend and debate this bill. If we give that away, it is \nour own fault today.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n[[Page H4503]]\n\n  Once again, I have to remind my colleagues we have got to follow some \nunderstanding about what we are trying to do here. This is TPA.\n  TAA was up last week, and my colleagues that are Democrats turned \ndown the same things they are now talking about were provisions to \nprotect the American worker. The Democrat Party voted against the \nAmerican worker last week.\n  They are the ones that turned down exactly what the gentleman is \ntalking about needs to be a part of this deal. The Democrat Party \nturned their back on the American worker. That was last week.\n  This week, now, they are trying to talk about things that are in TPP. \nMr. Speaker, we are not here today for TPP. We are here today for trade \npromotion authority. That is it, TPA.\n  The gentleman, Mr. Kelly, was very right to say let's talk about the \nreal facts of the case and the truth. This is about TPA. It is exactly \nthe same bill that was here last week.\n  There were other considerations last week. The Democrat Party turned \ntheir back last week on the worker. We are not trying to do that \ntoday--trade promotion authority.\n  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nCincinnati, Ohio (Mr. Chabot), the chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to support the \nrule, and I think every Member of this body, on both sides of the \naisle, have something in common. We all have small businesses in our \ndistrict and probably a lot of them.\n  One of the privileges we have, as Members of Congress, is to talk to \nthose people and find out what is important to them. What is important \nto them is important to the country because about 70 percent of the new \njobs that are created in the American economy nowadays are created by \nsmall businesses.\n  In thinking about what I would say about TPA here this morning, I \nthought, rather than just tell people what I thought about it, I \nthought I would bring some examples of some of those folks that we have \ntalked to.\n  As Chair of the Small Business Committee, I get to talk to small \nbusinesses all across the country. Here are some examples of what they \nare telling us.\n  Here is Michael Stanek of Hunt Imaging in Berea, Ohio. He said:\n\n       Free trade agreements are extremely important as they lower \n     foreign barriers to our exports and produce a more level \n     playing field.\n       Without TPA, the U.S. is relegated to the sidelines as \n     other nations negotiate trade agreements without us, putting \n     American workers and companies, especially small ones, at a \n     competitive disadvantage.\n\n  Here is Dyke Messinger of Power Curbers in Salisbury, North Carolina:\n\n       Passage of TPA, which lapsed back in 2007, is critical to \n     restore U.S. leadership on trade.\n       Manufacturers in the U.S. face steeper trade barriers \n     abroad than virtually any other major country, including \n     Mexico and China and European countries, largely because \n     those countries have entered into more market access \n     agreements than the United States. Trade and foreign markets \n     are critical for small businesses like Power Curbers.\n\n  Here is Kevin Severns of Severns Farm in Sanger, California.\n\n       Without TPA, critical negotiations with some of our key \n     export markets may well stall. My understanding is that, on \n     average, U.S. citrus exports to countries included in the \n     Trans-Pacific Partnership can currently face tariffs as high \n     as 40 percent.\n\n  That is tariffs at 40 percent.\n\n       Given that 35 percent of California's citrus crop is \n     exported around the world, access to these markets is vital \n     to us.\n\n  Here is Brian Bieron of eBay, which helps many small businesses sell \ntheir products abroad. He said:\n\n       Through our experience, we have found that technology is \n     transforming trade by allowing Main Street businesses to \n     directly take part in globalization, reaping the benefits of \n     markets previously only open to the largest global companies. \n     This is good economics because it means more growth and \n     wealth, and it is good for society because it means a more \n     inclusive form of globalization.\n\n  That is what people from around this country--small-business men, \nsmall-business women--are saying about TPA and TPP and trade. In \neffect, they are saying, if we want to grow the American economy and \ncreate jobs, which I think we all want to do, we must be proactive on \ntrade, and that means passing TPA and then TPP.\n  Better trade agreements mean small businesses will be able to access \nnew international customers and offer their products more easily and at \na lower cost than ever before.\n  It means that more products will be built and sold. When that \nhappens, jobs are created, wages go up, and more opportunity is \navailable to all.\n  You put an American worker against anyone in the world, and I will \ntake that bet every day of the week and twice on Sunday; but we can't \nget there without TPA.\n  Without TPA, other nations, especially China, will dictate the rules \nof the new economy, nations that do not respect the rule of law or the \nrights of individuals in many cases, especially in the case of China.\n  Ninety-six percent of the people that are on this globe that we all \nshare live outside the borders of the United States. Many of the \nworld's consumers are not here. We want to sell our products overseas, \nand TPA gets us on the right track.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nOhio (Ms. Kaptur).\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the ranking member, Ms. Slaughter, for yielding.\n  I wish to say that if the underlying Trans-Pacific Partnership were \nsuch a good deal, then why is the Rules Committee limiting our ability \nto read it and vet it fully and amend it?\n  By voting for the trade promotion authority, what we basically do is \nhandcuff Members of Congress. So we should vote ``no.''\n  Why should we believe anything the executive branch sends up here? We \nhave a right to read it fully and vet it fully.\n  Let's look at the history of these trade agreements. Over the last 25 \nyears, every time we have signed a so-called free trade agreement that \nbenefits the 1 percent--not the 99 percent--America has lost more jobs. \nPost-NAFTA, look what happened. We used to have trade balances with \nthese countries. They have all gone into trade deficit, which means \nthey send us more goods than we are able to get into their markets. \nHere is what happened after the WTO. Then we got into the China PNTR \ndeal. Then the Colombia deal. Then with Korea.\n  There hasn't been a balanced trade account in this country for 30 \nyears; 40 million lost jobs; $9.5 trillion of trade deficit, trading \naway one-fifth of our economic might to other places.\n  And what did the American people get? Lost jobs, outsourced jobs, \nstagnant wages. The average income in regions like mine--$7,000 less a \nyear than 25 years ago. Not a good deal.\n  You can't create jobs in America and have free trade when you have \nclosed markets abroad. Japan is closed. Korea is closed. China is \nclosed. Europe limits 10 percent imports. We don't. We have an open \nmarket.\n  You can't create jobs and have free trade when you try to trade with \ncountries where their people have no rights, no legal rights.\n  This Congress should vote ``no'' on this Trans-Pacific Partnership, \nthe underlying bill, and the trade promotion authority because we have \na right to read the agreement and openly debate it.\n  Right now we have to go down to a secret room. We have people who \nmonitor us. And we can't even talk to the American people about what is \nin it. What is free about that?\n  The executive branch has totally overreached its power. Only four \ntitles of the dozen in this TPP are actually about tariffs.\n  This bill is a treaty. It should be considered as a treaty, openly \nread by the Senate, and it should be able to be amended and fully \nvetted. This is so important. When you have gone through a quarter \ncentury of job loss and income loss by the American people, why can't \nwe produce a bill that benefits the 100 percent--not just the 1 \npercent, the ones that were able to pay the plane tickets to go over to \nAsia and help to represent very important transnational interests? But \nthere are not just the interests of those companies. We have to \nrepresent the interests of the American people.\n  Let's balance these trade accounts and develop a new trade model--not \na NAFTA-based trade model, but a model that produces jobs in America, \ngood\n\n[[Page H4504]]\n\nwages, and balanced trade accounts for the first time in a quarter \ncentury.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry. We forgot to make sure \neverybody knew: we are only doing TPA today. We are not doing TPP. We \nare not doing these other agreements. I am sorry. I forgot to say that \nfor the 57th time.\n  Where we cut deals, we win. With the 20 trade agreements America has, \nwe had a $10 billion surplus last year alone.\n  I don't know where all these people are getting off and scaring and \nmaking fear statements about the American worker. I don't get it, when \nthey talk about us not passing TAA when they are the ones--the Democrat \nParty--that turned it down. I don't understand why they are beating us \nup for putting in provisions about immigration. I guess they want to \nflood our workforce with foreign workers. I don't get where the \nDemocrat Party and its great stalwarts are coming from today. This is \nabout TPA, and that is what we are going to vote on.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).\n  Mr. KILDEE. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's be clear, the Members on this side of the aisle--\nthe Democratic Party Members on this side of the aisle--completely \nunderstand what we are debating today. We know we are debating the rule \non TPA, the same TPA which has been modified. As the gentleman has \nsaid, we are not debating TPP.\n  The problem we have is, the trade promotion authority is intended to \nbe the method by which this body, this Congress creates the parameters \nfor negotiation of trade agreements, such as the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. And the reason that this has been difficult, this House \nand the Republican leadership, in particular, is trying to create a TPA \nthat accommodates the already negotiated TPP.\n  So while it is a good rhetorical argument to say we are not debating \nTPP, the fact of the matter is, the reason that there has been such a \nlack of willingness to consider any modification, any amendments to the \nTPA bill is because any change would not align with the already \nnegotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  The reason, for example, that a bipartisan amendment that I and the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Clawson) offered--with equal numbers of \nDemocrats and Republicans, 22 of us--to deal with currency manipulation \nwas not made in order is because it would not align with the already \nnegotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  Most everybody agrees that it would be good policy, but this deal is \nalready written. And now we are trying to back in a TPA bill that it \nwill accommodate the TPP.\n  So it is rather difficult for me to accept the argument that this TPA \nquestion has nothing to do with the Trans-Pacific Partnership when \neverybody in this House of Representatives knows that it has everything \nto do with it.\n  The other thing that is important for us to keep in mind is that this \nis a worse piece of legislation than the bad one that came before the \nHouse last week. Because of the modifications to TPA that came through \nin the customs bill, as my colleagues have said, despite the fact that \nmany on the other side have argued that our attempts to deal with \nclimate change here in the U.S. alone will not be affected because it \nis not a global approach, when we have an opportunity to take a broader \napproach, representing 40 percent of the global economy and deal with \nclimate change, we now have an absolute prohibition, a gag order where \nwe can't talk about climate in the greatest opportunity we would have \nto deal with climate change; nor can we have even a weak provision \nregarding currency, which has been excised from the TPA. And, \nunbelievably, we will actually weaken our ability to deal with bad \nactors when it comes to human trafficking.\n  This is shameful, it ought to be rejected.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Holding). The gentlewoman from Ohio will \nstate her parliamentary inquiry.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I would like to know, if Members vote in favor of the \ntrade promotion authority currently before us, will Members be allowed \nto amend the underlying bill, the TPP?\n  Could the chairman of the Rules Committee address that, please.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is engaging in debate and is \nnot making a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Well, in what form could I ask the question that I could \nget a straight answer as to whether Members will be able to amend the \nunderlying 1,000-page trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman may look to the managers for \na specific item of debate.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. So, in other words, the chairman of the Rules Committee \ncannot answer my question? He is my friend. I think it would be \nimportant for Members to know that because it is my understanding that \nwe are not allowed to amend the agreement if, in fact, TPA passes.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is no longer recognized.\n  The gentlewoman from New York is recognized.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).\n  Mr. CICILLINE. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule and the \nunderlying bill.\n  TPA shouldn't stand for ``trade promotion authority''; it should \nstand for ``taking prosperity away,'' because that is exactly what it \nis going to do for millions of hard-working Americans.\n  The House failed to advance its proposal less than a week ago, and \ntoday the TPA we are voting on is even worse.\n  And hiding the vote behind our brave first responders? This is \nshameful.\n  Republican leaders are doing everything they can to jam through a \nspecial interest agenda that will depress wages, exacerbate inequality, \nand cost jobs. TPA will take away the constitutional responsibility \nthat Congress has to strengthen and improve the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. If we approve this measure, we are surrendering our \nability to improve a trade agreement for working families.\n  We are not voting on TPP, as the chairman said, but we are voting on \nTPA, on the rules to govern these negotiations and the process to be \nfiled. And if we vote for this TPA, we are saying that we are fine \nmoving forward on a trade agreement that has no enforceable provisions \nagainst currency manipulation; meaning, there are no protections to \nstop countries from devaluing their currency, artificially reducing the \nprice of their goods, and putting American manufacturers and American \njobs at a competitive disadvantage. We are saying, we are fine with a \ntrade agreement that fails to address the critical issue of climate \nchange. We are saying that we are fine with entering into a trade \nagreement with countries like Brunei, where LGBT individuals can be \nstoned to death and women can be flogged in public. We are saying, we \nare fine with having a trade agreement that weakens protections against \nhuman trafficking; and we are fine with entering into a trade agreement \nwith countries like Vietnam, which denies workers even the most basic \ncollective bargaining rights, while throwing workers' advocates into \nprison.\n  So we are not voting on TPP. We are voting on TPA. But we are setting \nthe rules for governing the negotiations, and we are removing ourselves \nfrom the process of improving and strengthening this trade agreement.\n  The House should reject this proposal and stand with hard-working \nAmericans. We should oppose TPA. We should oppose the rule.\n  For 30 years, we have had trade policies in this country that have \nfailed American workers, driving down wages, increasing income \ninequality, and, as a result of it, costing jobs. A vote for fast track \nis a vote to abandon our responsibility to ensure that trade works for \nour country and for American workers.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this rule, to reject the underlying \nbill, and to vote ``no'' on TPA.\n\n[[Page H4505]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) will control the time for the minority \nside.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I insert into the Record a letter to \nMembers of Congress from the general president of the International \nAssociation of Firefighters opposing House Resolution 321 when it \nattaches trade promotion authority to H.R. 2146, the Defending Public \nSafety Employees' Retirement Act.\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                             of Fire Fighters,\n\n                                                    June 18, 2015.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of more than 300,000 \n     professional fire fighters and emergency medical personnel, I \n     strongly urge you to oppose H.Res.321 which attaches Trade \n     Promotion Authority to HR 2146, the Defending Public Safety \n     Employee's Retirement Act.\n       The underlying legislation provides an important measure of \n     retirement security to the federal fighters who protect our \n     nation's defense installations, VA hospitals and other vital \n     facilities. It should not be politically exploited and used \n     in a last ditch, desperate effort to pass TPA.\n       HR 2146, which simply enables federal fire fighters to \n     access their own retirement savings once they reach \n     retirement age, was passed by the House by a vote of 407-5 \n     and adopted unanimously in the Senate with a technical \n     amendment. This amended legislation deserves to be considered \n     free of political gamesmanship and procedural tricks.\n       The IAFF urges you to oppose this rule, and consider HR \n     2146 without controversial amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Harold A. Schaitberger,\n                                                General President.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).\n  Mr. SHERMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we vote for trade promotion authority, fast track, \nwithout Trade Adjustment Assistance, if that is how we vote today, that \nis what we will get.\n  The Republican chair of the Rules Committee has made it clear. He has \nalready used his precious time to start blaming Democratic leadership \nfor the fact that Trade Adjustment Assistance will not become law.\n  The fact is that if Trade Adjustment Assistance ever comes before \nthis House, it will, no doubt, be loaded up by the Republican \nleadership with a host of poison pills, making sure that Democrats \ncannot vote for it. I can't vote for Trade Adjustment Assistance if you \nterminate the Affordable Care Act as part of the bill, for example.\n  Now the proponents of trade promotion authority have had to misstate \nthe actual economic facts, the figures on our trade surpluses and \ndeficits, in order to make their case. They have come again and again \nand said, we have a trade surplus with our free trade agreement \npartners.\n  Completely false. I will put into the Record the chart listing each \nof our free trade agreement partners, and we are running a $177 billion \ndeficit in goods. Including services, you are now down to a little over \na $100 billion deficit.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Now, how is it that Member after Member has come here and said \nsomething demonstrably false? They have been fooled by slippery \ncharlatans who feed them the following line: Since NAFTA, we have a \nsurplus with those countries that have a free trade agreement.\n  ``Since NAFTA'' implies since the early 1990s. No, they mean those \nagreements we entered into after NAFTA. So they look at our free trade \nagreements while ignoring NAFTA. That is like looking at the Cavs and \nignoring LeBron. You can't do that.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you look at the success and failure of our free trade \nagreements, number one is NAFTA. If you include all of our free trade \nagreements, including NAFTA, we have a $177 billion goods deficit. And \nthen if you look at MFN for China, most favored nation status for \nChina, well, then you are talking $400 billion of deficit. That was not \na free trade agreement. That was an even worse agreement.\n  This TPP is a gift to China. First, it enshrines the idea that \ncurrency manipulation will be allowed, even encouraged. It sets Chinese \nrules for trade in Asia, preserving for them their number one tactic in \nrunning such a huge trade surplus with the United States. It hollows \nout American manufacturing, thus endangering our national security. And \nthe rules of origin provision available for review in the basement will \nshow you that goods that are 50 and 60 percent made in China, admitted \nto be made in China, which means actually 70 or 80 percent really made \nin China, come fast-tracked into the United States. China gets the \nbenefit and doesn't have to make a single concession.\n  Vote ``no.''\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Doggett).\n  Mr. DOGGETT. First, we were all on the fast track, then the slow \ntrack with postponement into July, and now we are back on rush-hour \nscheduling, being told that fast track, which has been mangled in the \nmeantime with new changes, has to be approved by high noon today.\n  Railroading this bill through now will deny any opportunity to ensure \nthat our trade policy gets on the right track. The fast-trackers have \nrejected every constructive improvement for a better trade measure that \nwe have advanced. And even these fast-trackers, if they are really \ncandid with the American people, would concede there is not a Member of \nthis Congress who knows what is in this agreement to the extent that \nthe Vietnamese Politburo does. Because so much of it has been secreted, \nwe do not have one word that has been made public or accessible to us \nabout how it is that Vietnam will enforce provisions to ensure greater \nworker freedom and opportunity instead of being part of a race to the \nbottom.\n  What we do know about this fast-track agreement from a recent \nCanadian ruling, Bilcon v. Canada, is that corporate panels will be \nempowered to charge taxpayers millions of dollars for the privilege of \nmaintaining public health and safety laws. The language to which my \ncolleague from Texas has referred about preserving American laws is \nreally meaningless because, yes, they are preserved, but when your city \nor your State acts to protect you, foreign corporations are accorded \nmore rights than American businesses, and they can demand millions for \nkeeping our laws in place.\n  What we do know is that, since last week, this railroad has picked up \nsome mighty unsavory characters. The irony is that on the very day Pope \nFrancis is formally releasing his encyclical on global warming, this \nrailroad has picked up a troubling new provision that would deny any \nopportunity to address the greatest environmental challenge that our \nworld faces.\n  Even Trans-Pacific Partnership supporters concede that it looks like \na charter for corporate America rather than a high-level trade \nagreement. The Financial Times said, ``In too many aspects, it looks \nlike a charter for corporate America.''\n  We learn, I think, more from USTR's past failures than from its \ncurrent promises. USTR has never in its history successfully challenged \nworker or environmental abuses by any of our foreign trading partners. \nUsually the reason that USTR fails is that it doesn't really try. It \ndoesn't seem to have a belief in law enforcement when it comes to \nworker and environmental abuse. In Guatemala, it took it eight years to \neven bring a dispute. In Honduras, it took nearly four years to issue \nanother bureaucratic report. In Peru, we cannot get the audit that USTR \nwas responsible for obtaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, ``Asleep at the Wheel'' is a great Texas \nswing band, but it is a horrible philosophy for trade law enforcement. \nReject this rule; help us get a better trade policy; protect American \nfamilies; and advance our economy. We can do better than this by \nrejecting this rule.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  First of all, let me say to my colleagues that they should be \nappalled by\n\n[[Page H4506]]\n\nthis process. This is again being brought up under a process where \nnobody--not just Democrats, but Republicans as well--can offer \namendments.\n  In the United States Senate when TPA was considered, they were able \nto offer amendments, but when it came before the House last week, we \nwere told we could offer no amendments. The excuse we were given is \nbecause, if we passed it, it would go right to the White House. But \nwhat we are doing today is actually not going to the White House. It is \ngoing back to the Senate, yet we are again being presented with a \nclosed process.\n  Why can't Members of both sides of the aisle have an opportunity to \nmake their views known on this important issue? Why are we being shut \nout when it comes to the issue of trade and TPA?\n  I heard a number of speakers say that this debate is not about TPP. \nWell, this is indeed about the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Whether or \nnot TPP is implemented will depend almost entirely on whether the \nPresident has fast track in place.\n  The vote on fast track, or TPA, will determine the fate of the TPP \ntrade deal. So a ``yes'' vote on TPA is a ``yes'' vote on TPP. It is \nthat simple. History shows that is how it has worked time and time and \ntime again.\n  Fast track is not just about TPP. If we vote for TPA for fast track, \nwe are fast-tracking any trade deal that any President negotiates \nanytime in the next 6 years. We have no idea who the next President \nwill be, but you are giving the next President--or next Presidents--the \nauthority to have fast-track authority on whatever they want. Why are \nwe just giving away all of our ability to play a role in these \nnegotiations? The problem with these trade deals is that only the well-\noff and well-connected have a seat at the table.\n  I urge my colleagues to put American workers first. Vote ``no'' on \nthe rule and vote ``no'' on the underlying bill.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, the TPP is modeled after a failed trade \nagreement. It will further erode our national economy and change the \nrules in ways that hurt American workers. We are supposed to be here to \nprotect the American workers and to create more opportunity, and we are \nyet going down the road of another trade deal that is going to rob \nAmerica of important middle class jobs. It is appalling, and this \nprocess is appalling.\n  Vote ``no'' on the rule, and vote ``no'' on the underlying \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, this debate today has been most interesting about the \ndifferences between the speakers who showed up today. One group of \nspeakers is for America, for growth, for America leading, for America \nengaging the world, and for cutting deals with our friends against one \nother huge country that will overrun in every single economic \ncircumstance the rest of the world because they do not respect \nintellectual property or rule of law.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is about gathering together the United States House \nof Representatives and the United States Senate to where we gather \ntogether the best rules and regulations that we can, parameters by \nwhich the President would go negotiate. This isn't about abdicating our \nrole and responsibility. It is trade promotion authority.\n  Mr. Speaker, please, we understand that some people haven't read the \nbill. We understand some people think this is about TPP or other \nagreements, but it is not. This is about a simple process: Are we going \nto exert our constitutional authority? Are we going to engage the \nPresident where the President can go engage the world on behalf of the \nAmerican worker? Are we going to lead, or are we going to stick our \nhead in the sand?\n  Mr. Speaker, America needs to lead, and the world wants us to lead. \nMr. Speaker, the world wants American products, and American business \nwants to sell to others without high prices and without tariffs. What \nwe want to do is to compete. That is why we are here today.\n  I urge adoption of this rule. I look forward to the debate that will \nfollow, and I look forward to our young chairman, Paul Ryan, leading \nthat effort, proving not only to the Members here today and to you, Mr. \nSpeaker, but to the American people that we want more jobs. We have not \ncreated all the jobs that we need in this country. We need more, and \nthis is a part of that effort.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the underlying bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question \non the resolution.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

and\n       (13) to take into account conditions relating to religious \n     freedom of any party to negotiations for a trade agreement \n     with the United States.\n       (b) Principal Trade Negotiating Objectives.--\n       (1) Trade in goods.--The principal negotiating objectives \n     of the United States regarding trade in goods are--\n       (A) to expand competitive market opportunities for exports \n     of goods from the United States and to obtain fairer and more \n     open conditions of trade, including through the utilization \n     of global value chains, by reducing or eliminating tariff and \n     nontariff barriers and policies and practices of foreign \n     governments directly related to trade that decrease market \n     opportunities for United States exports or otherwise distort \n     United States trade; and\n       (B) to obtain reciprocal tariff and nontariff barrier \n     elimination agreements, including with respect to those \n     tariff categories covered in section 111(b) of the Uruguay \n     Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)).\n       (2) Trade in services.--(A) The principal negotiating \n     objective of the United States regarding trade in services is \n     to expand competitive market opportunities for United States \n     services and to obtain fairer and more open conditions of \n     trade, including through utilization of global value chains, \n     by reducing or eliminating barriers to international trade in \n     services, such as regulatory and other barriers that deny \n     national treatment and market access or unreasonably restrict \n     the establishment or operations of service suppliers.\n       (B) Recognizing that expansion of trade in services \n     generates benefits for all sectors of the economy and \n     facilitates trade, the objective described in subparagraph \n     (A) should be pursued through all means, including through a \n     plurilateral agreement with those countries willing and able \n     to undertake high standard services commitments for both \n     existing and new services.\n       (3) Trade in agriculture.--The principal negotiating \n     objective of the United States with respect to agriculture is \n     to obtain competitive opportunities for United States exports \n     of agricultural commodities in foreign markets substantially \n     equivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded foreign \n     exports in United States markets and to achieve fairer and \n     more open conditions of trade in bulk, specialty crop, and \n     value added commodities by--\n       (A) securing more open and equitable market access through \n     robust rules on sanitary and phytosanitary measures that--\n       (i) encourage the adoption of international standards and \n     require a science-based justification be provided for a \n     sanitary or phytosanitary measure if the measure is more \n     restrictive than the applicable international standard;\n       (ii) improve regulatory coherence, promote the use of \n     systems-based approaches, and appropriately recognize the \n     equivalence of health and safety protection systems of \n     exporting countries;\n       (iii) require that measures are transparently developed and \n     implemented, are based on risk assessments that take into \n     account relevant international guidelines and scientific \n     data, and are not more restrictive\n\n[[Page H4508]]\n\n     on trade than necessary to meet the intended purpose; and\n       (iv) improve import check processes, including testing \n     methodologies and procedures, and certification requirements,\n\n     while recognizing that countries may put in place measures to \n     protect human, animal, or plant life or health in a manner \n     consistent with their international obligations, including \n     the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and \n     Phytosanitary Measures (referred to in section 101(d)(3) of \n     the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(3)));\n       (B) reducing or eliminating, by a date certain, tariffs or \n     other charges that decrease market opportunities for United \n     States exports--\n       (i) giving priority to those products that are subject to \n     significantly higher tariffs or subsidy regimes of major \n     producing countries; and\n       (ii) providing reasonable adjustment periods for United \n     States import sensitive products, in close consultation with \n     Congress on such products before initiating tariff reduction \n     negotiations;\n       (C) reducing tariffs to levels that are the same as or \n     lower than those in the United States;\n       (D) reducing or eliminating subsidies that decrease market \n     opportunities for United States exports or unfairly distort \n     agriculture markets to the detriment of the United States;\n       (E) allowing the preservation of programs that support \n     family farms and rural communities but do not distort trade;\n       (F) developing disciplines for domestic support programs, \n     so that production that is in excess of domestic food \n     security needs is sold at world prices;\n       (G) eliminating government policies that create price \n     depressing surpluses;\n       (H) eliminating state trading enterprises whenever \n     possible;\n       (I) developing, strengthening, and clarifying rules to \n     eliminate practices that unfairly decrease United States \n     market access opportunities or distort agricultural markets \n     to the detriment of the United States, and ensuring that such \n     rules are subject to efficient, timely, and effective dispute \n     settlement, including--\n       (i) unfair or trade distorting activities of state trading \n     enterprises and other administrative mechanisms, with \n     emphasis on requiring price transparency in the operation of \n     state trading enterprises and such other mechanisms in order \n     to end cross subsidization, price discrimination, and price \n     undercutting;\n       (ii) unjustified trade restrictions or commercial \n     requirements, such as labeling, that affect new technologies, \n     including biotechnology;\n       (iii) unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary restrictions, \n     including restrictions not based on scientific principles in \n     contravention of obligations in the Uruguay Round Agreements \n     or bilateral or regional trade agreements;\n       (iv) other unjustified technical barriers to trade; and\n       (v) restrictive rules in the administration of tariff rate \n     quotas;\n       (J) eliminating practices that adversely affect trade in \n     perishable or cyclical products, while improving import \n     relief mechanisms to recognize the unique characteristics of \n     perishable and cyclical agriculture;\n       (K) ensuring that import relief mechanisms for perishable \n     and cyclical agriculture are as accessible and timely to \n     growers in the United States as those mechanisms that are \n     used by other countries;\n       (L) taking into account whether a party to the negotiations \n     has failed to adhere to the provisions of already existing \n     trade agreements with the United States or has circumvented \n     obligations under those agreements;\n       (M) taking into account whether a product is subject to \n     market distortions by reason of a failure of a major \n     producing country to adhere to the provisions of already \n     existing trade agreements with the United States or by the \n     circumvention by that country of its obligations under those \n     agreements;\n       (N) otherwise ensuring that countries that accede to the \n     World Trade Organization have made meaningful market \n     liberalization commitments in agriculture;\n       (O) taking into account the impact that agreements covering \n     agriculture to which the United States is a party have on the \n     United States agricultural industry;\n       (P) maintaining bona fide food assistance programs, market \n     development programs, and export credit programs;\n       (Q) seeking to secure the broadest market access possible \n     in multilateral, regional, and bilateral negotiations, \n     recognizing the effect that simultaneous sets of negotiations \n     may have on United States import sensitive commodities \n     (including those subject to tariff rate quotas);\n       (R) seeking to develop an international consensus on the \n     treatment of seasonal or perishable agricultural products in \n     investigations relating to dumping and safeguards and in any \n     other relevant area;\n       (S) seeking to establish the common base year for \n     calculating the Aggregated Measurement of Support (as defined \n     in the Agreement on Agriculture) as the end of each country's \n     Uruguay Round implementation period, as reported in each \n     country's Uruguay Round market access schedule;\n       (T) ensuring transparency in the administration of tariff \n     rate quotas through multilateral, plurilateral, and bilateral \n     negotiations; and\n       (U) eliminating and preventing the undermining of market \n     access for United States products through improper use of a \n     country's system for protecting or recognizing geographical \n     indications, including failing to ensure transparency and \n     procedural fairness and protecting generic terms.\n       (4) Foreign investment.--Recognizing that United States law \n     on the whole provides a high level of protection for \n     investment, consistent with or greater than the level \n     required by international law, the principal negotiating \n     objectives of the United States regarding foreign investment \n     are to reduce or eliminate artificial or trade distorting \n     barriers to foreign investment, while ensuring that foreign \n     investors in the United States are not accorded greater \n     substantive rights with respect to investment protections \n     than United States investors in the United States, and to \n     secure for investors important rights comparable to those \n     that would be available under United States legal principles \n     and practice, by--\n       (A) reducing or eliminating exceptions to the principle of \n     national treatment;\n       (B) freeing the transfer of funds relating to investments;\n       (C) reducing or eliminating performance requirements, \n     forced technology transfers, and other unreasonable barriers \n     to the establishment and operation of investments;\n       (D) seeking to establish standards for expropriation and \n     compensation for expropriation, consistent with United States \n     legal principles and practice;\n       (E) seeking to establish standards for fair and equitable \n     treatment, consistent with United States legal principles and \n     practice, including the principle of due process;\n       (F) providing meaningful procedures for resolving \n     investment disputes;\n       (G) seeking to improve mechanisms used to resolve disputes \n     between an investor and a government through--\n       (i) mechanisms to eliminate frivolous claims and to deter \n     the filing of frivolous claims;\n       (ii) procedures to ensure the efficient selection of \n     arbitrators and the expeditious disposition of claims;\n       (iii) procedures to enhance opportunities for public input \n     into the formulation of government positions; and\n       (iv) providing for an appellate body or similar mechanism \n     to provide coherence to the interpretations of investment \n     provisions in trade agreements; and\n       (H) ensuring the fullest measure of transparency in the \n     dispute settlement mechanism, to the extent consistent with \n     the need to protect information that is classified or \n     business confidential, by--\n       (i) ensuring that all requests for dispute settlement are \n     promptly made public;\n       (ii) ensuring that--\n\n       (I) all proceedings, submissions, findings, and decisions \n     are promptly made public;

and\n       (ii) with respect to labor, decisions regarding the \n     distribution of enforcement resources are not a reason for \n     not complying with a party's labor obligations; a party to a \n     trade agreement retains the right to reasonable exercise of \n     discretion and to make bona fide decisions regarding the \n     allocation of resources between labor enforcement activities \n     among core labor standards, provided the exercise of such \n     discretion and such decisions are not inconsistent with its \n     obligations;\n       (C) to strengthen the capacity of United States trading \n     partners to promote respect for core labor standards (as \n     defined in section 111(7));\n       (D) to strengthen the capacity of United States trading \n     partners to protect the environment through the promotion of \n     sustainable development;\n       (E) to reduce or eliminate government practices or policies \n     that unduly threaten sustainable development;\n       (F) to seek market access, through the elimination of \n     tariffs and nontariff barriers, for United States \n     environmental technologies, goods, and services;\n       (G) to ensure that labor, environmental, health, or safety \n     policies and practices of the parties to trade agreements \n     with the United States do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably \n     discriminate against United States exports or serve as \n     disguised barriers to trade;\n       (H) to ensure that enforceable labor and environment \n     obligations are subject to the same dispute settlement and \n     remedies as other enforceable obligations under the \n     agreement; and\n       (I) to ensure that a trade agreement is not construed to \n     empower a party's authorities to undertake labor or \n     environmental law enforcement activities in the territory of \n     the United States.\n       (11) Currency.--The principal negotiating objective of the \n     United States with respect to currency practices is that \n     parties to a trade agreement with the United States avoid \n     manipulating exchange rates in order to prevent effective \n     balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair \n     competitive advantage over other parties to the agreement, \n     such as through cooperative mechanisms, enforceable rules, \n     reporting, monitoring, transparency, or other means, as \n     appropriate.\n       (12) Foreign currency manipulation.--The principal \n     negotiating objective of the United States with respect to \n     unfair currency practices is to seek to establish \n     accountability through enforceable rules, transparency, \n     reporting, monitoring, cooperative mechanisms, or other means \n     to address exchange rate manipulation involving protracted \n     large scale intervention in one direction in the exchange \n     markets and a persistently undervalued foreign exchange rate \n     to gain an unfair competitive advantage in trade over other \n     parties to a trade agreement, consistent with existing \n     obligations of the United States as a member of the \n     International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.\n       (13) WTO and multilateral trade agreements.--Recognizing \n     that the World Trade Organization is the foundation of the \n     global trading system, the principal negotiating objectives \n     of the United States regarding the World Trade Organization, \n     the Uruguay Round Agreements, and other multilateral and \n     plurilateral trade agreements are--\n       (A) to achieve full implementation and extend the coverage \n     of the World Trade Organization and multilateral and \n     plurilateral agreements to products, sectors, and conditions \n     of trade not adequately covered;\n       (B) to expand country participation in and enhancement of \n     the Information Technology\n\n[[Page H4510]]\n\n     Agreement, the Government Procurement Agreement, and other \n     plurilateral trade agreements of the World Trade \n     Organization;\n       (C) to expand competitive market opportunities for United \n     States exports and to obtain fairer and more open conditions \n     of trade, including through utilization of global value \n     chains, through the negotiation of new WTO multilateral and \n     plurilateral trade agreements, such as an agreement on trade \n     facilitation;\n       (D) to ensure that regional trade agreements to which the \n     United States is not a party fully achieve the high standards \n     of, and comply with, WTO disciplines, including Article XXIV \n     of GATT 1994, Article V and V bis of the General Agreement on \n     Trade in Services, and the Enabling Clause, including through \n     meaningful WTO review of such regional trade agreements;\n       (E) to enhance compliance by WTO members with their \n     obligations as WTO members through active participation in \n     the bodies of the World Trade Organization by the United \n     States and all other WTO members, including in the trade \n     policy review mechanism and the committee system of the World \n     Trade Organization, and by working to increase the \n     effectiveness of such bodies;

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n\n[[Page H4519]]\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Welcome back, everybody. I have to admit, I am a little disappointed \nthat we are back here today. Last week, a bipartisan majority stepped \nup to pass trade promotion authority. That vote showed that Republicans \nand Democrats can still come together to do what is right for this \ncountry. It was a vote that I am very proud of.\n  Unfortunately, many of our friends on the other side of the aisle \nwould not stand with their President and voted to sacrifice a program \nthat they support--a program that they asked for--in order to block our \npath. It was disappointing, but we are not going to be discouraged. \nThat is why we are back here today.\n  Enacting trade promotion authority is critical for our economy and \nour national security, and so we are going to get it done here today. \nWhy do we need TPA? Well, Mr. Speaker, it is pretty easy, an easy \nquestion to answer--because we need more trade. Ninety-five percent of \nthe world's consumers don't live in America. They live in other \ncountries. If we want to make more things here and sell them there, \nthen we need to tear down those trade barriers that make American goods \nand services more expensive.\n  We know that trade is good for our economy. One in five jobs in \nAmerica is already tied to trade, and they pay on average 18 percent \nmore. We also need more trade to bolster our foreign policy and our \nnational security. Stronger economic ties lead to stronger security \nties. More market share means more influence. That is why so many \nnational security voices, former military leaders, former Secretaries \nof Defense, former Secretaries of State have all called on Congress to \npass TPA. They understand what is at stake here, Mr. Speaker.\n  What is at stake here is no less than America's credibility because \nthe rules of the global economy are being written right now. The \nquestion is: Who is going to write those rules? Will it be the United \nStates and our allies or will it be other nations that don't share our \nvalues or don't share our commitment to free enterprise and the rule of \nlaw?\n  Our friends in Asia and Europe are getting ready to place their bets. \nThey want to sign up for American-style free enterprise, but they need \nto know that the United States is going to stand strong as a reliable \nally, as a reliable trading partner before they do that. That is what \nTPA is all about.\n  So how does it work? We have heard all kinds of crazy misinformation \nspread by the opponents of trade. I mean, crazy stuff, really. Let me, \none more time, explain what TPA is and what TPA is not. TPA is a \nprocess; it is not an agreement. It is a process that gives us the best \nshot at getting a good trade agreement. It is a process, dating back \ndecades, that Congress has used to insert itself into trade \nnegotiations in order to provide more accountability and more \ntransparency to the administration, to the President.\n  This TPA has more transparency and more accountability than any \nversion ever before. It lays out 150 objectives and guidelines that the \nadministration must follow while negotiating a trade deal. These are \nour priorities. If the President wants an agreement, then he must meet \nto address these priorities. He must meet these guidelines in order to \nget it passed through Congress.\n  This TPA also requires that the administration consults with Congress \nduring the negotiations: Give us access to all of the text, provide \ntimely briefings on demand, allow Members to attend the negotiating \nrounds as accredited advisers if they want to. If we are here in \nsession, we can send our people. That is what the Zinke amendment \naccomplishes.\n  Finally, perhaps most importantly, Mr. Speaker, TPA ensures that the \nAmerican people can read any trade agreement, every trade agreement \nlong before anyone is asked to vote on it--60 days. An agreement must \nbe made public and posted online for 60 days before it can even be sent \nto Congress. This turns fast track into slow track.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is transparency, it is effective oversight, and it is \naccountability because if the President doesn't meet these requirements \nor doesn't follow the negotiating objectives, we can turn TPA off for \nthat agreement. We can cancel the vote, we can amend the agreement, or \nwe can stop it entirely. So it is ultimately, we, Congress, we always \nhave the final say. No agreement takes effect, no laws are changed \nunless we vote to allow it.\n  This process, TPA, creates a pact between Congress and the \nadministration that allows our trading partners to know that we speak \nwith one voice. It allows them to make their best efforts, knowing that \nas long as the administration follows TPA, Congress won't try to \nrewrite an agreement later. In other words, it gives America \ncredibility, Mr. Speaker. And, boy, do we need credibility right now.\n  Make no mistake, all of my colleagues, make no mistake: the world is \nwatching us; they are watching this vote. The foreign policy failures \nof the last few years, not to mention the stunt pulled here last week, \nhave capitals all around the world wondering if America still has it. \nAre we still the leader? Are we still the Republic that other countries \naspire to be? They want to know that we are still willing to engage, \nstill willing to lead, that we are still a nation that is out front. Or \nare we in retreat and decline?\n  We are here today to answer that question again. America does not \nretreat; America leads. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote \n``yes'' for TPA.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is said that we should write the rules, not China. \nBut make no mistake, the ``we'' is not Congress, leaving us with only a \n``yes'' or ``no'' vote at the very end. To vote for TPA now is to \nsurrender congressional leverage. To get it right in shaping TPP, the \nmost significant trade negotiation in decades, Congress will have \nsettled for a bill with so-called congressional negotiating objectives \nso vague they are essentially meaningless.\n  That won't matter to those who basically approach trade with a 19th \ncentury dogma, that trade between any two nations will naturally be \nbeneficial, simply matching the comparative economic advantages of \neach. But that has not worked out when, in this era, one nation \nmanipulates its currency as it trades with the other, when nations \nsuppress worker rights to keep their wages low, or degrade their \nenvironment to help them compete, or when nations heavily subsidize \ntheir markets or they keep their markets closed while their competitor \nkeeps them very open in vital areas, whether industrial or \nagricultural.\n  So let us write the rules, but Congress must be sure they are right. \nWe must make sure that the beneficiaries are the many in our Nation, \nnot just the few.\n  As often stated in this debate, trade does, indeed, create winners \nand losers. As one who has worked hard to help put together expanded \ntrade agreements, I know that in a globalizing world economy, failure \nto write the rules effectively is one of the reasons there have been \ntoo many losers. Millions of jobs lost, with middle class wages \nstagnant for decades, while the relative few have done so well.\n  Congress should not give what would be essentially a blank check to \nUSTR on key outstanding issues in the TPP negotiations. With this TPA, \nyou are saying ``fine'' to no meaningful currency provision. You are \nsaying ``fine'' to giving private investors in growing numbers the \nability to choose an unregulated arbitration panel instead of a well-\nestablished judicial system in order to overturn local or national \nhealth or environmental regulations. With this TPA, you cannot be \nconfident Vietnam and Mexico will adhere to meaningful labor standards. \nWith this TPA, you can't be confident that Japan will open its market \nat long last to our cars or agricultural products. With this TPA, you \ncan't be confident that there will be access to lifesaving medicines.\n  Despite a bombardment of rhetoric, instead of the approach that we \nlaid out in the substitute that we have not even been allowed to \nconsider in the committee or in this House, the reality is that this \nTPA will not put Congress in the driver's seat, but the backseat, for \nTPP and for 6 years in important negotiations with Europe in TTIP and \nwho knows what else. Congress has a responsibility to get trade \nnegotiations on the right track, not the fast track. Vote ``no.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H4520]]\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Brady), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways \nand Means.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. I thank Chairman Ryan for his leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, free trade is economic freedom. It is the freedom to buy \nand sell and compete around the world with as little government \ninterference as possible. It is really one of the great economic rights \nof every American. Given the choice between more economic freedom or \nless, we should always choose more. We know if America doesn't lead in \nfree and fair trade, we will grow weaker and our foreign competitors \nwill grow stronger, and our factories and farmers and manufacturers \nwill be priced out and shut down.\n  Texas is made for trade. America is made for trade. It is time, \nthrough expanded trade, to preserve these economic principles that have \nhelped us thrive and grow over the century. That is why Congress \nflexing its constitutional muscles and setting clear rules for future \nAmerican trade is not just a good thing for America; it is a great \nthing.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nBecerra), the chairman of our caucus and a member of our committee.\n  Mr. BECERRA. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, this trade promotion authority legislation, as we have \nheard, is all about writing the rules, writing the rules on trade. It \nis about who will lead or who will retreat on assisting on free and \nfair trade.\n  This TPA legislation sets forward the instructions on how we will \nwrite the rules in any trade agreement. Okay. So who is going to lead \nin writing the rules? On currency manipulation, where countries, not \njust the companies, but the countries themselves that want to trade \nwith us are cheating by manipulating their currency to make the value \nof their goods look less expensive than American products in the same \narea, when those countries are cheating, what are we going to say \nshould be the rules when it comes to currency manipulation?\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  Under this TPA, we can't say anything because we are prohibited from \nincluding anything in a trade agreement that will deal with currency \nmanipulation.\n  You then have to ask a second question. You are telling me that \ncountries that are going to sign these deals are going to be allowed to \ncheat when it comes to how they manipulate their currency so their \nproducts will look cheaper than ours? We are supposed to depend on \nthose same countries that are cheating to now enforce the rules in \nthese agreements against companies in those countries that are \ncheating? What kind of instruction is that?\n  What about when it comes to letting people in America know what is in \nthese deals? What if we want to know where the products that are going \nto be bought and sold in our stores come from? Shouldn't we have the \nright, if we want, to know the country of origin of a particular \nproduct?\n  I have heard about tainted milk coming from places around the world. \nWe have heard about toys that have dangerous chemicals in them that our \nkids play with. Don't we want to know where these products are coming \nfrom? That is all we are saying, just to know where they are coming \nfrom, not that we are going to degrade the place where they come from; \nwe just want to know if it is made in the USA or made somewhere else.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. BECERRA. Under this TPA, we can't ask those questions. We won't \nbe able to find out where a product is made because someone else--a \ntribunal, not an American court--will decide whether we can label a \nproduct as made in the USA or not.\n  Right now, these international tribunals that have no American \njurists or judges sitting on them get to decide for us if Americans \nshould have the right to know where a product is coming from that they \nare buying from a store in their neighborhood.\n  How does that lead to making sure trade is free and fair if we can't \neven put a label on a product coming from some other country that has \nin the past sent us tainted products?\n  We can do much better. We have over two or three decades of \nexperience in writing trade deals. We know what works; we know what \ndoesn't. The thing we know most is that enforcement is the most \ndifficult aspect of trade because most companies in faraway places \ndon't follow American law and American rules and they cheat and they \nthink they think can get away with it.\n  We can do much better. Let's get a better trade deal that is free and \nfair. This TPA doesn't give us that. It doesn't give us the right \nrules. Reject this TPA legislation.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is now my privilege to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), another distinguished member of our \ncommittee.\n  Mr. KIND. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, last week, in a bipartisan majority, this House granted \nthis administration trade promotion authority so that it can begin to \nelevate standards and level the playing field for our workers, our \nfarmers, and our businesses so we can effectively compete in one of the \nfastest growing regions of the global economy.\n  It is time for us to move forward. I feel confident that, with the \nassurances that we received from the Republican leadership, this body \nwill have another opportunity to also pass Trade Adjustment Assistance \nso that the training programs and education for the workers who need it \nwill be in place.\n  Out of consideration for some of our colleagues who are trying to get \nhome to their communities today after last night's terrible shootings, \nI end by encouraging my colleagues to support this legislation. It is \ntime for America to move on.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pascrell), a member of our committee.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, if at first you don't succeed, try, try \nagain. That seems to be the approach on trade.\n  Despite the fact that TPA passed the House last week by only eight \nvotes, at no point did the lightbulb go off for the leadership that \nperhaps they could work with the majority of the Democratic Caucus to \nfind agreement on how to move forward. I don't know why that didn't \noccur to you. Instead of cooperation, they have opted to use procedural \ntricks to pass the TPA.\n  The leadership has chosen to take a bipartisan bill passed by both \nChambers of Congress that would aid our law enforcement officers and \npublic safety workers and inject the unrelated, controversial trade \ndebate into it. I can speak firsthand because I am one of the sponsors \nof the bill.\n  This bill, the Defending Public Safety Employees' Retirement Act, I \nhave worked on with my friend Congressman Reichert, on behalf of the \nmen and women who serve the public in physically demanding work each \nand every day.\n  It would ensure that they could access their full retirement benefits \nat the time they retire without incurring a tax penalty. It is a good \nbill. I am not only one of the sponsors, I vote for it.\n  Today, this bill to provide tax fairness for our law enforcement \nofficers has been twisted and diminished to a convenient vehicle to ram \nthrough fast track for a deeply flawed trade bill.\n  This is not the same bill that we voted on Friday. Please read this \nbill. It is not. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  In fact, Harold Schaitberger, president of the International \nAssociation of Fire Fighters, has written a letter urging Members to \noppose attaching TPA to this bill.\n  The Trans-Pacific Partnership would establish the biggest trade \nagreement we have seen in years, encompassing 40 percent of the world's \neconomy. We need to take our time and do it right. In its current form, \nTPP is woefully inadequate and fails to ensure a fair deal for American \nworkers.\n  Issues such as prohibiting currency manipulation and ensuring food \nsafety have been neglected in TPP. As an example, only 1 percent of \nimported fish into this country--seafood--is inspected. I hope the next \ntime you go into the restaurant, you ask the proprietor: Has this fish \nbeen inspected?\n\n[[Page H4521]]\n\n  He will look at you like you have three heads. Isn't that \ninteresting?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. This country got shafted with our deal with Korea on \ncountry of origin automobiles. You don't really see any more cars \ntraveling through Korea--or certainly China--that are made in the \nUnited States of America. We are taking a backseat.\n  Instead of protecting the interests of American U.S. workers--not \nprotectionism, we are not advocating that--this trade bill gives \nprotections and sweetheart deals to multinational corporations, pure \nand simple. The American people look at every poll--from the left, from \nthe right, from north, south, east, west--and do not accept this deal, \nand we shouldn't either.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), another member of our committee.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I was thinking what a \ndifference a week does not make. The vast majority of the people in my \ncongressional district were opposed to fast track last week, and they \nare even more opposed to fast track this week.\n  We have seen fast track before. We have seen the jobs leave our \ncommunity, our district, our State, and our Nation fast enough. They \ndon't need our help. They don't need anybody else's help. We need to \ncreate jobs here in America, not have them flee.\n  I agree with my colleagues who have said vote ``no.'' I agree with \nthe people of my congressional district, and I shall vote ``no.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Cuellar).\n  Mr. CUELLAR. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I support TPA to give the President the authority to negotiate this \nagreement. It is very simple. A lot of those countries are already able \nto send their goods into our country duty free. What we want to do is \nallow our exporting companies to be able to export to those countries \nduty free, also, so we can send our goods over there.\n  Look at what has happened in Texas. Texas exported more than $289 \nbillion last year, up 146 percent from 2004. Let's look at the number \nof companies that export. They are not the big companies. Ninety-three \npercent of those 40,737 exporting companies were small- and medium-\nsized businesses.\n  Again, Members, I ask you to please support TPA. It is good for \nTexas; it is good for the United States, and it is a no-brainer to \nallow us to export to those countries.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. David Scott).\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the people of this great \nNation are watching us today, and they are begging and pleading with us \nto please vote down this bill.\n  Who knows better than the American people who live in the towns and \nthe cities where they have seen their manufacturing plants close and \nthey have seen their jobs shipped overseas? Every trade deal has done \nit.\n  Let's look at the China deal. As a result of the China deal, 2 \nmillion manufacturing jobs have been shipped from America over to \nChina.\n  Look at NAFTA. Yes, it created jobs; but where did they create jobs? \nThey are in Mexico. Where did the manufacturing plants go? They went to \nMexico.\n  That is why the American people are ringing everybody's office and \nurging them: Please let us not lose any more jobs.\n  Those of you who are concerned about income equality, the reason we \nhave that as a burning issue in the heart and soul, particularly of \nmiddle class America, is because we are seeing the middle class vanish.\n  These are the jobs. These manufacturing jobs, ladies and gentlemen, \nare not where the big corporate presidents make millions of dollars. \nYes, they are going to make plenty of millions of dollars; but these \njobs go into the middle section of our economic stream and the lower \nincome.\n  Look at Akron, Ohio; look at Atlanta, Georgia; look at Chicago; look \nat Detroit. They were once vibrant cities. The backbone of America is \nmanufacturing, and we are shipping it out to the world.\n  You know what else we are shipping out there? We are shipping these \njobs--not only that, the profits of these companies. Last year, $2 \ntrillion of profits were held in these overseas accounts, away from our \ntaxing structure.\n  Can't you see America is getting weaker because of these trade \npolicies? I urge you to vote ``no'' and stand up for the American \npeople for a change.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lee).\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first, I thank the ranking member for yielding \nand, once again, for his tremendous leadership.\n  I rise in strong opposition to this bill and to once again say ``no'' \nto fast track. This legislation cynically uses a bill that would exempt \nretired Federal police officers and firefighters from paying a penalty \non withdrawals from their retirement accounts if they retire after the \nage of 50. What does that have to do with fast track? Absolutely \nnothing--this is just plain wrong.\n  What is more, we know now that the Senate is considering attaching \nthe Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA, to the recently passed African \nGrowth and Accountability Act, better known as AGOA, as a means to get \nthis flawed trade package passed.\n  That is why yesterday, my colleagues Congressional Black Caucus Chair \nCongressman Butterfield, Congresswoman Karen Bass, Congressman Keith \nEllison, and myself sent a letter to the Senate leadership expressing \nour opposition to what they are trying to do in using AGOA as a \nbargaining chip.\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 17, 2015.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Reid: We \n     write to urge you to expeditiously pass H.R. 1295, the Trade \n     Preferences Extension Act of 2015, without attaching \n     unrelated amendments. If passed, the bill would go to the \n     President and reauthorize the African Growth and Opportunity \n     Act (AGOA) until the end of FY 2025.\n       AGOA is too important to be used as a bargaining chip to \n     pass unrelated trade legislation. As you know, AGOA is not \n     controversial and passed out of the House of Representatives \n     with almost 400 votes. AGOA is a trade preference program \n     that is usually noncontroversial, and thus voice voted. It is \n     the centerpiece of relations between the United States and \n     sub-Saharan Africa. Though a small percentage of overall \n     trade by the United States, AGOA has helped enhance trade, \n     investment, job creation, and democratic institutions \n     throughout Africa.\n       In its current form, AGOA expires September 30, 2015. It is \n     imperative that the Senate move H.R. 1295 along to \n     reauthorize the program soon. Delays will not only negatively \n     affect global supply chains, but also adversely affect the \n     livelihoods of individuals whose jobs come from AGOA.\n       The House has already passed H.R. 1295 to reauthorize AGOA. \n     We urge the Senate to follow suit without delay and send the \n     bill to President Obama's desk.\n           Sincerely,\n     GK Butterfield,\n       Member of Congress,\n     Karen Bass,\n       Member of Congress,\n     Barbara Lee,\n       Member of Congress,\n     Keith Ellison,\n       Member of Congress.\n\n  Ms. LEE. AGOA is a growth and trade act. That is a trade preference \nprogram that has helped enhance trade investment and job creation to \ndemocratic institutions throughout Africa.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.\n  Ms. LEE. In no way should that be used as a bargaining chip on this \nbill. It is outrageous. Members should not have to choose between \nprograms that they support, like TAA and AGOA, and then supporting fast \ntrack.\n  These procedural gimmicks are outrageous, and they are fundamentally \ndishonest. If Members fall for this maneuver, we not only risk \nimperiling the TAA, a program that many of our constituents rely on, \nbut also AGOA.\n  We have got to vote ``no'' on this bill, ``no'' to attaching TAA to \nAGOA. Let's get back to the drawing board and come up with a real fair, \nfree, and transparent trade bill.\n\n[[Page H4522]]\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nSherman), ranking member on the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, if you vote for this bill, you get fast \ntrack without Trade Adjustment Assistance. There is no assurance Trade \nAdjustment Assistance will come to this floor or that it will come to \nthis floor in a form that either Republicans or Democrats will support.\n  The supporters of this deal can't make their case without repeating \ndemonstrably false statistics. The fact is we won a $177 billion trade \ndeficit in goods with the countries with which we have free trade \nagreements. The $75 billion surplus in services brings the net to over \na $100 billion deficit.\n  How have so many Members been misled by charlatan lobbyists into \ncoming to this floor and giving false statistics? They are given this \nslippery phrase: Go down to the floor and talk about what has happened \nsince NAFTA.\n  Now, ``since NAFTA'' usually sounds like, well, since the early \n1990s. What they mean is excluding NAFTA. Excluding NAFTA when we \nreview free trade agreements is like excluding LeBron James when you \nevaluate the Cavaliers.\n  This bill is catastrophic for our national security. It hollows out \nour manufacturing base, and it is the greatest gift to China that we \ncould possibly make because it enshrines the sacrosanct nature of \ncurrency manipulation. It says, in the future, countries can manipulate \ntheir currency all they want and there will be no accounting for it.\n  In addition, the rules of origin provisions allow goods that are \nadmitted to be 50 or 60 percent made in China--that are actually 70 or \n80 percent made in China--to get fast-tracked into the United States. \nSo China gets 80 percent of the benefit of this agreement without \nhaving to admit a single American export.\n  As for Vietnam, our workers are going to have to compete against 56-\ncent-an-hour labor.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. We are told that we will get free access to the \nVietnamese markets. Vietnam doesn't have freedom. Vietnam doesn't have \nmarkets. They are not going to buy our exports any more than their \nCommunist Party decides to do so.\n  The chairman points out that with trade comes influence. That is \nright. There will be Nike lobbyists here, financed by this bill and its \neffects, lobbying against going after Vietnam for its oppression of \nreligion and its oppression of unions. So they will have influence here \nin Washington. They will continue not to have freedom, and we will \ncontinue to lose jobs.\n\n                                       THE TRADE DEFICIT WITH FTA PARTNERS\n                                  MERCHANDISE TRADE BALANCE WITH FTA COUNTRIES\n                                            [In thousands of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              U.S. Domestic   U.S. Imports for\n                          Country                             Exports 2014    Consumption 2014    2014 Balance\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAustralia.................................................        24,460,776        10,846,176        13,614,600\nBahrain...................................................           996,619           930,049            66,570\nCanada....................................................       262,930,650       345,304,263       -82,373,613\nChile.....................................................        15,311,892         9,501,206         5,810,686\nColombia..................................................        18,313,501        17,162,947         1,150,554\nCosta Rica................................................         6,289,716         9,493,622        -3,203,906\nDominican Rep.............................................         7,218,421         4,462,740         2,755,681\nEl Salvador...............................................         3,062,786         2,390,272           672,514\nGuatemala.................................................         5,653,385         4,140,518         1,512,867\nHonduras..................................................         5,686,432         4,511,855         1,174,577\nIsrael....................................................         7,894,126        23,054,059       -15,159,933\nJordan....................................................         1,971,195         1,354,296           616,899\nKorea.....................................................        42,010,900        68,602,393       -26,591,493\nMexico....................................................       192,706,833       292,481,624       -99,774,791\nMorocco...................................................         2,044,141         1,010,429         1,033,712\nNicaragua.................................................           905,977         3,079,467        -2,173,490\nOman......................................................         1,911,822           974,788           937,034\nPanama....................................................         9,737,362           386,123         9,351,239\nPeru......................................................         8,891,414         6,029,607         2,861,807\nSingapore.................................................        26,468,896        16,259,527        10,209,369\n                                                           -----------------------------------------------------\n    Total.................................................       644,466,844       821,975,961      -177,509,117\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n               Services Trade Balance With FTA Countries\n\n       According to the Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic \n     Analysis, we ran a surplus in services of $75 billion with \n     FTA Countries as of 2013, the last year for which we have \n     data on our services trade broken down for the FTA countries \n     as a group. Assuming normal growth for 2014, our surplus in \n     services is roughly $77 billion.\n       Therefore, our TOTAL TRADE BALANCE with FTA partner \n     countries is just over $100 billion. We run a significant \n     deficit with FTA Countries.\n       Explanation: There are different methods for measuring the \n     trade balance of the United States. The table above uses the \n     most accurate data for measuring the value of goods \n     (merchandise) actually ``Made in the USA'' and exported from \n     the United States to the various countries listed. The source \n     for our goods data is the International Trade Commission \n     (ITC) dataweb, available at http://dataweb.usitc.gov. ITC \n     measures exports in two different ways (``Total Exports'' and \n     ``Domestic Exports'').\n       We use ``Domestic Exports.'' According to the ITC, \n     ``Domestic Exports measures goods that are grown, produced \n     and manufactured in the United States, or goods of foreign \n     origin that have been changed in the United States.'' FTA \n     proponents like to use an alternative measurement, ``Total \n     Exports,'' which ``measures the total movement of goods out \n     of the United States to foreign countries,'' whether those \n     goods were made or altered by U.S. workers in the United \n     States or not--it includes goods that were simply transiting \n     the United States without alteration. Counting these ``Re-\n     Exports'' that are included in the ``Total Exports'' \n     measurement will give a distorted bilateral trade balance for \n     given countries because it drastically over-counts exports. \n     For similar reasons and in order to give an accurate, apples \n     to apples comparison, on the import side we use ``Imports for \n     Consumption'' which includes only imports that are not re-\n     exported. Using the alternative ITC measurement for imports, \n     ``Total Imports,'' would overstate imports by counting those \n     goods coming into the United States that are going to be re-\n     exported. See http://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/\ntradestatsnote.pdf for more on these terms and what the \n     measurements represent.\n       Services data. Ideally our nation's trade balance figures \n     would provide the trade balance for both goods and services. \n     However, services are more difficult for government agencies \n     to track, and the agencies therefore do not break the trade \n     data down consistently for every partner country, every year. \n     Also, the agencies cannot compile services data as quickly as \n     merchandise data. We use a 2013 services balance figure for \n     FTA countries in the aggregate that the Commerce Department's \n     Bureau of Economic Analysis provided to the Chamber of \n     Commerce for a report touting FTAs. We assume growth of about \n     $5 billion in the positive services balance for 2014. See the \n     Chamber report for these services data at https://\nwww.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/\nopen_door_trade_report.pdf.\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. How much time remains for both sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Wisconsin has 22\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Michigan has 10\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. We are the only two speakers left on our side. \nBecause of deference to our Members from South Carolina who are trying \nto get home to this tragedy, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Tiberi), and then I am just going to hold to close just for \nour South Carolina Members.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, read the bill. I have got it right here. The \nonly thing different is the number at the top has changed. The content \nis the same.\n\n[[Page H4523]]\n\n  TPA is not a trade deal. It is a process that holds this President \naccountable. It sets in motion Congress inserting itself.\n  By the way, NAFTA, I mean, I just continue to get blown away by the \nmisinformation. No wonder the American people get confused.\n  I take this personally. As the gentleman from New Jersey knows, my \ndad lost his job way before NAFTA. We have a trade surplus in \nmanufacturing with NAFTA. We have a trade surplus in services with \nNAFTA. We have a trade surplus in agriculture, food, and beverages with \nNAFTA. In fact, we have a trade surplus with NAFTA, if you take out oil \nand energy products. We have a trade surplus in manufacturing with \nNAFTA. I do get fired up about this.\n  Mr. Speaker, 95 percent of the world's population is outside the \nUnited States. A multinational corporation can move anywhere it wants \nto, a Fortune 500 company can move anywhere it wants to, and they do.\n  Lake Shore, in my district, a family-owned business, they cannot. \nThis is about breaking down barriers for Lake Shore, for Screen \nMachine, because they can't move a plant overseas, and they are at a \ncompetitive disadvantage. A large corporation can move. They can't.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, this is about jobs. This is about the American \nworker. This is about the fact that we have the ability today to \ncomplete anywhere in the world if those trade barriers are broken down.\n  We have to break them down, Mr. Speaker. One out of every five jobs \nis trade-related. They are good jobs.\n  Vote ``yes'' on TPA. Vote ``yes'' for the American worker.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. \nBass).\n  Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, last week I spoke in favor of H.R. 1891, the \nAGOA Extension and Enhancement Act of 2015. In the middle of tremendous \ncontroversy and tension over TPA, it was encouraging to have \nlegislation that wasn't controversial, in fact, had overwhelming \nsupport with 397 votes. The bill was sent to the Senate, and we were \nhopeful that H.R. 1891 would have already made it to the President's \ndesk.\n  Unfortunately, the bill is a victim of its own success. So many \nrumors are floating around that because AGOA is popular, supported by \nboth Democrats, Republicans, Senators, and House Members, that now \nSenators are considering adding more controversial bills into AGOA.\n  We are hearing TAA might be added. The press is even reporting \nconsideration is being given to using AGOA as a vehicle to extend the \nEx-Im Bank. We hear the thinking is, if TAA failed in the House last \nweek, if it is added in to AGOA, we will all vote for it.\n  AGOA can and should and stand on its own. The Senate should pass AGOA \nand send it to the President.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. \nVelazquez), who is the ranking member on the Committee on Small \nBusiness.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, once again, we are being asked to vote \nfor an agreement that will cost jobs, undermine environmental \nprotections, and erode workers' rights, all in the name of so-called \nfree trade.\n  This agreement is being negotiated in the dark, behind closed doors. \nThat secretive process may benefit large, multinational companies and \ntheir lobbyists, but it does not help small manufacturers in Brooklyn. \nIt does nothing for New Yorkers struggling to raise a family while \nkeeping their jobs from being exported.\n  When there is a bad process, we end up with a bad deal for American \nworkers, and we have seen this in the past. New York lost 374,000 \nmanufacturing jobs since NAFTA and the World Trade Organization \nagreements.\n  This vote, Mr. Speaker, comes down to a simple question: Are you \ngoing to side with Wall Street, large corporations, and their \nlobbyists, or will you stand with working families in your district? I \nwill take the latter.\n  Vote ``no.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nDoggett).\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, in Washington we never seem to lack for \nself-certified smart people. They are the folks who know what is best \nfor you and your family.\n  While they, today, are insisting on railroading through this fast-\ntrack trade deal--and they say it is so sweet for working families--is \nit so unreasonable to ask: What do the workers think about this bill?\n  While the environmental provisions have been secreted away from the \npublic, we do know that USTR does not believe in environmental law \nenforcement. Is it unreasonable to stop and ask: What do those who \nadvocate for clean water and clean air and conservation of our \nresources think about this trade deal?\n  I believe they support fair trade. They recognize that it raises all \nboats, but unfair trade sinks too many of them. They are capsized by \ncompeting with those who pay an average minimum wage of 60 cents an \nhour and whose only worker organization is the Communist Party in \nVietnam.\n  I believe our workers deserve respect. This bill asks American \nbusinesses to go out and compete with countries that mistreat their \nworkers, that pollute their air and water and destroy their natural \nresources, and that deflate or adjust their currency, manipulating it \nin ways that are unfair.\n  Railroading this bill through today will deny any opportunity, which \nwe have struggled so long for so many months to try to achieve to make \nthis a better right-track bill. The fast-trackers have rejected every \nconstructive improvement that we have offered to this measure. And all \nof us here in Congress have to concede we know less about what is in \nthis trade bill than the Vietnamese Politburo, than the Malaysian \nGovernment that has countenanced sex trafficking.\n  We need an open, fair process to advance real trade opportunities for \nall families. Reject this fast track.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We had one additional speaker. I don't see her, so I yield \nmyself the balance of my time to close.\n  I started off by saying it is said we should write the rules, not \nChina. That is true. We have been striving to try to help write the \nrules. We did so for years.\n  We introduced a substitute bill that outlined where we were coming \nfrom and where we thought these negotiations should go. That wasn't \neven given time for discussion.\n  So here is what we are left with. When you vote for TPA under these \ncircumstances, essentially what we are saying to this administration, \nit is essentially a blank check. They may talk. They may let us see \nsome of the documents, but often in ways we can't discuss them \npublicly.\n  This is likely to add up to a TPP that will be even more \ncontroversial than this TPA. For that reason, I strongly urge that, as \nwas said earlier, we slow down this process in order to try to find a \nroute to a TPP that would have broad bipartisan support. That has \nalways been my aim, rather than this kind of vote with a few handfuls \nof Democratic votes making this far, far, far from a bipartisan vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  For those who are coming on the floor protesting this particular \nprocess from the minority, it is the stunt pulled last week that \nbrought about this process.\n  We have talked a lot about what TPA is. It is a process, not a trade \nagreement.\n  I want every Member in this body to think about what this vote \nrepresents. It is one that will speak loudly about our political \nsystem: Can it still work?\n  It is a vote about what kind of Congress we want to be: Will we \nempower ourselves in trade agreements or just let the administration do \nwhatever it wants?\n  It is a vote about what kind of country we want to have: Are we still \ncommitted to leading? Are we still the symbol of freedom in free \nenterprise?\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a vote for accountability and for transparency. \nThis is a vote for a stronger economy and higher wages. This is a vote \nfor our system of free enterprise. This is a vote for American \nleadership. This is a vote to declare that America still has it. This \nis a vote to reestablish America's credibility.\n  The world is watching. Vote ``yes.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2146, the Trade \nPriorities and Accountability Act of 2015. For the past several\n\n[[Page H4524]]\n\nyears I have had many conversations about trade with the people of \nNorthwest Oregon. I've spoken with farmers, environmentalists, \nsemiconductor manufacturers, wine makers, workers, sports and outdoor \napparel employees, and others.\n  The district I represent has many trade-dependent jobs and \nindustries. We export a broad array of products--from computer chips to \npotato chips. Last year in Oregon, nearly 6,000 Oregon companies \nexported more than $20 billion in products. Expanding the overseas \nmarkets for U.S. goods will help businesses expand in this country. \nTrade agreements done right make it easier to sell American-made goods \nand they level the playing field by reducing tariffs that currently \nmake it difficult for Oregonians to compete in many of the world's \nmarkets.\n  This legislation is not the trade agreement itself, but rather a bill \nthrough which Congress establishes requirements for the negotiation of \ntrade agreements and the procedure for Congress to use when voting on \nwhether to approve the agreement when it is final.\n  The Trade Priorities and Accountability Act earned my vote because it \nrequires the President to negotiate a trade agreement that includes \nstrong and enforceable labor and environmental standards, fosters \ninnovation, would help expand exports, provides transparency for the \nAmerican people, and guarantees a meaningful role for Congress in trade \nnegotiations.\n  I strongly support the rights of workers and their ability to \ncollectively bargain and work in a safe environment. I also oppose \nchild labor and forced labor. The Trade Priorities and Accountability \nAct raises the bar in these areas and includes provisions that require \ntrading partners to comply with internationally-accepted labor \nstandards and face trade sanctions if they do not. For the first time \nit includes human rights--one of the cornerstones of our democratic \nvalues--as a negotiating objective. Oregon's First Congressional \nDistrict is known for its natural treasures--from the Pacific Ocean to \nthe Columbia River to the Clatsop State Forest--and it is imperative \nthat they be preserved for future generations. Deciding between \nconserving our natural resources and growing our economy is a false \nchoice; we can and must do both. The Trade Priorities and \nAccountability Act ensures that our clean air, land, and water will not \nbe up for negotiation.\n  The bill also protects intellectual property to safeguard innovation \nand fight piracy overseas, but with provisions to ensure that those \nprotections will not impede access to much-needed medicines for people \nin developing countries.\n  The Trade Priorities and Accountability Act requires trade agreements \nto contain high standards and protections, and it also requires that \nthe agreements include strong enforcement provisions to make clear that \nthe standards and protections will be upheld and enforced.\n  It is important to my constituents that any trade agreement be \naccessible and transparent to the public. The Trade Priorities and \nAccountability Act includes unprecedented access to trade agreements; \nthe entire final agreement must be made available to the public for a \nminimum of 60 days before the President signs it. In addition, after \nthe full text of the trade agreement becomes public, there will still \nbe months before Congress votes on whether to approve it.\n  To earn my vote, any trade agreement must be good for Americans. The \njobs we gain by expanding exports tend to pay high wages, but there is \na risk that some workers may be displaced by trade and by \nglobalization. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) is an important \nprogram to help workers transition into new fields by investing in \nskills and worker retaining. Without a reauthorization, TAA will expire \nat the end of September 2015. I voted in favor of TAA last week, but \nunfortunately it did not pass. But let me be very clear, I voted for \nthe TPA again today because the Speaker, the Senate Majority Leader, \nand the President have committed that Trade Adjustment Assistance and \ncustoms enforcement legislation will also move forward without delay.\n  I was deeply concerned that an early version of TAA legislation \nincluded cuts to Medicare. Seniors serve our country, contribute to our \neconomy, raise families, and strengthen communities across the nation. \nI urged House leadership to eliminate this provision. The bill I voted \nfor did not cut Medicare and I will continue to work with my colleagues \nto ensure seniors are not singled out to pay for this program.\n  This trade package, however, is far from perfect, and as we move \nforward I will continue to work to pass TAA and improve the trade \nagreement. I am very disappointed that partisan language to tie the \nadministration's hands on climate change was inserted at the last \nminute into the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act, which \npassed the House of Representatives last week without my support. I am \nalso very concerned that two very smart enforcement provisions offered \nby my colleague from Oregon, Representative Earl Blumenauer, were \ndeleted. His ``Green 301'' and enforcement fund provisions were very \nimportant to the overall effectiveness of the customs bill, and I will \nencourage the conferees to insist upon their inclusion in the bill we \nultimately send to the President's desk for signature.\n  We live in a changing and global economy. Markets, industries, and \ntechnologies evolve and American businesses and workers need to be able \nto react and adapt to thrive. A 21st century trade agreement broadens \nour country's reach and, done right, leads to more opportunity, more \ngrowth, and more job creation. It also supports the principle of trade \naccording to fair rules, equally applied, as opposed to all parties \ndoing whatever they want on a playing field that is far from level.\n  I am committed to policies that support a strong, long-term economy \nfor hardworking Oregonians and Americans. A trade agreement done right \ncan help achieve this goal, and passing H.R. 2146 is an important step \nin this process.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 321, the previous question is ordered.\n  The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin \n(Mr. Ryan).\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, on rollcall No. 375 I was detained with \nconstituents including a World War II veteran and family visiting in \nthe U.S. Capitol for the first time and missed rollcall No. 375. Had I \nbeen present, I would have voted ``yes.''\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, on rollcall No. 375, had I been \npresent, I would have voted ``yes.''\n  Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to cast my vote on rollcall \nNo. 375. Had I been present to vote on rollcall No. 375, I would have \nvoted ``aye.''\n\n\n                          personal explanation\n\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, June 18, \n2015, I was absent\n\n[[Page H4526]]\n\nfrom the House for family medical reasons. Due to my absence, I did not \nrecord any votes for the day.\n  Had I been pesent, I would have voted ``aye'' on rollcall 373, \nrollcall 374, and rollcall 375.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4526-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4526-H4528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM\n\n  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcCarthy) to inquire of the majority leader the schedule for the week \nto come.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House.\n  On Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. \nfor legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m.\n  On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning \nhour and noon for legislative business.\n  On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. \nLast votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next \nweek, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business \ntomorrow.\n  In addition, the House will consider H.R. 2042, the Ratepayer \nProtection Act, sponsored by Representative Ed Whitfield. This bill is \nessential for families all across the Nation. If we do not act, the \nelectricity bills could skyrocket as a result of EPA's clean power plan \nrule.\n  The House will also continue the annual appropriations process with \nconsideration of fiscal year 2016 Interior appropriation bill sponsored \nby Representative Ken Calvert.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his information.\n  I note that the Export-Import Bank, which, of course, expires on June \n30, is not among the scheduled pieces of legislation.\n  As the gentleman knows, Speaker Boehner has been quoted as saying \nthat, if we don't pass the Export-Import Bank, that there are thousands \nof jobs on the line that would disappear pretty quickly if the Ex-Im \nBank were to disappear. He then again said, as the Chamber closest to \nthe people, ``The House works best when it is allowed to work its \nwill.''\n  The majority leader knows that I am absolutely convinced that the \nExport-Import Bank is supported by a majority of Members of this House, \nbut this House has not been allowed to work its will on the Export-\nImport Bank.\n  Predecessors of yours and a very dear friend of mine, Senator Blunt, \nsaid not too long ago that he believed that, if a bill were brought to \nthe floor of the House, it would have the votes. More importantly, \nbecause he is now, of course, in the other body but is among the \nleadership in the other body, he said that the bill had the votes in \nthe Senate. I believe he is right on both of those observations.\n  I understand the majority leader is not for the bill. It is my \nunderstanding that the Speaker is. I would hope that those of us who \nsupport it and, frankly, those who oppose it would have the \nopportunity, as the Speaker indicated, for the House to work its will.\n  Can the gentleman tell me whether there are any plans prior to June \n30, when the Export-Import Bank authorization to give loans expires, \nare there any plans to bring that legislation before this House in a \ntimely fashion so that the authorization would not expire?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  The gentleman did say he knows my stance on this issue; and, no, \nthere is no action scheduled before the House.\n  Mr. HOYER. I apologize. Could the gentleman repeat himself?\n  Mr. McCARTHY. There is no action scheduled for this House, no.\n  Mr. HOYER. Does the majority leader intend to, therefore, have the \nauthority of the Export-Import Bank expire, notwithstanding the \nSpeaker's observation and that it will cost thousands of jobs?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Again, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  There is no action scheduled at this appropriate time.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for repeating his answer. I heard \nthat answer, but my question to the gentleman was: Is it his intention \nthat the Export-Import Bank expire and, therefore, not bring \nlegislation to the floor?\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding for the third time \nwith the same question.\n  There is no pending action before this House for next week.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for repeating for a third time his \nanswer to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would simply observe, sadly, that the representation \nthe House can work its will on an issue of great importance to the \nUnited States and to jobs in the United States will not be brought to \nthis floor, notwithstanding the fact that 180 Democrats have signed a \ndischarge petition and 60 Republicans filed a bill to extend the \nExport-Import Bank.\n\n  That is 240 votes, Mr. Speaker, as the Speaker well can add himself. \nTwo hundred and forty votes is a majority of this House. They reflect \nin my view, Mr. Speaker, the will of this House.\n  It is extraordinarily regrettable that, when the Speaker of the House \nsays that, if we don't do something, thousands of American jobs are \ngoing to be lost--it is particularly regrettable, just after we had a \nvote on a bill that many people believe is going to lose us jobs and, \ntherefore, they opposed.\n  How sad it is that we don't bring to the floor a bill which will, \nlike 85 other countries--85 other countries--help us export goods? \nThose 85 countries, Mr. Speaker, are not going to stop helping their \ncountries export goods, so the loss will be to our exporters and those \nthey employ.\n  I very much regret that that won't be brought to the floor. As the \nmajority has told me, it is not scheduled; I know it is not scheduled. \nI lament the fact that it is not scheduled.\n  Representative Chris Collins of New York said: I can't figure out for \nthe life of me why my party, the Republican Party, that stands for \njobs, and in every conference meeting, it is jobs and the economy.\n  The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee is on the floor; he \ntalks about jobs and the economy.\n  Here I am, says Chris Collins, in the majority of my own Conference, \nfighting to defend the Export-Import Bank, which is the best example of \ncreating jobs in America.\n  I regret that that is not being brought to the floor. I won't ask the \nquestion again because he has already told me it is not scheduled, and \napparently, there is no intent to schedule. I regret that.\n  Now, Mr. Leader, if I can ask you, we passed now six appropriations \nbills. Yesterday, the Labor, HHS bill was marked up in subcommittee and \nthe Financial Services in full committee.\n  Can the gentleman tell me whether it is the intention, whether they \nare scheduled right now or not, to bring all 12 appropriations bills to \nthe floor before--well, whenever--all 12 bills to the floor?\n  I yield to my friend.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  As the gentleman knows, this is the earliest we have ever started the \nappropriation process. The gentleman is correct that we are halfway \nthrough the 12 bills, having passed 6 already, and we are bringing up \nInterior next week. It is our intention to do the work that we are \nresponsible for in finishing the appropriation process.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for that.\n  Let me ask him further as he knows what is happening in the Senate \nand whether they can take those bills up: Does the gentleman \ncontemplate, as the majority leader, or does he know whether the \nSpeaker contemplates any effort to come to a bipartisan agreement as \nwas done when Mr. Ryan and Senator Murray met and came to grips with a \nresolution and a compromise on what otherwise would be the sequester \n302(a) allocations on discretionary spending, which the chair of the \ncommittee, as you know, Chairman Rogers, has called ill-conceived and \nunrealistic?\n  Does the majority leader know whether there is any plan to try to get \nus from the gridlock, which we are apparently in one more time on the \nappropriations process, to a place as\n\n[[Page H4527]]\n\nRyan-Murray got us where we moved ahead in a bipartisan way and, in \nfact, funded the government?\n  Although, it was not until December, and we had a stopgap measure in \nthere. Is there anything scheduled to discuss that or to pursue that \ncompromise?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  As the gentleman knows, there is no gridlock here. We have passed \nhalf of the appropriation bills already. We have started the process \nearlier than ever before. As the gentleman knows, with just the bill \nbefore--very bipartisan--more than 46 Democrats joined us in repealing \nthe medical device tax.\n  I would probably tell the gentleman that his question really goes to \nthe minority leader on the Senate side, Harry Reid. In reading some of \nhis statements, he wants to create a shutdown, which I think would be \nwrong for the American people.\n  I think the best way forward is for the Democrats and the Republicans \nin the Senate to take up DOD appropriations and move that to the \nPresident's desk.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend.\n  There is no Democrat in this House, in the Senate, or in the White \nHouse who wants to shut down this government. As a matter of fact, we \nhave not done that. It was done in '95 and in early '96. It was done \nlast year when many in your party said ``shut it down'' if the \nPresident doesn't change his immigration policy. Any suggestion, Mr. \nSpeaker, that Democrats want to shut down the government is simply \nincorrect.\n  Now, what the minority leader has said in the Senate, I believe, is \nthat, until such time as sequester is changed that it is not useful to \nwaste time on bills that will not become law as we did, of course, many \nyears during the Ryan budgets, which were never implemented, and they \nwere never implemented in the House of Representatives fully--not once. \nWhy? It is because, as Mr. Rogers said, they were ill-conceived and \nunrealistic.\n  I just want to make it clear to the majority leader that I am \nprepared to work with him and with others to get us to a compromise on \nlevels of funding that are realistic and well conceived by Mr. Rogers, \nby Mr. Cochran, and by others.\n  Until we do that, we are going to be in a place where we are going to \nbe, I predict, in late September, on the threshold of giving some fear \nthat the government is going to shut down again, the greatest \ngovernment on the face of the Earth. I am not sure what people around \nthe world thought when we shut our government down for 16 days. It was \nnot a confidence builder. That is for sure.\n  We have another item that we are losing confidence on, the highway \nbill. You didn't mention, Mr. Leader, anything about the highway bill \nbeing scheduled. I understand it does not expire until July 31, so we \nhave about 6 weeks, maybe a little longer than that.\n  Does the gentleman know whether there is any compromise being \nachieved so that we can give confidence to States, counties, \nmunicipalities, contractors, the business community that they will have \na funding stream to invest in building, repairing, and maintaining our \ninfrastructure in this country?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I will answer your question, but, first, I just want to make sure I \nclarify as to your earlier question.\n  I am just reading here from Politico, as you have been able to read \nother statements. It says here that the Senate Democrats are prepared \nto shut down the government. Leader Reid outlined Senate Democrats' \nobstructionist plan for the summer.\n  They have a title and a time for it, obstructionists for the summer, \nwarning that, because of the Democrats' plan to block appropriations \nbills, we are heading for another shutdown.\n  Unfortunately, as I read in other articles of this same time period, \nI believe the incoming leader on the other side, too--Senator Schumer--\nsaid he was actually working with the administration on this. I do not \nthink this is helpful.\n  For the history of why we are where we are, sequester was an idea \nfrom this administration. The President is the one who put that into \nthe bill. We are writing appropriation bills to the law. That is what \nour rules are and what we are doing. We are getting our work done, and \nwe are hopeful that this Democratic plan of obstructionists throughout \nthe summer will not come true.\n  Now, you asked about the highway bill. This is a very good question \nand is one that I do want to work with you on because we were working \ntogether on this, Republicans and Democrats, from our committee.\n  Unfortunately, as the gentleman may know, a month or so ago, your \nside of the aisle said they had to stop working with us. Part of the \nreason we were given was that it fell into the obstructionist plan for \nthe summer, that it wasn't just about appropriations, but that you \nwanted to somehow shut down transportation, which we do not want to do.\n\n  We want to get to a 5-year plan, and we were working with you on \noffsets to be able to pay for this throughout the rest of the year. \nUnfortunately, when the Democrats decided to stop this program, we had \nto just go to July.\n  We know we have some time left, and we are very committed to getting \nthis done. We think it is important for America to keep them working, \nand we hope you will come back to the table and work with us because we \nwill be more than willing to work with you.\n  I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his observation. I think that is \nmy reputation, that of wanting to work to constructively achieve joint \nobjectives--in this case, the highway bill.\n  Mr. Ryan is on the floor, but I won't ask him to yield for a question \nas to whether or not the Ways and Means Committee has come up with a \nway to finance the highway bill.\n  I know he said that there is not going to be a gasoline tax, which, \nhistorically, Republican Presidents have been for. I am not suggesting \nthis be it, but maybe tax reform, as my friend has said publicly for \nthat.\n  I will repeat, Mr. Leader, there is no Democrat who wants to shut \ndown the government. I hear what you said. I know the quote. What they \nhave said is they are not going to shut it down indirectly as you want \nto do. Now, you have done it directly.\n  I do not mean you, personally, but the only two times that I have \nserved in the Congress of the United States over the last 34 years when \nthe government was shut down as a policy was in 1995 under Newt \nGingrich and in the last Congress. Those were the only times, and I \nhave been here 34 years.\n  Has it happened inadvertently for a couple of days? Yes, it has, \nbecause the legislation was not agreed to or we couldn't get it to the \nPresident in time or things of that nature.\n  Let me say something because, on your side of the aisle, you love to \nsay this. You love to place sequestration at the feet of President \nObama's. Now, my friend, the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, has not been \nhere as long as I have, but sequestration originally started certainly \nin Gramm-Rudman--or it may have even started before then--with Phil \nGramm, a Republican from Texas, and Mr. Rudman, a Republican from New \nHampshire. That is when it started. Then we see all the time the \nacross-the-board cuts--the 1 percent, the 2 percent, the 3 percent. \nNow, we have defeated them, but that is a part of sequestration.\n  More importantly, on 7/15/11, your side, in charge of the Congress, \noffered a bill that you called Cut, Cap, and Balance. Now, this was 5 \ndays or 6 days before your allegation that Mr. Lew went to the majority \nleader then, Mr. Reid, and said maybe sequestration will help get this \nbill through.\n  First of all, Mr. Speaker, we were confronting the failure to \nreauthorize the payment of America's bills, the debt limit. That was \nwhat we were facing. What Mr. Lew was suggesting was that the \nRepublicans liked sequestration, so maybe if we put that in the bill, \neven though we don't like it, they will vote for not defaulting on the \nnational debt.\n  In fact, that is what happened; but if you look at your Cut, Cap, and \nBalance bill--your bill I voted against--the fallback that you \nsuggested was sequestration. That was about a week before Mr. Lew said \nto Mr. Reid that maybe that will get our Republican friends to support \npaying the national debt.\n  That passed, by the way, on the July 19, 2011. It was 6 days later \nthat Mr.\n\n[[Page H4528]]\n\nLew, in trying to get something done to make sure that America did not \ndefault, suggested to Mr. Reid maybe putting that in the bill will get \nthe Republicans' votes so that we will pay our debts.\n  The problem is, if you know the facts, you get a little frustrated \nwith hearing this representation, the President was for sequester. \nLet's just, for the sake of argument, say that nobody here was for \nsequester. Then let's get rid of sequester. If you are for sequester, I \nget it. You don't want to change it.\n  There are a lot of your Members who certainly don't want to change \nit. I tell people all over this country when I talk to them that \nsequester is a complicated word. It starts with an S. It stands for \n``stupid.'' It is a policy unrelated to opportunities, to challenges, \nand to needs. It was a number pulled out of the air.\n  I would hope, Mr. Leader, that we don't talk about ``you did it'' and \n``you did it.'' Let's talk about how we solve the problems confronting \nour country. Ex-Im is one of them. Appropriations bills that we can \nagree on is another and highway bill funding to give confidence to our \neconomy and to our entities that have to keep people moving and \ncommerce moving.\n  Let's give them confidence. Let's sit down. Let's get these done. \nLet's bring it to the floor. As Speaker Boehner said, let this House \nwork its will.\n  The gentleman referred to the 46 Democrats who voted with him and his \nparty on the most recent bill, which was a tax reduction and which is, \nas are all of the tax reductions that you have brought to the floor, \nunpaid for.\n  Very frankly, as the father of three daughters, as the grandfather of \nthree grandchildren, and as the great-grandfather of three great-\ngrandchildren, I don't like the fact that the expectation is they will \npay the bill. They don't vote, of course, so they can't vote for or \nagainst us.\n  My daughters can, notwithstanding the 46 people who voted for it on \nour side of the aisle because they are for the policy. I will tell you \nI have talked to a lot of them, and they are not for not paying for it, \nbut they were put in the position of either being for something, \ntherefore, or being against something because it is not paid for and is \nhurting future generations.\n  The only reason I mention that is the gentleman brought it up, and I \nwill tell him that there is very broad, almost unanimous sentiment on \nour side that we ought to pay for things, and when that policy was \nin place, we balanced the budget for 4 years in a row.\n\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I appreciate the gentleman's comments. Hopefully, I can \ntake from the gentleman's comments that he is willing to work with us \non highways and on coming back to the table. I appreciate that.\n  We may disagree on whether the administration put it in the bill in \nsequester, but I think history will prove me right. I look forward to \nit just as we worked throughout this week and passed two bills today on \na bipartisan level.\n  You may have disagreed with one, but 28 on your side of the aisle \nagreed with it, so did your President. We look forward to getting this \nwork done for the American people. We work within the current law. That \nis what we look to do, and I look forward to continuing to work with \nyou.\n  Mr. HOYER. I appreciate the gentleman's observations.\n  I would simply say, Mr. Speaker, that in that spirit, there are 240 \npeople in this House who think the Ex-Im Bank ought to be extended and \nreauthorized. I hope we will follow that process. I would reiterate, \nyes, I am willing to work with the gentleman on highways or on anything \nelse which will benefit the American people and our country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4528-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1300\n  HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW; AND ADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, JUNE 19, \n                    2015, TO TUESDAY, JUNE 23, 2015\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1190, Protecting \nSeniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2015, currently under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  What we are bringing to the floor today is Dr. Roe's bill to repeal \nthe Independent Payment Advisory Board. This is a bill that came out of \nthe Committee on Ways and Means with a bipartisan vote. This is an \nagency that Members on both sides of the aisle believe does not have \nthe right to exist, should not exist, and does not follow our \ndemocratic process.\n  Let me explain why we are doing this. There is no greater example of \nthe conflict of visions than this. ObamaCare created something called \nIPAB, the Independent Payment Advisory Board. It is a board of 15 \npeople who are not elected or appointed.\n  They have the power to cut Medicare's payments for treatment. They \nhave a quota which they have to hit in order to find the same number to \nactually cut. Every year, a formula kicks in, and the 15 unelected \nbureaucrats\n\n[[Page H4529]]\n\nfind where they are going to cut Medicare payments to providers to hit \nthat quota.\n  They can do all of this without Congress' approval. The idea, of \ncourse, is that unelected bureaucrats know best, unelected bureaucrats \nknow better than patients, their doctors, or their representatives in \nCongress; they will know which treatment works the best because they \nare detached, they are distant, they are above the fray, they are not \ninvolved in the emotions or the personal relationships that such \npersonal decisions like your health care ultimately involve.\n  That is the big problem. They are totally unaccountable. They are \ndivorced from reality. Health care is not a statistic. It is not a \nformula. It is not uniform. It is not cookie cutter. It is personal. It \nis individual. It is distinct.\n  Every patient is different. This is why patients, along with their \ndoctors, need to be put in charge of their health care. What IPAB would \nessentially do is ration health care. It would take control away from \npatients.\n  Now, the other side says, Hey, no, not so fast; Congress can override \nthem--but that is only with a supermajority vote.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have seen this movie before. It never ends well. \nSeniors will suffer the consequences. Medicare is more than a program; \nMedicare is a promise. Seniors have worked hard; they have paid their \ntaxes; they have planned on Medicare throughout all their working \nlives, and now that they are retired, it is something that they \ndeserve, a secure retirement. It needs to be there, just like it has \nbeen for our parents.\n  Think about what a Member of Congress will do. This Board of \nunelected bureaucrats will say, We are cutting Medicare X, Y, and Z \nways to these providers for Medicare, which will deny services to \nseniors; and they will do it according to this formula that is in law.\n  If Congress doesn't like it, then the law says Congress has to go cut \nMedicare somewhere else and overturn this ruling with a three-fifths \nsupermajority vote in the House and the Senate--as if that would ever \nhappen.\n  All this thing has done, it is designed to basically go around \nCongress, go around the laws, and have unelected and unaccountable \nbureaucrats ration care for our seniors.\n  This is wrong; it is undemocratic; it does not fit with our \nConstitution, and we think it ought to be repealed. That is why we are \nbringing this bill to the House.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2015.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Ryan: I write in regard to H.R. 1190, \n     Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2015, which was \n     ordered reported by the Committee on Ways and Means on June \n     2, 2015. As you are aware, the bill also was referred to the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce. I wanted to notify you that \n     the Committee on Energy and Commerce will forgo action on \n     H.R. 1190 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House \n     floor for consideration.\n       This is done with the understanding that the Committee on \n     Energy and Commerce's jurisdictional interests over this and \n     similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. In \n     addition, the Committee reserves the right to seek conferees \n     on H.R. 1190 and requests your support when such a request is \n     made.\n       I would appreciate your response confirming this \n     understanding with respect to H.R. 1190 and ask that a copy \n     of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the \n     Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the \n     House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fred Upton,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2015.\n     Hon. Fred Upton,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding the \n     Committee's jurisdictional interest in H.R. 1190, the \n     Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2015, and your \n     willingness to forego consideration by your committee.\n       I agree that the Committee on Energy and Commerce has a \n     valid jurisdictional interest in certain provisions of the \n     bill and that the Committee's jurisdiction will not be \n     adversely affected by your decision to forego consideration. \n     As you have requested, I will support your request for an \n     appropriate appointment of outside conferees from your \n     committee in the event of a House-Senate conference on this \n     or similar legislation should such a conference be convened.\n       Finally, I will include a copy of your letter and this \n     response in the Congressional Record during the floor \n     consideration of H.R. 1190. Thank you again for your \n     cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Paul Ryan,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The real purpose of this bill at this time, indeed, is to take a \nfurther effort to repeal ACA. That is really what this is about at this \nparticular moment. The Republican leadership is, yet again, taking aim \nat ACA. H.R. 1190 would repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, \nIPAB. This would really be the 59th vote to repeal or undermine ACA.\n  Since it passed, we have seen the slowest growth in healthcare prices \nover any period of that length in nearly 50 years. Growth in per \nenrollee healthcare spending across both the public and private sectors \nhas been controlled.\n  The three slowest years of growth in real per capita national health \nexpenditures on record were 2011, 2012, and 2013. The ACA, in essence, \nhas changed the healthcare cost landscape, keeping cost increases down \nand keeping or helping, at least, to keep families out of debt.\n  While we know the Medicare delivery system reforms have been working \nto deliver value and lower costs, the IPAB was created as a backstop--a \nbackstop--only to come into effect if other efforts weren't successful. \nThis should be clear. IPAB only comes into being if delivery system \nreforms aren't doing their job to manage Medicare.\n  According to the CBO, Medicare growth rates are projected to remain \nbeneath IPAB targets throughout the entire budget window, thereby not \ntriggering the Board's provisions until 2024. I think, when you \nsubtract 2015 from 2024, you get 9 years; so here we are, on this date, \nat this time, 9 years, according to CBO, before the provisions would \ncome into effect, asking this Congress to repeal the IPAB provision.\n  If the ACA's delivery system efforts continue to be successful, IPAB \nmay never even need to be constituted. It is specifically prohibited \nfrom cutting benefits or raising costs on seniors.\n  What IPAB can do, however, is to make recommendations to go after \noverpayments, go after fraud and abuse, and try to improve, if needed, \nthe way there is reform of the delivery system. IPAB will not take away \nMedicare benefits; it will not shift costs to seniors.\n  If we in Congress are doing our job as stewards of Medicare, we can \nmanage cost growth while protecting beneficiaries on the front end. In \nthe event IPAB makes recommendations, Congress always has the ability \nto disapprove or modify them. If we do our job, we won't need IPAB. If \nwe fail to do our job, IPAB will prod us to action 9 years from now or \nperhaps even later.\n  Let me talk a few words about the offset. It is a significant \nreduction of funding for the prevention and public health fund. While \nthe Republicans so far have come forth with their proposals that are \nnever paid for, this time, they have decided to have a pay-for, but it \nwould cut by half or more than that the current funding for the \nprevention and public health fund.\n  That fund was established in the ACA to provide expanded and \nsustained national investments in prevention and public health and will \nprovide $900 million this year alone for interventions that will reduce \nsmoking, tackle heart disease, and help improve prenatal outcomes.\n  I have a listing of what it has meant for Michigan, just as one \nexample: $3.5 million for State health department efforts to prevent \nobesity and diabetes; $3.8 million to address chronic disease risk \nfactors among African Americans, American Indians, Latinos, and other \nminorities; $3.3 million for community transformation grants in central \nMichigan to address heart disease prevention and diabetes; and almost \n$3 million for tobacco use prevention.\n  Here we are, at long last, the Republicans come forth with a pay-for, \nand they are paying for it by taking away something that really, really \nmatters.\n  We have in front of us a Statement of Administration Policy, and I \nask that it be placed in the Record. It just repeats some of the points \nthat I have\n\n[[Page H4530]]\n\nmade, so I will leave it just to be entered into the Record; and, \ntherefore, I will now say that we should not vote for this legislation.\n  It would repeal a part of ACA designed to help keep healthcare costs \nunder control, and so importantly, it would cut critical public health \nand prevention funding.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n     H.R. 1190--Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2015\n\n                    (Rep. Roe, R-TN, June 15, 2015)\n\n       The Affordable Care Act has improved the American health \n     care system, on which Americans can rely throughout life. \n     After more than five years under this law, 16.4 million \n     Americans have gained health coverage. Up to 129 million \n     people who could have otherwise been denied or faced \n     discrimination now have access to coverage. And, health care \n     prices have risen at the slowest rate in nearly 50 years. As \n     we work to make the system even better, we are open to ideas \n     that improve the accessibility, affordability, and quality of \n     health care, and help middle-class Americans.\n       The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) will be \n     comprised of fifteen expert members, including doctors and \n     patient advocates, and will recommend to the Congress \n     policies that reduce the rate of Medicare growth and help \n     Medicare provide better care at lower costs. IPAB has been \n     highlighted by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) economists, and health policy experts as contributing \n     to Medicare's long-term sustainability. The Board is \n     prohibited from recommending changes to Medicare that ration \n     health care, restrict benefits, modify eligibility, increase \n     cost sharing, or raise premiums or revenues. Under current \n     law, the Congress retains the authority to modify, reject, or \n     enhance IPAB recommendations to strengthen Medicare, and IPAB \n     recommendations would take effect only if the Congress does \n     not act to slow Medicare cost growth.\n       H.R. 1190 would repeal and dismantle the IPAB even before \n     it has a chance to work. The bill would eliminate an \n     important safeguard that, under current law, will help reduce \n     the rate of Medicare cost growth responsibly while protecting \n     Medicare beneficiaries and the traditional program. While \n     this safeguard is not projected to be needed now or for a \n     number of years given recent exceptionally slow growth in \n     health care costs, it could serve a valuable role should \n     rapid growth in health costs return.\n       CBO estimates that repealing the IPAB would increase \n     Medicare costs and the deficit by $7 billion over 10 years. \n     The Administration would strongly oppose any effort to offset \n     this increased Federal budget cost by reducing the Prevention \n     and Public Health Fund. The Affordable Care Act created this \n     Fund to help prevent disease, detect it early, and manage \n     conditions before they become severe. There has been \n     bipartisan and bicameral support for allocation of the Fund, \n     and the Congress directed uses of the Fund through FY 2014 \n     and FY 2015 appropriations legislation. The Fund supports \n     critical investments such as tobacco use reduction and \n     programs to reduce health-care associated infections. By \n     concentrating on the causes of chronic disease, the Fund \n     helps more Americans stay healthy.\n       The Administration is committed to strengthening Medicare \n     for those who depend on it and protection of the public's \n     health. We believe that this legislation fails to accomplish \n     these goals. If the President were presented with H.R. 1190, \n     his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), the author of the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a proud sponsor of H.R. \n1190, the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act. This bipartisan \nlegislation, which I introduced with my colleague, Linda T. Sanchez, \nwould repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB.\n  Created by the Affordable Care Act, this panel of 15 unaccountable, \nunelected bureaucrats exists to cut Medicare spending to meet arbitrary \nbudgets and have been given enormous powers to do so.\n  Listen to this carefully. Peter Orszag, President Obama's former \nbudget director, has noted IPAB represents the single biggest yielding \nof power to an independent entity since the creation of the Federal \nReserve. Let me repeat that: the single biggest yielding of power to an \nindependent entity since the creation of the Federal Reserve.\n  Mr. Speaker, we just spent, in a bipartisan way, 3 years working \nthrough SGR reform. Seventeen times, we kicked the can down the road so \nour seniors wouldn't be denied access to care. This bill is basically \nSGR on steroids. It trumps all the work we just did on SGR reform.\n  Any proposal made by IPAB will be considered using expedited \nprocedures, and without a three-fifths vote in the Senate, Congress can \nonly modify the type of cuts proposed, not the amount, so we have to do \nthe amount. If Congress doesn't act on IPAB's recommendation, the cuts \nwill automatically go into effect. To make matters worse, the Board is \nexempt from administrative or judicial review.\n  On the projections between 2020 and 2024, the CBO can't tell me from \nyear to year, within the tens of billions of dollars, what the budget \ndeficit is going to be each year, so I don't put a lot of stock in \nthat.\n  If the President does not nominate individuals to serve on the IPAB \nor if the IPAB fails to recommend cuts when required to do so, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services has the power to make the \nchanges unilaterally.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  One person will make those changes for the entire country. Think \nabout that for a second. One person would have the ability to reshape a \nprogram that has 55 million enrollees. Whatever you may think about the \nPresident's healthcare law, this just isn't right.\n  After practicing medicine for more than 30 years, I can tell you that \nno two patients are the same and that different approaches are required \nfor different needs. IPAB is blind to that fact and will ration \nseniors' access to care through a one-size-fits-all payment policy.\n  Medicare desperately needs reform to ensure it continues to be there \nfor current beneficiaries and the next generation, but this is not the \nway. We can do better.\n  It is time to go back to the drawing board. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill and put medical decisions back where they belong. Mr. \nSpeaker, that is between patients and doctors.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. McDermott), ranking member on the Health Subcommittee.\n  (Mr. McDERMOTT asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nhis remarks.)\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.\n  This legislation is a ghost hunt. It doesn't exist. There is no IPAB. \nThere is nobody that has been appointed. Nothing is going to happen \nuntil 2024.\n  So the question you have to ask yourself is: Why are we out here? \nWell, we are out here because some people think that trying to control \ncosts in health care is a bad idea.\n  If you go back and read the Medicare legislation when it was put in, \nthe AMA extracted from this Congress the right to charge their usual \nand customary fees. They have been driving the costs, and we have been \ntrying to control it with all kinds of mechanisms all the way through \nit. Only with the incidence of the ACA have we seen the curve come \ndown.\n  We have actually extended the life of Medicare to 2030. Right now, we \nare spending 17 percent of our gross domestic product on health care. \nWhen I came to this Congress, it was about 12 or 13 percent. It has \nonly gone up. We have not been able to do it ourselves. So the creators \nof this bill said: Let's put something in on the outside that can give \nus some suggestions.\n  Now, when we had Simpson-Bowles--and I know the chairman of the Ways \nand Means Committee thought the Simpson-Bowles idea was a good idea--\nwhat happened after it was brought out in public? Nothing. We ignored \nit.\n  The reason for IPAB is to put pressure on the Congress to act to \ncontrol costs. I guess Republicans don't care about costs because they \ndon't understand that there are 10,000 people signing up for Social \nSecurity every single day. That is 3.5 million people.\n  The numbers are going up. The costs are going to go up. People are \ngoing to run around here saying we have got to cut benefits; we have \ngot to shift the costs to the old people; we have got to do all this. \nThe IPAB was a way to force the Congress to face the consequences of \ntheir own inaction.\n  Dr. Roe is correct; we spent 16 years kicking the can down the road \non this issue of SGR. That was, again, an attempt to control costs. It \nnever worked. It was ill-conceived in the beginning.\n  This is an issue where there is some real muscle in it, and people \nare afraid of that. They are afraid of it 9 years\n\n[[Page H4531]]\n\nout because they know how the Congress does. This is just another way \nto try to undercut and make Medicare and the ACA not work.\n  Mr. Levin pointed out the other thing that is important, and that is \nthe place they look for the money is to go to community health, health \ndepartments. Nobody needs health departments. Why do you need people \nlooking at restaurants to see if they are safe to go into, or to look \nat the water supply or look at what is happening in sewage? You don't \nneed that stuff.\n  This $7 billion they are going to grab here is straight out of the \nhealth departments of our country. Every one of your counties is going \nto be facing the impact of this.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. The only thing that I think one can say is that it is \na bad idea to get rid of some muscle to force us to look at costs, but \nit is worse to pay for it by taking money away from health departments. \nThey are the ones that always get cut.\n  Who wants inspectors? The other side says: We don't like regulations. \nIt is regulations that are ruining America. We have got to get those \nregulations out.\n  You don't want regulations enforced in restaurants? Then take $7 \nbillion away from it and see what kind of restaurant problems you start \nto have.\n  Milwaukee had the cryptosporidium organism in the water supply. That \nis a health problem that is dealt with by the actual health department \nin the county. We are taking $7 billion to pay for this badly \nconstructed idea.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe).\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I have spent going on four decades \ntaking care of patients in rural east Tennessee, and I saw access \nbecoming more and more and more of a problem. It is a serious issue \nnow, as Medicare costs have gone up and up and up.\n  I have a mother who is almost 93. She has a difficult time affording \nher health care and other needs that she has. One of the things I am \nvery concerned with, as Dr. McDermott said, we have 10,000 seniors a \nday getting on that program. We need to leave those decisions to \ndoctors and patients, not to bureaucrats.\n  Let me give a little more information. There is a similar panel in \nEngland called NICE, the National Institute for Health and Care \nExcellence, I believe is what the acronym is. The other day, the Royal \nCollege of Surgeons talked about how they noticed that over 75, almost \nnobody got operated on for breast cancer, almost nobody over 75 got a \ngall bladder operation, almost nobody over 75 got a knee fixed, and \nalmost nobody over 75 got a hip fixed. That is wrong, and that is \nexactly the pathway we are going down if we don't stop this nonsense.\n\n  There is a very good article in the New England Journal of Medicine \npublished in 2011. I recommend you all read it. It is a look back from \n25 years. That is the only information they had. This particular author \nwas not for IPAB or against it; he just analyzed it.\n  Twenty-one of those 25 years, IPAB would have kicked in, meaning \nthose cuts would have happened. And I can tell you this right now: our \nseniors better look at this with a laser beam on because their care is \ngoing to be cut if this goes into effect. We need to get rid of it now, \nbefore that happens.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Linda T. Sanchez of California), a \nvery active member of our committee.\n  Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak \nabout H.R. 1190, the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act.\n  I am the Democratic lead, along with Congressman Phil Roe, and I am \nproud of the bipartisan work we have done to repeal the unelected \nbureaucracy known as the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB. I \nproudly voted for the ACA, and I think time has shown that the law \nworks. The ACA has reduced the number of uninsured Americans, lowered \nhealthcare costs, prevented disease, and increased access to cures.\n  Despite the success of the law, no bill is perfect. I believe that \nthere are certain areas for improvement in the ACA, and I am committed \nto working in a bipartisan manner to solve these issues and provide our \nconstituents with the world-class health care that they deserve.\n  The ACA is a good law and a few small tweaks can make it stronger, \nand that is why I decided to reach across the aisle to work with \nCongressman Roe on this legislation. Repealing IPAB is not the \nexclusive purview of the Republican Party, and it is a bipartisan \neffort.\n  Unfortunately, much like the last time Congress considered IPAB \nrepeal in 2012, an unpalatable pay-for undermined the bipartisan \nsupport for a deal. I know Congressman Roe has worked tirelessly to \navoid repeating the pay-for battle that we had back in 2012 in order to \nretain Democratic support.\n  Despite these efforts, Republican leadership has chosen to draw from \nthe prevention and public health fund to pay for H.R. 1190. This is \nsomething that I simply cannot support, and it is with great \ndisappointment that I must cast my vote against H.R. 1190. I truly \nbelieve that repealing IPAB is the right thing to do, but I cannot \nsupport gutting a great provision in the ACA to get rid of a bad one.\n  The prevention and public health fund is an unprecedented investment \nin public health to prevent costly and life-threatening diseases. The \nfund has invested nearly $5.25 billion in States, cities, and \ncommunities to keep our constituents healthy and safe before they need \ncostly, long-term care to manage their illnesses.\n  The fund also exists to prevent stroke, cancer, tobacco use, and \nobesity, while also funding vital childhood immunization programs, and \ninvests in detecting, tracking, and responding to infectious diseases. \nCounty public health departments rely on this fund to serve their \nconstituents, and I know my home State of California has received over \n$195 million thus far.\n  Despite all this, the Republican leadership has decided to take \napproximately $8.85 billion from the fund which actually helps lower \nthe cost of health care through prevention, eliminating the need, \nironically, for IPAB in the first place.\n  In closing, I again want to thank Congressman Roe and the 235 \nbipartisan cosponsors for their hard work. I am disappointed that I \nmust vote against my own bill, because I know the underlying policy is \ngood policy, but I cannot vote for something that drains an essential \nfund from the ACA.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time \nallotment remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Wisconsin has 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Michigan has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio \n(Mr. Wenstrup).\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, let me take a couple of minutes to explain \nwhy Americans fear the Independent Payment Advisory Board, as it \nmeddles with their health care.\n  As I stand here today, I will tell you that I am a physician, and I \ncan tell you what is already taking place within private insurance with \nthese peer reviews when you recommend something.\n  I recommended an MRI to a patient. That afternoon, I get on the \nphone. The woman says: I have had a problem for 10 years. I have had \ncortisone injections, physical therapy, blah, blah, blah.\n  I said: You need an MRI.\n  I am being denied the MRI by the insurance company because I have \nonly seen her once. And I said to the gentleman, the doctor on the \nphone: How many times have you seen her?\n  None.\n  I said: What State do you have a license to practice in?\n  Not Ohio, which is where we were.\n  And so I said: Tell me your specialty.\n  My specialty is foot and ankle. This woman was in for a foot problem.\n  He said: I am an emergency room doctor.\n  I said: Well, then you would refer her to a specialist, which is \nwhere she is today.\n  He said: Well, I am not going to let you get that MRI.\n  I said: I hope this call is monitored for quality assurance, because \nI want someone to hear what you said to me today.\n\n[[Page H4532]]\n\n  And then I asked the patient if she would go to her HR director and \ncall the insurance company and say: We are going to drop the insurance \nbecause you are not letting the patients get the care their doctor \nrecommends.\n  And then we got it. Within 3 weeks, I had her better because I knew \nwhat was wrong once I had the MRI.\n  Imagine trying to have that type of a discussion with the Independent \nPayment Advisory Board. If they pick up their phone, will they have a \nconversation with you about the patient?\n  This is a problem. This is what Americans are fearing today. And this \nis why the Independent Payment Advisory Board should go away.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. It is a great bill. We should pass it. IPAB is \na bad agency. It should not have been created in the first place.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1190, the Protecting \nSeniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today repeals the Independent Payment \nAdvisory Board, IPAB, one of the most ominous provisions in the \nsweeping overhaul of health care known as the Affordable Care Act.\n  The stated purpose of IPAB is to reduce Medicare's per capita growth \nrate. The Board is to be made up of 15 unelected, unaccountable \nbureaucrats--by the way, you can't have a majority of docs on the \nBoard--who will be paid $165,300 a year to serve 6-year terms on the \nBoard.\n  This panel of 15 unelected and unaccountable government bureaucrats \nis tasked with reducing Medicare costs through arbitrary cuts to \nproviders, limiting access to care for seniors. If Medicare growth goes \nover an arbitrary target, the Board is required to submit a proposal to \nCongress that would reduce Medicare's growth rate.\n  These recommendations will automatically go into effect, unless \nCongress passes legislation that would achieve the same amount of \nsavings. In order to do so, Congress must meet an almost impossible \ndeadline and clear an almost insurmountable legislative hurdle.\n  The Board has the power to make binding decisions about Medicare \npolicy, with no requirement for public comment prior to issuing its \nrecommendations, and individuals and providers will have no recourse \nagainst the Board because its decisions cannot be appealed or reviewed. \nIn other words, the Board will make major healthcare legislation \nessentially outside the usual legislative process.\n  The Board is also limited in how it can achieve the required savings. \nTherefore, IPAB's recommendations will be restricted to cutting \nprovider reimbursements. In many cases, Medicare already reimburses \nbelow the costs of providing services; and we are already seeing \ndoctors refusing to take new Medicare patients--or Medicare patients at \nall--because they cannot afford to absorb the losses.\n  Any additional provider cuts will lead to fewer Medicare providers, \nand that means that beneficiary access will suffer. Seniors will be \nforced to wait in longer and longer lines to be seen by an ever-\nshrinking pool of providers or have to travel longer and longer \ndistances to find a provider willing to see them.\n  Clearly, Medicare growth is on an out-of-control trajectory that \nendangers the solvency and continued existence of the program. IPAB, \nhowever, is not the solution.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House voted 223-181 in 2012 to repeal the \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board. Today, H.R. 1190, Protecting \nSeniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2015, enjoys the support of 235 of \nour House colleagues who have signed on as cosponsors.\n  The time has come for the House to once again repeal this flawed \npolicy, and I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1190.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1190. This bill would \nrepeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, and pay for it \nby drastically reducing our investment in prevention and public health.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do not support IPAB. I oppose independent commissions \nplaying a legislative role other than on the recommendatory basis. It \nis not the job of an independent commission to make decisions on \nhealthcare policy for Medicare beneficiaries. Congress simply must stop \nceding legislative power to outside bodies.\n  However, IPAB remains an insignificant provision from the Affordable \nCare Act, as it has not even been convened. Because of how well other \nprovisions of the ACA are working, Medicare cost growth rates are \nprojected to remain beneath IPAB targets through the entire budget \nwindow, thereby not triggering the IPAB provisions until 2024 at the \nearliest.\n  That said, I urge this House to oppose H.R. 1190, which would pay for \nIPAB repeal by effectively gutting the Affordable Care Act's prevention \nand public health fund, an incredibly significant provision from the \nACA.\n  The prevention and public health fund is a mechanism to provide \nexpanded and sustained national investments in prevention and public \nhealth, to improve health outcomes, and to enhance healthcare quality. \nThe fund has worked to reduce tobacco use, promote community prevention \nand use of preventive services, and combat healthcare associated \ninfections.\n  This year the fund will invest nearly $1 billion in programs that \nwill benefit every State, and these dollars go to proven, effective \nways to keep Americans healthier and more productive.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, we have received more than $47.5 \nmillion for prevention and public health fund programs. This bill would \nwalk back these and other important strides we have made in public \nhealth and prevention.\n  This bill is yet another Republican attempt to attack and undermine \nthe Affordable Care Act. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Sarbanes) manage the remainder of the Committee on Energy \nand Commerce time on the Democratic side.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jody B. Hice of Georgia). Is there \nobjection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I am pleased to yield such time \nas he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a \nvalued member of our Health Subcommittee.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1190, the \nProtecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act.\n  The President's healthcare law included the creation of the \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB. Despite its name, IPAB is \nthe opposite of independent, Mr. Speaker. IPAB is a group of 15 \nunelected members, unaccountable to the American people. IPAB's job is \nto control Medicare spending. That sounds nice, but they only have one \nway to do that, by cutting reimbursement rates for doctors and \nhospitals.\n\n  Seniors rely on Medicare, as well as the doctors who will see them. \nIf this unelected, unaccountable Board cuts reimbursement rates, \ndoctors will stop seeing Medicare patients. That is bad for the 180,000 \nseniors in my district.\n  Support this bill, and let's abolish IPAB. I look forward to a \nbipartisan vote in support of H.R. 1190.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to this legislation, H.R. \n1190, for reasons that I will detail in a moment.\n  At this time, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the minority whip.\n  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. HOYER. The gentleman indicated there were 235 people for this \nbill in this House. I just observed a few minutes ago there are 240 \npeople for Export-Import Bank. We have brought this bill to the floor. \nI would hope the gentleman would urge his side, when 60 of his folks \nare for it, all of ours are for it, to bring the Export-Import Bank to \nthe floor because it is about jobs.\n  Having said that--and I want to acknowledge that I am a good friend \nand\n\n[[Page H4533]]\n\nhave great respect for the sponsor of this bill, Dr. Roe. He and I have \nworked together on anaphylactic shock and the dangers caused by the \neating of peanuts. He is a good doctor. He is a good person.\n  We happen to disagree on this bill, however. This, essentially, will \nbe the 60th vote, over the next 2 days, 4 days, on the repeal of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  We obviously have a difference of opinion on the Affordable Care Act. \nI believe it is working. I believe that millions of people are covered \nby insurance. Because of the Affordable Care Act, millions of children \nare covered under their parents' policy, and millions of seniors are \npaying less for prescription drugs. Millions of people with a \npreexisting condition have the confidence that they can get insurance.\n  The bill we are debating today and voting on next week would repeal \nthe Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, as it is referred to.\n  Now, I was disappointed at the reference of ``bureaucrats.'' It is \nused as an epithet, unfortunately, not as a descriptive term.\n  The fact of the matter is these folks are appointed and they make \nrecommendations. They make recommendations to the Congress of the \nUnited States, and the Congress of the United States can reject them; \nand/or the President of the United States, if the Congress passes \nlegislation to set that aside, can consider it as well.\n  IPAB develops proposals to contain the rate of growth of Medicare \nspending. The Board hasn't been formed. There are no members appointed \nyet; yet Republicans are asking taxpayers to spend $7-plus billion over \nthe next 10 years to eliminate it. It is not that it has acted badly. \nIt is not that they are irresponsible. There are no people appointed to \nthis Board yet.\n  The Affordable Care Act has slowed the growth of healthcare costs to \nits lowest rate in 50 years. That helps every American, whether they \nare covered by the Affordable Care Act or private employer insurance or \nself-insured.\n  As a result, CBO predicts that action by the Board would not even be \ntriggered until 2024, but the cuts to the prevention fund would act \nnow. Republicans are paying for this bill by cutting funding for \ndisease prevention and public health now. Even then, CBO reports that \nthis bill still bends the healthcare cost curve in the wrong direction \nover the long run.\n  Today, as has been observed, we passed another bill. That one was \nwithout offsets. That will create an additional $24 billion deficit.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House has a choice. It can continue the same old \npartisan attacks against affordable health care and add billions to the \ndeficit, undermine prevention and public health, bringing deficit-\nfinanced tax cuts passed by this Republican-led Congress up to $610.7 \nbillion since January.\n  Somebody is going to pay that bill because we are not. My generation \nis not being asked to pay for it, $610.7 billion.\n  It could reject, of course, the politics as usual and, instead, work \ntogether in a bipartisan way to focus on creating jobs, lowering the \ndeficit, and investing in a competitive economy.\n  You heard the sponsor of this bill saying, I cannot support it, the \ngentlewoman from California, because the proponents of this bill would \nrather attack the Affordable Care Act than they would to pass this \nbill.\n  Now, they want to pass this bill, but their priority is undermining \nthe Affordable Care Act, which is why they didn't work with \nCongresswoman Sanchez and others who agree with them on the policy. I \nhave to disagree with them on the policy; but they have even put people \nwho agree with them in a place where they cannot support the \nundermining of the Affordable Care Act and preventive health in \nAmerica.\n  Let's choose to work together to do what American people are asking \nus to do, not undermine the critical healthcare reforms that are \ncontaining costs, increasing access, and improving quality.\n  That is why I opposed the medical device tax bill, and that is why I \nam urging my colleagues to defeat this one as well.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I would say to the distinguished minority \nwhip, I do support Ex-Im Bank and urge my leaders to act on it. We are \ntogether on support of that.\n  Let me just mention a few things to correct the record. Number one, \nwe had Secretary Burwell before the committee earlier this year and Dr. \nLarry Bucshon, on our Health Subcommittee, asked her specifically, when \nthe IPAB cuts would begin to take effect. She said in 2019. In fact, \nthe President's own budget request would begin the cuts of IPAB in \n2019.\n  Now, you don't have to have the members of the IPAB appointed in \norder to have the cuts. The law, IPAB, designates the Secretary of HHS \nwith the authority to make those cuts. To overcome those cuts, you \nreally have to have two-thirds votes in the House and the Senate, with \ncommensurate cuts from somewhere else in Medicare to replace those cuts \nthat you are overcoming.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  So this is a Board that has tremendous power that will deal with \nprovider payments and cuts.\n  We just dealt with the SGR, the sustainable growth rate, in a \nbipartisan manner. We acted to repeal the sustainable growth rate that \nrequired cuts to provider payments for seniors, and it was supported \noverwhelmingly.\n  But if you liked the SGR, you will love IPAB. This is the SGR on \nsteroids. It will be very difficult to overcome these 15 unelected \nbureaucrats, experts, whatever you want to call them--it can't be a \nmajority of docs, by the way--or the Secretary, whoever makes the \nrecommendations.\n  We use the prevention fund as a pay-for, taking funds from the \nprevention fund until 2025 to reach the $7.1 billion. But this \nprevention fund gets $2 billion every year, beginning this year and \nevery year ad infinitum. So $2 billion in 2015, 2016, '17, '18, '19, \n'20, '21, '30, '31, '40, '41. Every year, the Secretary gets $2 billion \nto use at her sole discretion. She doesn't have to use it for public \nhealth purposes. She has sole discretion on how this money is used.\n  Would you like to know some of the things she has used the money for \nso far?\n  Well, $450 million was used for the Navigator program and \nimplementing the Affordable Care Act; $400,000 has been used for \npickle-ball; $235,000 for massage therapy, kick boxing, and Zumba \nclasses, whatever that is; $7.5 million on promoting free pet \nneutering; $3 million for the New York Department of Health to lobby \nfor the passage of a soda tax; money for gardening projects, fast food, \nsmall businesses, bike clubs.\n  Rather than spend money on questionable projects, lobbying campaigns \nfor higher taxes, and for Affordable Care Act media campaigns, H.R. \n1190 would rather use these funds to protect Medicare seniors and their \nhealth care because the money for the operation of IPAB, for these \nsalaries, for their travel, for all their expenses comes directly out \nof the trust fund moneys for seniors, used for seniors and those with \ndisabilities. That is wrong.\n  We are constraining. We are not repealing the prevention fund to pay \nfor this, but we need to constrain the use of that fund. And good \npublic health policy ought to come before the Congress, not be at the \nsole discretion of this one Secretary or czar or however you might want \nto term it.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak in favor of this legislation, \nH.R. 1190, and I urge the Members to support it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I oppose H.R. 1190.\n  If the Republican appetite for the repeal of the Independent Payment \nAdvisory Board was based solely on its merits, I might be a little bit \nmore charitable about their bringing this bill to the floor because, as \nyou have seen from the speakers on our side, there is a legitimate \ndebate on the merits. I have some concerns myself about the IPAB. But, \nunfortunately, I think that where this is coming from is this impulse, \nthis kind of ceaseless impulse to undermine and dismantle the \nAffordable Care Act, and the evidence of that is in the pay-for.\n  Why would you want to go undermine the public health portion, really, \na significant commitment that was made through the ACA to begin to turn \nour healthcare system towards prevention, towards public health? \nFrankly,\n\n[[Page H4534]]\n\nwe need as many resources as we can muster to put behind that. And the \npay-for for this repeal would take $8.85 billion that has been set \naside for the prevention and public health fund away from that fund and \nundermine all of the various activities that are being funded by it.\n  I don't know why it is that our colleagues on the other side cannot \nrestrain themselves when it comes to this shiny object of repealing the \nACA when we now have plenty of evidence at our fingertips as to the \npositive impact that the Affordable Care Act is having: 3 million young \npeople who now can stay on the health insurance coverage of their \nparents, who were not covered before; millions more that are benefiting \nfrom the health exchanges across the country; seniors who now have less \nanxiety about falling into the so-called doughnut hole under the part D \nprescription drug benefit program because, under the ACA, we are \nbeginning to close that doughnut hole; insurance companies now being \nbarred from discriminating against people based on a preexisting \ncondition; preventive care screening for our seniors under the Medicare \nprogram; tests and other screenings that they used to have to come out \nof pocket for, now that is completely covered as a result of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  You ask the average person out there about any of those things I just \nmentioned, and they say: Why would we want to give these up?\n  These are important to our health, important to the strength of our \nfamilies and our community. Yet our colleagues just don't seem to be \nable to help themselves when it comes to wanting to attack the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Furthermore, if you view this IPAB as an important mechanism in terms \nof controlling costs, as has already been said, the trigger mechanism \nwould not kick in for a number of years here anyway. In other words, \nthe costs are being controlled currently. So that basis for sort of the \nurgency of it now in terms of bringing these other pay-fors into the \nmix doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\n  Let's acknowledge that one of the reasons that that trigger isn't \ngoing to come any time soon is because, again, the Affordable Care Act \nis working when it comes to controlling costs. So that is the other \nside of the discussion. The Affordable Care Act is working in terms of \nproviding more coverage and improving treatment and management of \nchronic care on the one hand, and the evidence is that it is also \nreducing cost on the other hand. So it makes sense to try to preserve \nthat, and I think the public health fund and prevention fund is a \ncritical piece.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation for the reasons \nenumerated.\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PITTS. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I just want to read into the Record, so that we have this \ninformation, a couple of observations from some of the groups out there \nthat are most engaged in prevention and public health across the \ncountry and the perspective that they bring in terms of this offset, of \nundermining and depleting the prevention and public health fund.\n  The American Lung Association said, using money from the prevention \nfund as a pay-for would have a devastating effect on our Nation's \npublic health.\n  The American Heart Association: Cardiovascular disease is a leading \ncause of death in the United States and is our most costly disease. The \nfund supports evidence-based initiatives like WISEWOMAN, a preventive \nhealth services program that provides lifestyle programs and health \ncounseling that help low-income, uninsured, and underinsured women ages \n40 to 54 prevent, delay, or control heart disease and stroke.\n  The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network observes that the \nnational breast and cervical cancer early detection program is funded \nin 31 States through the fund.\n  And there are others that have observed--the March of Dimes, the \nCampaign for Tobacco-Free Kids--that it doesn't make any sense to go \nraid the prevention and public health fund to support this repeal of \nthe IPAB.\n  For those reasons and the others that have been presented here today, \nI urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 1190.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  While the programs enumerated by the gentleman from Maryland are \nlaudable, there is nothing in the prevention and public health fund \nthat guarantees that these will be funded or that they are priorities. \nIt is at the sole discretion of the Secretary as to what she would \nallocate the funds for. And rightly, these kinds of funds should come \nbefore Congress, and Congress should approve these kinds of public \nhealth funds.\n  I might mention that CBO estimates that H.R. 1190, the Protecting \nSeniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2015, as amended, would have no \nbudgetary effect on fiscal years 2015-16. It would reduce direct \nspending by $1.8 billion over the 2016-2020 period, and reduce the \ndirect spending by $45 million over the 2016-25 period.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support H.R. 1190, the \nProtecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act, and repealing IPAB.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly rise in opposition to the \nProtecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act. It was critical that the \nAffordable Care Act (ACA) included the cutting edge delivery and \npayment reforms that it did. But, I have never believed that the \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) will be effectively able to \nfulfill its stated mission of cost containment. I have concerns with \nhow IPAB will operate and that it gives up important Congressional \nauthority over payment.\n  For these reasons, I am a proud cosponsor of this bill, but once \nagain, the House Republican majority has decided to kill the \nbipartisanship of this bill with a controversial pay-for. My Republican \ncolleagues continue to prove that they would rather have an anti-ACA \ntalking point rather than a real solution.\n  Since the Affordable Care Act became law, my home state of New Jersey \nhas received more than $20 million for evidence-based programs to \nprevent heart attacks, strokes, cancer, obesity, and smoking from the \nACA's Prevention and Public Health Fund. This bill, as it is being \nconsidered today, would completely gut this fund by cutting $8.8 \nbillion--nearly $2 billion more than is needed to pay for repealing \nIPAB.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to work with Democrats \nto find an agreeable way to pay for this bill, and I urge opposition to \nthis bill in its current form.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. \n1190, the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act.\n  While I support repealing the Independent Payment Advisory Board \n(IPAB), I oppose offsetting the cost of repeal with funds from the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund.\n  The Prevention and Public Health Fund is the nation's single largest \ninvestment in prevention programs. Established under the Affordable \nCare Act, the Fund represents an unprecedented investment in preventing \ndisease, promoting wellness, and protecting our communities against \npublic health emergencies.\n  Since its creation, the Fund has invested in a broad range of \nevidence-based initiatives. These include community prevention \nprograms, research, surveillance and tracking efforts, increased access \nto immunizations, and tobacco prevention programs.\n  Much of this work is done through partnerships with state and local \ngovernments, which leverage Prevention Fund dollars to best meet the \nlocal need. These monies have been used for important work, such as \ncontrolling the obesity epidemic, detecting and responding to \noutbreaks, and reducing health disparities.\n  Congress has a distinct responsibility to formulate and fund programs \nand initiatives that promote public health and wellness. The Prevention \nand Public Health Fund is one means by which Congress fulfils this \nobligation.\n  While I opposed the creation of the IPAB and support its repeal, \ngutting the Fund would be a significant step backwards on the path \ntowards improving our nation's health. Rescinding $8.85 billion to \noffset the costs of H.R. 1190 will have a devastating effect on our \nnation's health. It is not an acceptable trade off.\n  We spend billions of dollars on treating disease once people become \nsick. This investment in prevention is a key component of efforts to \nimprove health and bend the health care cost curve. Using this money to \npay for other priorities will only damage the long-term health of our \nnation.\n  I urge my colleagues to protect the federal government's only \ndedicated investment in prevention and vote against H.R. 1190.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1190, the \nProtecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2015, which repeals the \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), that was established under \nthe ACA in response to high rates of growth in Medicare expenditures \nand charged with developing proposals to ``reduce the per capita rate \nof growth in Medicare spending.''\n\n[[Page H4535]]\n\n  I oppose this bill strongly because by repealing IPAB before it has a \nchance to work, the bill would eliminate an important safeguard that \nwill help reduce the rate of Medicare cost growth responsibly while \nprotecting Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1190 is nothing but another attempt, in a long line \nof House Republican efforts to undermine both the Medicare guarantee \nand the Affordable Care Act.\n  Repealing IPAB cost over $7 billion during the course of a ten year \nperiod according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\n  Republicans have chosen to pay for the cost of this repeal with cuts \nto the ACA's Prevention and Public Health Fund.\n  This fund has invested nearly $5.25 billion into programs that \nsupport a number of public health initiatives, including obesity \nprevention and childhood immunization.\n  It has been used to increase awareness of and access to preventive \nhealth services and reduce tobacco use--concentrating on the causes of \nchronic disease to help more Americans stay healthy.\n  Eliminating these funds in the name of damaging the sustainability of \nMedicare is a two-pronged attack on our nation's public health.\n  After more than five years under the Affordable Care Act, 16.4 \nmillion Americans have gained health coverage; up to 129 million people \nwho could have otherwise been denied or faced discrimination now have \naccess to coverage.\n  Mr. Speaker, given the real challenges facing our nation, it is \nirresponsible for the Republican majority to continue bringing to the \nfloor bills that have no chance of becoming law and would harm millions \nof Americans if they were to be enacted.\n  House Republicans have tried 58 times to undermine the Affordable \nCare Act, which has enabled more than 16 million previously uninsured \nAmericans to know the peace of mind that comes from having access to \naffordable, accessible, high quality health care.\n  Their record to date is 0-58; it will soon be 0-59 because the \nPresident has announced that he will veto this bill if it makes it to \nhis desk.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to look at the facts before \nprematurely repealing sections of the ACA that have significant \nnegative impacts on Americans currently insured.\n  The Independent Payment Advisory Board recommends to Congress \npolicies that reduce the rate of Medicare growth and help Medicare \nprovide better care at lower costs.\n  IPAB has been highlighted by the non-partisan CBO, economists, and \nhealth policy experts as contributing to Medicare's long-term \nsustainability.\n  The Board is already prohibited from recommending changes to Medicare \nthat ration health care, restrict benefits, modify eligibility, \nincrease cost sharing, or raise premiums or revenues.\n  Under current law, the Congress retains the authority to modify, \nreject, or enhance IPAB recommendations to strengthen Medicare, and \nIPAB recommendations would take effect only if the Congress does not \nact to slow Medicare cost growth.\n  Despite the Supreme Court's upholding of the law's constitutionality, \nthe reelection of President Obama, and Speaker John Boehner's \ndeclaration that: ``Obamacare is the law of the land,'' Republicans \nrefuse to stop wasting time and taxpayer money in their effort to take \naway the patient protections and benefits of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that we stop wasting our time in taking away \nhealthcare protections and benefits and work to ensure that we support \nthe current law.\n  A law that is providing access to an industry once denied to so many \nAmericans and now supports millions.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against H.R. 1190.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 319, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill, as amended.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, Maine is home to the most skilled \nwoodworkers on Earth, but ObamaCare's medical device tax is killing our \njobs.\n  Hardwood Products and Puritan companies in Guilford have been family-\nrun businesses for nearly 100 years. 450 hard-working Mainers produce \n3.5 million popsicle sticks per day. The company also manufactures more \ntongue depressors and medical swabs than any other business in the \nWestern Hemisphere. Its only competitor is located in China.\n  Puritan Company pays nearly $250,000 per year in medical device tax. \nAs a result, they can't afford to buy new equipment to manufacture new \nmedical products or hire more workers.\n  It is not right for this ObamaCare tax to export our manufacturing \njobs to China. It is not right for this punitive tax to smother \ninnovation that helps Americans enjoy longer and healthier lives.\n  Today, let's all band together, Republicans and Democrats here in the \nHouse, to deep-six this horrible tax.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4535-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1400\n           COMMEMORATING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF JUNETEENTH\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1190, the \nProtecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act, which repeals ObamaCare's \narbitrary Independent Payment Advisory Board, known as IPAB.\n  One of the most concerning and equally troubling aspects of ObamaCare \nis its unprecedented shift of power to Washington bureaucrats. The \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board is no exception to that. Entrusting \n15 unelected bureaucrats with across-the-board power to reduce Medicare \nspending and decide which treatments are determined necessary only \nserves to jeopardize access to quality care for our seniors.\n  We know by now that one-size-fits-all solutions coming from D.C. will \nnot fix our healthcare system. Instead, we should focus on advancing \nwell thought-out, long-term solutions to make Medicare more sustainable \nso we can protect access to care now and for future generations.\n  This bill brings us one step closer to getting Washington out of the \nway and putting Americans back in charge of their healthcare decisions.\n\n[[Page H4536]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4536-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            DACA ANNIVERSARY\n\n  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, this week we marked 3 years since President \nObama created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. He \ndid this in response to Congress' failure to pass the DREAM Act and \nhelp children of undocumented immigrants stay here and help build a \nbetter future for America.\n  For children who probably know no language other than English and \nknow no country other than America, for many of these immigrants \nbrought here as children through no fault of their own, America is the \nonly home they have ever known. They love this country, and they \ndeserve a chance to stay and contribute to our Nation's future.\n  President Obama announced an expanded DACA last year, along with the \nprogram that deals with parents of such children to help the immigrant \nparents of American citizens and legal residents. Unfortunately, a \npartisan lawsuit has held up their implementation, and Republicans have \nnow voted three times to end this opportunity for children of \nimmigrants. They would split families apart.\n  If my Republican friends wish to change our immigration policies, \nthey have a perfect vehicle, Mr. Speaker, for doing so: a comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill supported, in my opinion, by a majority of the \nHouse of Representatives. Let's bring such a bill to the floor so that \nwe can fix our broken immigration system and create a pathway to \ncitizenship for these DREAMers and others who have been living and \nworking here for almost all their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4536-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4536-H4537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OUR DOCUMENTS OF FREEDOM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, quite often, as others have already done \ntoday, when I have come before this body, it has been to recognize \nsomeone who has done something significant in my district or to speak \nabout a bill, whether I was for it or against it, or a piece of policy \nor an issue. But today I don't have pre-prepared remarks. I just wanted \nto remind those of us who are here of why we are here. Why do we attend \nsessions here in this body day in and day out? What is the purpose for \nour being here?\n  Before I begin remarks, Mr. Speaker, I would like to personally \nextend my thoughts and prayers on behalf of myself and my family, as \nwell as those of the 11th Congressional District in Georgia, to those \nvictims of the horrific attack that happened last evening in \nCharleston, South Carolina.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am a member of the Committee on Homeland Security as \nwell as the special task force on foreign fighters, and as part of \nthat, we spend a lot of time studying terrorism and the terrorist \nattacks against this Nation. One thing that I have seen that is \nconsistent about these terrorist attacks is that they are attacking us \nnot because of who we are. Most of them don't even know our names. They \nmay not know our families or what we believe, and it may well be the \ncase in Charleston, as I know it was in Garland, Texas, in the attacks \nthere, they didn't even know their victims. But what I have seen with \nthese attacks of terrorism is they are attacks about what we stand for, \nand that is freedom.\n  In Garland, Texas, it was an attack on the First Amendment, our \nfreedom of speech. Last night, it was an attack on the most fundamental \nright that our Founding Fathers gave to us, and that is our freedom of \nreligion, a right that, as they said, was given to us by God and cannot \nbe taken away.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity since being in Congress a \nshort amount of time--and it is more than an opportunity, it is really \na privilege--to take constituents as they come to the Capitol here on \ntours. As I walk down the Halls of this building and I point out the \nstatue of Thomas Jefferson that we have right outside the Chamber, or \neven as I stand here, the image of Moses is looking at me as he is \nlooking over the Chamber, as I see the statues of our Founding Fathers, \nthey have left us reminders of why we are here.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we are getting close to the great anniversary \nfestival of the birth of this Nation, I think it is imperative and \nimportant that we as a body are reminded of why we are here. I just \nwant to speak briefly about two phrases that you can find in \nWashington, D.C., that remind us not only of why we are here, but what \nit takes to preserve the freedom that we have been given.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I walked down the aisle to come to this podium, I \njust glanced up above the rostrum where you are standing, and I see \nfour words, ``In God We Trust.'' That is one of the phrases that my \neyes often go to as I am sitting in this Chamber as we are debating \nbills. I reflect back on why do we have that phrase here?\n  Well, it also goes back to another phrase that I have seen recently \nas I was taking a tour of The Mall outside this building, where we have \nthe museums of the heritage of this Nation. There is also a building \nthere, the National Archives. Inside that building are the documents of \nfreedom, the most hallowed of all of our documents: the Constitution; \nthe Bill of Rights; and then the one that we hold the most sacred, the \none that is most requested by visitors to this Nation's Capital to see, \nand that is the Declaration of Independence.\n  In that Declaration, our Founding Fathers expressed what they \nbelieved that this Nation would be one day. It was their vision, it was \ntheir faith, and it was their philosophy about this new Nation. They \nwere revolutionary ideas that they brought forth because it was the \nfirst time in the history of mankind that a government existed with \nemphasis on the freedom of individual, empowering the individual. Every \nother government on the face of the Earth before this had focused its \nattention upon a group, a collective, whether it was by their race or \ntheir religion or aristocracy or their family line. But our Founding \nFathers sensed something different: if we empower the individual, if we \nrecognize the rights that God has given them and we give them the \nfreedom to excel and exceed, then our Nation, as a whole, would excel.\n  They believed that these rights were important to be protected: the \nright to speak freely, the right to have ideas, the right to pursue \nhappiness, the right to pursue commerce, and the right to worship \nwithout fear of oppression from the government. These were \nrevolutionary ideas.\n  They also knew that they had a challenge. Because of these \nrevolutionary ideas, they knew that they would not be well accepted by \nother governments because it threatened the power base of those \ngovernments. In fact, they knew they would have to take on the most \npowerful military force in the history of the entire world if they were \never going to see these ideas come to fruition.\n  Now, think about that. This ragtag rabble of Washington's soldiers \nwould have to take on the most powerful military force in the history \nof the world. It was an impossible task, and they understood that. But, \nMr. Speaker, that phrase that is in marble above the rostrum reflects \none of those two key phrases, because in the last line of the \nDeclaration of Independence, our Founding Fathers wrote these words: \n``And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm Reliance on the \nProtection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our \nLives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.''\n  You see, ``In God We Trust'' was the first element that they \nidentified that we must have if we were going to preserve this freedom \nthat they were fighting for.\n  Now, outside the National Archives, where that Declaration is still \non display, are the words, ``Eternal vigilance is the price of \nfreedom.''\n\n  ``Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom.''\n  You see, that is the second phrase that I think we must be reminded \nof today. The second part of that last line of the Declaration of \nIndependence says, ``we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our \nFortunes, and our sacred Honor.'' You see, freedom is not free, and it \nis held and it is protected at a price.\n  Just recently, I was given the opportunity to travel to the beaches \nof Normandy. As I stood upon the sands of\n\n[[Page H4537]]\n\nOmaha Beach, I started reflecting upon the price that was paid that day \nfor our freedom and our liberty. I brought back a little bit of the \nsand from the beach, as my dad was in World War II and served in that \ntheater. And as I sat at home right around Memorial Day, I was looking \nat that jar of sand, and I started thinking: What if these sands could \nspeak? What would they say? What would they tell us in this august body \nhere? What would they tell the people of our Nation if that sand could \nspeak?\n  You see, that sand absorbed the blood of American patriots who had \nthe courage to step off of those Higgins boats into the line of fire, \nand I wondered why would they do that, knowing that more than likely \nthey would never return back home. You see, that sand absorbed the \nblood of these patriots.\n  The sand also may be able to tell us of the last words that were \nspoken by some of those patriots as they drew their last breath after \ngiving their lives, their very lives, for our freedom. Would they tell \nthe name of the father or mother as they cried out their last cry of \nhope?\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Would they tell the name of a sweetheart which they will never \nembrace or a brother or a sister or a child that they will never see?\n  As I started thinking about it, I started realizing that sand held \nthe DNA of these soldiers--not just DNA of the soldiers, but the DNA of \nour entire Nation.\n  I believe today, Mr. Speaker, that, if that sand could tell us \nanything today in this body, it is to remember what they died for.\n  I believe, if that sand could speak today, that sand would tell us \nthese words: this is why we died, because we hold these truths to be \nself-evident, that all men are created equal and they are endowed by \ntheir Creator with certain inalienable rights; that amongst these are \nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to ensure these \nrights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just \npowers from the consent of the governed.\n  As we are nearing that celebration--we celebrate 239 years of the \nbirth of this Nation--I call upon the Members of this body to once \nagain reflect on why we are here, and that is to preserve freedom.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to speak.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4537-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4537-H4538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ISIS CRISIS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Newhouse). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOklahoma (Mr. Russell) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, in the last couple of weeks, America has \nasked what is our strategy to defeat ISIS and what is the President's \nplan to prevent the spread of barbarism in Syria and Iraq?\n  For all of our advancement in self-governance, the rule of law, and a \nbetterment of people's lives, the world stands in shock at beheadings, \nimmolations, crucifixions, sexual enslavement, and human suffering as a \nway of governance could exist on earth today.\n  As the world has watched in horror, it has also looked to America. \nWhere America leads, nations stand shoulder to shoulder; where America \nis absent, tyranny takes its chances and rears its ugly head--but who \nwould have thought barbarity would emerge?\n  Since last year, the President has been unable to articulate his \nstrategy to aid our ally in Iraq to combat ISIS. As a combat veteran of \nIraq that has had to watch my American and Iraqi friends die, that has \nhad to handle the flesh and blood of battle, that has had to do \nterrible things to destroy enemies, that has had to watch the good \npeople of Iraq suffer in absence of effective government, this is \ndeeply personal.\n  It is personal because I have lived among the Sunni Arab. I have \ncelebrated his victories, his wedding, his birthdays, and his \naccomplishments. I have mourned as close Iraqi friends have died to \nacts of terror and mourned when Iraq's educated, intelligent, and free \npeople have been expunged.\n  The President's refusal to negotiate a status of forces agreement and \ndecision to abandon Iraq in 2012 is largely responsible and aided ISIS' \npath to destruction in that country.\n  We soldiers and servicemembers who have sacrificed so much in Iraq \nweep. We defeated Saddam's army, toppled the Ba'athist government, \ncaptured and brought a world tyrant to justice, fought an insurgency, \nand stood shoulder to shoulder with disenfranchised Sunnis and Kurds to \nrestore control to Iraq's Government. We turned the country around with \na military pause.\n  The President used that pause for abandonment and political \nexpediency; where we sacrificed, he quit. I speak for so many of the \nIraq veterans when I say: Mr. President, you have hurt us deeply. You \nhave torn a hole within us. We are at a loss to see the state of Iraq \ntoday.\n  Now, as we ask what can be done, we see a strategy offered by this \nadministration. I heard it yesterday in the House Armed Services \nCommittee when Secretary of Defense Carter and Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs Dempsey attempted to articulate it. I left more confused than \nwhen I entered.\n  The President is offering a plan without vision or conviction. \nIndeed, Secretary Carter could not even name it, calling it the so-\ncalled nine-line strategy. So-called? Do we not even have enough \nconviction to call the strategy some name? Is it our strategy or not? \nAre we so unsure of it that we do not even know what to call it? Then \nwe were informed of the ``lily pad strategy.'' I suppose that is the \none that makes us look like a bunch of toads.\n  The nine lines, if we decide to actually call it that, this strategy, \nwhen taken together, is mostly passive and defensive. In my 21 years of \nmilitary infantry service, I have never seen enemies defeated by \ndefense.\n  While passive measures are important, they are only complementary. \nThe President is looking for nations in the Middle East to lead. Middle \nEastern countries are looking to the United States for leadership. We \ncannot approach this problem like pushing a strand of wet spaghetti. \nGrab it by the front, and it will go where you want it to go.\n\n  If Iraq and Syria were a crime-ridden neighborhood, this nine-line \nstrategy would be like relying on neighborhood watches to physically \nfight criminals and restore leadership of the town. The mayor and \npolice would then tell them, Well, if you clean up your neighborhood, \nthen we will come and provide the protection that you require--if only \nlife worked that way.\n  The military can provide pauses, but we cannot provide an Iraqi \ncollapse when the President pulls out all the protection necessary to \nsustain a nascent government. If the United States is not committed \nwith a diplomatic, economic, and informational solution, all the \nheroics exerted by our men and women in uniform to provide a window \nwill be squandered once again if we abandon our gains.\n  Secretary Carter and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dempsey spoke of \ntrying to find people willing to fight in Iraq. There are plenty of \nthem. The problem is they are Sunni Arabs and Kurds. They do not wish \nto live under ISIS; yet we will not organize them into a Sunni-Arab and \nSunni-Kurd federation that would actually stand a chance of success and \nwould be a deadly blow to the objectives of ISIS.\n  They want to govern themselves because Baghdad cannot include them. \nThey do not wish to live under ISIS' barbarity, and we should embrace \nthem.\n  In the interim, what can be done that is not passive? How about some \nof this? Cripple Raqqa. This town, it is clear, is the center of ISIS \npower. The President's Cabinet says: We are worried about collateral \ndamage and civilian casualties.\n  News flash, the most humane thing we can do to end the suffering of \nhundreds of thousands of people is cripple what ISIS draws its strength \nfrom; destroy their infrastructure, hammer the electricity capacity of \nthat city, destroy the bridges on their roads of ingress and egress, \ntake away the oil refining installations that they possess and use to \nfund themselves with millions of dollars of illegal cash.\n  We have the ability to rebuild those later, but ISIS would be \ndiminished deeply by their loss. The most humane thing we can do to \nprotect civilians is defeat the barbarians, causing their\n\n[[Page H4538]]\n\nsuffering. That is true humanity. If the United States leads, others \nwill stand shoulder to shoulder. Mr. President, we need you to lead.\n  We hear talk about countermessaging. Well, here is something every \nAmerican can help with. News stations, stop putting ISIS recruiting \nvideos as B-roll on your newscasts. Replace it with crosshairs and \nexplosions of their defeat, or show the world their acts of barbarity, \ninstead, for the B-roll. Stop using their images and their propaganda \nfor furthering American newscasts. Americans, write your local news \nstations and tell them to stop it.\n  Iran, here is the cold reality and its impact on ISIS and Middle East \nunrest. Lifting sanctions on Iran will introduce tens of billions of \ndollars into these war-torn nations and will destabilize the entire \nregion. Mr. President, do not lift the sanctions on Iran. They must \nshow good action before we show good will.\n  Finally, we must go back to the drawing board on this so-called \nstrategy of halfheartedness. Using American warriors should mean \nbacking them with the full weight and might of this Republic.\n  Mr. President, do you not realize that our enemies hear you loud and \nclear when you say you will not sign the Defense Authorization? \nSecretary Carter, do you not realize that we are still negotiating it \nbetween both Houses of Congress? Why do you say you support a veto when \nwe are still in the process of its negotiation? By such actions, one \nthing is certainly clear: nothing is too good for the troops, and \nnothing is what they will get.\n  Instead, lead, achieve, get an ISIS strategy worthy of this mighty \nRepublic, sign the Defense Authorization, and let's get back to our \nconstitutional requirement to provide for our Nation's defense.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their \nremarks to the Chair and not to a perceived viewing audience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4538-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4538-H4540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WEEK IN REVIEW\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we had an interesting vote today on the \ntrade agreement, and I know my friends at Club for Growth have scored \nthat.\n  They wanted people to vote ``yes'' because they believed, as some \nhave said, it is about free trade; but it is a bit ironic for those who \nfollow politics because, on the one hand, Republicans were being told \nthis will allow us to force the President to keep us apprised, to give \nus notice of what is going on so that we can reign anything in that is \nnot helpful to the country.\n  I didn't have that impression of the bill, not when reading the TPA, \nnot going to the classified setting. I mean, I did that; I read the \nTPP, most of it.\n  Having been a lawyer and a judge, prosecutor, done defense, a chief \njustice, I have litigated a lot of loopholes. There are a lot of \nloopholes in that TPP. There were loopholes in the TPA.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  One of my Democratic friends was telling me, Mr. Speaker, that he was \nbeing told that the whole reason the President came up here is that, by \npassing this trade agreement, it is going to allow the President to get \nhis agenda done in the next 18 months without Congress being able to \nstop him.\n  Some of my Democratic friends prefer that Congress have more say than \nthat, and some were not happy with the proposal at all. They also were \nsmart enough to know there are a lot of American jobs that will be lost \nbecause of that bill. I am not an isolationist. I believe in free \ntrade, but I don't believe in free rein for a President. I am afraid \nthat is what it will do, and that is why I had to vote ``no'' once \nagain.\n  But it passed, and now, we will see if what some of my Democratic \nfriends were told is accurate in that the bill will allow the President \nto achieve his agenda without Republicans being able to stop him. It \nappears that way to me, in reading the bills, that he has got enough \nloopholes he can take advantage of.\n  Plus, even without loopholes, there is a requirement of notification. \nHe was required to notify us before he released anybody from \nGuantanamo. He didn't do it. He went ahead and released five of the \nworst murderers in return for a guy who is, we are told, about to be \ncharged with desertion.\n  The President doesn't seem to be bogged down by having to follow the \nlaw, but I am impressed with my friends who think--but, yes--if we pass \none more law that makes him give us notice, after 6\\1/2\\ years of his \nnot keeping us apprised as the law requires, this time, we think he \nreally, really will.\n  I am impressed with that kind of optimism, even though the old \nexpression here in Washington is, no matter how cynical you get, it is \nnever enough to catch up. Sometimes, I think there is merit to that.\n  In any event, Mr. Speaker, there is an issue even far more important \nthan trade that is about to hit this country. It could create a \nconstitutional crisis of proportions that some of the Justices on the \nSupreme Court can't imagine. Mr. Speaker, I blew up the law. This is \nthe law. It is not an ethical requirement.\n  I mean, having been a prosecutor, a defense--heck, I was even court-\nappointed to appeal a capital murder conviction. I don't know how many \nhere on the floor have appealed a capital murder conviction. I begged \nthe judge not to appoint me, but he did anyway, and when I got into the \nthousands of pages of records, I found out he had not gotten a fair \ntrial.\n  I fought for him in the highest court in Texas and got the death \npenalty reversed. Some clients felt like I was a pretty good lawyer. I \nwas told before I went on the bench that I got the only jury verdict \nagainst what was then the largest oil company in the world. I don't \nknow if it was or is. That is what I was told.\n  I know something about practicing law, and I know something about \nbeing a judge. I know that, with any case in which the public would \nsuspect that I could not be impartial, I would have to recuse myself. \nSometimes, judges will just recuse themselves so they don't have to \nmake a tough call--I never did that--but there are times when you have \nsuch a strong opinion about a matter that you have no business sitting \non that case.\n  Now, ethical requirements would insist that a judge conduct his \nperformance as a judge in such a way that it comports with the \nrequirements of the canons of ethics. However, this isn't an ethical \nviolation that would get you a letter from some bar president or from \nsomebody saying: We think you violated the canons of ethics.\n  This isn't it. This is United States law. This is the law of the \nland. This is part A. Part B goes into some different possibilities \nwhen a judge might have to recuse him or herself, but it is volume 28 \nof the United States Code, section 455, and section A doesn't have any \nsubparts to it like B does. B is, like I say, other examples where the \njudge might have to recuse himself, but A is unequivocal.\n  ``Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States \nshall''--that is a ``shall''--``disqualify himself''--generic, male or \nfemale--``in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably \nbe questioned.''\n  This is not some model code of ethics. This is the United States law. \nNo one in the country, including on the United States Supreme Court, is \nsupposed to be above the law. As we have talked about, we have two \nJustices who have performed same-sex marriages.\n  In fact, the article by Greg Richter, May 18 of 2015, is quoting from \nMaureen Dowd in her article in which Maureen Dowd writes regarding \nJustice Ginsburg: ``With a sly look and special emphasis on the word \n'Constitution,' Justice Ginsburg said that she was pronouncing the two \nmen married by the powers vested in her by the Constitution of the \nUnited States.''\n  Now, there is no question that Justice Ginsburg is biased, \nprejudiced. She has her own opinion about this matter. She has had her \nopinion about this. That was clear in the first same-sex marriage she \nperformed. For her not to disqualify herself is a violation of the law \nof the United States; yet we are told that Justice Ginsburg is not \ngoing to recuse herself, that she wants to be part of a majority \nopinion.\n\n[[Page H4539]]\n\n  What happens when someone who is disqualified for sitting on a case \nsits on a case anyway in order to use her partial, biased position to \nbring about a majority opinion? It would certainly seem that that would \nbe an illegal act, not criminal--this isn't criminal law--but it is an \nillegal act for someone to violate this law.\n  Then, of course, we also had Justice Kagan as mentioned in the fall \nof last year, in September of last year, in The Hill, when Peter \nSullivan reported: ``'Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan officiated a \nsame-sex wedding on Sunday,' a court spokeswoman told the Associated \nPress.\n  ``The ceremony in Maryland for a former law clerk is the first same-\nsex wedding that Kagan has performed. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and \nretired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor have performed same-sex weddings in \nthe past.\n\n  ``Gay marriage,'' the article reads, ``has been a divisive topic at \nthe Supreme Court as it has been elsewhere in the country.''\n  The article reads: ``The Court could decide as early as this month \nwhether to take up the issue again in the coming session, this time to \nconsider a more sweeping ruling declaring a right to same-sex marriage \nacross the country.\n  ``Ginsburg said last week that, unless an appeals court allows a gay \nmarriage ban to stand, `there is no need for us to rush' on a Supreme \nCourt ruling.''\n  But they took the case up, and now, we are told they are going to \nrule by June 30 of this month.\n  Clearly, Justice Kagan is disqualified. She has had a profound \nopinion. It reads ``in which the impartiality might reasonably be \nquestioned.''\n  There are different standards of evidence in the law. Some States use \ndifferent burdens of proof. You can have more likely than not if it is \na group, like on a jury, one more than half. If there is a \npreponderance of the evidence that it is more likely than not, then you \nfind that way.\n  Probable cause is an issue that has an evidentiary requirement. It \nhas got to be, probably, something is likely or has occurred, a \npreponderance of the evidence. I mentioned that ``beyond a reasonable \ndoubt'' is what most criminal courts have before you can find someone \nguilty. Evidence must be beyond a reasonable doubt. There are some \ncourts that use a standard called ``clear and convincing evidence.''\n  This United States law doesn't use any of those standards. It is a \nvery weak threshold before a judge or a Justice must disqualify \nhimself. He must disqualify himself. I hated the fact that Justice \nScalia, some years back, had to disqualify himself, but he had already \nhad an opinion expressed about, I believe it was, the Pledge of \nAllegiance.\n  He could not be sure that it wouldn't end up as a 4-4 decision, which \nmeant the ninth circuit decision would stand, which struck down ``under \nGod'' in the pledge, as I recall, but he disqualified himself. Justice \nScalia followed 28 USC 455.\n  He disqualified himself because his judgment--his impartiality--might \nreasonably be questioned. It appeared that he was partial, that he had \nan opinion in the case, so he disqualified himself. That is acting in \naccordance with the law.\n  Mr. Speaker, I keep coming back to this. It is a matter of a \nconstitutional crisis when the Highest Court in the land not merely \nstrikes down and says that their opinion is more important than Moses', \ndepicted up there in the center point of this room, more important than \nMoses', depicted in the marble wall over the Supreme Court, holding the \nTen Commandments.\n  The Supreme Court says theirs is more important than the opinions \nestablished and stated by Jesus Christ when he said--and he was quoting \nMoses--that a man shall leave his mother and father, a woman leave her \nhome, and the two will come together and be one flesh, and what God has \njoined together, let no man put asunder.\n  That is the law of God according to Moses. It is the law of God \naccording to Jesus. It is tough enough if you have a United States \nSupreme Court which, back in the 1890s, said this is clearly a \nChristian nation. Despite what any opinions may be, the evidence \nestablished. This country was established as a Christian nation.\n  The great thing is that, if a nation is established on Judeo-\nChristian beliefs, it allows anybody to live here and to function here \nand to do so without impediment to one's beliefs because one can be an \natheist, an agnostic, a Buddhist, a Muslim.\n  You can be any of those things, as long as you are not trying to take \nover the country like some would like to do.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  But otherwise, by basing a country on Judeo-Christian beliefs, we \nhave provided more freedom for individuals than any nation in the \nhistory of the world. And yet we may have an ultimate crisis here when \na Court says our opinion is more important than God, if there is one, \nmore important than Moses, more important than Jesus. Our opinion is \nnot only more important than those people, but it is the law of the \nland, and it is so important that our opinion count that we are going \nto violate the law ourselves in order to force our opinion--clearly \nwhat it is--our opinion on the United States of America.\n  I don't want anybody to be prejudiced against anybody else. I was \nsick to my stomach this morning hearing about the shooting in \nCharleston, South Carolina. This evil perpetrator killed my brothers \nand sisters. We are brothers and sisters in Christ. Skin color does not \nmatter one bit. He killed my brothers and sisters.\n  I hope America joins me in mourning. I know the people on both sides \nof this aisle do. At our prayer breakfast this morning, we prayed and \nwill continue to pray for the families of those who were lost. Those \nChristians, we as Christians believe, as Jesus told the thief beside \nhim: This day you will be in paradise with Me. We believe they are \nbetter off than any of us here in the United States or on Earth.\n  Because of their beliefs, we believe they are in paradise with Jesus \nhimself, with the Lord, but it is the terrible wake they leave behind \nthat is so tragic. State senator, from all accounts a good man, not \nonly a Christian brother, but a really good man, pastor. Three men, six \nwomen. So our hearts go out to them. We don't want anybody to be \nprejudiced against anybody.\n  But when it comes to the founding block, the foundation of any solid \nsociety, it doesn't matter what relationships exist. It doesn't matter \nwho loves or is friends with whom. As a Christian, I think I can love \nmost everybody. There are a few it is kind of tough, but most \neverybody. I have got some Democrats over here. I love them. They are \njust wonderful people. They are wrong on issues, but I love them. They \nare great folks. There is no animus.\n  But when it comes to the foundation of this Nation, the home, a \nmother and a father, regardless of what other relationships may exist \nbetween siblings, between anybody else, what matters is you don't \ndestroy the central building block.\n  I was intrigued when the Iowa Supreme Court back in 2009 didn't use \nthese words, but basically said there is no evidence in nature to \nindicate a preference of a marriage being between a man and a woman. It \nwas clear the people of Iowa spoke--I love those folks. They were \nawesome. They came out, and for the first time since the up-or-down \nretention vote started, I understand, in 1960 or 1962 or so, they threw \nout the judges that were up for reelection because the vast majority in \nIowa knew that is ridiculous.\n  Nature makes very clear that you start a family, whether you keep \nboth a mother and father, things happen. There are so many of our \ngreatest Americans have arisen from orphanages or from single-parent \nhomes, but still it doesn't get away from the optimum being nature says \nyou are best off if you have a mother and father. They can produce \nchildren. Yes, you can adopt children, sure, but that is where nature \ncomes in and says, yeah, but the optimum is a mother and a father in a \nhome.\n  I know there are some who are involved in same-sex marriage. They are \nnot able to love as I do. They hate anybody that disagrees with them. \nThere are some that can love me, though we disagree. I hope that the \ncontinued hatred that has been growing among some in the same-sex \ncommunity can be tamped down, but this is an issue that is foundational \nto any society that is going to maintain strength,\n\n[[Page H4540]]\n\ngoing to maintain viability for a long time into the future rather than \nshow we just crossed another milestone on our way to the dustbin of \nhistory. This is something that is important to our society, to our \nfoundation. Let's love everybody. Let's use law enforcement to stop \nthose like the evil perpetrator in Charleston, like the leftwinger I \nthink it was in North Carolina that killed the Muslims. There is no \ncall for that. The man needs to go to prison. In Texas, we would say it \nis a multiple murder. I would say you need to get the death penalty for \nkilling more than one Muslim. There is no place for that.\n  But again, when it comes to the optimum home, a loving mother and \nfather can procreate, adopt, but regardless of who agrees or disagrees, \nthis is going to be a civilization changer, and it is not going to be \nfor the better. We are going to continue our divisiveness and \ndestructiveness when the highest Court in the land has Justices that \nsay: My opinion is so much more important than the Bible, Moses, Jesus. \nMy opinion is so much more valuable that I am going to violate the law; \nI am going to break the law so I can sit on this opinion, so the \ncountry can have my forced opinion on it.\n  I know there are Christian leaders, some are ready to capitulate, but \nthere are some that won't. But we are now to the point, Steve King and \nI and some others, addressed back when the hate crime bill was being \ndiscussed, that we are going to lead to the point where you ultimately \npersecute, eventually prosecute people because of their beliefs about \nsexuality. People then were wrong because they couldn't see the future, \nbut this is where we have come.\n  Now, if you hold the same beliefs that David Axelrod says the \nPresident didn't, but he said it in order to get elected, that a \nmarriage is a man and a woman, you hold that belief that most Americans \nhave held and still hold, that the Founders all held regardless of \ntheir sexuality, they believed a family, marriage at least, was a man \nand a woman, that that was foundational.\n  So I am not sure what is going to happen in this country. I don't \nhave that kind of crystal ball. But I know if we have two or three \nJustices who are clearly disqualified, who have clearly indicated--not \nonly raised questions as to whether they could be reasonably questioned \nas to their impartiality, they made clear they are very, very partial. \nI don't know what happens, but it isn't going to be good at all.\n\n  Justice Sotomayor has made statements that indicate she has an \nopinion before this case was decided. So, Mr. Speaker, I hope scholars \nwill look carefully at this and they will understand, if Supreme Court \nJustices violate the law in order to change the law dramatically, as \nthey want to do, is that a valid law? I don't believe it is. If they \nbreak the law in order to make the law, it is a void law. They need to \nrecuse themselves and let an impartial group on the Court make the \ndecision. It should be left to the States anyway.\n  It is probably sufficient grounds for impeachment for a Supreme Court \nJustice to violate the law so that they can force their will upon the \nAmerican people to push through their legislative agenda even though \nthey are not legislators. Probably impeachment would be in order. If \nthey break the law in order to change dramatically the law, they \nshouldn't be on the Supreme Court.\n  It is my hope and prayer they will do the legal thing, recuse \nthemselves before the Court makes its final decision with regard to \nmarriage. If they don't, they will go down in legitimate American \nhistory books as being exceedingly destructive, and history will note \nthat they violated the law in order to change the law so that it would \nbe the way they wanted, not with a constitutional amendment, not \nthrough a legislative process, not by a constitutional convention that \narticle V provides for. They just had the feeling that they wanted to \ntinker with over 200 years of law and foundational societal structure \nand force America to abide by their legislative agenda. Again, I just \ncan't get over that.\n  If they don't disqualify themselves, they will violate the law to try \nto change the law with the agenda they have made clear that they have. \nSo, Mr. Speaker, I hope Americans will join me in not only hoping, but \npraying that their hearts will be touched, that they will decide not to \nact illegally, that they will be moved toward acting lawfully, \ndisqualify themselves, and let us get a proper opinion from the Supreme \nCourt.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4540-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for \ntoday on account of family medical reasons.\n  Mr. Jolly (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on account of a \nfamily emergency.\n  Mr. Clyburn (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \nofficial business in district.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/house-section/article/H4540-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT.
