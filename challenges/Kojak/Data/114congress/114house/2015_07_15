The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, I was on the HBO show \n``Real Time'' with Bill Maher on a Friday night, and I had a chance to \ntalk with Ann Coulter who, as you might have guessed, I don't have on \nmy speed dial for regular conversations. It was a couple of days after \nDonald Trump announced he was running for the Republican nomination \nbecause he thought Mexican immigrants were criminals, drug dealers, and \nrapists.\n  When it was my turn, I told Ms. Coulter--and, by extension, Mr. \nTrump--that what they were saying about Mexican immigrants would serve \nas a voter registration machine to turbocharge voter registration in \nthe Latino and immigrant community, all because of their particularly \nmean and--frankly, let's be honest--racist attacks on Mexican \nimmigrants.\n  It was particularly important that I was in California for the show \nbecause I was watching the Republican Party make exactly the same \nmistake they made in the 1990s when it lost control of the politics in \nCalifornia.\n  By supporting extreme anti-immigrant policies to kick kids out of \nschool and cut off families from being part of our society, California \nwent from a purple State that had given the Republican Party important \nleaders like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan and, in just a few years, \nwas transformed into a deep shade of Pacific blue.\n  Why? It is because millions of immigrants became citizens; millions \nof immigrant citizens registered to vote; and millions of registered \nvoters voted to punish the Republican Party for being mean, \nshortsighted, and for offering demagoguery, not real solutions to \nissues.\n  This brings me back to Mr. Trump, who is trying to be the standard \nbearer of the anti-immigrant wing of the Republican Party and trying to \ndefine the party as one that will fight against immigrants it sees as \nmurderers, drug dealers, criminals, and rapists.\n  Jan Brewer has endorsed Trump, and there he was, this past weekend, \nstanding with Joe Arpaio in Arizona. Democrats could not paint a \nclearer picture if we tried. You should understand that, when Donald \nTrump said Mexican immigrants are criminals, what do I and other Puerto \nRicans hear? I hear him saying all Puerto Ricans are criminals; and, as \nfar as the Republicans are concerned, we all are.\n  Millions of others here--Hondurans, Colombians, and Dominicans--it is \nclear to all of us that what he is really saying is that all Latinos \nare suspect, whether we were born here or not.\n  Look, Trump's stereotyping is nothing new. Every single wave of \nimmigrants has met the same resistance. They say they are lazy, they \nare bringing crime and diseases, that they are not like us, and they \nare coming to kill our sons and rape our daughters.\n  Whether you came to Chicago from Mexico a decade ago or from \nMississippi in the 1950s to escape Jim Crow, you heard the same thing. \nIf you came to New York from Ireland or came from Sicily a century ago, \nit has always been the same thing.\n  I say that Latinos should do what the Irish and the Polish and the \nItalians did, become citizens and vote. To my constituents and anyone \ntoday that is offended by what Donald Trump stands for, I have a simple \nmessage: Become a citizen--``hazte ciudadano.''\n  There are more than 8.8 million immigrants who hold green cards and \nmeet the residency requirements and are eligible to apply for \ncitizenship today. That includes about 5 million Latinos who can apply \nto become citizens today.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me fill you in on a little secret. With fee waivers, \nup to 20 percent of all of those 8.8 million will pay absolutely \nnothing for their citizenship application. Becoming a citizen for free \nso you can make it clear that you are offended by Donald Trump, it is \npoetic and patriotic. Rather than renew your green card for $450, \nbecome a citizen for about $230 more, or zero if you are part of the 20 \npercent.\n  Look, Mr. Speaker, almost all of the immigrants in this country are \ngoing to remain in this country until the day they die. Let's be \nhonest. For the millions who meet the requirements of citizenship, I \nsay take the step, learn the language, learn our history and\n\n[[Page H5176]]\n\nhow our government works, and take the test. Every time you see Trump's \nface on your TV, vow to learn a little more English or a few more \nhistory facts so you can take the citizenship test.\n  Let's turn the ignorance and the hatred of a TV personality running \nfor President and turn it into something that strengthens democracy for \nall Americans.\n  You know what, if millions of people naturalize, become citizens, and \nwe add to that the million Latino citizens who this year will turn 18, \nplus all of our allies in the African American community, the LGBT \nvoters, younger voters, environmental voters, women voters, Asian \nvoters, and union voters that are being pushed away by the Republican \nParty, all the people they don't want in their coalition constitute a \nmajority of Americans.\n  Together, we are the new American coalition that will dominate \npolitics for decades to come; and together, we will create a stronger, \nmore inclusive, and more egalitarian Nation.\n  Let's turn Trump's negative words into something positive. That is \nhow you deal with bullies and bigots.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5176-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NEVADA'S BASIN AND RANGE MONUMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNevada (Mr. Hardy) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, last Friday, the President signed away more \nthan 700,000 acres of Lincoln and Nye Counties, as the Basin and Range \nNational Monument in my district, locking these lands up from economic \ndevelopment the region depends on. This is unacceptable.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to give a voice to what Nevada's \nargument is and what Nevada's argument is not. Some on the other side \nof the aisle wish to paint those who oppose the designation as enemies \nof our public lands, when nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Southeastern rural Nevada is in my blood. As a fifth-generation son \nof farmers and ranchers from Mesquite, Nevada, I am directly descended \nfrom the very same mountain men and the settlers whose bravery and \nresolve blazed the trail for the founding of our great State and who \nare mentioned in the President's proclamation. I grew up to explore the \nrugged landscapes of Lincoln and Nye Counties, hunting, hiking, and \ncamping in these one-of-a-kind surroundings.\n  I love Nevada as much as the next Nevadan, and we refuse to be \nlectured by those who feel that they are first among equals in matters \nthat concern our future. Our argument is not about whether or not to \npreserve our national treasures contained on our public lands. I \nwholeheartedly agree that we have a responsibility; we must protect \nwhat needs to be protected.\n  It comes down to this: The Antiquities Act is antiquated. The law is \nrooted in the last century, and it has been manipulated over the years \nto exceed its original intent. It has become a tool of political \npatronage, burnishing the legacies of those privileged enough to hold \nour Nation's highest elected offices. It also furthers the insidious \nnotion that Washington knows best.\n  The primary orchestrator of this monument maneuver even went so far \nas to say to the concerned people of Lincoln and Nye Counties: Don't \nworry. This is going to be great for you.\n  Despite the Orwellian refrain, the people in Nevada demanded the \nright to think for themselves, and they strongly disagree.\n  According to the letter I received from Nye County, the entire county \nboard of commissioners opposes the Basin and Range National Monument \ndesignation, stating the dire concerns about the absence of any \nconsultation with the Federal Government and the harmful economic \nconstraints. With 98 percent of Nye County already under Federal \ncontrol, it can ill afford to lose additional economic opportunities.\n  As for Lincoln County, the commissioners have expressed grave \nconcerns about having such a large swath of the county administered \n``for a singular, specific, preferred use, rather than for a multiple-\nuse management resource plan.''\n  Despite what the White House asserts, this outcome would particularly \nbe harmful for a county that is already 97 percent federally \ncontrolled.\n  Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, there is no doubt in my mind the \nAntiquities Act is a holdover of a bygone era. We continue to see \nPresidents pay lip service to the requirement that the boundaries of \nnational monuments should be ``confined to the smallest area \ncompatible''--700,000 acres, really?\n  What I would like to encourage my colleagues and those in the \nadministration to remember is that rural Nevada's culture, the will and \nresolve of its people, are not things that can be locked away in an \noutdoor museum. They live on in today's generations who continue to \ncarry on the traditions of those who came before them and respect the \nland they call home.\n  With proper consultation across all levels of government and the \nlocal buy-in, I am confident that Democrats and Republicans can work \ntogether to protect America's natural heritage, while also preserving \nits people's way of life.\n  This photograph is a great example of the possibilities. The Tule \nSprings Fossil Beds National Monument is a case study of a successful \neffort to preserve Nevada's national heritage that was given due \nconsideration and that had a widespread community backing. That is why \nCongress passed legislation to create the Tule Springs Fossil Bed \nNational Monument in Nevada last year.\n  If I can pose for a picture, smiling wide and holding a sign with the \nwords ``national monument'' on it, there must be a right way to go \nabout protecting our public lands.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need local input; we need votes in Congress, and we \nneed to fix the antiquated Antiquities Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5176-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5176-H5177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               IRAN DEAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, for 35 years, the United States' \nrelationship with Iran has been frozen in amber, locked in a series of \nproxy wars and covert struggles.\n  Circumstances have occasionally thrust us together, like our shared \nactions against the Taliban after 9/11 or, more recently, working \ntogether against some of the most barbarous forces in the Middle East.\n  Now, no one is under any illusions that the military leadership and \nhard-line clerics are bad actors opposed to the United States, but that \nis only part of the story of a complex narrative.\n  The new and potentially more significant chapter of that relationship \nis an effort to contain Iran's nuclear ambition, not through force, but \na combination of tough, multinational sanctions and diplomacy. This all \nstarted in the Bush administration a decade ago and has continued. \nCongress is now beginning the analysis of this historic agreement.\n  For the first time, Iran's nuclear activities have been reined in. \nThey have followed what they said they would do for the last 2 years. \nFor the first time in history, we have an agreement that would last for \na decade or more, reached not just by the United States alone--we could \nnot have done this alone--but with all five members of the U.N. \nSecurity Council, Germany, and the cooperation of potential consumers \nof Iranian oil like India and Japan.\n  Now, we must be prepared to hear people, starting with Prime Minister \nNetanyahu, attack it. We will hear that it is not good enough, that it \ncontains potential downsides.\n  Iran might well try to cheat. Netanyahu will make his arguments with \nthe same certitude as when he appeared in Washington before the Iraq \nwar and talked about the benefits of attacking Iraq. He would have more \ncredibility with me if he weren't so wrong then and if he had any \ncredible alternative now. He has complaints but no solution.\n  Indeed, he doesn't even have a peace plan for dealing with Israel's \nown ongoing festering problems with the Palestinians in the Israeli-\noccupied territories--a man with no plan and no alternative attacking \nthe best option for America and Israel that we have seen.\n  With this agreement in place, we will have more tools than we have \never had to inspect, to monitor, and enforce and more allies to make it \nwork. If the United States walks away from this\n\n[[Page H5177]]\n\nagreement, it is certain that the countries that helped us reach this \npoint will walk away, too, starting with Russia and China.\n  Without this perfect alignment of interests for punishing sanctions, \nthey will fall apart, and we will lose this moment.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Now, despite the huffing and puffing, military action is not viable. \nTalk to your constituents about what their appetite is for another \nmilitary engagement in the Middle East, particularly, with the horrific \ncosts and consequences that would follow.\n  Military action would only strengthen the most reactionary evil \nforces in Iran to unleash the next escalation of global terror, which \nis frightening to comprehend. An attack will strengthen Iran's resolve \nto secure their own nuclear weapons, just as North Korea has done. And \nyou cannot bomb away the knowledge that Iran has on nuclear technology.\n  Ten, fifteen years is a lifetime in international affairs. Who could \nhave imagined what has taken place in the last 15 years of our history? \nThe world was a much different place in the year 2000.\n  We ought to work to keep this coalition in support of the agreement \nalive and well and work to implement it and to enforce it, because we \ncan snap back these sanctions if Iran crosses the line. The evidence is \nthat the American public, and especially the majority of Jewish \nAmericans, want to give diplomacy a chance.\n  Congress should allow it. Reject the alternative for people who have \nno alternative. Recognize this as a major achievement, and work \ntogether to make diplomacy work. Let's seize this once-in-a-generation \nopportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5177-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EGYPT AND THE PERSECUTION OF COPTIC CHRISTIANS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, there is a cultural and religious \ncleansing sweeping across the Middle East. ISIS has made it clear that \nthere is no compromise on religion. It is intolerant of any religious \nbelief different than its own. If a person is not a Muslim, they are \nforced to pay a tax, convert, or be executed. In the face of this ugly \nterrorist group that preaches hate, Christians are persecuted.\n  But ISIS is just one example of groups that are intolerant of \nChristians. Egypt is a hotbed of persecution of Coptic Christians.\n  Some people thought after the fall of Mubarak, things would get \nbetter, but that hasn't been true for Coptic Christians.\n  A schoolteacher told a Coptic teenager to hide his cross that was on \nhis necklace. He wouldn't do so, so the teacher encouraged the class to \npunish the boy to protect the name of Allah. His classmates beat him to \ndeath. He died because he was a Christian.\n  A mere rumor that a Muslim girl was dating a Christian boy led to \nchurch burnings and a curfew for Christians.\n  Since 2011, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom \nhas deemed Egypt a ``country of particular concern.''\n  In 2013, the Muslim Brotherhood blamed Coptic Christians for the \ndownfall of President Morsi, even though it was the majority of the \nEgyptians that were tired of Morsi's oppressive rule. So Muslim mobs \nbattered their way into an Orthodox church south of Cairo, tore down \nthe cross, and torched the building. After they looted the church, they \nset the church on fire with Molotov cocktails and gasoline. When they \nleft, they spray-painted a nearby wall with the words, ``Egypt is \nIslamic.''\n  In all, over 40 Christian churches were destroyed or damaged in \nEgypt.\n  Like the Nazi marking of Jewish homes, black Xs are painted on \nChristian stores so attackers know which shops to target. Dozens of \nhouses, shops, hotels, and vehicles belonging to Christians have been \nburned and looted.\n  The military said it would help rebuild churches that were destroyed, \nbut the law requires non-Muslim places of worship to receive \nPresidential approval before rebuilding a church; and of course, \nPresidential approval is very difficult to obtain. So this is the \ngovernment's way of stopping construction of Christian churches across \nEgypt. The government is still not protecting Coptic Orthodox \nChristians and their churches.\n  Coptic Christians are often treated as second-class citizens by the \ngovernment. Bishoy Boulous was charged with blasphemy, or ``defaming \nIslam,'' in 2009 because he wanted to change his religion on his \nnational identity card from Muslim to Christian.\n  You see, Mr. Speaker, in Egypt you have to put your religious \naffiliation on your identification card.\n  After receiving multiple threats, his wife and his children were \nforced to flee the country. The prosecutors have ignored court \ndeadlines for his trial, and he remains in prison today.\n  President el-Sisi has staked his legacy on the fight against \nterrorism, ISIS, and the Muslim Brotherhood. Ensuring human rights for \nChristians must be given the same priority.\n  Four years after the so-called Arab Spring, attacks against \nChristians have not stopped. In February, 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians \nwere beheaded by ISIS. The brutal mass murder was filmed in a 5-minute, \nhighly produced video and disseminated by ISIS' propaganda arm. When \ntheir relatives got permission from the President of Egypt to build a \nchurch in the memory of the martyrs, they were attacked by rock-\nthrowing radical mobs.\n  Coptic Christians just want to be left alone and worship and exercise \ntheir religion. They want to be able to gather on Sunday without \nfearing the church they are in will be bombed or burned. They want to \nlive in peace without having to hide from radical, intolerant mobs \nready to attack them.\n  These are not unreasonable requests. They are basic freedoms. Our \nally, Egypt, must do a better job of protecting all religious groups.\n  Religious freedom is a human right. We guarantee in our First \nAmendment, and, Mr. Speaker, it is the first right of the five rights \nmentioned in the First Amendment. That placement is not accidental.\n  The right to practice one's religion is a basic human right. Egypt \nshould protect all religious groups, including Coptic Christians, from \nreligious cleansing.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5177-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5177-H5178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts (Ms. Clark) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I would like to share the \nstory of a determined woman who took a traumatic personal experience \nfrom her past and is using it to help people.\n  Erin Merryn is a survivor of childhood sexual assault that began when \nshe was just 7 years old. In her book, Erin shares: ``The only message \nI got as a child came from my abusers, and that was to stay silent or \nelse. I went to bed night after night crying and keeping my secrets \nlocked away in my childhood diary.''\n  Tragically, Erin's is not an uncommon story. Childhood sexual assault \nis a silent epidemic that exists in every one of our communities, and I \nam asking us to come together to do something about it. I am asking, as \na mom of three boys first and as a lawmaker second, because every 6 \nminutes a child is sexually assaulted in the United States. One in four \ngirls, and one in twenty boys are sexually assaulted before they turn \nage 18, and yet only a tenth of children who are sexually abused will \ntell someone.\n  Survivors of child sexual assault carry the corrosive burden of this \nheinous act with them the rest of their lives. Survivors often \nexperience guilt, isolation, problems with self-esteem, and building \nrelationships.\n  Erin shared her story to educate and protect thousands, if not \nmillions, of children. And today, thanks to her work, policies that \nrequire schools to provide age-appropriate sexual abuse prevention \neducation for teachers and students are called Erin's Law.\n  As Members of Congress, as parents, as neighbors, we owe it to our \nkids to follow Erin's example and be their strongest advocates. \nChildren, teachers, and parents are on the front line of this problem, \nbut they often don't have the tools necessary to identify it or get \nkids the help they need.\n\n[[Page H5178]]\n\n  While Erin's Law is an important step for States that have \nimplemented it, every child in America should benefit from the policies \nthat prevent sexual abuse. Children learn tornado drills, fire drills, \nbus safety drills in school, but too often they learn nothing about how \nto protect themselves from predators and how to report abuse.\n  Congress can and should do more to help, and that is why today I am \nintroducing the Child Sexual Abuse Awareness and Prevention Act. This \nlegislation will help schools implement and expand child sexual abuse \nawareness and prevention programs by authorizing funding through \nexisting grant programs.\n  It is common sense that we teach our children to stay safe and how to \nreach out to an adult when they are in trouble. By passing this bill, \nwe can help schools across the United States protect some of the most \nvulnerable children in our country.\n  I am grateful to Representative Joe Heck for partnering with me in \nthe House, and to Senators Gillibrand, Heller, and Feinstein for \nintroducing the bill in the Senate. I am also grateful to the Rape, \nAbuse, and Incest National Network for their leadership on this issue \nin ending abuse and violence.\n  Most importantly, I am thankful for Erin, for her bravery, \nleadership, and determination. No child should ever feel like they have \nnowhere to turn when they are being abused, and with the Child Sexual \nAbuse Awareness and Prevention Act, we can take a critical step toward \nmaking sure that they aren't.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5178-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          IRAN'S NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. DeSantis) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss one aspect of this Iran \ndeal which I think is a fatal flaw, in addition to other fatal flaws--\nbut this one, I think, in particular--and that is the issue of \ninspections.\n  Now, the crucial part of any type of deal dealing with nuclear \ndisarmament involves inspections. You have got to inspect to make sure \nthat they are not--that, in this case, Iran is not--building a nuclear \nweapon.\n  Now, the best way to have done that would be to insist that the \nsanctions remain in place until Iran affirmatively dismantles their \nprogram, and then you have inspectors go in to verify that the program \nhas been dismantled; and then as long as the program is, in fact, \ndismantled and they don't have a nuclear infrastructure, then the \nsanctions are relieved. The minute that they are caught trying to \nrebuild, then the sanctions go back on.\n  But that is not what this deal is at all. What this deal is is a \nhuge, huge influx of cash, hundreds of billions of dollars up front to \nthe Iranian regime, which will be used, no doubt, much of that money, \nto fund terrorism and to expand Iran's influence throughout the Middle \nEast.\n  And we are affirmatively recognizing Iran's nuclear program. They are \nnot required to dismantle their infrastructure, so they get to keep \nthat. So a huge influx of cash, and they keep the nuclear program.\n  You are not going to sell me once you go down that road, because I \ndon't think they have a right to any nuclear material. But other people \nwill say, well, as long as we can inspect, then maybe it is going to be \nokay. And here, in this deal, we don't even have legitimate \ninspections.\n  Now, the administration has drawn a lot of red lines with this Iran \ndeal. One of them was, of course we are going to have anywhere, anytime \ninspections, and they said that repeatedly. Just a couple of months \nago, in April, Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Adviser, said the \ndeal would include anytime, anywhere inspections. Energy Secretary \nMoniz said of course you have to have anytime, anywhere inspections.\n  And then guess what? The deal comes out. Rhodes is asked on TV, what \nabout anytime, anywhere? I thought that was part of the deal. He said \nwe never sought anywhere, anytime inspections. So the administration is \nrecognizing the reality that this deal does not include anywhere, \nanytime inspections.\n  What it does have is a convoluted bureaucratic process that, if we or \nthe IAEA or the U.N. suspect that Iran is developing a nuclear weapon \nin, say, one of their military sites, you actually have to petition to \nbe able to inspect it. Iran gets to weigh in on whether they want to.\n  There is a convoluted bureaucratic appeals process. Basically, Iran \ncan drag it out for 24 days, and that is even assuming you get a \npositive resolution, which, by the way, is going to require the assent \nof Russia and China, and they may not even be willing to give approval. \nSo even if you get that, that is 3-plus weeks where Iran will have the \nability to conceal any of the offending conduct that they were \nsuspected of. So the bottom line is a 24-day delay makes the \ninspections regime utterly useless.\n  So this is a country that has sponsored terrorism consistently for \ndecades. They have lied to the United Nations for decades. Then we are \nin a situation where somehow they should be able to block access to \ntheir potential weapon sites?\n  The bottom line is Iran should not be able to interfere with any \ninspections for any reason at any time. Unless you have that, this is \nnot going to be something that has any chance of success.\n  And guess what. Not only are the inspections not valid, but you are \nlifting the arms embargo over a couple of years, and you are relieving \nsanctions on the Quds Force and Qasem Soleimani. These are designated \nterrorists. Our country has viewed them as a designated terrorist \norganization.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  So the bottom line is, on its own terms, this deal will not succeed. \nIt is a dangerous mistake. Congress has the ability over these next 60 \ndays to scrutinize it, to debate it, and, ultimately, God willing, to \nstop it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5178-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5178-H5179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THIRTY-ONE GIVES OF COLUMBUS, OHIO\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the Thirty-One \nGives Foundation that is a philanthropic arm of Thirty-One Gifts, Inc., \nwhich is the 17th largest direct selling company in the world. I am so \nproud to have both based in my Ohio Third Congressional District.\n  The Thirty-One Gives Foundation is an organization dedicated to \ncelebrating girls, women, and families by providing them with the \nsupport and self-esteem needed to lead to successful lives.\n  Since its first meeting just in 2012, Thirty-One Gives has donated \nover $80 million in product and cash to nonprofit organizations \ncommitted to their same mission.\n  They have proudly partnered with many well-known national \norganizations, such as the Ronald McDonald House, Girl Talk, Salvation \nArmy, the American Heart Association, the Girl Scouts, and the YWCA of \nCentral Ohio to advance this philanthropic mission.\n  Cleverly built around their name, Thirty-One Gifts, with over 16,000 \nconsultants, volunteer on the 31st day of every month with 31 days.\n  Mr. Speaker, I salute their volunteers for providing services such as \npreparing and serving homemade meals to families staying at the Central \nOhio Ronald McDonald House, helping to give stability and strength in \nthese families' homes away from homes.\n  They volunteer also to serve meals at the YWCA Family Center of \nCentral Ohio, which provides emergency shelter and critical services to \nstabilize homeless families.\n  As a long-time advocate against human trafficking and one of the \nsponsors of legislation included in the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act, S. 178, which was recently signed into law by \nPresident Obama, I salute Thirty-One Gives for assisting over 15,000 \nwomen in transition from human trafficking, domestic violence, and \nhomelessness.\n  Mr. Speaker, during my recent district job tour, I had the \nopportunity to visit Thirty-One Gifts and meet the founder, CEO, and \npresident, Cindy Monroe.\n  Today I salute this incredible civic leader, self-starter, and \nentrepreneur and her team for making a difference in the lives of \nothers and presenting a unique solution to the emotional and economic \nempowerment of women locally, nationally, and worldwide.\n\n[[Page H5179]]\n\n  I look forward to welcoming and joining this inspirational \norganization on Sunday, July 26, when some 16,500 sales leaders from \nThirty-One Gifts travel to my congressional district for their annual \nnational sales conference being held right in Columbus, Ohio.\n  As the members of Thirty-One Gifts know, when we all work together \nand give a little piece of our heart, we can make a huge difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5179-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           21ST CENTURY CURES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Meehan) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my deep appreciation to my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. I was proud to be part of this \nbody last week when together, in a bipartisan fashion, we, in strong \nnumbers, passed the 21st Century Cures bill.\n  Let me tell you why that bill matters. It matters because of people \nlike this. This is a picture of Rhoda Mull, a woman that I had the \nopportunity to spend some time with this Monday when we sat together \nfor a period of time, talking about a number of issues, but, most \nspecifically, her life.\n  Rhoda is an attorney of some distinction. She worked with a major \npharmaceutical firm dealing in complex legal issues, traveling \nthroughout the world.\n  In about 2007, she began to feel a little droop in her foot. It \ncontinued to move further up. Ultimately, after numerous consultations \nwith physicians, she was diagnosed with ALS, better known to many as \nLou Gehrig's disease, and, thus, began the slow, but continuing, \nchallenge of the ability for her to move about.\n  But Rhoda, much to the inspiration, didn't allow this to hold her \nback. Quite the opposite. She embraced the challenge of the moment and \nreached out to become a voice, a voice for those some 30,000 people in \nour country every year who are victimized by the disease, Lou Gehrig's \ndisease, ALS. She came to be a voice for those people. It is one of the \nreasons why what we can accomplish with 21st Century Cures is so \nimportant.\n  Let me talk for a second about the fact that she was a voice. Today \nthis body is very likely to deal with the issue of something called the \nSteve Gleason Act.\n  It is an act which will enable the voice recorder that allows Rhoda \nto speak to be able to be approved in such a manner that they will not \nhave to have these important communication tools capped by a rental \npolicy that has been part of CMS' attempts to try to deal with the \ncosts associated with these devices.\n  One of the things that we are working on is to allow people to have \ncontinued access to these technologies, to see the courage of Rhoda, a \nvibrant woman in her mind, but who isn't capable of feeding herself or \ndressing herself, yet is able to speak with me.\n  Inside this mind, there are tremendous things going on. And as she \nmoved to that voice box and communicated with me, it inspired me to say \nwe have got to continue to fight for people like Rhoda, who has been \ngiven a voice.\n  We must stand here and give her a voice as well, to fight for passage \nof the Steve Gleason Act today and to reach out to our colleagues on \nthe other side of this building to make sure that we fight for the \npassage of 21st Century Cures.\n  ALS is just one of thousands of conditions for which we have no real \ncure. We have made tremendous advancements in medicine in the last two \ndecades. There is still much we do not know about conditions like \nmultiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's.\n  I have some good news to share with Rhoda. Just last week the House \napproved the 21st Century Cures Act that will direct money towards \nresearch into cures for conditions like ALS.\n  It expands lifesaving research into conditions that affect millions \nof Americans, increasing the budget of the National Institutes of \nHealth by $10 billion over the next 5 years.\n  It cuts the red tape and bureaucracy, just as importantly, that \nstands between us and groundbreaking new treatments and will help train \nthe next generations of doctors, scientists, and researchers. Millions \nof Americans with conditions like cancer, Alzheimer's, ALS, cystic \nfibrosis, and others stand to benefit from this research.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the Senate to \nget behind this and pass the 21st Century Cures Act. I urge my \ncolleagues in this House to stand up today and cast an important vote \nin support of the Steve Gleason Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5179-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    P5+1 NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Weber) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the P5+1 \nnuclear agreement with Iran.\n  No longer do we have to guess at rumors or wonder what the deal is. \nWe now know. We know that enrichment, despite earlier promises, will \ncontinue. We know that the arms embargo will be removed.\n  We know that the entire sanctions regime, covering problems with \nhuman rights abuses, terrorism, and the ballistic missile programs, \nwill cease to exist.\n  We know that Iran has the capability of usurping an anytime, anywhere \ninspections program, thanks to required advance permission for each \nindividual inspection, up to 24 days sometimes.\n  After decades of animosity on the part of Iran toward the American \npeople, we also know that our Americans are still sitting in Iranian \nprisons. I wonder how many 24-day periods they have been there.\n  We know that Iran still views the United States and Israel as their \nenemy, as stated earlier this month by multiple members of the Iranian \nregime.\n  We know that Iran's sponsorship of terrorism will continue unabated, \nonly now they will have more money and increased market access to \nensure that weapons and funds continue to flow into the very hands of \nthose who wish our death.\n  President Obama announced, ``America negotiated from a position of \nstrength and principle.''\n  Really? That was our beginning position? Well, when did they cease to \npush that position? All I see is capitulation to a regime which has \nrepeatedly violated the terms of the negotiations, all the while \nsitting at the very negotiation table.\n  America's failure to truly lead is what has caused both President \nObama and Secretary Kerry to state that this deal had the support of \nthe international community.\n  Obviously, they forget that our greatest ally, Israel, is part of the \ninternational community as well as other gulf coast countries. Aren't \nthey all members of the same international community?\n  Now it is incumbent upon Congress to seek answers to a number of \nquestions prior to finalizing our votes on an expected resolution.\n  Number one, do we really believe it will prevent a nuclear armed \nIran? Answer: No. Do you really believe it will prevent a nuclear arms \nrace in the Middle East? Answer: No. Do you really believe that the \nremoval of a comprehensive sanctions program that brought a terroristic \nIranian regime to the negotiation table in the first place can truly be \n``snapped back''? Answer: No. Have we lost decades of work? \nUnfortunately, answer: Yes.\n  Do you believe this deal makes the world a safer place? As for me, \nthe answer is no. The answer to all of these questions is no. As such, \nI cannot nor will I support approval of Iran's deal of a lifetime.\n  All I can say, Mr. Speaker, is it is a good thing President Obama \nwasn't on the decks of the USS Missouri to end World War II because, \nhad he been, we would all be speaking Japanese.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5179-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5179-H5180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CLEAR LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR CRIMINAL ALIEN REMOVAL ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, sitting here listening to my colleagues, \nI find it just so incredibly interesting that nearly everyone that is \ncoming to the floor today is talking about an issue that centers on our \nNation's security, whether it is our national security writ large in \nthe world, what is happening in the Middle East, or what is happening \nhere at home.\n\n[[Page H5180]]\n\n  And, as I talk to female constituents, it is amazing to me what comes \nup over and over: How are we going to be certain that we are safe in \nour homes, in our communities? How do I know that my children are going \nto be safe at school? How do I know that we are going to be safe when \nwe are out at events in the community or driving in the car or going to \nchurch?\n  These are questions of concern to so many moms who, like me, worry \nabout their children and their grandchildren.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this is one of the issues that brings me to the floor \ntoday. I have legislation that I first filed in 2007. It is called the \nCLEAR Act. It is H.R. 2964.\n  The CLEAR Act addresses the issues with the criminal illegal aliens \nthat are in our country and the policies that have arisen around \nsanctuary cities. These sanctuary city policies and the executive \namnesty really have turned every State into a border State and every \ntown into a border town in this country.\n  Here is why: There are lax, permissive, and liberal policies that \nhave really created an open border society here in our country--and do \nyou know what, it makes Americans less safe every single day.\n  Now, the CLEAR Act isn't a big bill; it is 20 pages, but let me tell \nyou what it does specifically. It withholds funding from section 241(i) \nof the Immigration and Nationality Act to sanctuary States and cities.\n  That is important to do because, as I said, those lax, liberal, and \npermissive policies have now allowed over the last 7 or 8 years to \ncreate a total of nearly 300 sanctuary cities in this country. This \nshould disturb us because we are becoming a sanctuary country.\n  I would ask my colleagues: Will you support that provision of the \nCLEAR Act?\n  The second thing the CLEAR Act does, Mr. Speaker, is when a State or \nlocal law enforcement agency arrests an alien and requests that DHS, \nHomeland Security, take custody of that alien, the CLEAR Act requires \nDHS to do two things: take the alien into Federal custody and \nincarcerate him or her within 48 hours or request that the State or \nmunicipality temporarily incarcerate the alien or transport them to \nFederal custody.\n  The CLEAR Act requires the DHS to train State and local police in \nenforcing immigration laws and to repay them for the money that they \nhave spent.\n  Now, sanctuary cities first started to happen in the United States in \n1979. Los Angeles was the first sanctuary city. That means these cities \nchoose--choose--to stand in violation of Federal law and to not comply \nwith Federal immigration law.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think it is so instructive that the Department of \nJustice has never taken one of these cities to court, but if you let a \nState like Arizona try to strengthen their immigration laws, then the \nDepartment of Justice takes them to court. There is something wrong \nwith that.\n  Another thing that has happened is the illegal alien crime rate which \nhas continued to grow. Do you know what the illegal alien crime rate \nshould be? It is zero--zero.\n  There should not be tolerance for this. We see it all across our \ncountry. Certainly, we saw it on a San Francisco pier. In Tennessee, a \nTennessee Highway Patrol officer made a traffic stop on I-40 that led \nto the arrest of a man with an order of deportation and the recovery of \na 19-year-old who may have been a victim of human sex trafficking.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time to address this issue, and I encourage \nsupport for the CLEAR Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5180-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MOURNING THE LOSS OF JUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Fleischmann). The Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the city of Memphis lost one of its most \noutstanding citizens on Sunday evening. D'Army Bailey, who had served \nas a judge in circuit court for nearly two decades, was a national \nfigure, recognized for such in The New York Times yesterday with a very \nlarge and meaningful obituary.\n  D'Army Bailey was singularly responsible for the creation of the \nNational Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee. There was a time \nwhen the Lorraine Motel, which is the site of the National Civil Rights \nMuseum and the site of Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination, was \ngoing to be foreclosed and possibly demolished; but D'Army Bailey, then \nan attorney, saw that as wrong and knew that the National Civil Rights \nMuseum should be built at the site of the assassination of Dr. King and \nthat site should be preserved for generations for people to learn about \ncivil rights and learn about Dr. King.\n  He got together, Mr. Speaker, and raised money from individuals and \nthe city of Memphis and was able to save the Lorraine from foreclosure \ndemolition.\n  He then put together the idea of the city, the county, and the State \ngovernments funding the beginnings of a national civil rights museum. \nThere was private funding as well, but it was the initial work of \nD'Army Bailey coming to Nashville, where I was a State senator, and \nworking to get Governor McWherter and the State legislature on board \nand then the city of Memphis and the county of Shelby.\n  Now, there is a phoenix, having risen from the ashes, a great civil \nrights museum in Memphis, Tennessee; and there is one man who had the \nidea and refused to see the site destroyed and sought out the funding \nwhen people said it couldn't happen and made sure it happened. That was \nJudge D'Army Bailey--Judge D'Army Bailey.\n  He was recognized because he spoke truth to power, and he spoke truth \nto power in Baton Rouge during the civil rights movement; in Berkeley \nwhen Berkeley was an evolving center of thought and questioning of \nvalues and where he was the city councilman; and on Beale Street, where \nhe brought students to Memphis to march with Dr. King.\n  Mr. Speaker, D'Army Bailey was a respected figure in the city of \nMemphis. He crossed all boundaries in the city, economic and racial, \nand all because of his gigantic intellect.\n  Many Members in the House have asked me about his passing. He had an \neffect on this country and an effect on our city. His was a life well \nlived, and he will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5180-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5180-H5181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Duncan) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I participated in a \nhearing on criminal justice reform before the Oversight and Government \nReform Committee. A second hearing is being held today on this issue in \nthe same committee. At both hearings, conservatives and liberals are \njoining together to urge that we stop or at least try to slow the \ngrowth of our Federal police state.\n  Conservative columnist George Will wrote a few months ago: \n``Overcriminalization has become a national plague.''\n  Paul Larkin, senior legal research fellow at the Edwin Meese III \nCenter for Legal and Judicial Studies, wrote in The Washington Times: \n``Today, there are perhaps 4,500 Federal offenses--and more than \n300,000 relevant regulations--on the books. No one knows exactly how \nmany. The Justice Department and the American Bar Association each \ntried to identify every crime and failed.''\n  Mr. Larkin continued: ``No reasonable person, not even a judge or \nlawyer, could possibly know all of these legal prohibitions, although \ncriminal penalties are attached to each.''\n  John Baker, a retired Louisiana State University law professor said: \n``There is no one in the United States over the age of 18 who cannot be \nindicted for some Federal crime.''\n  He added: ``That is not an exaggeration.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I have special interests in this because, for 7\\1/2\\ \nyears before coming to Congress, I was a criminal court judge in \nTennessee trying the felony criminal cases. I believe in being tough on \ncrime, and I have been a very strong supporter of local law \nenforcement, the people on the front lines who are fighting the real \ncrime, the violent crime that everyone is so concerned about.\n\n[[Page H5181]]\n\n  I remember in 1993 reading an article in Forbes magazine, one of the \nNation's most conservative magazines. This article said that we had \nquadrupled the Justice Department just between 1980 and 1993 and that \nFederal prosecutors were falling all over themselves trying to find \ncases to prosecute. We have kept on expanding the Justice Department \nsince then and have had explosive growth in the number of Federal \ncrimes.\n  We have had far too many cases where overzealous prosecutors have \nprosecuted high-profile defendants just so that a prosecutor could make \na name for himself. I remember the totally unjustified case against \nSecretary of Labor, Ray Donovan, in which, after he was acquitted, made \nthe famous statement: ``Where do I go to get my reputation back?''\n  Our Federal Government has become far too big, and it is far too \npowerful. We all have heard how particularly the IRS is running \nroughshod over individual citizens. Newsweek magazine a few years had \non its cover: ``Inside The IRS--Lawless, Abusive, and Out of Control.''\n  Unfortunately, while there are many good Federal prosecutors, there \nare far too many of them and, unfortunately, some who, like the IRS, \nare lawless, abusive, and out of control.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are now so many laws, rules, and regulations on \nthe books today that people are being prosecuted for violating laws \nthey didn't even know were in existence.\n  Paul Larkin, whom I quoted earlier, said that we need a ``mistake of \nlaw'' defense. An innocent mistake is not supposed to be criminal, but \na zealous prosecutor can make even an innocent mistake look criminal, \nand there is an old saying that a prosecutor could indict a ham \nsandwich if he wanted to.\n  Almost everyone has violated some tax law--they are so convoluted and \nconfusing--and almost every person in any type of business has \nunknowingly violated some law, rule, or regulation for which they could \nbe prosecuted.\n  That is why, yesterday, we had at our hearing a conservative \nRepublican like Senator John Cornyn, a former justice of the Texas \nSupreme Court; and Senator Cory Booker, a liberal Democrat; and a \nconservative like Representative Sensenbrenner; and a liberal like \nRepresentative Bobby Scott--all joining together to urge reform.\n  Lastly, let me mention one other aspect of our Nation's crime \nproblem. In my years as a judge, I handled over 10,000 cases because \nprobably 97 or 98 percent of the defendants enter some type of guilty \nplea and then apply for probation.\n  Every day, for 7\\1/2\\ years, I would read several 8- or 10-page \nreports into a defendant's background, and I would read, ``Defendant's \nfather left home when defendant was 2 and never returned,'' or \n``Defendant's father left home to get a pack of cigarettes and never \ncame back.''\n  Mr. Speaker, over 90 percent of the defendants in felony cases in my \ncourt came from father-absent households. Drugs and/or alcohol are \ninvolved in most cases, but they are secondary to the absent father \nproblem.\n  Years ago, I read a report that said 57 percent of marriages break up \nin arguments, disputes, or disagreements about money. As government has \ngrown so much at all levels, Federal, State, and local over the past 40 \nor 50 years, it has become a major factor in the breakup of the \nAmerican family by taking so much money and making it so much more \ndifficult for families to stay together.\n  This, Mr. Speaker, has had a major impact on our Nation's crime \nproblem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5181-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FREEDOM OF SPEECH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in order to \nstand in strong support of a foundational American law and principle \nthat I feel has been woefully neglected recently. I rise in defense of \nthe First Amendment, which in part states: ``Congress shall make no law \nrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free \nexercise thereof.''\n  Due to the recent Supreme Court decision on marriage, I feel that the \nFirst Amendment is at risk of being horribly violated in the name of \njudicial activism. I am deeply concerned for the First Amendment rights \nof all American citizens and feel strongly that the Court did not act \nwithin its limited constitutional constraints.\n  Due to this decision, Mr. Speaker, there now exists a direct conflict \nbetween the law of man and the law of God, and we have tens of millions \nof Americans who are now facing a dilemma to choose between their faith \nand their religious convictions and the government. As Christians, we \nmust obey the law of God.\n  This decision by the Supreme Court is devastating, and it directly \nignored the will of the people and the will of most States. It was a \ndirect rejection of previously held decisions; it rejected dozens of \nState laws and Constitutions, and, yes, it rejected God's law.\n  In effect, this decision took the people's prerogative and the \nStates' prerogative and threw it out the window in favor of incorrectly \ndefining and interpreting that which is detrimental to our First \nAmendment, the First Amendment which guarantees not only the freedom of \nspeech, but also the freedom of religious expression without fear of \nharassment or penalty from our government.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, we must find different avenues where citizens and \nlawmakers can get involved to address this egregious offense to our \nFirst Amendment. In my home State of Georgia, local legislatures are \nconsidering the Pastor Protection Act which would endeavor to ensure \nthat no pastor or minister or house of faith would be forced to perform \na wedding that they believe violates their religious beliefs. That is \ngood, but we must do more. It is a good first step.\n  Frankly, it is my hope that other States would raise the mantle of \nour Constitution and protect it and protect not just pastors and \nministers, but all citizens, including businessmen and -women.\n  In addition to State action, Congress also must be heavily involved \nat this time. As an initial step, I am personally proud to have \ncosponsored H.R. 2802, the First Amendment Defense Act, offered by my \ngood friend and colleague Representative Raul Labrador from Idaho.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  This bill includes many provisions that would both reaffirm and \nsafeguard our First Amendment rights. It would ensure that the Federal \nGovernment could not penalize institutions, churches, and individuals \nfor simply exercising their First Amendment right.\n  Furthermore, it prohibits the Federal Government from blocking access \ndue to deeply held religious convictions from those who are seeking \ngrants or licenses or contracts or accreditation or tax-exempt status. \nI believe this bill would help greatly to deal with the uncertainty \nthat currently is held by millions.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, it is my sincere hope and desire that we can \nall come together to defend our First Amendment. I think Daniel Webster \nsaid it best when he said:\n\n       If we abide by the principles taught in the Bible, our \n     country will go on to prosper, but if we and our posterity \n     neglect its instructions and authority, no man can tell how \n     sudden a catastrophe may overwhelm us and bury all our glory \n     in profound obscurity.\n\n  I, for one, Mr. Speaker, will continue fighting for our First \nAmendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5181-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5181-H5182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HIGHWAY TRUST FUND\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Ribble) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon, this body is going to come \ntogether and in bipartisan fashion--I think that is normally a good \nthing, in bipartisan fashion--be able to applaud themselves for fixing \nthe highway trust fund. Like the proverbial magician that takes the \nshiny object in one hand to distract you, they will, with sleight of \nhand, with the other hand borrow $8.1 billion when the American people \naren't watching.\n  I want to refer you to the chart on my left. You will see three \nlines. I want to talk about the bottom two first.\n  The very bottom line is the revenue line. That is the amount of money \nwe receive from excise taxes and gasoline taxes to pay for roads and \nbridges and infrastructure. The red line above it is\n\n[[Page H5182]]\n\nthe expenditures. That is the money that we are spending. The \ndifference between the two is the deficit. That is the borrowed money. \nI will show you where it is.\n  For decades--for decades--we have been adding red ink to the American \npeople's debt. We have been borrowing billions of dollars annually each \nyear to spend on our infrastructure rather than telling the American \npeople the truth: that if we believe as Members of Congress and this \nbody that roads and bridges and airports are important enough to buy, \nthey are important enough to pay for. But we don't want to do that. We \ndon't want to tell the American people we are going to raise taxes.\n  But I want you to know that this afternoon when we borrow $1.8 \nbillion to build roads and bridges, we are going to raise taxes. Here \nis what I mean. We are going to raise taxes on kids, on our children, \non my 11-year-old grandson. Do you want to know why? Because we don't \nwant to tell them, we don't want to tell adults today that they have to \npay for the roads and bridges that they buy today. What we would rather \ndo is say you can have these things for free. We are going to wave the \nshiny magic object here. We are going to borrow money while telling the \nAmerican people it is paid for, and then we are going to ask our \nchildren when they grow up to buy our roads and bridges when the bill \ncomes due.\n  We are perfectly fine on raising taxes on kids, raising taxes on \nchildren. Do you want to know why? Because they can't vote. So let's \ntell them they have got to pay for this stuff rather than us paying for \nthis stuff. Remember, all deficit spending is nothing more than future \ntaxation.\n  What is the top line here, the hash line? Back in 1992, the last time \nthat we raised the national gas tax, Congress, before I came here and \nbefore many of my colleagues came here, decided not to index the gas \ntax to inflation. So our purchasing power is disappearing because we \nhave left it where it is.\n  Now, I am going to use a green pen here. All that green is lost \nopportunity.\n  I don't know how many of you have flown into LaGuardia, JFK, O'Hare, \nthese international airports. They are the international gateway to the \nUnited States economy, and they are also an international embarrassment \non a global scale.\n  We continue to let these places degrade and fall apart, and yet none \nof us in our own spending would do that in our homes. If the roof \nleaks, we fix it. If the House needs painting, we paint it. We take \ncare of these things and maintain them because they are our assets. \nThey are what we are passing on to the next generation. We have lost \nall this opportunity.\n  What I would much rather see is either we are honest with the \nAmerican people, Mr. Speaker, and say, if it is worth buying and worth \ndoing, we should pay for it, and then raise the taxes necessary to do \nthat, like Ronald Reagan did, like George Bush did, like Dwight \nEisenhower did--all Republican Presidents. They said it is worth paying \nfor. Let's not burden our children. Let's not tax them. If it is worth \ndoing that, we should do that.\n  If it is not worth doing that, we should bring our expenditures down \nto the revenue level and not spend the money in the first place so that \nwe are sending a clear message back to each of the States that are \ngetting Federal largess on highways and roads that we are not going to \ndo that and that you need to raise your taxes to cover the gap.\n  Both of those ideas would be better than what we are doing right now, \nwhich is nothing but a magic trick on children, and we ought to stop \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5182-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5182-H5183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McClintock) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I don't know how adequately to express \nmy alarm and outrage over the President's agreement with Iran. It is a \nbreathtakingly dangerous act. Some have compared it to Neville \nChamberlain's Munich accord with Nazi Germany, but that does not fully \nillustrate the danger. In this case, we are talking about a rogue state \nwith all of Nazi Germany's genocidal intentions, but this one will be \narmed with nuclear weapons.\n  In its preamble, the agreement asserts that Iran will comply with the \nnuclear nonproliferation treaty that it signed long ago. Well, wait a \nsecond. If it had obeyed this treaty, we wouldn't be having this \ndiscussion to begin with now, would we?\n  The fact is that Iran has a well-established and consistent record of \nroutinely violating international law. Its intention to acquire nuclear \nweapons is obvious.\n  The immediate effect of the President's action is to release hundreds \nof billions of dollars of direct and indirect resources to Iran with \nwhich its government can pursue its military and terrorist activities, \nactivities that aren't even addressed in this agreement. It is sobering \nto consider that Iran's extensive terrorist operations, which \nreportedly now reach into South America, are about to get a huge \ninfusion of cash.\n  But lifting the sanctions does far more damage than merely releasing \nresources to this outlaw regime with which to kill Israelis and \nAmericans, as its leader vowed to do just last week. The sanctions were \nhaving a major impact on destabilizing the regime according to all of \nthe Iranian expatriates I have talked with. Relieving those sanctions \nundermines what had been a rapidly building uprise against the regime \nfrom within.\n  Over the last several years, the Iranian opposition had grown \ndramatically for two reasons: there was a strong and growing perception \namong the Iranian people that the Iranian dictatorship was a pariah in \nthe international community, and that the resulting international \neconomic sanctions had created conditions that make the regime's \noverthrow imperative--that is, until Barack Obama blundered onto the \nscene.\n  This agreement cannot be verified. We are now learning that the 24/7 \naccess to inspections promised by the President does not exist. Under \nthis agreement, the regime can stall any inspection for many weeks or \neven months.\n  The President's promise that violations will result in a snapback of \nsanctions is also completely empty. Restoring sanctions would require \nthe assent of China and Russia, something much less likely, given our \nrapidly deteriorating relations with them.\n  And even if Iran scrupulously abided by every detail of the \nagreement, they can continue to run centrifuges for low-level \nenrichment, continue their research and development of advanced \ncentrifuges, continue their heavy water research, and within 8 years \nacquire intercontinental ballistic missiles. That means, even under \nthis agreement, within a decade, Iran will have a nuclear breakout \ncapability and the launch vehicles necessary to deliver those weapons \nanywhere in the world with the solemn vow of its government to wipe \nIsrael and the United States off the map.\n  Indeed, just last week, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nwarned: ``Under no circumstances should we relieve pressure on Iran \nrelative to ballistic missile capabilities and arms trafficking.'' Yet \na week later, that is exactly what this agreement does.\n  The President says there is no alternative. Well, this is utter \nnonsense. The sanctions were working. The domestic resistance to this \nIslamic-fascist dictatorship mustered over 100,000 Iranian expatriates \nat its annual meeting in Paris last month. This movement desperately \nneeds the moral and material support of our Nation to bring down this \nregime from within. That is precisely what this administration has \ndenied them.\n  Last month, I fear the Congress became complicit in this agreement by \nadopting a completely extraconstitutional process for ratification that \nI believe was a sham. Instead of two-thirds vote of the Senate to \napprove treaties, it requires an almost impossible two-thirds vote of \nboth Houses to reject it as an agreement. But at this moment in time, \nnothing is more important to the world than for two-thirds of this \nCongress to repudiate this dangerous falling.\n  Despite all of the indignities, retreats, and self-inflicted wounds \nour country has endured these past 6\\1/2\\ years, the freedom-loving \npeople of the\n\n[[Page H5183]]\n\nworld still look to us for leadership and support. We are still what \nLincoln called the last best hope of mankind. It is imperative that \nCongress now rise to the occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5183-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, President Obama \nannounced that the final framework for a nuclear deal with Iran had \nbeen reached.\n  While I am supportive of a strong deal that would prevent the nuclear \narmament of Iran and thereby easing tensions with our ally Israel, no \ndeal is better than a bad deal.\n  One provision of particular concern has been the relief of \ncongressional sanctions that were implemented years ago. By authorizing \nsanction relief, the Iranian Government will have billions of dollars \nat their disposal to use for the same secretive activities that we have \ngrown accustomed to seeing them support.\n  As such, hundreds of Members on both sides of the aisle have \nexpressed their opposition to a deal that does not appropriately \naddress the shortfall of transparency or cooperation that Iran has \ndemonstrated repeatedly. Merely threatening them with snapback \nsanctions does not go far enough to institute a level of \naccountability, nor does it prove to be a viable option once sanction \nrelief has been in motion.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I have stated, I have joined with a significant \nmajority of both Democrats and Republicans communicating expectations \nto the President on behalf of the American people for any negotiated \ndeal with Iran. I am very concerned these expectations have not been \nmet in this announced proposed deal.\n  The deal should never provide Iran a pathway to a bomb. This deal \ndoes not prevent that but, rather, prolongs the time until Iran \ndevelops nuclear weapons.\n  To achieve security and peace, this agreement must be long-lasting. \nAny deal that allows Iran to access conventional weapons in 5 years and \nballistic missiles in 8 years is anything but long-term, anything but \npeaceful, anything but appropriate.\n  Relief of sanctions should be earned by full compliance, access, and \ntransparency regarding the Iranian nuclear program. Sanction relief \nloaded up-front is unacceptable. This deal fails that requirement. \nSanction relief will only provide a financial stimulus to fund the \nworld's number one exporter of terrorism--Iran.\n  During this 60-day congressional review period, I encourage all of my \ncolleagues and the American people to take a very detailed look at this \nagreement and determine whether it is a good deal for America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5183-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, the American people have an expectation \nthat the hard-earned money that they pay in taxes will not be wasted or \nused fraudulently. However, we have seen far too many examples of the \nFederal Government squandering taxpayer dollars.\n  Take the IRS, for example. We have learned the earned income tax \ncredit has an error rate of over 27 percent. That means taxpayer money \nis wasted to the tune of $15 billion. Compare that to the private \nsector, where Visa maintains an error rate of 0.06 percent.\n  In another shocking revelation, it was even discovered that a single \nmailbox received 24,000 fraudulent tax returns, totaling $46 million. \nOne mailbox, Mr. Speaker.\n  In addition to fixing a broken Tax Code by making it simpler and \nfairer, Washington needs to also be good stewards of taxpayer money, \nmaking sure that taxpayer dollars are not wasted, are not misused, and \nthat there is appropriate oversight over the IRS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5184-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ENSURING CAREGIVERS' OPPORTUNITIES\n\n  (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILMER.

For many, that means being able to stay in \ntheir own homes.\n  In concert with the White House Conference on Aging, this week I met \nwith a group of home care workers that turned that wish into a reality. \nThey work tirelessly to cook meals, help with therapies, make sure \nmedication is taken properly, and help people live under their own \nroof.\n  The work of caregivers is so valuable, so I want to call on this \nCongress to actually value them. What does it say when the people who \ncare about our most vulnerable--our parents and our grandparents--are \nso poorly compensated?\n  One of the caregivers I met with expressed that her pay was so low \nshe wasn't building up enough in Social Security to retire, herself.\n  We need to work for better wages and for the notion that, when \nsomeone works overtime, they get paid overtime. We need to expand \ntraining and apprenticeship opportunities so those working hard in \nthese demanding positions can move up.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have a grandmother who is now 105 years old. I want \nthe caregivers taking care of her and her generation and future \ngenerations to know that we respect what they do, not just with words, \nbut with policies and pay that supports them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5184-7", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COLLEGE SAVINGS PLANS\n\n  (Mr. NUGENT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a simple solution to \na straightforward problem. A constituent of mine came to me with this \nissue. He had created college funds for each of his grandchildren in a \n529 college savings plan.\n  Some of his grandchildren decided not to go to college, while others \nwent to college and graduated, but with student debt. While he wanted \nto use the leftover college savings to pay off those loans, which makes \nsense because the loans were the same expenses that the 529 plan money \nis intended for, he was not able to spend that money on the loans \nwithout being hit with both the capital gains taxes and an additional \n10 percent penalty, the same as if he were using the money for some \nother purchase.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill to strike the additional penalty when \nthe 529 college savings plan money is used to pay for student loans \nthat were taken out for qualified educational expenses. In this age of \nrising college costs, there is no reason to penalize families for \npaying down student debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5184-8", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5184-H5185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PROMOTING LITERACY\n\n  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n\n[[Page H5185]]\n\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, as students enjoy summer break, \nwe need to ensure that our kids remain intellectually engaged.\n  Today we hear so much about our youth being glued to their screens, \ntheir tablets, and their gaming apps. It has caused concerns among \nparents who worry that their kids will remain idle without mental \nexercise during the summer months.\n  I know that our kids can be just as enthusiastic about reading as \nthey are about Minecraft.\n  Last year, I started Robin's Readers, a literacy challenge for \nstudents in my district. I was blown away by the response. More than \n3,000 kids participated and read over 20,000 books in a 10-week period. \nThis past April, I hosted an awards event for these kids and saw \nfirsthand their passion for reading.\n  Chicago's mayor, Rahm Emanuel, has also started Rahm's Readers, which \nwill ensure that the love for reading continues to burn strong over the \nsummer months.\n  I urge my colleagues, especially my Illinois colleagues, to work with \nme to promote literacy. I call on you to start your own reading \nprograms.

Mr. Speaker, the original GI Bill, the Serviceman's \nReadjustment Act of 1944, is one of the most significant laws in our \nhistory. It provided education to millions of Americans and created \neconomic opportunity for a generation.\n  Subsequent GI Bills were signed into law to cover the soldiers of \nsubsequent conflicts, but these benefits came with a catch. They had to \nbe used within 10 or 15 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, the sacrifice of our soldiers is immeasurable and \ntimeless, and our gratitude should not come with an expiration date. \nMany returning veterans postpone education to support their families or \nrehabilitate from war injuries.\n  A recent VA report found that 21 percent of veterans had not used \ntheir educational benefits because their period of eligibility had \nexpired. Moreover, placing limits on educational benefits is out of \nstep with the increasingly competitive global economy. Today many \nworkers will need specific skill training throughout their entire \ncareer.\n  I have introduced the Veterans Education Flexibility Act to remove \nthese outdated deadlines and retroactively restore the benefits to the \nAmericans who earned them.

It is \nunconscionable and inexcusable that we are giving the hard-earned money \nof American taxpayers to an organization that callously kills an \ninnocent, unborn child every 90 seconds.\n  At its core, Planned Parenthood supports the systematic extermination \nof the most vulnerable among us.

He committed his life to the fair \nimplementation of the law, believing that it applies to all of us and \nprotects each of us.\n  Throughout his career, he showed how words like ``justice'' and \n``fairness'' were not just ideas for discussion, but principles that \nhad to be fought for, protected, and defended.

He gave it a face and a family.\n  Serving at the helm of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau for nearly a \ndecade, he trained, supervised, and worked with over 180 law students \nand served roughly 2,700 low-income individuals and their families.\n  Through his service, he protected thousands of people in need and \ninspired hundreds of young lawyers.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2713, the title \nVIII Nursing Workforce Reauthorization Act, a bipartisan bill that I \nauthored with my Nursing Caucus co-chair David Joyce.\n  When President Johnson first signed these programs into law, he \nobserved that the Nurse Training Act of 1964 was the most important \nnursing legislation in our Nation's history. And, indeed, it has been.\n  Over the past 50 years, title VIII programs have bolstered nursing \neducation at all levels, from entry-level preparation through graduate \nstudy, not only supplying our Nation with needed healthcare providers, \nbut also strengthening the nursing education pipeline to train the \nnurses of tomorrow.\n  These programs are targeted to address specific needs within the \nnursing population, nursing workforce, and America's patient \npopulation. Simply put, title VIII nursing workforce programs are a \ndirect investment in our Nation's health.\n  The Nursing Workforce Reauthorization Act of 2015 is a bipartisan \neffort to simply ensure that these critical programs are available for \nyears to come. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \ncosponsor H.R. 2713.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5187-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1230\n                         IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT\n\n  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about a matter that is \ncritical to the future security of not only the United States, but to \nour allies and international security.\n  Yesterday, the President announced a nuclear agreement had been \nreached between Iran and six other nations led by the United States. \nThroughout these negotiations, I have been skeptical of the concessions \nmade by this administration to Iran, despite its history of dangerous \nand defiant behavior.\n  Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and has \nconsistently shown a pattern of noncompliance. I have serious concerns \nthis deal will fail to prevent a nuclear Iran while rewarding the \nIranian Government's past actions with billions of dollars in sanctions \nrelief.\n  Mr. Speaker, as Congress continues to evaluate the deal, I believe we \nmust reject any agreement that further bolsters the Iranian regime; \nendangers our allies, especially Israel; and fuels instability in the \nregion.\n  Far too much is at stake to accept a bad deal that puts the security \nof our Nation and our fight to combat violent extremism at greater \nrisk.\n  Mr. Speaker, how can you have a deal with someone you can't trust?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5187-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE PARTNERSHIP TO BUILD AMERICA ACT\n\n  (Mr. BERA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. BERA.

President Eisenhower invested in the interstate highway bill, \nwhich built our interstate commerce system and transport system and put \nthousands of people to work and led to an economic boom.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's think big. That is what we do as Americans. Let's \ninvest in ourselves. Let's come up with a long-term highway trust fund \nbill that invests in our infrastructure; puts thousands of Americans to \nwork; and lets us lead an economic recovery not just in the United \nStates, but in the world.\n  That is what we do as Americans; we think big.

Mr. Speaker, if you work, you should be better off than \nif you don't work. That is why, earlier this week, I introduced the \nDrug Testing for Welfare Recipients Act.

The government should expect the same of \npeople who receive welfare benefits. If recipients can't meet the basic \nstandards of employment, in essence, they are trapped in a cycle of \nwelfare dependency.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe this bill is one step in the right direction \nto improve our welfare programs, and I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this commonsense bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5187-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5187-H5188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE CARLTON COMPLEX WILDFIRE\n\n  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE.

It is a sad day.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are becoming a more compassionate pro-life Nation \neach and every day, and all of us must speak out against these barbaric \npractices. We must ensure that these providers are prosecuted under the \nlaw, and we should pass whatever legislation necessary to ensure that \nwe appropriately punish these heartless acts.\n  We should also ensure that not one penny of American tax dollars goes \nto Planned Parenthood or any organization that performs or profits off \nof abortion.

Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported a rule, H. Res. 362, providing for consideration of two very \nimportant pieces of legislation: H.R. 2898, which is the Western Water \nand American Food Act of 2015, and H.R. 3038, the Highway and \nTransportation Funding Act of 2015, Part II.\n  The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2898 under a structured \nrule, with eight amendments made in order that are evenly split between \nDemocratic and Republican Members of this body. The rule also provides \nfor consideration of H.R. 3038 under a closed rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, this rule will allow us to consider the Western Water \nand American Food Act, which is an important bill that will help us \nrespond to the severe water shortages facing California, which I am \nsure many of you have heard, and much of the Western United States. \nMany people are confronting the worst drought that they have seen in \nmany, many years, and a growing number of communities across the West \nhave been acutely impacted by these arid conditions.\n  While this crisis has been caused by the drought, our environmental \nlaws, as well as misguided and outdated regulatory restrictions, have \nexacerbated the situation. This bill addresses these policy failures \nand seeks to alleviate the impacts of drought in the short and in the \nlong term.\n  My own district in central Washington is dealing with serious water \nsupply shortages. Actually, the whole State is declared a drought area. \nThese are impacting the agriculture, energy, and manufacturing sectors, \nas well as families and small businesses that rely on an adequate and \nstable supply of water. These conditions are also increasing the threat \nof dangerous wildfires and increasing the likelihood of catastrophic \nwildfire, which could destroy homes, businesses, and large amounts of \nland, as well as crippling many communities throughout the West.\n  Over the past 2 weeks in my State of Washington, we have already seen \nwildfire outbreaks across the State in cities like Wenatchee and Quincy \nand counties such as Benton, Grant, Adams, and Douglas. Sadly, with an \nextremely low snowpack and continuing drought conditions, we are likely \nto see even more fires.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a third-generation farmer, I know firsthand the \nchallenges facing many in our Western agricultural communities and the \ncritically important role that water plays in agriculture's success. In \nrecognition of this fact, earlier this year, I introduced H.R. 2097, \nthe Bureau of Reclamation Surface Water Storage Streamlining Act. This \nmeasure will speed up Reclamation's feasibility study process on \nsurface water storage, spurring the development of new projects across \nthe West, and I was very proud to have it included in this essential \nlegislation that we are considering today.\n  Water is not just a resource, it is the lifeblood of farming and \nranching communities all across the West, and we must act swiftly and \ndecisively to mitigate the impacts of this crisis that we are facing. \nThe importance of water to agriculture production cannot be overstated, \nand we must take steps to support this vital industry that is \nresponsible for feeding billions of people around the globe. In fact, \ntoday, I am proud to say, the average American farmer is responsible \nfor feeding upwards of 144 people, a drastic increase from just 50 \nyears ago when that number was around 25.\n  The reason for this change is simple and complex. Our modern farmers \nare growing more disease- and pest-resistant crops that require less \nwater, less pesticides, and better conserve our natural resources. \nAlthough modern agriculture allows us to use less water for agriculture \nto flourish, we still must have a reliable supply of water.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Western Water and American Food Act represents a \ncomprehensive and bipartisan approach aimed at alleviating the \ndrought's impacts through short-term and long-term measures. This bill \nwill address the root causes of the crisis: complex and inconsistent \nlaws, faulty court decisions, and onerous regulations at the State and \nFederal level that have exacerbated an already devastating drought.\n  In California and across the West, millions are facing water \nshortages and rationing, yet many of the drought's damaging effects are \npreventable. H.R. 2898 aims to fix our broken regulatory system and \nbring our water infrastructure into the 21st century. This bill gives \nimmediate relief to millions of Americans facing mandatory water \nrationing and invests in new water storage facilities to prepare for \nfuture droughts. Additionally, it will provide farmers with the \ncertainty they need to produce the majority of our Nation's fruits and \nvegetables, which feed our Nation, as well as people around the world.\n  This rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 3038, the Highway \nand Transportation Funding Act of 2015, Part II, a bill that will \nextend Federal surface transportation programs, as well as the \nhazardous materials transportation program and the Dingell-Johnson \nSport Fish Restoration Act, until December 18, 2015, and fund these \nprograms at the fiscal year 2014 authorized level. This extension will \nprovide the committee of jurisdiction with additional time to continue \ntheir important work towards a long-term highway and surface \ntransportation bill. Mr. Speaker, this extension will provide the House \nand Senate with time to work out a long-term surface transportation \nreauthorization bill in a bicameral, bipartisan manner.\n  Every State transportation department in the country currently has \nnumerous multiyear transportation projects that would benefit greatly \nfrom the increased certainty a 6-year transportation bill would \nprovide. My hope, and I think the hope of everyone in this Chamber, is \nthat this short-term extension gives us time to reach an agreement that \ncan provide certainty for all of our constituents.\n  Additionally, this legislation will also allow us to work on a \nresolution for the highway trust fund, which is facing a $90 billion \nshortfall. Failing to address the trust fund would have disastrous \nimpacts across our country. If the trust fund were to go insolvent, \nmany State transportation and infrastructure projects would grind to a \nhalt, leading to furloughed workers and lost capital from investments \non existing projects. The cost of shutting down and then restarting all \nof these projects would be astronomical and would end up costing our \ntaxpayers much more in the long run.\n  Mr. Speaker, another short-term extension is not what any of us would \nhave wanted. Our States need certainty, and that will only come from a \nlong-term transportation authorization. While the bill before us may \nnot be what we all would have preferred, it is a good stepping stone to \nsomething greater. I believe passing H.R. 3038 is the right thing to do \nand will allow us to consider a long-term, 6-year authorization in the \nvery near future.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule, allowing for \nconsideration of two critically important pieces of legislation. H.R. \n2898 will help drought-stricken communities in the West by providing \ncritically needed reforms to the broken regulatory system, as well as \nbipartisan solutions to help provide relief to families, farms, the \nenvironment, and the American economy. H.R. 3038 will ensure that many \nimportant transportation programs do not lapse and will extend the \nhighway trust fund expenditure authority, guaranteeing that this vital \nfund will remain solvent and available for infrastructure projects \nacross the country while working towards a lasting solution.\n\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I support the rule's adoption, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support both the rule and the underlying bills.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman, my friend, Mr. \nNewhouse, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.\n  Mr. Speaker, we already know what H.R. 2898 and H.R. 3038 are called, \nbut they are follow-up legislation to the short-term temporary \ntransportation funding bill that was signed into law last May. I am \ntroubled by a number of issues concerning the rule and underlying bills \nthat we are considering today.\n  First, as I have stated on numerous occasions, I take serious issue \nwith the manner in which the majority has chosen to consider \nlegislation in this\n\n[[Page H5190]]\n\nChamber. Grouping or combining multiple, unrelated pieces of \nlegislation into one rule has become the new normal, precluding the \nMembers of this body from making informed judgments about the proper \nfloor procedure for each measure and creating often confusing debates \nabout an assortment of unconnected issues. The majority's insistence on \nthe continued use of grab-bag rules prevents the thoughtful \ndeliberation that important legislation requires and does both the \nMembers of this Chamber and the American people an immeasurable \ndisservice.\n  Next, there are now only 9 legislative days remaining before Congress \nrecesses in August, and much important work remains. For example, \nmillions of Americans continue to suffer dire economic ramifications \nfrom the GOP's failure to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, the \ncharter for which expired June 30.\n  The Ex-Im Bank supported 164,000 private sector American jobs in \nfiscal year 2014, alone, and over 1.3 million jobs since 2009. What is \nmore, the Ex-Im Bank has received the support of the last 13 \nPresidents, Republicans and Democrats, including Ronald Reagan, George \nH. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. It is high time \nRepublicans allow a vote on its reauthorization.\n  In the face of realities such as these, Republicans in Congress \ncontinue to put forward legislation for consideration that has very \nlittle bipartisan support and stands even less chance of becoming law. \nIndeed, President Obama has issued a Statement of Administration Policy \nadvising that, if he is presented with H.R. 2898, the Water bill we are \nconsidering today, he will veto it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include that Statement for the Record.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n    h.r. 2898--western water and american food security act of 2015\n\n                  (Rep. Valadao, R-CA, July 14, 2015)\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2898, the Western \n     Water and American Food Security Act of 2015, because it \n     fails to address critical elements of California's complex \n     water challenges and will, if enacted, impede an effective \n     and timely response to the continuing drought while providing \n     no additional water to hard hit communities. Like similar \n     legislation in the last Congress, H.R. 2898 was developed \n     with little input from the public, the Administration, or key \n     stakeholders affected by the drought. The urgency and \n     seriousness of the California drought requires a balanced and \n     flexible approach that promotes water reliability and \n     ecosystem restoration.\n       Specifically, H.R. 2898 dictates operational decisions and \n     imposes a new legal standard which could actually limit water \n     supplies by creating new and confusing conflicts with \n     existing laws, adding an unnecessary layer of complexity to \n     Federal and State cooperation. This additional standard could \n     slow decision-making, generate significant litigation, and \n     limit real-time operational flexibility critical to \n     maximizing water delivery. And, contrary to current and past \n     Federal reclamation law that defers to State water law, the \n     bill would preempt California water law.\n       In addition, H.R. 2898 directs specific operations \n     inconsistent with the Endangered Species Act (ESA), thereby \n     resulting in conditions that could be detrimental to the \n     Delta fish and other species listed under Federal and State \n     endangered species laws.\n       The Administration strongly supports efforts to help \n     alleviate the effects of drought in the West; however, the \n     Administration is concerned with section 401, which \n     establishes deadlines for completing feasibility studies for \n     certain water storage projects. The provision is unnecessary \n     and the dates provided in the bill could prevent the \n     participation of non-Federal partners in certain studies and \n     may inhibit the Administration's ability to consider a full \n     range of options for addressing these issues. In addition, \n     financial penalties levied upon the Bureau of Reclamation \n     under section 403 for not meeting these deadlines would only \n     undermine the Department of the Interior's ability to help \n     address the effects of drought in the West.\n       Much of the bill contains provisions that have little \n     connection to the ongoing drought. The bill includes language \n     constraining the Administration's ability to protect the \n     commercial and tribal fishery on the Trinity and Klamath \n     Rivers, which will have impacts not just in California, but \n     throughout the west coast. The bill would also repeal the San \n     Joaquin River Settlement Agreement, which the Congress \n     enacted to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation. Full \n     repeal of the settlement agreement would likely result in the \n     resumption of costly litigation, creating an uncertain future \n     for river restoration and water delivery operations for water \n     users on the San Joaquin River.\n       Californians are facing significant drought-related \n     challenges. This is why the Administration has directed \n     Federal agencies to work with state and local officials in \n     real-time to maximize limited water supplies, prioritize \n     public health and safety, meet state water quality \n     requirements, and ensure a balanced approach to providing for \n     the water needs of people, agriculture, businesses, power, \n     imperiled species and the environment. Consistent with the \n     2015 Interagency Drought Strategy, the Administration and \n     Federal agencies have partnered with state agencies in \n     California to improve coordination of water operations in the \n     state. In June, the Administration announced new actions and \n     investments of more than $110 million to support workers, \n     farmers, and rural communities suffering from drought and to \n     combat wildfires. This builds on the more than $190 million \n     that agencies across the Federal government have invested to \n     support drought-stricken communities so far this year. \n     Unfortunately, H.R. 2898 would undermine these efforts and \n     the progress that has been made.\n       For these reasons, if the President were presented with \n     H.R. 2898, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \n     the bill.\n\n  Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, even more offensive, in a \ndisplay of colossal incompetence, last week, the Republican leadership \nwas forced to pull their entire Interior Appropriations bill to protect \ntheir Conference from having to defend the display of the Confederate \nbattle flag on Federal lands, imagery long recognized as a symbol of \nhatred and intolerance. As a result, funding for critically important \nagencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, whose programs \nprotect wildlife, the environment, and public health, continues to hang \nin the balance.\n  This rule first provides for consideration of H.R. 2898, the Western \nWater and American Food Security Act of 2015, which Republicans claim \nwill alleviate the drought crisis currently unfolding in California and \nother Western States, but this bill is just another example of the \ncountless partisan attempts made by the majority to roll back important \nenvironmental protections while also preempting State laws. Let me put \na footnote right there, ``preempting State laws.'' These are the people \nthat argue State rights and now would preempt them in Western portions \nof our great country, particularly California, reducing water \nmanagement flexibility.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill undercuts the Endangered Species Act by \nchanging the well-defined standard used to determine when an action \nnegatively affects an endangered species and introduces an untested, \nundefined standard.\n  As evidenced by this piece of legislation, the Republicans' solution \nto the drought crisis is to provide handouts to big agricultural \ninterests at the expense of the environment and everyone else.\n  I want to make it very clear that I represent agricultural interests \nas do my colleagues who are Republicans. We represent all of the \nspecialty crops and sugarcane grown, and we understand these dynamics \nvery well.\n  Not only will this bill scale back desperately needed environmental \nprotections, it will affect thousands of fishing jobs in California and \nOregon that local residents depend on.\n  Given the changing standard of the Endangered Species Act, this bill \nwill dramatically weaken protections for salmon and other fish and \nwildlife in California's Bay-Delta Estuary.\n  This bill claims to help California, but even California doesn't want \nit. California's own Secretary of Natural Resources has said that this \nbill--and let me quote him--will ``reignite water wars, move water \npolicy back into the courts, and try to pit one part of the State \nagainst another.''\n  This bill will elevate the water rights for certain agricultural \ncontractors over the existing water rights that benefit refuges and \nwildlife areas.\n  In short, this bill circumvents California's groundbreaking equitable \nwater conservation programs and puts the desires of big agriculture \nover everyone else.\n  This combined rule also provides for the consideration of H.R. 3038, \ntermed the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015, Part II, \nbecause it is yet another short-term, temporary patch to ensure that \nthe highway trust fund does not become insolvent.\n  It is a patch. It is the ninth time we are patching. If you had a \ntire and were riding down a highway and if every time you looked up you \nhad to have another patch, pretty soon you would recognize that you \nwould need new tires.\n\n[[Page H5191]]\n\nWhat we need in this country is a 6-year highway bill.\n  Back in May, Congress passed and the President signed a bill we can \nnow appropriately call the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of \n2015, Part I.\n  At that time, we were assured by our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle that a multiyear bill that would provide the long-term \nfunding certainty and stability needed to keep transportation and \nconstruction projects operating was on the horizon. That was in May.\n  We were promised, Mr. Speaker, that if we voted to provide funding \nthrough July 31, the comprehensive, multiyear highway bill America so \ndesperately needs would become a reality in time to avoid any \ninsolvency.\n  Unfortunately, today we find ourselves in the same situation as we \ndid in May. I just heard my good friend from Washington make the \nargument that, in the next 6 months, we will be able to work together \nto do the things necessary for a 6-year highway bill. I am paraphrasing \nwhat he said.\n  As we had in May, today we have a rapidly approaching, self-imposed \ndeadline and are frantically seeking an interim fix. Like its \npredecessor, this highway bill does nothing to address the long-term \nsolvency of the highway trust fund.\n  There is one thing I have learned here about kicking the can down the \nroad: If kicking the can down the road were an Olympic sport, here in \nthe United States Congress, we would win gold, we would win bronze, we \nwould win silver, and we would win aluminum for kicking the can down \nthe road.\n  Instead, we are again being asked to vote for legislation that would \nkeep the highway trust fund solvent through December 18.\n  Note the date of December 18, just before Christmas, so that we can \nplay the game: ``If you don't vote for this next patch--if we don't do \n6 years--then we will keep you here until Christmas without the \nnecessary assurances that a long-term bill will become a reality.''\n  This is no way to govern. Our insistence on kicking the can down the \nroad does nothing to protect American jobs or to invest in critical \ninfrastructure that every man and woman in this House of \nRepresentatives recognizes is desperately needed in this Nation of \nfalling bridges and pock-marked roads.\n  Finally, investing in our Nation's infrastructure and, indeed, in our \nNation's future will require us to make tough choices.\n  Instead of considering raising the Federal gas tax--I said the ugly \nwords, ``Federal gas tax''--which is the primary source of funding for \nthe highway trust fund--and it has not been increased since 1993, \npeople--this bill seeks to cut taxes on liquefied natural gas and \nliquefied petroleum gas at a cost of $90 million over the next decade.\n  Any comprehensive highway bill must consider, in part, addressing the \nFederal gas tax. Why don't we just face up to that, go to our \nconstituents and explain it to them so they will understand that this \nis a desperate need for this entire Nation.\n  Our failure to come together to pass a multiyear transportation bill \nyear after year has resulted in 65 percent of our Nation's roads being \nrated ``deficient.'' All you have to do is drive around Washington to \nrecognize that.\n  It has left 25 percent of our Nation's bridges in disrepair, and it \nhas left 45 percent of Americans without access to transit.\n  This failure has far-reaching and devastating implications and must \nbe addressed with thoughtful and meaningful bipartisan legislation that \nwill provide the certainty and consistency required to fuel jobs and \nkeep the highways and other transportation infrastructure safe.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I share the gentleman from Florida's enthusiasm for the important \nwork that is in front of this Congress. These combined rules offer us \nthe opportunity to bring forward important legislation at a critical \ntime in as efficient a way as possible.\n  I am excited, as a freshman Congressman, to be able to be a part of \nthis institution, certainly, but to be able to do this hard work that \nwe have in front of us. We have a lot to do, and doing it in this way \nallows us to get these important things done very quickly.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nValadao), a young man who shares a very interesting perspective because \nhe is living the drought conditions that we just read about in the \nState of California. He is the author of this important bill we have \nbefore us, and he is a resident of Hanford, California.\n  Mr. VALADAO. I thank the gentleman from Washington for his help with \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, a little bit on the history of the Valley and the area \nthat I represent. It is an area filled with immigrants.\n  When you look at my district and when you look at the people I \nrepresent, 80 percent of them are minorities. One of the reasons I feel \nthat I had the opportunity to be elected and the honor of being able to \nrepresent that district is due to my own background.\n\n  My dad came to this country in 1969 as a new immigrant. He didn't \nspeak English as well as he should have, and still, to this day, he \nspeaks with a very strong accent, as does my mom.\n  When my dad started working in plants and trying to save money so \nthat he could start his own farm someday and give us the opportunity to \nhave the American Dream, he learned to speak Spanish while working \nalongside a lot of Hispanic folks.\n  While working really hard and saving his money, he had the \nopportunity to save enough money to actually buy some cattle and work \nhis way up to the point at which he actually owned some land.\n  When we look at an opportunity for the American Dream, when we listen \nto people talk about the opportunity to be successful and protect the \nsmall business guy, I am that guy.\n  I am the guy who had that opportunity because of my parents, because \nof their hard work. I have been in that struggle. I don't just \nrepresent them in Congress, I am that face. I am that person who had \nthat opportunity because of that hard work.\n  When we see the struggle and when someone claims to tell me or to \ntell us on our side what those struggles are really like and how this \npiece of legislation has an impact only for the largest of the large, \nwhen you raise the cost of water because you restrict the amount of \nwater that we have delivered to the Valley, it hurts the smallest guy \nthe most.\n  Those people I represent, that 80 percent minority district, are \nseeing unemployment numbers as high as 50 percent because those farmers \nare not getting that water. Those food lines are starting to grow, \nlines that I stood in, where I helped serve food. It is food that was \ngrown in other countries because we can no longer grow it in the \nValley.\n  These are all people that my friends across the aisle claim to \nrepresent, but they don't, because they don't have that background and \nthey didn't have that opportunity to be there to work with them and to \ngrow up in that life where they had to work before and after school \nlike I did--drive a tractor, feed calves, and do all that different \ntype of stuff--because that is what the American Dream is all about: \nworking, saving your money, and having that opportunity.\n  It is also about having government at their backs. But, right now \ngovernment is making it more and more difficult for that little guy. \nWater has gotten so expensive because you have the large cities coming \nin and spending a bunch of money so that water is going right through \nthe Valley to the southern portion.\n  All we are asking for in this piece of legislation is for some common \nsense, common sense that says: ``Let's look at what science we are \nusing.'' If we are going to protect a species, show me the evidence \nthat meets and actually delivers the protection of species.\n  We have lived through two decades of this, and now we are seeing that \nthe endangered species they claim to want to protect is on the verge of \nannihilation, almost gone, extinct, after delivering almost no water.\n  We have gotten an allocation over these past few years of zero \npercent. We are not asking for a lot of water. We are not asking to be \ntaught how to conserve water. We have done that. We have reached that \npoint.\n\n[[Page H5192]]\n\n  We are at zero. We have got zero water, and we have got high \nunemployment numbers. We have got people standing in line, asking for \nfood and begging for help, when all they want to do is work an honest \nliving and provide for their families and for their neighbors.\n  We have seen too much suffering. It is getting old. We need to pass \nlegislation. We need people who are sincere in this conversation to \nshow up and show some courage and vote for this legislation.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  When the gentleman speaks of growing up in that area, my father grew \nup in Griffin, Georgia, on a farm. My first job was on a farm. I picked \nbeans, I stripped celery, and I cut chicory. So I don't need lectures \nabout not understanding farming. I picked beans in Pahokee, Florida, \nwhich I am proud to represent now as their Congressperson.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. \nWelch), my good friend.\n  Mr. WELCH. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, America needs a long-term, sustainably funded surface \ntransportation bill. You know it. I know it. The Governors in all of \nour States know it. We need it to repair our roads and bridges and to \nfix our crumbling infrastructure.\n  Every single one of the 435 Members in this body has needs in his \ndistrict. Speaker Boehner has 136 deficient bridges in his district. \nLeader Pelosi has 29. In my State of Vermont, we have 252 structurally \ndeficient bridges. A photo of one of them is right here. It is \ndisgraceful and it is unnecessary.\n  Yet, instead of facing up to this problem that we all share and doing \nsomething that a proud and confident country would do--invest in its \nfuture--with reckless irresponsibility, we are acting, once again, to \ndodge our duty with yet another short-term extension of our highway \nbill.\n  This time, the plan is a bold extension for 5 months, through \nDecember 18. Can our transportation agencies really plan a bridge \nreplacement or a major repair in the next 5 months?\n  By the way, how is it paid for? It is not by asking users to pay, \nwhich has traditionally been the way we have funded our roads and \nbridges, but by, in this case, among other dubious devices.\n  We are asking airline passengers 10 years from now to pay a few \nbillion dollars to fix our highways tomorrow. Think about it. Airline \npassengers in 10 years--2025--will pay for road repairs we make \ntomorrow.\n  By the way, this resort to gimmicks is not new. It has become a \nhabit. This is the 35th short-term extension in the past 6 years. The \nlast one in July of 2014 was paid for by the gimmick of all gimmicks, \npension smoothing. We created a pothole in somebody's pension in the \nfuture to fix a pothole in his highway today.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need a long-term plan. We need it first to restore \nsome semblance of duty and responsibility to this House of \nRepresentatives that has failed to do its job.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  We need to have those 600,000 good-paying jobs start digging dirt and \nfixing those roads and bridges, and we need it to make America more \ncompetitive.\n  Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. I urge you to join me in voting ``no'' \nto this joke of a short-term plan. No more Band-Aids, no more patches, \nno more smoke and mirrors, no more gimmicks.\n  American contractors and workers are ready to do their job. It is \ntime for Congress to do its job and pass a long-term highway \ntransportation bill.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I was just handed a Statement of \nAdministration Policy from the Executive Office of the President, a \nstatement of his policy position on H.R. 3038. It says:\n\n       The administration supports passage of H.R. 3038 to give \n     the House and Senate the necessary time to work on a long-\n     term bill this year that increases investment to meet the \n     needs of the Nation's infrastructure.\n\n  I just wanted to add that to the Record.\n  At this time, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. \nHardy), a fellow freshman, a gentleman from the scenic Virgin Valley of \nNevada.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from \nWashington for yielding me time to speak on the rule of this vital \npiece of legislation, H.R. 2898, the Western Water and American Food \nSecurity Act.\n  Coming from Nevada, the Nation's most arid State, we continue to \nbattle a drought in all 17 counties. At no time in recent memory has \nthe significance and proactivity of managing our water resources across \nthe West been more important.\n  I can sympathize with my colleagues from across the neighboring State \nof California, who are also facing the fourth consecutive year of \ndrought. We obviously cannot afford to keep this status quo.\n  As the only Member of Nevada's House delegation on the Committee on \nNatural Resources, I take a great deal of pride in speaking up for my \nconstituents and the people of my State on important issues facing our \ncommunities. Those communities are affected by the droughts currently \naffecting California's Central Valley, the source of so much of our \nNation's food.\n  For those in my district and around the country who are still \nbattling to get this economic recovery, they can ill afford to pay more \nof their hard-earned income at the supermarket to feed their families.\n  As the son of farmer-ranchers from southeastern Nevada, I feel for \nthe hard-working farmers whose suffering is being made worse by \nburdensome environmental laws and the failure of our elected leaders to \nprovide adequate water infrastructure to meet the ever-growing demands \nof the 21st century. Though long overdue, we have a real opportunity to \nprovide some commonsense solutions to this very dire situation.\n  Again, I would like to thank the gentleman from Washington for \nyielding me some time. I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a \n``yes'' on the underlying bill.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, would you be kind enough to advise how \nmuch time remains on both sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington has 13 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Florida has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Hahn), my good friend.\n  Ms. HAHN. I thank my colleague from Florida for allowing me these few \nminutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to explain why I am voting against this \nrule today. As has been said, California is now in the fourth year of a \nrecord drought. In response, our State and local governments have \nimplemented mandatory conservation measures, but we also need to think \nabout how we will increase our water supply.\n  The bill that the House will consider today does not do that. It just \nmoves water from one need to another. That is why I attempted to offer \nan amendment to address present and current water needs. However, my \namendment was not made in order by the Committee on Rules.\n  My father, who was Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenny Hahn, had an \nidea in the 1970s to build a water pipeline from Alaska to California. \nThe idea was never completely investigated but continues to have merit; \ntherefore, I believe that the Department of the Interior should study \nthe feasibility of a water pipeline network, linking our Nation's \nFederal reservoirs to transport water from wet regions to the dry \nregions in this country. That is what I thought my amendment would \naccomplish.\n  My proposal, I thought, was a first step in building pipelines from \nregions that have more than enough water to regions that do not. If we \ncan transport oil via pipeline, we should be able to do the same thing \nwith water. I am disappointed that the Committee on Rules did not find \nthis amendment in order. It was a study to determine if this idea is \nfeasible.\n  I believe a water pipeline and other creative ideas to increase our \nwater supply should be studied. I would think Mr. Valadao, my fellow \nCalifornian, would support an idea like this that we could consider.\n  To ensure that California and other States have enough water for our \nresidents and other needs, even during periods of drought now and in \nthe future, I think Congress should encourage and support efforts \nleading to these kinds of creative solutions.\n\n[[Page H5193]]\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Nunes), a young man from the San Joaquin Valley to add \nto the California voice.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the fine gentleman from Washington \nfrom the Committee on Rules and, of course, Chairman Sessions for, \nagain, bringing a water bill to the floor of the House.\n  Five years ago, we passed a water bill very similar to this. It was \nin a year where we had abundant rainfall. Unfortunately, that rain was \nnot captured. The water flowed right out to the ocean and was wasted. \nWe have continued to dump water out to the ocean over the last 4 years. \nEven today, we are continuing to dump water out to the ocean.\n  When I hear my colleagues talk about drought, yes, we are in the \nthird year of a drought, a very bad drought; but, in fact, the founding \nfathers of our State built the water systems to withstand 5 years of \ndrought.\n  Back from 1987 to 1992--it is a drought that I still remember and \nmany of my constituents remember--we really didn't have harsh problems \nuntil that fifth year of the drought. Since that time, places down in \nLos Angeles have built big water storage projects--in our area, no new \nwater storage projects, only taking water away.\n  You go to 1992; they pass the Central Valley Project Improvement Act \nthat took a million acre feet away and dumped it out to the ocean. In \n2009, the San Joaquin River Act took another 250,000 acre feet and \nwasted it. In addition to that, you have had lawsuits brought forth by \nthe Endangered Species Act by radical environmental groups that have \ntaken the rest of the water away.\n  The reason we don't have any water is not because of drought; it is \nbecause we didn't hold the water when we had a chance to hold the water \nand keep the water and use it and spread it throughout the State of \nCalifornia.\n  In fact, it is unfortunate to say because I don't wish ill on the \npeople in San Francisco or the Silicon Valley, but they get their water \nfrom our area that they actually pipe over, instead of contributing to \nthe environment.\n  Now, I don't want the people of San Francisco to lose their water, \nbut at the same time, the people of San Francisco shouldn't be willing \nto forfeit and give up our water that we rightfully own while they are \ntaking some of ours and not contributing to the fish populations that, \nno matter how much water we put down, down the river and out to the \nocean, the fish continue to die.\n  At some point, you would think that people would step back and say: \nWell, if flushing water out to the ocean doesn't work and hasn't helped \nthe fish populations, then we should stop doing that.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui) to add further perspective \nfrom California.\n  Ms. MATSUI. I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2898. California is \nin the fourth year of a devastating drought, and what is on the House \nfloor today does nothing to address the crisis, but, rather, it sets \nCalifornia back by fanning the flames of century-old water wars.\n\n  The story of California and the West's drought is known across the \ncountry because it is unprecedented. Not only has our annual rainfall \nplummeted, but for the first time in our history, California has no \nsnowpack--none. The snow in the Sierras once sustained us through the \ndry summers and replenished our streams with cold water, but not this \nyear.\n  Folsom Reservoir, just upstream from the city of Sacramento, is \nprojected to be at the lowest it has been by the end of September, less \nthan 15 percent of capacity. This is not due to government \nmismanagement or environmental restrictions; it is due to the lack of \nrain.\n  We need real solutions to this crisis, short- and long-term \nsolutions. There are no silver bullet solutions. It is an all-of-the-\nabove approach, and it should certainly not be the fear-mongering \nlegislation like H.R. 2898.\n  For the short term, our State has used the flexibility it already has \nto move the water and make timely deliveries to make the best of this \nvery, very bad situation. We also need to continue our conservation \nefforts and fix our infrastructure where there are leaks and wastes, \nbut that is just for the short term.\n  In the long term, we need to be investing in wastewater recycling, \nabove- and below-ground water storage, and new technologies to help us \nmonitor our water use on demand.\n  I have introduced a sensible bill that will allow wastewater \nrecycling projects to move forward much more quickly with Federal \nsupport. We should be debating solutions like that and not wasting \ntime, yet again, on a bill that does not solve the real problem.\n  As the daughter of a Central Valley farmer and the granddaughter of \nanother, I grew up on a farm, and I deeply understand the value of and \nthe controversy over water. In northern California, we have done our \nbest to balance our watershed to provide water for our farms, our \ncities, and the environment.\n  To say that this bill will help the drought is grossly misleading \nand, frankly, irresponsible. Mr. Speaker, even if we pump as much water \nsouth as possible, it still wouldn't be enough.\n  The problem is a lack of rain. There is simply no more water to pump \nfrom the delta. This bill only further divides our State. My district, \nthe city of Sacramento, the Sacramento region, and northern California \nas a whole strongly opposes this bill.\n  Some of the concerns that have been raised include the loss of the \nState's right to manage its own water; the decimation of environmental \nprotections for our Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta; the ability to manage \nFolsom Reservoir for the benefit of the Sacramento metropolitan area; \nand, most importantly, the overall instability that this bill will \ncreate in California.\n  We cannot afford to give up California's right to control its own \nwater future. The stakes are too high. I urge my colleagues to strongly \nreject this legislation.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nLawrenceville, Georgia (Mr. Woodall), a fellow member of the Committee \non Rules.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend on the Committee on Rules \nfor yielding and appreciate what he is doing down here today.\n  Mr. Speaker, you serve on the Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure, as I do; you know how important it is that we get to \nthese infrastructure questions. I see colleague after colleague after \ncolleague coming and saying we need long-term solutions to \ninfrastructure. What I don't see is any colleague coming and saying \nthat those long-term solutions are available to us, as we stand here \ntoday.\n  I don't have to get everything I want in this institution, Mr. \nSpeaker, but I do have to move the ball forward. Three yards and a \ncloud of dust is what I tell constituents back home is the way we are \ngoing to get what we all want for this country; and if the answer is to \nsit on your hands and do nothing for this thing that has been so vexing \nto this institution, we are looking at 34, 35 extensions.\n  We have an opportunity to put a stop to it. The Senate, in its \nwildest imaginations, says maybe we can get a 4-year deal; most likely, \nit will be an 18-month deal. When I turn to the chairman of the \nCommittee on Ways and Means here in the House, when I turn to the \nchairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in the \nHouse, they say: Colleagues, give me 5 months, and we can do it right.\n  Colleagues, give me 5 months, and we will do what no other Congress \nhas been able to do for nearly a decade. Give us 5 months, and we will \ndeliver on not just the promises, but the expectations that every \nsingle American has.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  My colleagues, we have gotten in the business of telling the American \npeople that they can have their roads for free, and that is not true. \nIf you want better roads to drive on, you have got to provide the money \nto make that happen.\n  For years, our solution has been to transfer general fund revenues \ninto the user fee-funded transportation account. User fees mean that \npeople who benefit from it pay for it.\n\n[[Page H5194]]\n\n  I have never bumped into an American who didn't believe they ought to \npay for what they use. I have never bumped into an American who didn't \nbelieve that paying their fair share was at the fabric of who we are as \na nation.\n  This rule gives us the best chance we have, and the best chance we \nhave had in a decade, to make transportation certainty a reality for \nthis country. It means better roads. It means more savings of taxpayer \ndollars. It means better efficiency. It means more accountability.\n  I am grateful to my friend on the Rules Committee for bringing this \nrule forward and giving me an opportunity to cast my ``yes'' vote on \nthis rule and a ``yes'' vote on the underlying bill. Five months to a \nbetter solution for America.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I will keep my good friend from Georgia's \nstatement for him on December 18, and remind him of what he said.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer), my good friend.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I listened to my friend from Georgia talking about 5 \nmonths and we will be able to finally fix this. I actually have in my \nhand my speech from 1 year ago today speaking on the rule where we \ndodged the bullet again, and I said at that time I could pull out some \nof my other speeches. All this does is let people off the hook.\n  Why didn't we fix it last fall or this spring? My good friend from \nWashington used to serve in the State legislature. His State \nlegislature just passed a 15-cent gas tax increase, joining a list of \nsix States, all Republican States, that have raised the gas tax this \nyear.\n  My friend from Georgia says he has never met anybody that doesn't \nreally want to pay for their infrastructure. Well, he ought to take a \nhard look at his leadership. They have denied an opportunity to move \nforward with something championed by Ronald Reagan in 1982, when the \ngas tax, at his direction, under his leadership, was raised 125 \npercent.\n  There is no excuse to keep torturing people at the State and local \ngovernment level to stop enabling people to avoid their responsibility \nhere.\n  My good friend, Mr. DeFazio, is on the floor. In 2 months, he and \nBill Shuster, the chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee, could give us a 6-year bill, but Congress has to give them a \nnumber.\n  Does anybody in their right mind think that we are going to go into \n2016, with half the people in the other body running for President, \nholidays, treaties? Think again. It is a fool's errand. We ought to \nstep up, follow Ronald Reagan's lead, replenish the gas tax, and get on \nwith work.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I would inquire how much time is \nremaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Simpson). The gentleman from Washington \nhas 8\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Florida has 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will \noffer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3064, a comprehensive, \n6-year surface transportation bill that is partially paid for by \nrestricting U.S. companies from using so-called inversion to shirk \ntheir tax obligations.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. DeFazio), my good friend and the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, who will discuss our \nproposal.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  As we have heard, a year ago today, the House passed a temporary \nextension of 1 year. Chairman Ryan of the Ways and Means Committee, who \nwas supposed to figure out how to pay for this, said we will use this \nyear to put the transportation highway trust fund on a sustainable path \nso we can avoid stopgap legislation in the future.\n  Well, that didn't happen, but they were occupied with much more \nimportant things. For instance, they said that estates worth more than \n$10 million shouldn't pay a penny in taxes--none, zero. That cost $289 \nbillion. If we had dedicated that to surface transportation, we could \nhave basically doubled spending over 10 years.\n  So today, the Democrats are here to offer a real, 6-year, long-term \nincrease in investment in America's failing infrastructure.\n  There are 140,000 bridges that need repair or replacement on the \nNational Highway System. Forty percent of the pavement is at the point \nwhere you have to dig up the underlayment and rebuild the whole road.\n  We have an $84 billion backlog just bringing our existing transit \nsystems up to a state of good repair. It is so bad that people are \ndying on Metro here in Washington, D.C., because of the decrepit \ncondition of the system.\n  With the Buy America rules, we would create a phenomenal number of \njobs. In fact, under our funding proposal in our bill, we would create \nan additional 300,000 jobs a year. And we need those jobs here in \nAmerica, and they are good-paying jobs. They are not just construction \njobs. They are engineering, they are technical, they are small \nbusiness, and they are minority business enterprises. They are a whole \nhost of things that would lift the whole economy--make us more energy \nefficient, make Americans save money getting out of congestion, not \ndriving their cars through giant potholes and incurring costs--but the \nRepublicans can't figure out how to get there.\n  Well, we are offering an alternative--a good, solid, 6-year bill. \nYes, we haven't figure out the 6-year funding yet because you guys are \ntotally opposed to user fees, despite Ronald Reagan and Dwight \nEisenhower and the history of the Republican Party on user fees, and \nalso former chairman of the committee, Bud Shuster, who joined with the \nDemocrats in 1993, the last time when we raised the Federal gas tax to \n18.3 cents a gallon.\n  We would fund 2 years of this bill by prohibiting corporate \ninversions; i.e., Benedict Arnold corporations that continue to have \nall of their operations in America but go overseas and buy some minor \nentity and claim that is their international headquarters, like a \ncorner drug store somewhere in London for a pharmaceutical company. It \nis an outrageous practice. While they enjoy all the benefits of America \nand all the protections of our law and our military and all those \ncosts, they don't want to pay, and they don't want to pay for \ntransportation either.\n  So we are offering an alternative today. If we defeat the previous \nquestion, we would go into an open rule, something that never happens \nmuch around here, where both sides of the aisle, any Member of \nCongress, could offer an amendment to increase spending, decrease \nspending, target one or another part of the infrastructure that they \nfeel needs more investment.\n  So I urge my colleagues to defeat this rule, move to an open rule, \nsomething we were promised when the Republicans took over, and fund a \n6-year bill. We will give you 2 years of funding, and we can figure out \nthe rest over the next 2 years.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 4 minutes to \nthe distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen), my good \nfriend and the ranking member of the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Let me thank my friend from Florida (Mr. Hastings) \nand congratulate Mr. DeFazio and Mr. Blumenauer on all their work on \ntrying to modernize our national infrastructure. They know what every \nAmerican out there knows, which is that we have an embarrassing state \nof affairs when it comes to our roads, our bridges, and our \ntransitways.\n\n  It is not just them. We also know from the American Society of Civil \nEngineers, who are the nonpartisan pros, that they have concluded we \nhave failing infrastructure. They gave our infrastructure system a \ngrade of D-plus, a grade we should all be embarrassed by. But what is \neven worse is this Congress should get a grade of F for its refusal to \nactually do something about it.\n  So we are about to see an expiration of the authorization in a few \nweeks. Funding will dry out in a few weeks. And so what is the proposal \nfrom our Republican colleagues? Let's do 5 more months, through \nDecember, at a level they know is inadequate to help modernize our \ninfrastructure. That is their proposal.\n  As my colleagues have said, we have been here before, and we are \ntired of\n\n[[Page H5195]]\n\nBand-Aids. Who can plan to modernize their infrastructure with just a \n5-month time period?\n  These are major investments our States are making, major investments \nwe are making on behalf of our country, and to not have any kind of \ncertainty that the funds are going to be there after the end of \nDecember is something that is embarrassing for a country like the \nUnited States of America.\n  So we are proposing today to do the 6-year plan. Mr. DeFazio has put \nthat forward. The President has put forward the 6-year plan, the Grow \nAmerica plan, to modernize our infrastructure and grow more jobs in the \nprocess, and we fund the first 2-year installment. How do we fund it? \nWe fund through a mechanism that I will bet you virtually every \nAmerican will support, which is to close these pernicious tax loopholes \nthat are allowing American companies simply to move their mailing \naddress overseas in order to dodge their obligations to the American \npeople.\n  These companies are not moving their employees. They are not moving \ntheir management. They are not moving their factories or anything else. \nThey are just changing their mailing address by acquiring a small \noverseas company. It is called inversion. By doing that, they are \nescaping their responsibilities to their own country.\n  That is why my colleague called them Benedict Arnold corporations, \nbecause they are still benefiting from everything this country has to \noffer--educating their employees, the infrastructure that we do have, \nand all the other support structures they get--but they don't want to \npay for it. And when they don't pay for it, guess who pays for it. The \nAmerican people. Their taxes go up, or we have to borrow more on our \ncredit card to pay for it.\n  So what we are saying is let's stop these inversions. Let's use that \n$41 billion to fund the first 2-year installment of a robust \ninfrastructure plan. And we can do it now.\n  We have introduced the bill, H.R. 3064, introduced by Mr. DeFazio, \nmyself, Mr. Israel, Mr. Levin, Ms. Holmes Norton. The next vote we \nhave, the next vote we cast, will allow this body to take up that \nlegislation.\n  So we don't have to kick the can down the road for just 5 months with \nall that uncertainty. We can vote to do a robust 6-year plan, have a \nmodernized infrastructure, and pay for it by shutting down these \nloopholes that corporations are abusing.\n  Let's take that money that is right now going into the pockets of \npeople who are dodging our tax laws and invest in infrastructure. Let's \nget the job done today, not 5 months from now or a year from now. Let's \nget it done today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and defeat the \nprevious question so we can take it up.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Denham).\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, it is an important and critical time for the \nState of California. We are facing an unprecedented drought that is \naffecting farms, families, and communities that are just being shut off \nfrom water, communities that are not only rationing, but now having to \nhave water trucked in.\n  This has been an ongoing battle. This battle has been going on for \nyears. Some would say this is all due to climate change. But shouldn't \nwe as a country, shouldn't we as a State be focused on infrastructure \nthat will actually capture water so that we can save the water for \nyears like this rather than seeing huge unemployment levels?\n  Rather than seeing people waiting in lines to receive free food \nbecause they can't get a job, shouldn't we be making the simple fixes \nto actually store and capture our water?\n  The amendments that we heard earlier talk about desalinization. Sure, \nI am fine with desalinization. I think we ought to use every \nopportunity that we have. But rather than pushing all of our clean \nwater out into the ocean only to desalinate the salt water to bring it \nback into clean water, shouldn't we first start by saving the precious \nresources that we have?\n  So, sure, desalinization is a good idea, but it ought to be mixed in \nwith everything else that we do. We ought to have greater water \nstorage. We ought to be actually protecting the fish that we talk about \nprotecting. Let's actually address the predator fish that eat 95 to 98 \npercent of the fish that we are trying to save, spending millions of \ndollars not only trying to save them, but pushing out thousands of \nacre-feet of freshwater that would go to our communities, which would \ncreate thousands of jobs rather than seeing this huge population that \nbegins to see unemployment levels at record levels.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  We ought to do the restoration to the environment. We have a number \nof different tributaries that we entered into agreement on, bipartisan \nagreements, to actually address the restoration of that area.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Rather than restore the riverbeds themselves, we truck \nthe fish around the river. That doesn't help the environment; it \ndoesn't help the fish, and it certainly does not help the communities \nof California.\n  What the rest of the country needs to worry about is this shortage of \nfood, the scarcity of food that we will see across the country not only \nbeing sent from California, but the high prices that go with it.\n  You are affecting the American family; you are affecting the jobs in \nCalifornia, and it is time to fix this water situation on the West \nCoast and in the United States and in California and to do it now.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I have one more good gentleman from \nCalifornia I would like to hear from.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the young man from Richvale, California (Mr. \nLaMalfa).\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 2898, is the product of \nbipartisan, bicameral negotiations and will protect State water rights, \nstore more water during winter storms, address invasive fish that my \ncolleague Mr. Denham was talking about that have decimated endangered \nspecies, and advance new water infrastructure to prepare for future \ndroughts.\n  One project alone--Sites Reservoir, in my region--would reduce the \nState's need for rationing by 60 percent with that project.\n  My northern California district is a source of a vast amount of the \nState's usable water supply and its largest reservoirs; yet even my \nconstituents are facing water rationing. Fields across my district are \nfallow because Federal agencies haven't adapted to drought conditions.\n  While some in the minority party would prefer to simply hand out \nborrowed money, doing so only ensures that this crisis will be repeated \nagain and again. Our conditions in our lakes are already desperate. \nFolsom Lake, for example, will soon be a dead pool, and that is an \nimportant water source for Sacramento, due to the attempts to try to \nkeep water under salmon down there.\n  This bill increases access to water for all Californians, without \nbenefiting one region at the expense of another.\n  Mr. Speaker, California and the Nation cannot wait any longer. We \nneed H.R. 2898 to move forward in the bipartisan effort we have had so \nfar. The answer to this crisis isn't billions again and more borrowed \ndollars or more environmental restrictions. It is action to move on \nCalifornia's drought and add to California's water supply.\n  I urge your support for H.R. 2898. Let's get California back moving \nagain.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, there is too little time left on the \nlegislative calendar for this body to be considering partisan \nlegislation that we have been assured will not become law.\n\n[[Page H5196]]\n\n  Furthermore, the future of our Nation's highways and transportation \nsystems are far too important to continue to fund using short-term \nBand-Aid patches. Our constituents, this great country, deserves \nbetter.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In closing, the issues we have considered here today are critical to \nthe stability of our transportation infrastructure and the health of \nour rural western communities, as well as the economic well-being of \nour country.\n  This rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3038, the Highway and \nTransportation Funding Act, as well as H.R. 2898, the Western Water and \nAmerican Food Security Act, a comprehensive and bipartisan bill that \naims at alleviating drought impacts in the short and long term.\n  Water is not just a resource in the West; it is the lifeblood of \nfarming and ranching all across the region, and we must act swiftly and \ndecisively to mitigate the impacts of this crisis.\n  California and many areas in the West are facing devastating drought \nconditions. This bill fixes the bureaucratic and regulatory mess that \nhas prevented people from getting water they so desperately need. \nFailing to pass this bill would deal a devastating blow to farm \nfamilies and the American economy.\n  Many families, businesses, and ag producers are producing with some \nof the most dire drought conditions they have seen in decades; and a \ngrowing number of communities have been impacted by water shortages and \nrationing.\n  However, most of the damaging effects of the drought are preventable, \nand this bill comes to the aid of the West by fixing the broken \nregulatory system and updating our water infrastructure for this coming \ncentury.\n  While the root of the cause of this crisis is the drought, complex \nand inconsistent laws, misguided court decisions, and burdensome \nregulations have exacerbated an already devastating situation.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill addresses these policy failures and seeks to \nalleviate the drought's short- and long-term impacts. It will give \nimmediate relief to millions of Americans who are facing mandatory \nwater rationing and will invest in new water storage facilities to \nprepare for future droughts.\n  While the Obama administration has issued a veto threat for this \nbill, people suffering in the West have little time for political \ntheater, which is why I am urging my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to support this critical legislation.\n  This rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 3038, the Highway \nand Transportation Funding Act, a bill that will extend the Federal \nsurface transportation programs. This extension will provide the House \nand Senate with time to work out a long-term surface transportation \nreauthorization bill in a bicameral, bipartisan manner.\n  This bill will also allow us to work towards a resolution of the \nhighway trust fund, which is currently facing a $90 billion shortfall, \nas we have heard. If we fail to address the trust fund, its insolvency \nwould have disastrous impacts on States across our country. Many \nprojects would grind to a halt. Workers would be furloughed, and \nexisting infrastructure investments would be lost.\n  While another short-term extension is not what any of us wanted, our \nStates need certainty, and that certainty can only come from the long-\nterm reauthorization of these transportation programs, as well as a \nlasting solution for the trust fund.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule, allowing for \nconsideration of two important pieces of legislation that will help \nprotect our rural, Western communities, while providing much relief \nfrom devastating water shortages and drought conditions.\n  It will also ensure that many important transportation programs do \nnot lapse and will extend the highway trust fund expenditure authority \nso that this vital fund remains solvent and available for projects \nacross the country while we work towards a lasting solution.\n  I appreciate the discussion we have had over the last hour. It has \nbeen great, very enlightening. Although we may have some differences of \nopinion, I believe this rule and the underlying bills are strong \nmeasures that are important to our country's future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 362 and the \nunderlying bills.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:\n\n     An Amendment to H. Res. 362 Offered by Mr. Hastings of Florida\n\n       Strike section 2 and insert the following:\n       Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     3064) to authorize highway infrastructure and safety, \n     transit, motor carrier, rail, and other surface \n     transportation programs, and for other purposes. The first \n     reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of \n     order against consideration of the bill are waived. General \n     debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one \n     hour equally divided among and controlled by the chair and \n     ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation \n     and Infrastructure and the chair and ranking minority member \n     of the Committee on Ways and Means. After general debate the \n     bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute \n     rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 3064.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools\n\n[[Page H5197]]\n\n     for those who oppose the Republican majority's agenda and \n     allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer \n     an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill, H.R. 3038.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3038, the Highway and \nTransportation Funding Act of 2015, Part II.\n  This bill extends the Federal surface transportation programs through \nDecember 18, 2015. H.R. 3038 is a clean extension and funds the \nprograms at authorized levels for fiscal year 2014.\n  The bill also ensures the solvency of the highway trust fund. We have \nan immediate, critical need to address the solvency of the trust fund \nand extend the current surface transportation law.\n  If Congress fails to act, the States will not be able to be \nreimbursed for past expenses, transportation projects, and jobs across \nthe country will be at risk; and over 4,000 U.S. Department of \nTransportation employees will be furloughed.\n  I appreciate Chairman Ryan's attention to this pressing issue, as \nwell as his commitment to addressing the solvency of the trust fund.\n  A long-term surface transportation reauthorization bill remains a top \npriority for this committee, and it should be for this Congress.\n  I am committed to continuing to work with Chairman Ryan, Ranking \nMember DeFazio, and others on achieving a long-term reauthorization \nbill. I believe this extension gives us our best shot.\n  I strongly urge all Members to support H.R. 3038, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Ironically, it was exactly 1 year ago today that the chairman of the \nWays and Means Committee said they needed time to come together for \nfunding a 6-year surface transportation bill investing in our \ntransportation system, 1 year ago today.\n  There was an extension until the end of the year, then there was an \nextension until May, and then there was an extension from May until \nnow--temporary extensions, I think 34 temporary extensions we have seen \nnow.\n  Now, we are talking about another temporary extension with the hope \nthat maybe they can find some money under the couch cushions or pass \ntax reform and cut taxes on rich people and use dynamic scoring and say \nit raises money and then put it in the trust fund. I don't know what \ntheir solution is.\n  We have had a user fee funded transportation system in this country \nsince Dwight David Eisenhower was President, followed by Ronald Reagan \nwho doubled the tax; and Ronald Reagan also put transit into the \nhighway trust fund, saying we should not ignore our population centers \nand actually our centers of economic growth.\n  Then in 1993--granted, Democratic President and Democratic Congress, \nbut we didn't quite have the votes to increase the gas tax--and Bud \nShuster, Republican chair of the Transportation Committee back then, \nactual relation to current chairman, he brought us quite a number of \nRepublicans to vote with the Democrats to go to 18.3 cents a gallon; \nand there it stood since 1993.\n  We are hearing now you can't increase the gas tax, so I have offered \nalternatives. Let's eliminate the gas tax and put a tax on a barrel of \noil, the fraction that goes into taxable transportation uses, which \neconomists say means Wall Street might eat part of that because they \nare speculating so much, ExxonMobil might eat part of that, OPEC--hey, \nwe might get Saudi Arabia to pay for a little bit of our \ninfrastructure; but I am told, no, they can't do that.\n  I proposed just indexing the existing gas tax and bonding, pay it \nback over time with that increment. Now, if we double index the gas \ntax, it might go up 1.7 cents next year. There is apparently a fear in \nthis place that if gas went up 1.7 cents a gallon--unlike ExxonMobil \njacking it up 25 cents while you are driving by in May because Memorial \nDay is coming--but of the Federal Government to invest in filling in \nthe potholes, fixing the bridges and the transit systems and raised it \n1.7 cents, oh, my God, people lose their elections.\n  Well, we have seen six Republican States raise their gas tax this \nyear, all red, deep red States; and those same States have said to us \nin testimony: It is not enough that we are raising the gas tax; we need \nmore Federal investment.\n  The system is falling apart--140,000 bridges, 140,000 need repair or \nreplacement. Forty percent of the surface national highway system needs \nto be not just resurfaced; it needs to be dug up and rebuilt--and that \nour transit systems, $84 billion backlog to bring them up to a state of \ngood repair.\n  It is so bad in Washington, D.C., that they are killing people; they \nare killing people on the transit system because it is so outmoded.\n  Now, if we made those investments and we made them in a more robust \nlevel than we are doing now, we could put hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans to work. It is not just construction workers; you are talking \nmanufacturing; you are talking small business; you are talking minority \nbusiness enterprises; you are talking engineering; you are talking \ntechnical.\n\n  The Buy America requirements are the strongest in the whole \ngovernment. It would have an incredible stimulative effect on the \neconomy. In addition, it would put 300,000 people back to work, and we \ncould begin to climb back toward where we were.\n  Dwight David Eisenhower gave us a system that was the envy of the \nworld. We were number one in infrastructure. We are now 16. We are \ndropping like a rock. Pretty soon, we will be down there with Third \nWorld countries in terms of state of our infrastructure in this \ncountry. It is embarrassing. It is pathetic. It is not necessary.\n  Today, we should be considering a long-term bill. We have introduced \na viable long-term bill. We propose today a way to pay for the first 2 \nyears of it by just saying Benedict Arnold corporations can't buy a \ndrugstore overseas for a major pharmaceutical company and then say: Oh, \nthat is our home headquarters, although we are still here enjoying all \nthe protections of American citizenship law and our military, but we \ndon't want to pay for it and our infrastructure.\n  There are ways forward. There seems to be an incredible reluctance on \ntheir side, so here we are again saying let's\n\n[[Page H5204]]\n\ndo a patch until December 18. Meanwhile, the Senate over there has been \nin who knows what kind of circles. They are proposing to get most of \nthe money by reducing retirement for Federal employees. Now, that is a \ntremendous relationship to infrastructure and user fees. Let's not get \ntoo far away from the idea of user pays.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Graves).\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I want to make note, the \nhighway program funding mechanism expires at the end of this month. It \nexpires; that means it runs out of funding. Voting against this bill \ncauses the program to shut down, causes a decline, a dropoff on \ninvestment in our Nation's infrastructure.\n  Right now, we are seeing growth; we are seeing increasing demand. As \nthe gentleman from Oregon just noted, we are seeing underinvestment in \nour infrastructure system. We have got to increase the investment. We \nhave got to work hard to address the outdated funding mechanism that \nfunds our current highway system. As was noted, we have lost value in \nthe current funding mechanism.\n  Having a user fee is absolutely critical, but a user fee that ensures \nthe level of investment that we truly need. This extension gives us \ntime to recreate that. We have been using the same user fee for \ndecades, a user fee with static figures since 1993, as was just \nmentioned, and a user fee that has conflicting Federal policies that \nreduces the value of the income of this trust fund as a result of the \ncorporate average fuel economy or CAFE standards that require greater \nfuel efficiency out of vehicles.\n  We have got to take a fresh look at this. We have got to take this \ntime and use it wisely to ensure that we can ensure the level of \nfunding that we need to invest in our Nation's infrastructure. We need \na fundamentally different approach, and we need to do it without \nraising taxes.\n  Mr. Speaker, back in my home State of Louisiana, we have some of the \nworst traffic in the Nation for a region of its size. We have an area \nthat the interstate system, the only place in the Nation where it \nliterally drops down to one lane, the interstate, an incredible \nbottleneck, in this same area where we are having a manufacturing \nrenaissance, where we are seeing tens of billions of dollars in new \neconomic development opportunities; yet the infrastructure is \nstruggling. The infrastructure is strangling that growth and strangling \nthat investment.\n  I urge all Members to support this. I urge all Members to work \ntogether to ensure we develop a new funding stream that meets the \ndemand of our crumbling infrastructure in this Nation.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shuster, and I want to thank Chairman Ryan \nand Ranking Member DeFazio, to ensure that this legislation moves \nforward.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nthe District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), the ranking member of the \nHighways and Transit Subcommittee.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the ranking member, \nfor yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, the majority has turned virtually its only congressional \npolicy, tax savings, on its head with useless short-term transportation \nbills and extensions. Their short-term policy on the Nation's highways, \nbridges, and transit has simply transferred the transportation tax \nburden to the State taxes of their constituents.\n  Twenty-one States and the District of Columbia have raised their gas \nuser fees--six since July 1--Iowa, Wyoming, Maryland, Massachusetts, \nNew Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Vermont, District \nof Columbia, South Dakota, Idaho, Georgia, Nebraska, and Vermont.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  States going in that direction are Michigan, North Carolina, Utah, \nand Washington State.\n  States also considering user fee increases are Kentucky, Missouri, \nNew Jersey, and South Carolina. That makes almost half the States that \nCongress has driven to State taxpayers alone, States that have nothing \nin common except the desire to keep their transportation \ninfrastructure, the key to a growth economy, from completely \ndisintegrating.\n  Meanwhile, the Representatives in Washington have continually failed \nto pay their part, on the average, about 50 percent of the costs of \nState infrastructure with Federal dollars, yet the Federal dollars are \nonly a pass-through that goes right back to the States.\n  For 22 years, we have allowed the Federal user fee to remain fixed at \n1993 levels, although fuel efficiency long ago made that obsolete.\n  Although American taxpayers have stepped up, they can't do their \nprojects without a Federal long-term bill. In the Nation's capital, for \nexample, the iconic Memorial Bridge, gateway to Arlington Cemetery in \nthe south and, on the north, to the National Mall, is partially closed, \nleaving thousands of workers unable to take Metro buses to get to work.\n  Even bridges like the H Street bridge here, which needs only repair, \nis standing in the way of billions of dollars of nontransportation \ndevelopment here and nationwide.\n  So whatever the Congress does in the next authorization bill, two \nthings must be done: We must put in pilots that instruct us, guide us, \nfor a new way to fund transportation infrastructure in light of fuel \nefficiencies, such as cars like my hybrid Ford C-Max.\n  And, most of all, to be useful at all, we must have a 6-year \ntransportation bill.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. \nMica), the former chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, here we are. It is the last minute to avoid an \ninfrastructure disaster across the country.\n  How did we get here? Well, when we knew that we needed a substantial \namount of money, the other side of the aisle found out that there was a \nlittle bit of money left.\n  We had asked several months ago to consider going to the end of the \nyear when we are doing tax reform, and we could find sufficient money \nto fund a 4- to 6-year bill. They said ``no.''\n  They had to spend the last dime in the cookie jar, take it out of the \ncookie jar, and that is what put us in this situation. What that has \ndone is at least seven States have almost closed down their \ninfrastructure projects.\n  My State isn't affected, but some of the northern States are affected \nbecause they have a very short work period. So they are missing that \nwork period.\n  States don't operate like the Federal Government. They have to pay \ntheir bills. They can't be spending, producing, and printing paper \nmoney without backing. So we have let them down.\n  So here we are, asking to go where we wanted to go to before \nDecember. So I urge the Members to pass this legislation.\n  It is kind of interesting. Sometimes I think that there is a lot of \namnesia around here. Mr. Speaker, I don't know if we could go down to \nthe health clinic downstairs and get a supply of ginkgo, but it would \nbe good to give some of the Members on the other side of the aisle some \nginkgo to help their memory.\n  Three years ago they controlled the House, the Senate, and the White \nHouse. They could have passed this legislation they are talking about, \nfunded it, and we would have a bill that would be in place now.\n  The President came in. I was there. Ray LaHood came in, cut the knees \nout of Mr. Oberstar when he was chairman and said they weren't going to \nmove forward, they weren't going to raise taxes. Now they call for \nraising taxes.\n  Well, 21 States have raised it. They have done the responsible thing, \nand they have to do it. It is better for them to do it because the \noverhead and the carrying charge is so great in Washington. So they \nhave to do it.\n  Going to the well instead of raising gas taxes, now, didn't we \nrecommend that to the other side and they ignored it? I think we need a \ndouble dose of ginkgo.\n  So I think now we step up to the plate and we help Mr. Shuster and \nMr. Ryan. They will get us to December. The leadership of the House is \ncommitted to a long-term bill, and we will get that done, everybody \nworking together. And maybe a few people having another little dose of \nginkgo might help around here.\n\n[[Page H5205]]\n\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I must say it is one of the most bizarre \nand fanciful things I have ever heard. There never was a viable plan to \ngo to year-end. The Republicans never proposed the revenues.\n  They just recently found revenues under couch cushions to get us \nthrough to December 18th. And they have not meaningfully addressed any \nlong-term funding, despite having been in charge 4\\1/2\\ years, and he \nwants to blame us.\n  They just held the first hearing ever in Ways and Means on revenues \njust a couple of weeks ago, and the chairman started by saying, ``No \nuser fees.''\n  Well, you have now ruled out the traditional way of paying for \ninfrastructure. So they are going to have to come up with something \nelse. But that was totally bizarre.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards).\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, for months Republicans have actually \nsquandered an opportunity to develop and pass a long-term authorization \nfor highway spending, and it is pretty regrettable, since May 19 \nRepublicans simply brought up and passed another 2-month extension.\n  We have already heard--sometimes we lose count. Is it 33? Is it 34?--\nextensions. Unfortunately, here we are 2 months later and we are \ncareening yet again to another Republican-made crisis, more gridlock \nfor the highway trust fund, right in the middle of the critical \nconstruction season.\n  Hundreds of thousands of jobs, as has been said, and vital \nconstruction projects across the country are really hanging in the \nbalance, and here we just have a few days left. What do we know? We \nknow that Republicans don't have a plan and they don't have any ideas.\n  Well, we have some ideas, and those ideas are contained in the Grow \nAmerica Act. I am one of the original cosponsors. It is a 6-year, $478 \nbillion bill that would be a framework for our discussions. We could \nput that on the floor here today, vote on it, and make sure that we get \nunderway.\n  But, oh, no, we are stuck yet again with another extension. Frankly, \nI am not really sure whether, when we get to December, we won't be \nstuck with yet another extension. This just goes on and on and on. The \nAmerican people have had enough.\n  We know that, if we invest in our infrastructure, we create jobs, and \nwe know that our infrastructure is falling apart. So this seems like a \nno-brainer to most Americans and to working people. And I don't \nunderstand what the complication here is, Mr. Speaker, but enough is \nenough.\n  It is time for Republicans to be the adults at the table to bring a \nplan and a program to the floor for a long-term authorization and put \nAmerica back to work not 6 months at a time, not 2 months at a time, \nbut for a long time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I again would like to remind my colleagues \nthat the Senate was controlled up until January by their party. The \nWhite House has been controlled for 6\\1/2\\ years by their party.\n  I know the ranking member at the time when the stimulus came out--as \nI recall, I believe he voted against the stimulus because they were \ngoing to squander $800 billion.\n  If they would have listened to the ranking member at the time, they \nwould have put much more or a lot more money into the investment of \ninfrastructure. Instead of that $800 billion bill, about $68 billion \nwent to transportation.\n  So everybody can point fingers at everybody, but the reality is here \nwe are. We need to extend this so that the Ways and Means Committee and \nthe Finance Committee in the Senate can figure out the dollars in a \nresponsible way, not to continue to raise the debt and the deficit, but \nfind a responsible funding level to get us to a 6-year bill, which I am \ncommitted to and I know Chairman Ryan has said many, many times in \npublic he is committed to, and our leadership in the House is committed \nto a long-term bill.\n  Instead of pointing fingers at each other, let's figure out a way to \nmove forward together, and I believe we will.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, could I inquire as to the time left before \nwe proceed?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Westmoreland). The gentleman has 4 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota \n(Mr. Nolan).\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, the simple truth is, as \nhas been articulated so well here today by my colleague, that this \nNation desperately needs a long-term transportation funding bill to \nrepair our Nation's crumbling infrastructure, not another kick-the-can-\ndown-the-road, short-term, temporary, convoluted fix.\n  Last week Congress appropriately honored the late chairman of the \nTransportation Committee, Jim Oberstar, with the naming of his hometown \npost office in Chisholm, Minnesota. What a wonderful tribute it was to \nChairman Oberstar.\n  But here we are once again kicking the can down the road on the issue \nthat Jim Oberstar cared most about. As chairman, Jim worked hard to \nensure the committee drafted good, strong, bipartisan legislation, and \nthat is what we need here today.\n  If the Transportation Committee were allowed to do that, I have every \nconfidence that we would indeed write a long-term transportation \nfunding bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, the fact is that the trains are running off the tracks, \nthe bridges are falling down, the wastewater treatment facilities are \noverflowing.\n  So let's do right by our good friend, former Congressman Jim \nOberstar, and let's create a long-term fix to our national \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include an article for the Record.\n\n               [From The Washington Post, July 14, 2015]\n\n    House Honors the Late Rep. Jim Oberstar as Congress Fumbles His \n                            Greatest Passion\n\n                          (By Colby Itkowitz)\n\n       It was curious timing for House members to honor the late \n     Democratic congressman Jim Oberstar.\n       On Monday evening, they voted to rename a post office after \n     Oberstar in his hometown of Chisholm, Minn. Several members \n     spoke on the floor about his deep institutional memory, \n     passion for everything transportation and all-around \n     collegiality.\n       ``I'd like to ask that we honor him by rededicating \n     ourselves to that spirit of bipartisanship, that spirit of \n     working together, that spirit of getting things done . . . \n     that was the spirit that epitomized Jim Oberstar and that's \n     how so he was successful in getting things done,'' Rep. Rick \n     Nolan (D-Minn.), who represents Oberstar's former district, \n     said in floor remarks.\n       But as Oberstar was being memorialized by his former \n     colleagues, a Republican plan was being hatched to place \n     another Band-Aid over the gaping, oozing wound that is \n     federal highway program funding. Whatever short-term fix is \n     agreed to, it will be just another patch to temporarily \n     staunch the bleeding, when what's really needed is invasive \n     surgery.\n       Oberstar knew this. He had a plan. And when he finally \n     earned the gavel of the Transportation committee in 2007 \n     (he'd begun his career as a young staffer on the then-Public \n     Works panel and then, as a new congressman in 1975, climbed \n     his way up from the lowest rung on the committee dais to the \n     chairman's perch), he thought the Democratic majorities in \n     both chambers and two years later the White House would lead \n     to real investment in transportation.\n       But there was no political will then, or now, for the \n     easiest immediate solution to ramp up revenue for the starved \n     highway programs--raising the federal gas tax for the first \n     time since 1993. Instead, Congress is poised to find a short-\n     term fix to bailout the Highway Trust Fund for the seventh \n     time since President George W. Bush first shifted money from \n     the general treasury in 2008 to keep the trust fund solvent.\n       This time, with the highway program set to expire at the \n     end of this month, House Budget Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-\n     Wis.) wants to find savings through complicated tax \n     compliance rules to patch the highway program as lawmakers \n     continue to fight over how to pay for a multi-year \n     reauthorization, which has evaded Congress for years.\n       In 2009, when Oberstar released his six-year, $450 billion \n     plan for surface transportation, he warned that the short-\n     term extensions don't allow state departments of \n     transportation the certainty to plan for bigger, more \n     ambitious projects. It's a sentiment that's been echoed by \n     governors, mayors, big business and labor.\n       Oberstar, who lost his reelection in 2010, believed that if \n     Democrats had passed his bill they would not have lost the \n     House in those mid-term elections because the infrastructure \n     jobs would have been such a boon to the economy.\n       It's of course impossible to know if that would have been \n     true. But Oberstar, who died in May 2014, would probably feel \n     quite conflicted this week--deeply honored by the post office \n     naming and deeply disheartened that Congress still hasn't \n     made transportation spending a priority.\n\n\n[[Page H5206]]\n\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER. May I inquire as to how much time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 7 \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Oregon has 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Graves), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Surface \nTransportation.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I want to associate myself with \nthe words of my colleagues, who just spoke obviously on the need to do \nthis and the need for a long-term transportation bill.\n  I remember Chairman Oberstar working diligently to try to do that in \nthe six, seven extensions, I think, that we had at this time and never \ndid come up with a transportation bill. That is why we are working so \nhard to make sure we have a good bipartisan bill.\n  I do rise in support of H.R. 3038. It is going to extend the current \ntransportation law until December 18, 2015, until we can get that long-\nterm bill in place.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, I believe it \nis critical for Congress to come together on this bipartisan, long-\nterm, surface transportation reauthorization bill.\n  In my home State of Missouri, we have nearly 35,000 highway miles and \nover 10,000 bridges that are begging for our attention.\n  Last month, I had a hearing focusing on the transportation needs of \nrural America. Our roads and bridges demonstrate why we need a strong \nFederal highway program. A network of efficient, interconnected roads \nis critical to moving people and goods and to the overall health of \nthis economy.\n  That is why I am committed to working with Chairman Shuster, Chairman \nRyan, and others to get a reauthorization bill done.\n  Federal surface transportation programs are set to expire at the end \nof this month, and Congress has to act to ensure that these programs \ncontinue and that the solvency of the highway trust fund is addressed.\n  State and local governments need to be able to plan for projects with \nconfidence. They need certainty not just for the next 5 or 6 months, \nbut for the next 5 or 6 years.\n  This bill enables us to continue our bipartisan efforts on a \nreauthorization bill, which we hope to accomplish by the end of the \nyear.\n  We have a tremendous opportunity to secure that bill that is going to \nimprove, rebuild, and modernize our Nation's transportation system, and \nit is time that we come together to do that.\n  I want to thank both of the chairmen on their work on H.R. 3038.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. \nBlumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in yielding me \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, I could not agree with the chairman of the committee \nmore. I personally think that it is time to stop pointing fingers. \nThere is enough bipartisan blame to go around. We didn't quite do the \njob when the economy was in free fall. We would have, a number of us--I \nknow the ranking member would have--written the Recovery Act \ndifferently, but the point is we are here now with the challenge to \nfund it.\n  Six States, six Republican States have increased the gas tax already \nthis year. I have got a proposal that is ready to go that could be \npassed in 2 weeks, and the committee could have the resources to \nactually fund the bill, but there could be other options. I know the \nranking member has a barrel tax, a proposal to index the gas tax and \nbond against it. I don't care what it is that we do. I do care that we \ndon't continue to stall.\n  It was exactly a year ago today we were standing here on this moment \nsaying: Don't spill this to the end of the year; we need to get on with \nit because we will be right back here a year from now. And we are. It \nis time to act.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nBrendan F. Boyle).\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. I want to thank my colleague \nfor yielding me the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is just embarrassing. It is embarrassing that we \nare here talking about the umpteenth patch for the umpteenth time. \nOther countries around the world right now are looking at us and \nwondering whether or not the United States is still interested in \nleading. Let's forget the short-term patches. Let's finally deal with \nthe problem.\n  The previous speaker, Mr. Blumenauer, is exactly right. Before coming \nhere, as a State legislator in Pennsylvania, we had Democrats and \nRepublicans band together and cast a very politically tough vote. It \nwas the right thing to do. Both Democrats and Republicans did it, and \nnow we are finally building bridges and repairing roads that we \nneglected for 20 years in our State.\n  It is time for the U.S. Federal Government to do exactly the same, \nright thing. Bite the bullet, and let's show that in America we can \nsolve big problems and we can lead again.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  Investing in infrastructure in America has always been \nextraordinarily bipartisan over the entire time I have been here. \nRecently, we have kind of gone off the tracks. It means we both have to \ncooperate on policy and on funding. For the life of me, why has the \nRepublican Party drawn a line in the sand, saying we cannot have user \nfee-based investment in transportation which benefits people who drive \ncars, pickup trucks, buses, everybody who moves goods in America, we \ncan't do that anymore, we have got to come up with some fanciful tax \nreform which may or may not happen? It is very sad.\n  I proposed doing away with the retail gas tax, imposing a barrel tax, \nwhere some of the costs would be paid by ExxonMobil, Wall Street \nspeculators, OPEC, Saudi Arabia, and, yes, they would probably pass a \nlot of it through at the pump, but that would be a fair way to move \nforward to make the massive investment we need to put hundreds of \nthousands of people back to work and get America moving again.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Oregon makes a good \npoint. We are not spending the kind of dollars--at least, we are not \nspending wisely the kind of dollars, I would also add to that--to fix \nour infrastructure problem.\n  But we do face more difficult times today than we did when we set up \nthe fund in the 1950s or even in the 1980s, as the economy grew. In the \n1990s, the economy grew. Today we have an $18 trillion debt. \nRepublicans want to make sure this is fiscally responsible. We want to \nmake sure we are just not layering something else on top of the \nAmerican people.\n  More importantly, I hope my colleagues join with me to continue to \nreduce the regulatory burden that we have put out there to people who \nbuild the roads, who operate on the roads, the States that have to come \nup with a plan to building them.\n  So again, there is a lot of work to be done. I feel confident that \nChairman Ryan and his committee will be able to come up with a funding \nlevel that we can continue to work to get a 6-year bill, which I think \nis essential to this Nation to give the certainty we need to help boost \nthe economy.\n  A vote against this bill is a vote in favor of shutting down these \nvital programs, putting transportation projects and jobs across the \ncountry at risk, and furloughing Federal employees.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise to speak in favor of this. Here is basically what we are \ntrying to do:\n  We want to get to a long-term highway solution. We believe that, for \nthe sake of jobs, the economy, certainty, planning big projects in our \nStates, we want to do a multiyear highway bill, and typically a \nmultiyear highway bill means a 6-year bill. That is our aspiration and \nour goal.\n  We know we are not going to write that bill in the next 2 weeks. We \nknow we need at least 2 or 3 months to write that bill. Unfortunately, \nthe highway trust fund has a fiscal shortfall in 2 weeks, so we are \nhere to extend the highway trust fund through December\n\n[[Page H5207]]\n\n18 to give us the time we need to put together a multiyear solution. \nThat costs $8 billion just to do that. What we use are revenue \ncompliance measures to make it easier for people to file their taxes, \neffectively, and some spending savings to get the $8 billion. Not a \nsingle fee increase, not a single tax increase is in this bill to \nfinance the extension of the highway trust fund solvency to December \n18.\n  For example, TSA fees, TSA fees are not being increased. They are \nstaying exactly the same as they are, so nobody getting on an airplane \nwill see anything different. The difference is we keep those fees going \nto mandatory spending. We keep those fees going to where they are \ninstead of going into discretionary spending where they can be spent in \naddition to other spending. So by walling off that money so Congress \ncan't go spend it somewhere else, we save money by doing that.\n  Things like this are what we do. Savings for the taxpayer, tax \ncompliance, easier to comply with your taxes, making sure that fees \ndon't get spent in other areas are some important fiscal savings that \nwe have to make sure that we can extend the solvency of the highway \ntrust fund.\n  Now, the other point I would simply make is we believe that we have a \nchance of writing a big multiyear bill. That is why we are seeking this \nextension. If we didn't think that we had the chance and the \nopportunity on a bicameral, bipartisan basis to do a 6-year highway \nfunding bill, then we would just do a 2-year bill like the other body \nis attempting to do. We think we can do a multiyear bill. We think \nthere are ways of doing it, such as incorporating it with international \ntax reform, things that are important for the economy, things that are \nimportant for our businesses. We think that is an opportunity, and that \nis something that we are exploring on a bipartisan basis.\n  So for that reason and many others, I urge adoption of this. I think \nit makes sense. Where I come from in Wisconsin, the way we say it is: \nWe have two seasons--road construction season and winter. The last \nthing we want to do is see road construction stop at the beginning of \nAugust. We need to give our construction, our highways, our people who \nare filling these construction projects a little certainty, at least \nget into the winter so they can finish the building season while we \nwork out a long-term highway solution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As was said, here we go again. A bill from the majority. They have \nbeen in power over 4 years, and the result is another patch. We need to \ndo better. We know the state of highways and the infrastructure in this \ncountry, our national infrastructure, receives a D-plus grade, getting \nworse every day. So it has been said we need multiyear, and that is so \ntrue.\n  It is also being said that there needs to be a bipartisan, bicameral \nbill. I want to just talk to the chairman, to talk to this entire \nHouse, to talk to the Congress, having also met with the \nadministration. There is no way to have a multiyear bill, 5, 6 years, \nunless it is truly bipartisan, involving Democrats as well as \nRepublicans in both Houses.\n  We have come up with some ideas. We are suggesting today, for \nexample, passage of the Stop Corporate Inversions Act that many others \nand I introduced some time ago. So we need to consider everything.\n  I want to close this way: We will not have a multiyear bill if lines \nare drawn not in sand, but in concrete. If the majority takes the \nposition that some ideas cannot be considered, it is likely to lead \ninfrastructure to another dead end. We need to do much better: \nmultiyear, bipartisan, both Houses, with the administration. If we \ndon't do that, the rest is talk.\n  This delay has cost millions of jobs. Everybody, including the \nmajority, now talks about middle income and stagnation. Part of it is \nbecause we have been stagnant in terms of an infrastructure bill on a \nlong-term basis. That has to stop. We need to put a big red sign that \nsays ``Stop'' in front of the majority in this House and the entire \nHouse and the Congress and get busy on a bipartisan basis on a highway \nlong-term bill, all infrastructure.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman from \nMichigan has more speakers than I do, so if it is all right with him, \nwhy don't a few of the speakers on his side of the aisle go first.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We will be glad to do that. We are so full of vigor on \nthis, we have lots of speakers.\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nBecerra), a member of our committee, who is also chair of our Caucus.\n  Mr. BECERRA. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the greatest, most capacitated nation on Earth, there \nis no excuse for so many crumbling roads and bridges and for the ever-\ngrowing traffic gridlock and congestion that we see every day that we \ntry to get to work. There is no reason why hundreds of thousands of men \nand women in the construction industry today should remain unemployed \nbecause this Congress won't do its job of replenishing the highway \ntrust fund. It is crazy.\n  We know that when we repair a road or a bridge, we put an American to \nwork, and we make it easier for all of us to get to work so we can be \nmore efficient. But here we are for the 34th time doing a patch to the \nhighway trust fund, which doesn't help any city or county in America \nbecause you don't build a road or build a bridge or retrofit a bridge \nwith 2 months of funding or 5 months of funding. You need 6 years to \nknow how much money you can rely on because that contractor doesn't buy \ncement or lumber for 2 months or 6 months. They buy for 4 or 5 years \nbecause, for them, time is money.\n  We are costing the American people a ton of money by doing these \nconstant patches. Why? Because we are not willing to do what we were \nelected to do: our job. Instead of just spectating, we should be coming \nup with the funds to have those roads built and repaired, those bridges \nbuilt and repaired, to replace those aging buses and trains that stop \nus from being efficient.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time to do it the right way, the long way, a long-\nterm fix, not this short-term patch.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Reichert), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Select \nRevenue Measures.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of today's legislation that will \nensure that our country's infrastructure needs are met.\n  The bottom line is we are all here. We have agreement on a lot of the \ndiscussion we are having today. We all want a multiyear highway bill. \nWe all recognize that that is what our communities need. That is \nexactly why we need to pass this bill today, so that we can have that \nopportunity to discuss these issues over the next few months to come up \nwith a multiyear bill.\n  It continues funding for construction projects through the end of the \nyear, while giving us the time to come together on a solution that \nfunds a multiyear transportation bill.\n  This is not just about the economy--it is about the economy, but not \njust about the economy. It is about jobs and jobs connected with \nconstruction and jobs connected with moving our goods across the \ncountry and in our communities. It is also about the quality of life \nthat our constituents are having to deal with back home, stuck in \ntraffic for an hour or 2 hours, trying to get home and not having time \nwith their families.\n  There is a lot involved here with our discussion today and the \nbenefits of a multiyear plan. Of course, when I go back home--just like \nany other Member--we drive on the highways. We see the need. We \nexperience the congestion.\n  I want to go back and tell my constituents that we have listened to \nthem, that we realize and recognize that there is a problem; but most \nof all, I want to go back and say: We have a plan. As Democrats and \nRepublicans, we are going to work together on a multiyear plan that we \ncan agree on to move this country forward, a plan that includes a \nmultiyear highway bill that offers communities greater certainty to \nplan for the future, improves our roads and bridges, reduces \ncongestion, and eases the movement of goods.\n\n[[Page H5208]]\n\n  To get there, we must find a way--of course, this is where the rub \ncomes in--to pay for it. By the end of the year, I want to be able to \nsay to my constituents that we have met this challenge and that we have \nfound a solution.\n  We can start by evaluating whether we can accomplish our goals \nthrough a solution that modernizes our international tax system, \nsupports the competitiveness of our American companies, and secures \nfunding for a multiyear transportation bill--and finally defining a \npermanent funding solution for our infrastructure needs.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to ask pardon for a pun I am about to use in my \nnext sentence. The bill today can help drive us there and give us time \nto have these discussions.\n  Today, let's pass this bill; send it to the Senate, and let's get to \nwork together, Mr. Speaker. People want us to work together on a \nmultiyear solution to our transportation and infrastructure needs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nNeal), an active member of our committee.\n  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, in reference to the point that my friend, \nSheriff Reichert, just made, I would note the irony of his advocacy on \nbehalf of a plan. I guess, after 35 short-term extensions, we haven't \nbeen able to find the time to develop a plan. You need years out to \ndevelop a plan.\n  Just weeks ago, in this very Chamber, our friends on the other side \nmade a full-throttled argument about America remaining competitive in \nthe world, and that is why we needed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  Let me think about this for a moment. We want America to be \ncompetitive in the world, and we simultaneously allow America's \ninfrastructure to crumble as we speak. Do you know what is going to get \nCongress to move, sadly enough? That catastrophe that awaits us \nsomewhere across this country.\n  The European Union has a highway system that, in many instances, is \nthe envy of the world; the Chinese are developing high-speed rail that \nis the envy of the world, and we are doing the 35th short-term \nextension on a highway bill.\n  Let me relate to our friends on the other side, as you travel across \nthe Federal highway system, there is this great sign everywhere. It \nsays the Dwight D. Eisenhower Federal highway system because a \nRepublican President had the foresight and vision in the aftermath of \nWorld War II to develop a first-class Federal highway system.\n  You know what else he had? He had two great allies in the Congress: \nLyndon Johnson, the majority leader in the Senate; and Sam Rayburn, who \nwas the Speaker of this House--who helped sponsor legislation that gave \nus a system that was the envy of the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, 35 times we are not going to talk about extending the \nhighway bill because we don't have time to develop a plan.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. \nBlumenauer), another valued member of our committee.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, America is still falling apart and \nfalling behind. We are looking now to slide again past the deadline \ntowards the end of the year. The problem is we are still pretending we \ncan pay for 2015 infrastructure with 1993 dollars. It isn't that hard. \nIt doesn't take 6 months to come up with a funding stream.\n  I have legislation that is in the committee that could be acted on. \nWe could follow the example of 20 States that have raised their user \nfees for transportation. We could get courage from the 6 Republican \nStates that have raised their gas tax already this year.\n  Just a few days ago, in the State of Washington, the Republican-\ncontrolled State Senate approved a 15-cent gas tax increase. We could \nfollow the example of Ronald Reagan in 1982, when he urged this \nCongress to bite the bullet and raise the gas tax. He proposed and \nCongress followed through on a 125 percent increase in the gas tax.\n  Somehow, my Republican friends are afraid to use the mechanism that \nis fast, that is accepted, that the people in the States--Republicans \nin the States--have the courage to undertake.\n  Why is it that this year is going to be any different than last year? \nWhy will my speech be any different? Is it going to be cheaper? Is it \ngoing to become less complex? Are we going to have a little more \nbackbone?\n  It is time for us to step up. I would hope that our Ways and Means \nCommittee could take the next 2 weeks, follow regular order, and \nprovide funding so that we could give the Transportation Committee the \n2 months they need to fund it, and the job would be done.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey \n(Mr. Pascrell), another valued member of our committee.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, what are we writing here, a new Magna \nCarta? They have had 4 years, for crying out loud; and we still don't \nhave legislation in front of us.\n  It has been 2 months since we were last here. We had a lot of talks 2 \nmonths ago about how bad extensions are for transportation planning and \npolicy, how the last extension was going to be the last extension. \nNothing has changed.\n  You keep on talking about the anxiety over tax reform and tax change. \nWhat about the anxiety that the American people and the contractors and \nworkers have of getting our roads and highways and airports up to \nsnuff? The bill before us today has the Congress paying for our \nhighways and transit systems with more gimmicks.\n  Tax compliance--these are the same provisions the House rejected last \nyear. Transportation security administrative fees--Nick Calio at the \nairlines trade association rightfully criticizes: ``This plan proposes \nto use tomorrow's dollars to pay for today's problems.''\n  The international tax can be part of a solution to bridge the gap, \nbut corporate America is counting on those revenues to lower their \nrates and not pay for highway spending. Using an international tax \nscheme now will make it that much more difficult to get back to a user \nfee system. The people who use the system should pay for the system. \nThat is what we should be agreeing on.\n  The Ways and Means Committee did hold two hearings on renewing the \ntrust fund--and we come to this?\n  This is the new Magna Carta. I am waiting to see the final results 6 \nmonths from now. It has been 10 years since this Congress passed a \ntransportation bill. Neither party has the courage to deal with it.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Jenkins), a member of the \nWays and Means Committee.\n  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nthank him for his leadership on this very important issue.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 3038. With the prospect of the \nhighway trust fund dollars and spending authority expiring in just over \n2 weeks, this bill is a critical step to give our States the certainty \nthat they need to continue work on important infrastructure projects \nback home. This bill gives the House and the Senate time to work \ntogether toward a long-term highway package by the end of the year.\n  It is also important to note that this bill includes provisions I \nhave pushed for to help many small businesses by establishing a \nchronological set of due dates for them to pay their taxes. The current \nlaw fails to do this, which causes small business and their owners \nunnecessary grief, time, and money.\n  I have worked during the past two Congresses on legislation to fix \nthis problem, and I am pleased that the House is acting today to take \nanother burden off the shoulders of small-business people.\n  I urge support of H.R. 3038.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nDanny K. Davis), another valued member of our committee.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, we all know that on July \n31, the highway trust fund will expire, but we didn't just learn it. It \nis not that we just found out last week or last month. We have always \nknown it. Now, we come to where we are backed up against the wall.\n  We know we need a long-term fix, but I am going to vote for a short-\nterm fix. I am going to vote for it because I want the contractors in \nmy State to keep\n\n[[Page H5209]]\n\nworking. I want the construction workers to keep laying concrete. I \nwant the bridgebuilders to keep repairing bridges.\n  We can't afford to have a short season. In Illinois, if you don't do \nconstruction now, you may not get a chance to do much.\n  On the basis of the logic of keeping the construction industry \nmoving, I vote ``yes'' for the highway bill that we are considering \ntoday.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to \nrespond to the gentleman from Chicago.\n  As a person who represents the State line and drives to O'Hare every \nweek, back and forth, I want to add to the comment. They are in the \nmiddle of road construction right now on I-90 going to Chicago. If we \ndon't pass this bill, construction projects like that will stop.\n  By the way, we need more construction in the Chicagoland area, just \nlike we do around the rest of America. That is why we have to pass \nthis.\n  I think the gentleman from Illinois hit it right, which is, yes, we \nknew this was coming; but it takes a while to figure out how to do \nthings like rewrite international tax laws, something we haven't done \nfor decades. It takes a while to figure out how to come up with long-\nterm financing of something like a highway trust fund.\n  We know that we cannot come up with that answer within the next 2 \nweeks. We don't want to see these construction projects like the really \nimportant one on I-90 and I-94 going to O'Hare--and everywhere else in \nAmerica--stop in 2 weeks.\n  That is why this is necessary. We don't like patches anymore than \nanybody else does, but this patch is necessary to make sure that those \nprojects don't stop.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nLewis), a truly valued member of our committee and this Congress.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong concern with yet another \nstopgap measure. Nearly 60 years ago, a Republican President, Dwight \nEisenhower, led the charge to create the Interstate Highway System. He \nrealized that good roads were not just about commerce and economic \ndevelopment, they are a national security priority to keep America \nsafe.\n  I have said it before and I will remind you again: there is no such \nthing as a Republican road or a Democratic bridge. Today, American \nroads and bridges, American transit, and American highways are \ncrumbling. This is a national embarrassment.\n  We have already rolled the ball down the road more than 30 times, and \nhere we are doing it again. The time for talk is past. In the words of \nDr. King: We have been bogged down in the paralysis of analysis for too \nlong.\n  Delay for another day is not an option. American jobs are on the \nline. In a few short weeks, transportation projects across our country \nwill grind to a stop. We must act, and we must act now.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  As I think back, we have been doing this so often, and our chairman \nsaid it takes a while. It has been a decade.\n  I just want to emphasize, if we are no longer going to take a while \nbut do it right, it is going to have to be done on a truly bipartisan \nbasis.\n  There is a tendency, I think, to go off on a wild goose chase, and \nthat won't build highways. And it won't build if one party doesn't work \nwith another, if the Senate doesn't work with the House. Now we have \nthe Senate seeming to go a different way on a short-term thinking they \ncan do a long-term. Chaos doesn't build highways. So I really hope, \nhowever we vote on this bill, that there will be a new dedication to \ndoing what is so long overdue.\n  All the talk about middle class incomes essentially goes up in smoke \nwhen we fail to do what is so clearly in the interest of middle class \njobs, and that is to build highways, to repair bridges, to take care of \nairports, to take care of our infrastructure.\n  Coming from Michigan, I am ashamed of the state of highways in \nMichigan compared to when I was a kid and later on. Disrepair has \nessentially been the hallmark of highway and infrastructure in this \ncountry because there has been a failure to step up to the plate.\n  I just want to finish by saying: Don't put anything aside. Don't say \nanything can't be considered because that is a ticket, really, to \nanother bridge to nowhere.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will spare the cliches and just simply say I think \nthis is important that we get this done. Both parties have patched this \ntrust fund for, as the gentleman said, 10 years.\n  Part of the problem we have right now, Mr. Speaker, is the revenue \nsource for highways is a revenue source that is no longer relevant, \nthat doesn't work anymore. Gas taxes don't work well.\n  Why?\n  There is a good reason why. We get much better gas mileage. Our \nengine technology is better. Some cars don't even use gas. They are \nelectric, and therefore, as a result, we don't pay as much for the \nhighways we use, and that is the problem.\n  So we are trying to figure out what is a way we can bridge finance \nthe highway trust fund so that we can come up with a new revenue source \nfor the long term. That means we have to have a medium term, a 6-year \nhighway bill to make sure that the construction that we need to get \ndone gets done, and that is going to take us some time to figure this \nout.\n  That is why we need to have this patch to give us that time, because \nif we fail to pass this extension right now, then I can, sure as day, \ntell you what will come over from the other body will be a medium, \nabout an 18-month extension, and that will come through here, and we \nwill not get the bridge we need. We will not get the ability to give \nmultiyear projects the ability to plan and get off the ground, and we \nwill not have done our jobs.\n  So in order to give us a chance to do our jobs, to get the long-term \nsolution in place, to work on these big issues, we need to get \nourselves a few more months' time. That is why I think, on a bipartisan \nbasis, Members understand and appreciate this situation and therefore \nwill, hopefully, support this.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I will vote for H.R. 3038, the Highway and \nTransportation Funding Act of 2015, because our nation cannot afford a \nsurface transportation shutdown. There are still upwards of 15 million \nAmericans either unemployed or underemployed, and a lapse in highway \nfunding--however brief--would jeopardize thousands of Americans' \nlivelihoods. My hope is that Republicans will stop careening toward \ncrisis and finally pass a long-term measure to fix our aging \ninfrastructure and put Americans to work. I am proud to support such a \nsolution: today's Democratic Motion to Recommit aimed to allow a vote \nto re-authorize a long-term Transportation Bill to provide 6 years of \nfunding for states and localities to repair crumbling roads and \nbridges. The time has come to stop governing by crisis and start making \nlong-term investments to build a full employment society.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, roads, bridges, and \nrailroads are crumbling all across America. In North Carolina, which \nused to be known as the ``good roads'' state, over 5,500 bridges are \nstructurally unsound, and poor roads cost drivers $1.5 billion a year. \nThat's why I am so frustrated that instead of seizing the opportunity \nto build a viable transportation system with a long-term highway-\ntransit bill, Republican leaders have instead elected to once again \nkick the can down the proverbial road and forgo critical repairs and \nsafety improvements, to say nothing of new construction.\n  Despite these grave reservations, I will vote for today's 5-month \nextension because I believe it will allow congressional leaders to \nnegotiate the comprehensive transportation overhaul we so desperately \nneed. However, like President Obama, I will not support future efforts \nto shirk the responsibility of rebuilding our nation's infrastructure.\n  Short-term, stop-gap, extension-to-extension governance has become \nthe norm over the past few years, and I'm frankly fed up with it. House \nDemocrats are ready to get serious about making the investments we need \nto make to thrive as a country--I strongly encourage Republicans to \nanswer the call.\n\n[[Page H5210]]\n\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of a \nlong-term surface transportation bill.\n  It's disappointing that Congress once again has failed to propose a \nlong-term solution to invest in our nation's roads, bridges, and rails.\n  The bill being brought to the floor is nothing more than a Band Aid: \nhowever, without this temporary fix, the Department of Transportation \nwould be unable to fund new obligations to repair America's crumbling \nroads and fix our Nation's vast infrastructure problems. The reality is \nour nation's investment in infrastructure is woefully inadequate. These \nshortfalls hurt our constituents and damage our entire economy.\n  In Alabama, twenty percent of our major city streets are in poor \ncondition. Driving on deteriorating roads costs motorists approximately \n$1.4 billion a year.\n  Across our country, an estimated one in three fatal traffic accidents \nis caused by roads that are in poor or mediocre condition. Moreover, \nThe American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that one out of every \nnine bridges in the U.S. is structurally deficient.\n  By building the infrastructure of tomorrow, we would create thousands \nof good-paying construction jobs that help more hard-working Americans \nearn a living.\n  Investing in our infrastructure would also enhance our economic \ncompetitiveness by reducing transit costs and travel delays.\n  We can't continue to kick the can down the road--we must do better by \nour constituents. There's no reason why Congress cannot pass a long-\nterm plan that would fix our aging infrastructure and boost our \nnation's economic development.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nsupport of H.R. 3064, the GROW AMERICA Act, a bill that underscores the \nurgent need for a long-term investment in our Country's transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  With only eighteen days left before the Highway Trust Fund expires on \nJuly 31st, we should be urgently seeking out a long term solution.\n  Instead, we are considering H.R. 3038, another short term extension \nof the Highway Trust Fund that only provides five months of additional \nfunding. This five month quick-fix fails to provide America with the \nstability of a more permanent solution. Passing this bill only \ncontinues the repeated pattern of kicking the can down the road, \nfurther putting off the sensible solution that we owe to our \nconstituents.\n  In my home state of Texas, 38 percent of roads are in mediocre or \npoor condition, forcing drivers to spend approximately $5.3 billion \nannually on otherwise unnecessary automotive repairs. With 19% of our \nstate's bridges being structurally deficient, it is clear that a \nsweeping bipartisan effort is needed to invest in the future of \nAmerica's infrastructure.\n  Without a long term extension, many states are unable to plan future \nconstruction projects, providing much needed repair to deteriorating \nroads. This is particularly crippling for Texas, which has a longer \nconstruction season because of its climate.\n  In the Dallas area specifically, we currently have nine major \nconstruction projects costing in excess of $275 million that would be \nput on hold, in the event that the highway trust fund runs out of \nmoney. This is simply unfair. It is harmful to the growth that this \nregion is experiencing, and places an unnecessary burden on Dallas \nresidents and their ability to commute safely.\n  Just a few months ago, I spoke out against the House's refusal to \ntake up long term action on the Highway Trust Fund; and yet, we are \nagain attempting to put a band-aid on a deep cut to America's \ntransportation needs\n  By contrast, H.R. 3064, the GROW AMERICA Act seeks to address the \nharmful impacts of continuous stop-gap funding. This bill infuses our \neconomy with transportation infrastructure investment, providing $478 \nbillion over six years for highways, bridges, public transportation, \nhighway safety, and rail programs.\n  Enacting a six-year GROW AMERICA Act adds nearly two million jobs, \ncompared to another extension of surface transportation programs, and \nis desperately needed to improve transportation quality across the \nnation.\n  I urge my colleagues to call their transportation departments, if \nthey have not already, and find out how short funding patches in \nFederal highway funds would affect their states. Bridge replacements, \ntraffic decongestion projects, and road widening efforts, all impact \nsafety, time, money and jobs; all of which stand to be harmed by short-\nterm funding.\n  Mr. Speaker, with only eighteen days until the Highway Trust Fund \nruns out of money, I urge my colleagues to support the GROW AMERICA \nAct, a multi-year solution that provides states with the funding \nnecessary to adequately invest in their infrastructure.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I support workers and the important \ntransportation and infrastructure jobs they do. They deserve the \ncertainty and support that a long-term, well-funded highway funding \nbill would provide. H.R. 3038 is not that bill.\n  Our infrastructure is rated a D+ by the American Society of Civil \nEngineers. A transportation system that was once the envy of the world \nhas fallen into disrepair. We've passed dozens of short-term extensions \nover the past decade, and they haven't done the trick.\n  We know where this bill will leave us: infrastructure projects won't \nbe planned beyond December, long-overdue projects will hang in limbo, \nand workers will be left wondering if they'll spend the holidays \nunemployed.\n  Every business owner, worker, and state and local official I have \nspoken with has asked for the same thing: a long-term, well-funded \nbill. In order to do that, we need to make a commitment to filling the \nfunding gap from the gas tax--which has not been increased in more than \ntwo decades.\n  I support gradually raising the gas tax to pay for our infrastructure \npriorities. I also joined 184 of my Democratic colleagues in supporting \na motion that would have paid for a long-term, well-funded highway bill \nby preventing corporate tax inversions--the process of moving corporate \nheadquarters overseas. Just one Republican supported that proposal. \nDoing either of those things would sustain the vital infrastructure \ninvestments we need.\n  Those who suggest we can't afford a good highway bill are wrong. We \nare the richest country in the world at the richest time in our \nhistory. Funding our roads and bridges is a priority. We can afford it, \nand the American people demand that we do.\n  What we cannot do is continue the path of unpredictability and short-\nterm planning that results from these stopgap measures for our \nhighways, bridges, and other infrastructure projects. That is why I \nvoted against H.R. 3038.\n  This is the greatest country in the world, and there is nothing we \ncannot do. It's time to act accordingly by advancing a long-term, well-\nfunded transportation bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 362, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN.

Mr. Speaker, I ask \nunanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Maryland is recognized for 5 \nminutes in support of his motion.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, we have a very sad state of affairs \nhere. We know we have an urgent problem with respect to infrastructure \naround America. Our roads, our bridges, our transitways are in \ndisrepair at a time when we should actually be investing more to \nmodernize our American infrastructure so we can compete and put people \nback to work.\n  And yet what do we have from our Republican colleagues? More of the \nsame. Five more months of inadequate funding, no certainty for people \nwho need to plan for projects. People are going to face layoffs again. \nSo we have an urgent problem, and the response we get from our \nRepublican colleagues is 5 months of inadequate funding.\n  We have put forward a 6-year plan, the first 2 years fully funded of \na more robust plan. How do we fund it? We fund it by saying ``no more'' \nto the companies, the American companies that are cheating the American \ntaxpayers by inversion.\n  So what are they doing? They are simply changing their addresses to \nan overseas address so they don't have to pay any more into helping our \ninfrastructure and helping our country.\n  Let me give you an example of what these companies are doing. They \nare not moving their employees. They are not moving their management. \nThey are not moving their factories or anything else. They are just \nchanging their mailing address by acquiring a small foreign company \nand, in doing so, saying: We are not going to pay any more of our \ntaxes.\n  So to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, I think most \nAmericans would disagree with you that we need more time. We don't need \n5 more months to figure out that these corporations are cheating, as \ntaxpayers, by using these special provisions. We can close this tax \nloophole right now. In fact, about 30 of these companies have inverted \nin the last 5 years.\n  So we want to wait another 5 months and allow 5, 10 more to use this \ntax device to escape their responsibilities to the American taxpayer? \nWhy should we do that?\n  Let's do the right thing, and let's do it right now. We have that \nwithin our power. That is what the legislation that we have put forward \nis all about. Let's invest in our national infrastructure, and let's \nuse it by getting the savings from these companies that are engaging in \nthese inversion tax practices.\n  I am pleased to yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Israel).\n  Mr. ISRAEL. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. Speaker, Republicans and Democrats until this Congress have \nalways agreed that the way you build an economy is by building \nhighways, bridges, tunnels, and transit.\n  With this Congress, Mr. Speaker, under this Republican Congress, we \nare not building; we are patching. As a result, the American people are \nsitting in more traffic, longer rush hours, with higher repair bills.\n  Well, this is a choice, Mr. Speaker. Under the Republican plan, we \ncan kick the can down the crumbling highway. We can patch through \nDecember, telling construction workers we don't know if they are going \nto work after that. We can fund the status quo.\n  Or, under this plan, we can be big, bold, and fair. We have 6 years \nof work, a 6-year extension of the highway trust fund, $40 billion in \njobs and construction. It is funded not by asking Americans to dig \ndeeper into their pockets or take something from their paychecks. It is \nfunded by telling America's corporations they cannot establish an \naddress for themselves in the Caribbean in order to avoid paying their \nfair share of taxes right here at home.\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people are fed up. They are sitting in \ntraffic. They can feel their tires hitting the potholes. They are told \nwe can't afford to fix those potholes because we don't have the money. \nThey sit in longer rush hours. Meanwhile, corporations rush to the \nCaribbean to avoid paying their fair share of taxes to fix the \npotholes.\n  This is the choice: Will we protect tax gimmicks for America's \nbiggest corporations, or will we protect the American taxpayer and \nAmerica's workers?\n  Our proposal, Mr. Speaker, grows jobs, creates sustainable growth and \npaychecks. It fixes potholes. It fixes our highways and transit. It \ngets Americans to their jobs on time. It rebuilds our economy by \nrebuilding jobs. And it is a choice we are making today.\n\n[[Page H5212]]\n\n  The choice is this, Mr. Speaker: Will we protect tax gimmicks for tax \ndodgers, or will we protect jobs for the American people?\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw the reservation of the \npoint of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of the point of order is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I have a few points.\n  Number one, I am looking through the bill, the motion to recommit \nhere. There is no 6-year plan in here. There is no 6-year highway \nproject plan in here. They may have proposed one, but it is not being \noffered here today. All this bill does is the stop corporate \nexpatriation and invest in America's infrastructure, but there is no \ninvest in America's infrastructure here, just the tax increase.\n  Let's speak to that.\n  We have heard speaker after speaker after speaker here from the other \nside of the aisle say: You are getting away from gas taxes to fund \nhighways, to fund infrastructure.\n  What does this do? This isn't a gas tax increase. So you are moving \naway from the user fee principle yourself in your own rhetoric.\n  Let's speak to the substance of this particular proposal. This \nproposal will do a couple of things.\n  Number one, it will encourage foreign companies to buy U.S. \ncompanies. You might as well say this is the Buy American Company Act \nof 2015.\n  Number two, it will encourage U.S. corporate headquarters to move \noverseas. Don't take my word for it. That is the characterization of \nthis bill by the Senate Democratic Policy chair, the senior Senator \nfrom New York, who has said this policy will encourage U.S. \nheadquarters to be moved overseas.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Inversions are bad. We want to stop inversions. But to quote the \nTreasury Secretary of the other side's party, the way to stop \ninversions is tax reform.\n  Why are we here doing this patch? So that we can give ourselves the \ntime to do tax reform, to do international tax reform, so that we can \nprevent inversions. That is the whole purpose of this episode that we \nare having here.\n  So not only is this really bad policy, it doesn't work. It won't \naffect what they are trying to do.\n  If you want to stop inversions, you have got to do tax reforms. \nAdding more obstacles to U.S. companies doesn't stop U.S. companies \nfrom moving. It simply says that they are more ripe for takeovers by \nforeign companies.\n  There is a very dangerous trend, Mr. Speaker, of foreign companies \nbuying U.S. companies. It is happening at an alarming pace. If this \nwere to pass, it would accelerate that pace.\n  And the way that this is written, it would say: If you have your \nheadquarters in America, as an American company, you had better move \nthem overseas. Why would we want to do that?\n  The real solution is tax reform, make America more competitive and \nmake America the place you want to have your corporate headquarters.\n  Let's have American companies buy foreign companies instead of the \nother way around. That is what we should be doing.\n  Let's just have a little truth in advertising here. This doesn't stop \ninversions. This accelerates American companies being bought by foreign \ncompanies. It accelerates American headquarters going overseas, and it \ndoesn't fund anything for the next 6 years.\n  So with that and many other reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote on this \nmotion to recommit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and \npass the bill (S. 984) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act \nto provide Medicare beneficiary access to eye tracking accessories for \nspeech generating devices and to remove the rental cap for durable \nmedical equipment under the Medicare Program with respect to speech \ngenerating devices.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                 S. 984\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Steve Gleason Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROVIDING MEDICARE BENEFICIARY ACCESS TO EYE TRACKING \n                   ACCESSORIES FOR SPEECH GENERATING DEVICES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1861(n) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395x(n)) is amended by inserting ``and eye \n     tracking and gaze interaction accessories for speech \n     generating devices furnished to individuals with a \n     demonstrated medical need for such accessories'' after \n     ``appropriate organizations)''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply with respect to devices furnished on or after \n     January 1, 2016.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and to include extraneous material on S. 984, currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in favor of the Steve Gleason Act. This bill would expand \naccess to life-changing equipment called SGDs, otherwise known as \nspeech-generating devices.\n  People with severe diseases like ALS or Parkinson's need these \ndevices to communicate. They often add SGDs as accessories to their \nwheelchairs.\n  Now, for a long time, Medicare has covered their wheelchairs and \nthese devices and people have been able to buy SGDs so they can \ncustomize their devices.\n  There is one device that I have seen that is just incredible. It is \ncalled an\n\n[[Page H5215]]\n\neye-gaze. It allows someone to use one's eyes to actually navigate a \ncomputer and hit the mouse click to do things like turn on the TV, go \non the phone, speech communication, everything. It is just incredible, \nbut there is a problem.\n  Two years ago CMS changed the policy. Before, you could buy this and \nyou could add an upgrade to it. CMS changed the policy, and seniors now \nhave to rent an SGD for 13 months before they can buy it.\n  What is worse, Medicare will stop making these rental payments if a \nsenior citizen makes an upgrade that is not directly related to speech.\n  As you also know, Mr. Speaker, not just seniors go on Medicare. \nPeople with certain disabilities as well are allowed to go on Medicare; \nso this affects people of all ages.\n  This change is so sweeping that Medicare is refusing to pay for \nthings like an eye-gaze, the very thing that patients need in order to \nuse their SGDs.\n  This bill would remove the 13-month rental requirement so as to allow \nseniors to buy their SGDs immediately. It would also make sure that \nMedicare continues to cover SGDs if they are entering nursing homes.\n  The people who need these devices are truly the most disabled and \nmost vulnerable among us. The whole point of Medicare is to protect \nthese very patients and to give them the care that they need.\n  And this bill goes to the heart of Medicare's mission. It goes to the \nheart of fixing a flaw that I think everybody recognizes needs to be \nfixed.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington \n(Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), our distinguished Conference chair.\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, last summer more than 17 million people participated in \nthe ice bucket challenge to raise awareness of the crippling disease of \nALS and the physical and emotional toll it takes on millions of men and \nwomen and their families.\n  Around the same time, Gail Gleason, who is the mother of former NFL \nstar Steve Gleason, who has ALS, came to me with concerns about \nMedicare denying access to cutting-edge speech-generating technology \nfor patients who are living with degenerative diseases.\n  Gail and Steve feared thousands of people would lose their ability to \ncommunicate with the world around them, to share their stories, order \ncoffee, tell jokes, ask for help, say ``I love you.''\n  Before eye-tracking technology became available, once people lost \ntheir ability to type, they could no longer communicate, but all that \nhas changed with revolutionary technology.\n  Today patients can continue communicating by typing with their eyes, \nbut top-down, government-knows-best rules and regulations threaten to \ntake it all away for those who need it most.\n  I pledge to do everything within my power to fix this, and I am proud \nto help steer this bill through Congress, from the start to the finish, \nwith the help of Majority Leader McCarthy, Majority Whip Scalise, \nRepresentative Paulsen, and Senator Vitter.\n  So many have joined us in this effort. We led a letter with more than \n200 Republicans and Democrats to push CMS to investigate this arbitrary \ndecision, and I am proud today to stand to help support the effort to \nsend the Steve Gleason Act to the President's desk.\n  Mr. Speaker, life-changing innovation cannot help people when it is \ncollecting dust on a desk or is getting caught up in red tape. Because \nof Gail Gleason and Steve Gleason, thousands of Americans living with \ndegenerative diseases can have peace of mind today that their voices \nwill continue to be heard and that they will still be able to say ``I \nlove you.''\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today in support of S. 984, the Steve Gleason Act. This \nlegislation is named after Steve Gleason, a former professional \nfootball player for the New Orleans Saints and a native of Washington \nState.\n  The bill will increase access to speech-generating devices that help \npatients living with ALS and other neurological disorders. ALS is what \nis commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease.\n  Under current law, speech-generating devices are treated as capped \nrental items by Medicare, requiring beneficiaries to rent their devices \nfor 13 months before they are able to own them. This cap has made it \ndifficult for many beneficiaries to have access to these devices.\n  In a recent national coverage determination, CMS has already begun \nproviding payment for speech-generating devices. This is a good step, \nbut it does not necessarily ensure continued payment for the devices if \na beneficiary moves from a post-acute facility, such as a nursing home.\n  This legislation makes a simple fix that will eliminate the rental \ncap and clarify that beneficiaries may purchase speech-generating \ndevices immediately.\n  It will ensure payment for these devices even if a beneficiary is \nadmitted into a facility for which payment is bundled into a post-acute \nfacility payment.\n  It will improve the Medicare program, and it will make a meaningful \ndifference in the lives of beneficiaries who are living with ALS.\n  I am pleased to see the chairman out here pushing this, and I am glad \nto join with him. I hope someday I will join with him to provide \nhearing aids to senior citizens who are having trouble paying for them \ntoday.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the distinguished majority \nwhip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for yielding and \nfor his leadership in bringing the Steve Gleason Act to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, Steve Gleason is somebody who has served as an \ninspiration for the people of Louisiana for a long time, going back, of \ncourse, to the 2006 game when the Superdome was reopened after \nHurricane Katrina.\n\n  That night was really one of the galvanizing moments that helped \nbring the city of New Orleans back, that helped reinspire the people of \nNew Orleans to come back.\n  It was Steve Gleason who blocked the punt at the end of the game to \nwin the game. I was in the Dome that night. I know my wife, Jennifer, \nand I were as euphoric as everybody in that building.\n  The reason that Steve Gleason inspires people today, Mr. Speaker, is \nnot because of what he did on the football field. It is because of what \nhe has done to serve as an inspiration for people all across the \ncountry, people with all disabilities, since he was diagnosed with ALS, \nwith Lou Gehrig's Disease.\n  What he has done is to go out and show that he is able to exhibit his \nvoice because of the speech-generating device that he has.\n  This isn't something that he just wants for himself. He wants this \nfor all people who have something to say, who have that same voice, to \nbe able to go out and inspire other people.\n  When CMS made the change in policy that started to take away that \nvoice, he spoke up, as so many others did, and said, ``We need to \nreverse this.''\n  I commend Senator Vitter for bringing the legislation forward that we \nare debating that was passed through the Senate, for this is a bill \nthat truly will give voice to thousands of people.\n  Over 5,000 people every year are diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's Disease, \nwith ALS. They all have something to say. They all have that voice.\n  The Steve Gleason Act will give them that voice so they can go out \nand continue to achieve their lives' potential.\n  I urge the passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Richmond).\n  Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague and my friend, \nMajority Whip Steve Scalise, in advocating for and in asking our \ncolleagues to vote today for the Steve Gleason Act.\n  Steve's name is on it, but it is a lot bigger than Steve. If you know \nSteve and what he stands for, you will understand that this bill and \nthis fight on behalf of him and his family--the fight that they have \nfought--benefits thousands of people in our society who really need the \nhelp.\n  That is why last year I was happy to join in a letter with Mrs. \nMcMorris Rodgers to CMS, asking them to change this policy.\n  It is important to put patients first and to fix this extremely \nmisguided\n\n[[Page H5216]]\n\nand harmful Medicare regulation that has had a devastating impact on \nthe lives of ALS patients, stroke victims, and other folks who are \nexperiencing significant paralysis. It has really prohibited them from \ntalking to and communicating with their families.\n  I think Steve did a great job of expressing what Steve means to the \npeople of New Orleans. Gleason's actions on the football field and his \nactions since being diagnosed with ALS really exemplify the resilience \nthat the people of New Orleans have had after being knocked down time \nand time again from hurricanes and other things.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  But just as Steve stood up and just as the city of New Orleans stood \nup to help themselves, government has a responsibility to make the \nlives of people better and to help them help themselves, and that is \nwhat this does.\n  I will give you Steve's words. He said: If we have a purpose in life \nbeyond being a cog in the human machine, mine is to help inspire \npeople. And that is pretty cool.\n  What I would like to say today is that Steve inspired Congress to \nmake the lives of thousands and thousands of people better; and what \nSteve was able to do was bring out the best of what is in this body, \nand that is both sides working together to make sure that we do \ntangible things to improve the lives of the people whom we represent.\n  I am proud to stand here with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle and enjoy the benefit of their hard work and a team effort to do \nthis. So I would just encourage my colleagues to vote for the Steve \nGleason Act.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Paulsen), a distinguished member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the chairman for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  As has already been mentioned, last summer, millions of Americans \nparticipated in the ice bucket challenge, raising more than $100 \nmillion to combat ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease.\n  What most people don't realize, though, is at the exact same time \nthis movement was sweeping the Nation, the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services was implementing misguided policies to deny access to \nspeech-generating devices for those patients with ALS and other \ndegenerative conditions. Now, for many people who have ALS, speech-\ngenerating devices and the eye-tracking technology that is often used \nwith these devices are the only way to communicate with your loved \nones, with families, friends, and others.\n  In response to the agency's new policies, Representative Cathy \nMcMorris Rodgers and I led a bipartisan letter with over 200 \nRepublicans and Democrats asking for changes to the proposals. While \nthe agency has taken some actions to roll back some of the rules, we \nhave got to guarantee that these patients will have access to speech-\ngenerating devices.\n  That is why Senator Vitter, Representative McMorris Rodgers, and \nMajority Whip Scalise and I first introduced the Steve Gleason Act. \nNow, this bill gets its name, as was mentioned, from former New Orleans \nSaints safety Steve Gleason. Steve famously blocked a punt, resulting \nin the first touchdown for the New Orleans Saints in their dramatic \nreturn to the Superdome after Hurricane Katrina. Today, Steve faces a \nnew opponent as he battles ALS. This bill is for Steve and the millions \nof people who have ALS.\n  The ice bucket challenge was a good start, but there is more we can \ndo to help people with that deadly disease. Instead of limiting access \nto life-improving devices, we should be embracing 21st century cures \nand technologies that empower millions of Americans living with \ndegenerative disabilities to have a better life and communicate with \ntheir family, friends, physicians, and loved ones.\n  I am glad we could come together in a bipartisan manner to embrace \ninnovation and help so many patients, Mr. Speaker. I encourage passage \nof this important legislation.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Boustany), a distinguished member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, to thousands of Americans living with ALS \nand end-stage Parkinson's disease, the Steve Gleason Act literally \nmeans the difference between the ability to speak and silence.\n  I had the great privilege 2 weeks ago to spend about an hour with \nSteve and his mother in Steve's home in New Orleans. You have heard \nabout Steve's exploits on the football field and how he inspired so \nmany in that first return back to the Superdome after Katrina. But \nSteve lost his ability to speak and is wheelchair bound due to ALS. \nThis happened earlier this year. His 2011 diagnosis could have been a \ntragedy, but he turned it into something amazing and good.\n  When I visited with Steve, it was amazing to see the fire and the \nspirit in his eyes because, despite all that has happened to him, he is \ndetermined to help a lot of people. He told me: I am not going to give \nup until you guys pass this legislation so we could help so many others \nwho don't have access to this technology that I have been blessed to \nhave.\n  So Steve started Team Gleason, an advocacy organization. Its main \npriority is to raise awareness for ALS. And Steve is communicating, \nusing this amazing technology, but he knows not all individuals with \nALS or end-stage Parkinson's have the resources to be able to afford \nthese expensive devices.\n  This bill is named for Steve because of his tireless advocacy, and \nthis final legislation will provide the resources to give voice to \nthousands of individuals living across this country with ALS, end-stage \nParkinson's, and other types of neurological disorders.\n  I am proud to have played a little role on the Ways and Means \nCommittee with my chairman to help move this bill through. I think this \nis a very proud day for America. We are happy for Steve and his \nadvocacy and happy for so many individuals who are caught with this \nvery difficult disease.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Reichert), another senior member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman again for yielding to \nme today.\n  I rise today to support the Steve Gleason Act of 2015. I have never \nhad the honor of meeting Steve; however, he is a native Washingtonian.\n  I have had the honor of knowing a good friend and partner who passed \naway from ALS while I was with the sheriff's office back in Washington \nState in King County in the city of Seattle. His name was Jim. And I \nhave heard people talk about Steve, his inspiration, and the fight and \nfire in his eyes this afternoon, and Jim had that same inspiration to \nthose around him and had that same fire in his eyes.\n  He came to work every day. And people noticed there was something a \nlittle bit different, not quite right about Jim, but Jim just said, you \nknow: I had an operation on my knee.\n  He limped into work and he committed himself to doing the job and \ngetting it done. He was working on one of the biggest serial murder \ncases this country has ever known, the Green River case. He lived long \nenough to interview the person that we finally arrested, which took us \n19 years. He stayed alive long enough to interview--I am not even going \nto mention that person's name on the floor of the House.\n  Jim was a good friend. For CMS to make a ruling like this, to \nwithhold commonsense medical devices for people who need it, to help \nAmericans across this country, is almost unbelievable and illogical. \nCMS has made other rules, too, denying medical devices for people with \nlymphedema, for example, commonsense medical devices, like garments to \nhelp them live a normal life.\n  I am so pleased to hear today that we are able to change this rule to \nhelp people with ALS communicate, to be able to say, ``I love you.''\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the \nbill, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume for the purpose of closing.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I saw Steve Scalise talk about that play--I am a big \nNFC fan, and I remember that play. My\n\n[[Page H5217]]\n\nfriend Aaron Stecker, who is a friend of mine from Wisconsin, played on \nthat team at that time. I just have to say, Mr. Speaker, in America, we \nhave all of these heroes, and the best among us are the heroes that \nhave been so high and have been brought so low but have come back up \nand have shown a great example of courage to the rest of us.\n  We are very pleased to be bringing this bill to the floor. I \nbasically want to thank the members of the Louisiana delegation for \nbringing this issue to our attention, for making us know about this.\n  This is one of those things where the bureaucracy just got it wrong. \nThe bureaucracy basically came up with a rule that effectively denied \nthese devices to people, which means they can't live a full life.\n  These SGDs are invaluable. They are absolutely essential for people \nsuffering from ALS to be able to communicate and to be able to \nfunction. I had a constituent at a town hall meeting walk me through \nhow his eye gaze technology worked as a part of SGD, and it is just \ntruly remarkable.\n  So this is one of those issues that speaks to absolute common sense. \nThe bureaucracy got it wrong, and this is Congress in action. This is \ndemocracy in action. Our constituents brought us an issue. We \nunderstood that there was a problem that needed to be solved. So, in a \nbipartisan basis, here we are, passing legislation, fixing this problem \nso that we can make sure that this program, Medicare, fulfills its \nmission by making sure that it is there for the people who need it. \nThat is democracy.\n  I want to thank the people from Louisiana for bringing this to our \nattention. I urge the passage of this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 984.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5217-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5217-H5219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MEDICARE INDEPENDENCE AT HOME MEDICAL PRACTICE DEMONSTRATION \n                        IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and \npass the bill (S. 971) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act \nto provide for an increase in the limit on the length of an agreement \nunder the Medicare independence at home medical practice demonstration \nprogram.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                 S. 971\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 971, currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), the author of this \nbill and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, for the purpose of \ndescribing this bill.\n  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Ryan for yielding time.\n  I am pleased to see that we are taking up this 2-year extension of \nthe independence at home demonstration project, which expired on May 1.\n  I first got interested in this because of a constituent, Dr. Thomas \nCornwell from Wheaton, Illinois. He is actually a visionary. He was way \nahead of his time on this effort to reach out to patients at home. He \nis the president of the American Academy of Home Care Physicians and \nchairman and chief medical officer of the Home Centered Care Institute. \nHe has been really passionate about this idea of trying to reach people \nwhere they are.\n  Since the founding of his home care practice in 1997, Mr. Speaker, he \nhas personally made over 30,000 house calls. So he knows intimately the \ndifference that a home care option makes in the lives of individuals \nwith multiple chronic conditions and the savings that it can bring to \nthe healthcare system to treat these people at home rather than at the \nhospital.\n  So what he has been able to do is to say, look, this is better for \nthe patient and it is better for the system, so let's pursue this and \nlet's move it further along. That is exactly what the independence at \nhome demonstration brings to Medicare. It focuses on reducing costs \nwhere the needs are the highest and improving care where the needs are \nthe greatest. It provides home-based care to medical enrollees with two \nor more chronic conditions who are within the 5 to 25 percent of \nbeneficiaries that account for nearly 80 percent of all Medicare \nspending.\n  Of the 34 Medicare home care demonstrations over the past 20 years, \nthe IAH is decidedly different, requiring that doctors meet fiscally \nresponsible conditions of participation. Here is what they have got to \ndo: they have to return a minimum savings of at least 5 percent to \nMedicare; they have to produce good outcomes; and they have to pass \npatient and caregiver satisfaction ratings.\n  It even provides an additional incentive by allowing successful \npatient participants to share in any savings that generate from \nMedicare above that 5 percent mark on an 80/20 basis. So think about \nthat; everybody comes out ahead on this. And it is working.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  In June, CMS reported that IAH saved over $25 million in its first \nperformance year. That is an average of over $3,000 for each of the \n8,400 beneficiaries that participated in the demonstration.\n  In other words, have you heard, have you talked about, have you \ncontemplated anything that is like this? In other words, you have got \nhappier patients, and they are saving money at $3,000 a person. What is \nnot to love about this?\n  We have several lessons from this that have been artfully crafted \ninto the demonstration itself. It requires participants to save \ntaxpayer money by avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations, ER visits, and \nnursing home admissions.\n  It protects the viability of the Medicare Program, provides quality \nhealth care for those most in need, and benefits providers by giving \nthem the flexibility they need to care for their patients and share in \nthe savings they produce.\n  For those reasons, I strongly support passage of this, and I thank \nChairman Ryan for his support.\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 971, the Medicare \nIndependence at Home Extension Medical Practice Demonstration \nImprovement Act of 2015. This bill provides for a 2-year extension of \nan interesting program intended to help beneficiaries living with \nmultiple chronic conditions.\n  The Affordable Care Act, which has been reviled extensively, \nestablished the Medicare independence at home demonstration. The \npurpose of this project is to test a new service delivery and payment \nincentive model that utilizes primary care teams directed by doctors \nand nurse practitioners to provide care to patients in their home.\n  Practices that successfully reduce costs and meet quality measures \nwill be rewarded with incentive payments. If this is successful, this \nmodel would provide Medicare beneficiaries with access to home-based \nprimary care and\n\n[[Page H5218]]\n\navoid costly and unnecessary trips to the hospital.\n  In 2012, 15 practices launched IAH practices, but the authority to \ncontinue these practices will expire in 2015. S. 971 extends this \nauthority by 2 years. This will provide CMS with additional time to \nevaluate the results of the demonstration and to determine whether this \nis a sustainable model to pursue moving forward.\n  This will give policymakers the additional information we need to \ninform our decisionmaking as we look for innovative ways to coordinate \ncare and reduce costs in the healthcare system.\n  It is noteworthy to note that this was instituted by the ACA. There \nare good things in that bill. As they have tried again and again out \nhere to repeal it, we never thought about things like independent \nhealth practices.\n  I think that it is important for us, as a Congress, to look \nindividually at the programs before we make sweeping generalizations.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Burgess), the author of this legislation, a Member of the Energy \nand Commerce Committee, and a physician.\n  Mr. BURGESS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I certainly thank \nhim for having this bill on the floor this afternoon.\n  I am pleased the House is considering this bipartisan, bicameral \nlegislation. S. 971 is identical to H.R. 2196, the Medicare \nIndependence At Home Medical Practice Demonstration Improvement Act, \nwhich I introduced with Mr. Roskam of Illinois and Mr. Thompson of \nCalifornia. The bill extends the Medicare independence at home medical \npractice demonstration program for an additional 2 years.\n  S. 971 passed the other Chamber with unanimous consent in April. Let \nme reiterate that this bill has cleared the Senate, and we have the \nopportunity to actually advance this bill today and have it become law \nshortly.\n  Now, more than ever, it is essential that we consider innovative ways \nto deliver care that is led by providers. Individuals are aging into \nMedicare at a rate of 10,000 seniors a day, with many of the most \nelderly being severely disabled or home limited. It just so happens \nthat one of the best ways to both lower costs and improve care is to \nreturn to the simple house calls of the past.\n  The independence at home program puts patients and their families \nfirst by allowing them to stay at home as long as possible and \nincentivizing their providers to coordinate the care they provide to \ntheir patients.\n  This program targets Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic \nconditions who have the highest healthcare costs, require more services \nfrom providers, and have a greater need for coordinated care.\n  Independence at home allows providers to take a more active role in \npatient care and is proving to decrease unnecessary hospitalizations, \nunnecessary ER visits, and unnecessary nursing home visits.\n  Independence at home offers incentives to doctors, specialists, and \nnurse practitioners to better coordinate care for patients while also \ncutting costs. This is accomplished by requiring that these groups \nattain a savings of at least 5 percent of which each qualified patient \nwould otherwise have cost the Medicare system.\n  I will say it again: The program has and must deliver savings by law. \nIf these providers fail to achieve the mandatory 5 percent savings, \nthey face removal from the program; however, if they are able to \naccomplish the 5 percent savings threshold, these groups may keep up to \n80 percent of the savings.\n  This program is proving to reduce costs and increase quality by \nreducing duplicative and unnecessary services, delaying or eliminating \nthe need for nursing home placement, and reducing readmissions to the \nhospital simply by having a coordinating team of providers.\n  In addition to saving Medicare money, the patient and their family \nare able to spend quality time at home, instead of the doctor's office \nor a hospital. In fact, these programs must improve patient and \ncaregiver satisfaction for the program to continue.\n  This demonstration program is generating substantial savings and \npositive outcomes. While the Congressional Budget Office estimated a \nzero score on June 12, a week later, the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services released practice results from year one of the \nprogram, showing a savings of $25 million the first performance year.\n  Since CMS has been able to release the data, we are confident that if \nthe Congressional Budget Office were to look at this bill again, they \nwould estimate savings for the program, and we expect higher savings in \ncoming years.\n  Without this extension, there would be a disruption in care for \nMedicare beneficiaries and lost savings that are being generated for \nthe Medicare Program.\n  A vote in favor of S. 971 is a vote in favor of ensuring improved, \nbetter managed care for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries and \nsmarter spending in the Medicare Program.\n  This bill has gone through regular order. It passed the Ways and \nMeans Committee. I would like to thank Chairman Ryan and Ranking Member \nLevin for that. I would also like to thank the Ways and Means Committee \nstaff on both sides of the dais, as well as the Energy and Commerce \nstaffs, for discharging and advancing the bill.\n\n  I want to thank Representative Roskam and Representative Thompson and \ntheir staffs. I certainly want to thank J.P. Paluskiewicz and Lauren \nFleming from my office who have worked to get this bill to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, the program has been a success. Mr. Speaker, the program \nhas no cost. Mr. Speaker, the program is generating savings. If it does \nnot generate savings in the future, it goes away.\n  This program is generating higher satisfaction for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. If it does not generate beneficiary satisfaction in the \nfuture, it goes away.\n  The Senate has already passed this bill by unanimous consent. Mr. \nSpeaker, there is no reason for us not to do so as well.\n  I urge everyone to vote in the affirmative.\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Thompson).\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 971, the Medicare \nIndependence at Home Extension Medical Practice Demonstration \nImprovement Act. As was pointed out, it is a 2-year extension to a very \nimportant and critical component of ObamaCare.\n  I thank Mr. Roskam from Illinois and Mr. Burgess from Texas, the two \nfolks who coauthored the House bill with me. I appreciate them and \ntheir staff for the great work they did.\n  According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, more than two-\nthirds of Medicare beneficiaries suffer from multiple chronic \nconditions, the care and the treatment for which account for more than \na majority of the Medicare spending. These costs are expected to \nincrease substantially with the growing population of seniors, \nparticularly those living with multiple chronic conditions.\n  Consequently, there is a need for programs aimed at reducing \nunnecessary hospital admissions and ER visits, strengthening chronic \ncare coordination for our sickest seniors, and slowing the growth in \nMedicare spending.\n  This program, the independence at home demonstration program, was \ncreated in ObamaCare to do just that. This program provides chronically \nill Medicare beneficiaries with primary care services in the comfort of \ntheir homes, where they will be able to retain their independence, \ndignity, and quality of life. It is essential. In essence, it is \ndoctors making house calls, a ``back to the future'' way of providing \ncare.\n  The demonstration is targeted; it is immediate; it is proven; it is \nfiscally responsible, and it is in high demand by Medicare \nbeneficiaries and their families in my home State of California and \nevery State in the Nation.\n  During its first year, the demonstration saved over $25 million, an \naverage of over $3,000 per benefactor. These are very real savings, and \nthere is more to come if we act today to extend this important and \nsuccessful demonstration for 2 more years. Without this extension, \nthere would be a disruption in care for our most fragile seniors and \nlost savings to the Medicare Program.\n\n[[Page H5219]]\n\n  The independence at home demonstration enjoys strong, bipartisan \nsupport in both the House and the Senate. It passed the Senate by \nunanimous consent and in the Ways and Means Committee on a voice vote. \nI hope that we do the same here. I urge everyone to vote for this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I \nam prepared to close.\n  Mr. McDERMOTT.

Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government is hoarding \nAmerican land. The bureaucrats own about 640 million acres of it. That \nis 27 percent of America, larger than all of Western Europe.\n  The government cannot afford this massive estate. Notice this map. \nAll the red area is what the Federal Government owns. Over half the \nWest is owned by the Federal Government.\n  Day by day, unused and unmaintained land sits idle. Instead of Uncle \nSam hoarding this land, the government should consider selling the land \nto Americans. To be clear, I am not talking about selling off national \nparks, monuments, forests, or protected areas--just unused land and \nunmaintained land the government doesn't take care of.\n  The revenue from the sales could go toward reducing the debt or \nimproving transportation. Plus, the sale of land would help State and \nlocal governments because new property owners will be paying taxes on \nthe land.\n  Time for the Federal Government to let Americans own more of America. \nDoes Uncle Sam really need all of this land?\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5219-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5219-H5220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PURSUING PEACE THROUGH DIPLOMACY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Young of Iowa). Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from New Jersey \n(Mrs. Watson Coleman) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of \nthe minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the United States and \nour allies reached a landmark agreement with Iran to prevent them from \nobtaining a nuclear weapon.\n  To get to this point, Mr. Speaker, we used diplomacy to find a \npotential solution that seeks to stabilize the entire Middle East \nregion. Diplomacy affords us a clearer picture of what the Iranian \nGovernment is doing and what they are capable of.\n  We used peaceful means to promote peace in one of the most volatile \nregions in the world, and I am proud of the commitment of President \nObama, this administration, and our allies, in keeping these \nnegotiations alive.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am not saying that our job is done. Congress must and \nshould take a very close look at this agreement in its final form. In \nfact, I firmly believe that Congress has a critical role to play in the \nnext steps of this agreement.\n  Let's look at what this agreement does. Within the text, Iran affirms \nthat it will not seek, develop, or acquire a nuclear weapon; but we \nmust ensure that the language will fully deter them from going back on \ntheir word and duly punish them if they take that path.\n  Within the text of the agreement, we accept that the United States \nwill lift the sanctions that we have placed on Iran, but we must have \nmechanisms that will allow for oversight on the ground in Iran that \nholds them accountable.\n  This is a difficult and sensitive balance, but if this agreement has \nmanaged to strike that balance, we would miss a once-in-a-generation \nopportunity to transform the Middle East if we reject this deal. That \nis not something we can afford to flippantly dismiss.\n  What this teaches us, Mr. Speaker, is that aggression is not the only \nanswer we have to handle difficult relations across the globe. In fact, \naggression would not have brought us to this point where, without any \nloss of life for us or our allies, without significant cost to our \nNation or the global economy, we have managed to find compromise.\n  Sanctions cannot and should not be the only way we bring nations to \nthe table. They serve a critical purpose, and certainly, they helped in \nbringing us to this point.\n  They also come at a significant cost; rather than starving their \ngovernment\n\n[[Page H5220]]\n\nin the way we thought they would, they pushed the government to starve \nits people, resulting in vast unemployment and limited opportunity for \na generation of Iranians and probably fertile ground for the \nradicalization of individuals.\n  They pushed Iran to ally itself with international actors that \nfurther hampered our efforts to stabilize this region. They pushed Iran \ntowards total isolation, a situation in which we have no impact \nwhatsoever. At some point, sanctions that have at points been effective \nbecome obsolete and counterproductive.\n  I would not ask any of my colleagues to support a deal that does not \nachieve our chief purpose, preventing a nuclear-armed Iran, with the \nability to wreak havoc on the United States, our allies, and the world.\n  I will also ask my colleagues to consider the alternative if we fail \nto ratify a deal that would meet these goals appropriately, pushing \nIran further into the shadows; giving us no chance at monitoring how, \nwhere, and when Iran is enriching uranium; and sending Iran further \ninto the arms of bad actors or offering Iran even greater motivation to \nundermine basic international law.\n  I have one pretty solid idea of the outcome: a dangerous, complicated \nwar that would drag what is likely the most volatile region in the \nworld into complete chaos.\n  This agreement may be the best chance to put Iran at the table and \nkeep them accountable, to engage the international community in \nmonitoring their activities, to operate in the known and not the \nunknown of what they are capable of, and to give them a reason to seek \nthe same kind of international peace that every country desperately \nrelies upon.\n  Further aggression, further sanctions, further isolation can no \nlonger be our answer, especially when we have been given a real \nopportunity to open the door to peace.\n  I urge my colleagues to give this agreement real consideration. I \nurge my colleagues to read this agreement. I urge my colleagues to \napproach this agreement without partisan or political bias.\n  It is time to give peace a chance.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking Bonnie Watson Coleman \nfor leading this important special order and for her leadership on \nthese issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, yesterday, President Obama announced that the United \nStates--along with our P5+1 negotiating partners--had reached a deal \nwith Iran--a deal that if fully implemented, will prevent Iran from \nobtaining a nuclear weapon.\n  As someone who has long supported sustained diplomatic engagement \nwith Iran, I applaud President Obama, Secretary Kerry, and our P5+1 \npartners for their tireless work to obtain a deal which promotes peace \nand global security.\n  In the 112th and 113th Congresses, I introduced a bill--the Prevent \nIran from Acquiring Nuclear Weapons and Stop War Through Diplomacy \nAct--that called on the President to use all diplomatic means to \nresolve the nuclear issue with Iran. It urged the President to ``secure \nan agreement that ensures Iran does not engage in nuclear weapons \nwork,'' through increased safeguards and international Inspections,\n  Yesterday's announcement demonstrates just how effective that type of \nsustained engagement and diplomacy can be.\n  When fully implemented, this deal--or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction--will prevent an Iranian nuclear weapon while ensuring greater \nstability in the Middle East. The deal is an important victory for \ndiplomacy and America's leadership abroad as well as for United States \nnational security and of course for global peace and security.\n  And as the President said yesterday during his announcement--``This \ndeal meets every single one of the bottom lines we established when we \nachieved a framework earlier this spring. Every pathway to a nuclear \nweapon is cut off.''\n  Prior to yesterday's announcement, negotiations with Iran had already \nled to a first-step agreement that has significant reduced Iran's \nnuclear stockpile and their ability to create a nuclear weapon. Without \nthose negotiations and the framework agreements, Iran's nuclear program \nwould have been unmonitored, unrestrained and Iran would have continued \nthe production of medium enriched uranium.\n  Now, we know that more work remains. The deal has to go to the United \nNations Security Council--and Congress now has 60 days to review the \nterms of the agreement.\n  Mr. Speaker, all of us share the same goal; preventing Iran from \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon.\n  That is why it is critical--as this process moves forward--that \nCongress act in good faith and ensure the success of this agreement.\n  This negotiated deal, between Iran and our international partners, \nremains the best route to ensuring national and regional security while \npreventing another war in the Middle East.\n  We simply cannot afford the alternative to this deal.\n  Diplomacy is the best way to cut off any potential pathways to an \nIranian nuclear weapon.\n  It is the best way to ensure oversight and inspection.\n  And it is the best way to ensure regional security.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the President, support our \nnegotiators, and to give this deal the chance to succeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5220-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5220-H5225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PORT CHICAGO DISASTER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier) is \nrecognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the \nminority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleagues \nfrom the Congressional Black Caucus, to talk today to the American \npeople about the tragedy of Port Chicago, California, and the injustice \nthat marked the lives of 50 African American sailors in 1944 and \ncontinues to mark every American today.\n  On my right is an overview of where the facility is. It is still an \nexisting Naval facility--or a Department of Defense facility--an \nimportant deepwater port that allows for munitions to go to strategic \nassets in the Pacific.\n  This is the map of the bay area. You can see it is in the Sacramento \ndelta, as the delta comes into the San Francisco Bay. The photograph is \nan aerial photograph, obviously, of how the facility looked in 1944. \nYou can see where the trains came in and put the boxcars into sidings \nthat had concrete on either side to protect people from explosions, and \nthen you can see where the ships docked.\n  In this photograph, there is one ship docked. On the night that we \nwill talk about, there were two ships loaded. In continuously operated \nshifts, those ships were loaded, as witnesses would say, in a manner \nthat sacrificed safety in order for expedience.\n  The fateful, moonless night on Monday, July 17, 1944, was clear and \ncool. A slight breeze was blowing from the southwest. Two cargo ships \nwere tied up at the pier, Port Chicago pier. Under floodlights, work \nwas proceeding at full speed, all hours.\n  Shortly after 10:18 p.m., disaster struck. This is how the day of the \nexplosion is described by Dr. Robert Allen in his book, titled ``The \nPort Chicago Mutiny.''\n  The deadliest homefront disaster of World War II occurred at Port \nChicago Naval Magazine, a major ammunitions facility in my district in \nnorthern California.\n  The shipyard site was 2 miles from a little community of Port \nChicago, population 1,500. In those days, the greater area was largely \nwheat fields and had a very small population of under 50,000. The area \ncurrently has a population of over 600,000.\n  Indicative of the discriminatory practices at the time, all of the \nenlisted men loading ammunition at the site were African American, \nwhereas all of their officers were Caucasian. The explosion killed or \nwounded 710 people, 435 of whom were African American.\n  They had no formal training in safe methods of ammunition or \nexplosives handling given to any of the enlisted men. The Navy failed \nto adequately provide these enlisted men with the tools necessary to be \nable to operate under safe working conditions, even after the tragedy \nstruck.\n  When the surviving 258 African American sailors who, understandably, \nrefused to return to work in these deplorable conditions following the \nexplosion, 50 were charged with mutiny and convicted.\n\n[[Page H5221]]\n\n  During this time, we seek to bring attention to the systemic racial \ndiscrimination suffered by these sailors while on duty, in order to \nbring perspective to the ongoing discrimination against people of color \nas we enter into the weekend which will note the 71st anniversary of \nthis tragedy.\n  Prior to the explosion, many officers at Port Chicago had no previous \ntraining either or experience in ship-loading, handling ammunition, or \ncommanding enlisted men. Many of them were reservists. They were called \nto Active Duty from civilian life and given little or no training. They \nhad to, as they said, learn by doing.\n  Black enlisted men were also untrained. While they were very aware of \nthe inherent danger of their jobs, these African Americans coped by \ndiscounting the risks, much by humor.\n  Weeks before the explosion, the longshoremen's union of San Francisco \nwarned the Navy that there would be disaster at Port Chicago if the \nNavy continued to use untrained seamen to load ammunition.\n  The longshoremen's union was doing similar work in either ports on \nthe West Coast and knew how to load these dangerous materials safely \nand did not sacrifice safety for speed. The union offered to send \nexperienced longshoremen to train Navy recruits in the safe handling of \nammunition, but this offer was ignored by the Navy.\n  Existing policy required the Coast Guard to provide a detail to \nensure that safe handling procedures were followed. Navy commanders \nbelieved that this was unnecessary and would create confusion and \ndisrupt loading.\n  When the Coast Guard tried to oversee operations, it rejected the \nNavy's common practice, including the practice of moving bombs by \nrolling and dropping them into place in the ship's hold. Alternative \nmethods offered by the Coast Guard were considered ``ridiculous'' by \nthe Navy and ignored.\n  In addition, sailors were encouraged to compete against each other to \nload as much ammunition as possible into the ship, and officers placed \nnightly bets among themselves as to which division would load more and \nthen pursued their individual enlisted men to make sure that they would \nwin bets as small as $5.\n  During the environment of this whole period, 8-day work periods were \nwhat were allowed by the Navy. You would have 6 days of loading \nammunition, with a sleep break, and with meals and short rest periods; \nthen after the sixth day, you would have what was called a duty day, \nwhich you would do duty around the facility. You had 1 day of liberty.\n  Now, this, at that time, was a very remote facility and was a long \nway from Oakland, the nearest major city; but many of the enlisted men \nmade that trip anyway and went back to work very exhausted.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Aside from the petty officers, all the officers at Port Chicago were \nwhite. Commanding officers believed Black enlisted men were a major \nproblem rather than an asset.\n  Captain Nelson Goss, the commanding officer of Mare Island, of which \nPort Chicago was a subcommand, said the Black recruits ``arrived with a \nchip on their shoulder, if not, indeed, one on each shoulder.''\n  In actuality, these recruits joined the military to defend their \ncountry and to fight, if necessary, and put themselves in harm's way \noverseas. Captain Goss also complained that they were poor workers, \ncapable of only 60 percent of the work compared to White workers.\n  In turn, Black men resented, obviously, that only they were assigned \nto essential labor battalions charged with doing dangerous work. They \nwere distressed that they could not receive the rating and promotions \nthat they thought they deserved. For men working under these precarious \nconditions, the situation amounted to a new form of slavery.\n  A worker described Port Chicago as a ``slave outfit,'' adding that, \n``We were considered a cheap labor force from the beginning.'' They \nbelieved their lives were worth less. They were treated as if their \nlives were worth less, just as their work and abilities were valued \nless.\n  A group of men drafted a letter in 1943 setting their grievances and \npointing out that the morale among the enlisted men at Port Chicago had \ndropped to an ``alarming depth.''\n  On the evening of 17th, two ships--as I said, the E.A. Bryan and the \nQuinault Victory--the Quinault Victory was a brand-new ship that was \nabout to embark on its maiden voyage--were both in port being loaded. \nThe E.A. Bryan was almost fully loaded as they entered into the \ngraveyard shift.\n  In the enlisted men's barracks a short distance away, it was quiet. \nMany men were in their bunks when suddenly an unbelievable explosion \noccurred shortly after 10:18 p.m.\n  Survivors in Oakland and San Francisco still remember the explosion \nfrom 20 and 35 miles away. People in the nearby rural communities \ncontinue to remember this explosion the way survivors of the earthquake \nin San Francisco did for many years after.\n  The E.A. Bryan was loaded that night with 4,600 tons of ammunition \nand high explosives. Bombs weighing 650 pounds each and with their \nactivating mechanisms, or fuses, fully installed were being loaded one \nat a time.\n  The dock and the ship had disappeared after the explosion. The E.A. \nBryan was eviscerated. Very few pieces were found of this large ship. \nThe Quinault Victory was lifted clear out of the water in an instant by \nthe blast, turned over, and broken into pieces, with very little of it \nremaining. The 1,200-foot-long wooden pier simply disappeared.\n  This is the day after the explosion, and this is what was left of the \npier.\n  During the evening, the accounts talk about people in the barracks \nbeing completely in black because all the electricity went out. Not \nknowing what had happened, not knowing what had happened to their \ncolleagues down at the pier, many of them thought they were under \nattack by the Japanese.\n  I have one account from Jack Critten, who was a guard on duty that \nnight. ``The barracks had a lot of windows, lower and upper deck, whole \nside was windows.'' This is a distance away from this site. ``And they \nwere blown to pieces. Some guys lost their sight; others were badly \ncut. Finally, they got the emergency lights together. Then some guys \ncame by in a truck. And we went down to the dock, but when we got \nthere, we didn't see no dock, no ship, no nothing,'' just darkness.\n  Everyone onboard the two ships and the fire barge were killed \ninstantly: 320 men, 202 of whom were African American. Another 390 \nmilitary personnel and civilians were injured, including 233 Black \nenlisted men.\n  This single stunning disaster accounted for more than 15 percent of \nall Black naval casualties during World War II. Property damage, \nmilitary and civilian, was estimated at that time at more than $12 \nmillion.\n  Again, Mr. Critten recounted, ``You'd see a shoe with a foot in it, \nand then you would remember how you'd joked about who was gonna be the \nfirst one out of the hold if something went wrong. You'd see a head \nfloating across the water--just the head--or an arm, bodies. Just \nawful.''\n  Four Port Chicago seamen and one Black enlisted man were awarded \nmedals for their heroic conduct in fighting the ammunition boxcar fire \nand subsequent fires that broke out that evening after the explosion.\n  A proposal was presented in Congress to grant families up to $5,000 \nin compensation for the loss of their loved ones. However, when \nMississippi Representative John Rankin objected to the plan because \nmost of the beneficiaries would be Black, Congress reduced the maximum \nallowable grant to $3,000.\n  Four days after the explosion, a Naval Court of Inquiry convened on \nMare Island to inquire into the circumstances of the explosion.\n  Captain Nelson Goss admitted that a port director had previously \nwarned him that, ``Conditions are bad up there. You've got to do \nsomething about it. If you aren't careful, something's going to happen, \nand you'll be held responsible for it.''\n  The judge advocate of the inquiry concluded by addressing the \nquestion of the role of Black enlisted personnel in his official \ninquiry: ``The consensus of opinion of the witness--and practically \nadmitted by the interested parties--is that the colored enlisted \npersonnel are neither temperamentally or intellectually capable of \nhandling high explosives.''\n  In short, they blamed the victims because they were African American.\n\n[[Page H5222]]\n\n  During the weeks after and the days after, the men obviously were in \na state of shock, troubled by the vivid memory of the horrible \nexplosion in which so many of their friends had died and so many of \nthem had believed would come to bear and then, unfortunately, saw the \ntragedy worse than they could imagine.\n  ``Everybody was scared,'' one survivor recalled. ``If someone dropped \na box or slammed a door, people began jumping around like crazy.''\n  Many of the Black survivors expected to be granted survivor's leave, \nas was the custom at the time in the Navy, to visit their families \nbefore being reassigned to regular duty.\n  They waited and waited to get these 30 days off to go visit friends \nand to start to process what they had seen before they would come back \nto regular duty, which they were happy to do.\n  Such leaves were not granted. Even men who had been hospitalized were \nnot granted leaves. All men were to be sent back to work loading \nammunition under the same officers before. However, White officers were \nallowed to go home for 30-day leaves, all of them.\n  You can see why, under these circumstances and given the tragedy, \nmany of the enlisted African American survivors at Port Chicago were \nupset in the 3 weeks after the explosion.\n  They continued to be treated as they were treated before the \nexplosion in spite of their warnings, the warnings of the professionals \nin the longshoremen union, and the United States Coast Guard.\n  So some weeks later the men were sent back to Mare Island, a short \ndistance away from where Port Chicago is, across the strait, where \nmunition ships were again being loaded for the war effort, an important \njob.\n  As the men marched to go back to work 3 weeks after the incident, \nthey still did not know where they were going as they marched.\n  But they did know that, at a certain juncture in the road, they could \nbe ordered to turn right, which would take them to the parade ground, \nor they could be ordered to turn left, which would take them to a ferry \nthat crossed the river to the ammunition loading dock, where they would \ninevitably resume doing the same work they had done before.\n  There was a young enlisted man from New Jersey who had natural \nleadership qualities, who we will hear about shortly, enlisted man \nSmall.\n  He actually directed the cadence as they walked back. And he \ndescribed what happened next as he delivered the cadence and he marched \nhis division back towards the pier:\n  ``I was marching on the left-hand side of the ranks. When the \nlieutenant gave the command `column left,' everybody stopped dead, \nboom, just like that. He said, `Forward march, column left.' Nobody \nmoved.''\n  An officer asked Small, ``Small, are you going to go back to work?'' \nHe answered, ``No, sir.'' The officer asked why. And he said, ``I am \nafraid.''\n  Seen as a leader among the men, others refused to work when he \nrefused to go back. Someone over in the ranks said, ``If Small don't \ngo, we're not going either.''\n  Mr. Speaker, 328 followed enlisted member Small and refused to return \nto work at that moment. 258 were imprisoned as a result. And shortly \nthereafter 50 were charged with conspiring to make mutiny.\n  The trial commenced on Treasure Island shortly thereafter. If these \n50 were convicted of the charge, the men faced prison terms of 15 years \nor death.\n  Mutiny was defined by the defense as ``unlawful opposition or \nresistance to or defiance of superior military authority with a \ndeliberate purpose to usurp, subvert, or override the same.''\n  Mutiny was defined by the prosecution as ``collective \ninsubordination. Collective disobedience of lawful orders of a \nsuperior. A conspiracy to disobey lawful orders of a superior is \nmutiny'' as opposed to what we described.\n  One sailor stated that, ``We didn't know you could define disobeying \norders as being mutiny. We thought mutiny could only happen on a \nship.''\n  A refusal to work is a passive act of resistance, without intent to \nseize power. A mutiny, on the other hand, is an active revolt with the \nintent of taking charge.\n  At this point, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. \nRichmond), the gentleman from the Congressional Black Caucus.\n  Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire from the Chair how much time \nremains?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California has 35 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. RICHMOND. First I would like to thank Congressman DeSaulnier for \nbringing this important issue up and highlighting, one, the \ncontribution made by the sailors; two, the challenges they faced during \nthis ordeal; and, three, the remarkable sense of patriotism that each \none of them exhibited and their desire to serve our country.\n  Not often do we bring up things that happened 71 years ago, \nespecially things that have not gained a lot of media attention. But \nthe sacrifice of every man and woman in this country, whether Black, \nWhite, or otherwise, deserves recognition.\n  So I am honored to be a part of this hour tonight, and I feel really \nprivileged that I get a chance to talk about a few of my constituents' \nfamilies that really exemplified what is best in America and what is \nbest about the American people.\n  So the first sailor I will start with is Ernest Joseph Gaines. He was \na native of New Orleans. He enlisted in the Navy in 1942, when he was \nonly 20 years old.\n  Before enlisting, he worked as a helper, doing sheet metal work in a \nmachine shop. At Port Chicago, he was a winch operator and worked \nloading the E.A. Bryan, one of the ships that was destroyed in the \nexplosion at the base.\n  At the mutiny trial, Gaines testified that he had ``a lot of \ntrouble'' controlling the winch he was operating. After the explosion, \nhe said he became afraid of loading ammunition because he knew he could \nnot control the winch.\n  And just as a side note here, there was a report of trouble with the \nbrake on the number one winch on the E.A. Bryan before the explosion, \nbut whether it was fixed is not known to us.\n  The next person I would like to talk about is Martin Bordenave from \nNew Orleans. And just think about his eagerness to show his patriotism.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Mr. Speaker, he initially volunteered for the Navy in 1942 when he \nwas 16 years old. He wanted to follow in the footsteps of his four \nolder brothers, all of whom had enlisted in the Navy. When they \ndiscovered he was underaged, they immediately discharged him, but he \nimmediately reenlisted in 1944 when he was of proper age. In the \nmeantime, Bordenave worked as a painter helping his father who had a \njob painting houses. The ultimate thing with Bordenave, although his \npatriotism is remarkable, he was one of the African American soldiers \nthat was injured in the explosion and hospitalized.\n  Of the last two, one of which is Miller Matthews, he was born and \nraised in New Orleans, had 5 years of elementary education before \nbecoming a shoeshine boy, then a busboy, and then a delivery boy, \nbefore finally becoming a longshoreman loading and unloading \nMississippi riverboats for 6 years. He enlisted in the Navy in 1943 at \nthe age of 27.\n  Then we have Lloyd McKinney, Mr. Speaker, who was born and raised in \nDonaldsonville, Louisiana, which is another part of my district, where \nhe completed 1 year of high school and then went on to work as a porter \nin a hotel and later as a helper in an auto repair shop. He enlisted at \nthe age of 18 in 1942. McKinney, in the explosion, suffered lacerations \nfrom flying glass. But imagine this: he declined to be taken to the \nhospital because he did not want to take up space that other officers \nwould need because they were more seriously injured.\n  So again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for really \nbringing up this story, which I am not ashamed to say is a story that \nwas new to me, and I think that every day we learn more and more about \nour country, about the people who sacrificed to make this country \ngreat; and talking about past instances of discrimination and unfair \ntreatment that African Americans went through, especially while serving \ntheir country, only makes this country better. It helps us share \nperspective and gives us the real-life experiences that others went\n\n[[Page H5223]]\n\nthrough, which makes this country stronger, which makes this country \nbetter, and it breeds understanding and a love that makes us \nexceptional.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague again for letting me \nparticipate in this Special Order.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Thank you, Mr. Richmond.\n  I yield, Mr. Speaker, to the gentlewoman from New Jersey, \nRepresentative Watson Coleman, my friend.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlemen for yielding \nto me.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join his call for justice for the \nsailors and their families who suffered in the discriminatory and \ncallous response to the Port Chicago Naval Magazine tragedy.\n  This is of particular importance to me because I have the honor of \nrepresenting the district that the alleged leader of that protest, \nJoseph Randolph Small, had called home. It is also important because of \nwhere we are in the arc of history. The events of the past couple \nmonths have forced our Nation to do quite a bit of soul-searching on \nthe topic of race and the enduring injustices felt by men and women of \ncolor.\n  From the seemingly inexplicable use of force against unarmed people \nof color in cases like those of Walter Scott in South Carolina and \nTamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio, to the explicit and disturbing hate \ncrime committed at Mother Emanuel, we know that the bias and \ndiscrimination that occurred at Port Chicago is not isolated to the \npast.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, if there is any positive outcome to these \ntragedies, it is in the opportunity to heal long buried but never \nbandaged wounds. Recognizing one such wound, South Carolina recently \nvoted to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of its \nstatehouse. Exonerating the sailors who were unfairly punished simply \nfor seeking safer working conditions would help heal yet another.\n  Mr. Speaker, as my colleague already described, in 1944, a segregated \nU.S. Navy used Black enlisted men with no training to do the heavy, \ndangerous work of loading ammunition onto vessels that would transport \nthem to the front. That lack of training and neglect for the safety of \nthose sailors led to the greatest homefront disaster of World War II \nand claimed several hundred lives--most of them Black.\n  Small, who hailed from beautiful Somerset, New Jersey, led the \nprotest because the survivors understood that to return to the same \nroutine would mean risking another explosion. That simple protest of \nbasic rights and consideration led to convictions of mutiny, prison \nsentences, and dishonorable discharges for the sailors who stood with \nSmall.\n  Before the explosion, Small had complained to the new commander that \nhe was promoting inherently dangerous behavior by rewarding the sailors \nwho could load the most ammunition in the shortest period of time. \nSmall was ignored. And after joining his peers in protest, he was kept \nin solitary confinement during his trial and sentenced to 15 years \nsimply for seeking justice.\n  Mr. Speaker, exonerating these men would make right a longstanding \ninjustice, and I am proud to stand with my colleagues in this call for \naction. I thank the gentleman for his work.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlemen for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman DeSaulnier and Congresswoman \nLee for their leadership and drawing attention to this issue and for \nhelping to bring attention to this story of injustice. The story of the \nPort Chicago 50 isn't in most textbooks or histories of World War II, \nbut perhaps it should be.\n  While it may not be this Nation's proudest moment, it is a part of \nour history, and it is a tragic event from which we can learn and we \ncan actually grow, I think, as a nation.\n  The enlisted men stationed at the Port Chicago Naval Magazine, \nincluding the Port Chicago 50, served our Nation proudly, and they \nserved her honorably. For that, they deserve our gratitude.\n  For those unfamiliar with the story, and I know it has already been \ntalked about, but I would like to talk about it very briefly again.\n  Following a catastrophic cargo vessel explosion on July 17, 1944, \nwhich killed or wounded 710 people, several enlisted men voiced \nconcerns about continuing to handle munitions at the port. Among those \nvoicing concerns were two gentlemen from Cincinnati, Ohio, from the \narea that I am proud to serve, Mentor Burns and Edward Lee Longmire. \nBoth men enlisted in 1943. They were not lifelong soldiers with \nextensive training. They were ordinary, patriotic Americans doing their \npart to help in the war effort. Mr. Burns was a wood-turner in a \nfurniture factory before enlisting. Mr. Longmire worked as a sales \nclerk selling poultry.\n  Nothing in their background prepared them for handling munitions, \nand, unfortunately, the Navy at that time, did not provide adequate \ntraining for the men serving at Port Chicago. So it is understandable \nthat the men who survived the explosion were reluctant to continue \nloading munitions without efforts to make the process safer. For that, \nthey were charged with mutiny.\n  Reluctance and even refusal to return to unsafe conditions and \nprocedures is not mutiny; it is common sense.\n  Mr. Speaker, America is the greatest country on the face of the \nglobe, but that doesn't mean we don't at times make mistakes, and that \nis what happened here. Injustices like the mutiny convictions for the \nPort Chicago 50 certainly fall within that category. However, one of \nthe things that makes America great is the freedom of the American \npeople and the people's elected representatives to speak out against \ninjustices, correct past wrongs, and strive for a better future for all \nof us.\n  Mr. Speaker, we can't go back in time and prevent the convictions of \nthe Port Chicago 50, but we can correct the record, and we can \nexonerate those wrongfully convicted and give their families and their \nloved ones the peace of knowing that they served our Nation honorably \nand faithfully and that they did nothing wrong.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is far past time that the Port Chicago 50 received \njustice. We owe it to Mr. Burns, Mr. Longmire, and the rest of those \nwrongfully convicted and discharged. We need to set the record \nstraight.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for making it possible for us this \nevening to participate in this effort.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his eloquence \nand to the point of what we asked for today.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), my neighbor, my \ncolleague, and my partner in this effort.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me just start by thanking my colleague and \nmy neighbor in the East Bay, Congressman DeSaulnier, for organizing \nthis very important and long overdue Special Order.\n  Since being elected to the House, Congressman DeSaulnier, you have \nreally been doing a phenomenal job working on behalf of your \nconstituents on a whole range of issues as a member of the Oversight \nand Government Reform Committee. So I know your constituents are \nthanking you, but I just want to thank you for coming and hitting the \nground running on so many issues, including our efforts to eliminate \npoverty.\n  Also tonight, it is so important, this special hour, calling for the \nexoneration of these brave and courageous men. This is an issue, I must \nsay, that I have worked on for many, many years, first as a staffer to \nmy mentor and predecessor, Congressman Ron Dellums, and then alongside \nyour predecessor, Congressman George Miller, who was a true leader on \nso many issues.\n  Some, and you may have mentioned this earlier, may know that in 1999 \nwe pulled together a national petition and persuaded President Clinton \nto pardon one of the few surviving convicted sailors affected by this \ntragedy. We also worked tirelessly to preserve the Port Chicago \nNational Memorial through legislation, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine \nMemorial Enhancement Act, which President Obama signed into law in \n2009. So I am very pleased to see that we are here tonight once again \ncalling for justice for the African American sailors at Port Chicago.\n\n[[Page H5224]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this story needs to be told over and over and over \nagain, as we are doing tonight. And, once again, thank you for taking \nthat baton, continuing to fight the good fight for justice, Congressman \nDeSaulnier.\n  We stand here just days before the 71st anniversary of a national \ntragedy that is far too often forgotten. Today we remember 320 American \nsailors--African American soldiers were, I think, 200 of the 320--who \nlost their lives in the deadliest homefront disaster of World War II. \nBut we also remember how deeply this tragedy was marked by, yes, \ninstitutional racism and the solemn duty we have to undue the legacy of \nthat racism today, which Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman talked \nabout very eloquently.\n  The Port Chicago Naval Magazine, as some may know, is located near \nConcord, California, right next to my congressional district. On the \nevening of July 17, 1944, a violent explosion ripped through the \nmagazine, shattering piers, destroying vital ships, and blowing out \nwindows as far away as San Francisco. As I said earlier, all in all, \n320 sailors lost their lives; 200 of them were African Americans.\n  The cause of this tragedy was inadequate training and insufficient \nsafety precautions around handling active munitions. All of the \nenlisted men who were unloading the active munitions onto a cargo \nvessel at the time of the explosion were African American. Our Nation's \nthen-segregated military barred African American enlisted servicemen \nfrom active naval duty and, therefore, from receiving the proper \ntraining to handle artillery.\n  Nevertheless, White officers at Port Chicago ordered African American \nsailors to improperly load active munitions into ships resulting in the \ntragic explosion. These men died serving their country on the homefront \nand died because their lives and personal safety were not valued by \ntheir commanding officers.\n  But the story does not end there. Three weeks after the tragedy, the \nmore than 300 African Americans sailors who survived the tragedy were \nonce again ordered to continue loading ships in the same perilous \nfashion. Nearly all of them stood their ground and refused to return to \nwork without proper safety conditions and ammunition training in place. \nAll of those who refused to go back to work in unsafe conditions were \narrested, and 208 of them were sentenced to bad conduct discharges and \nforfeiture of 3 months' pay for disobeying orders.\n  This is mind-boggling as I recount the history of this tonight. It is \nso sad.\n  The 50 of these men who stood up for their rights and spoke truth to \npower about the value of their lives were charged with mutiny--mutiny, \nmind you--convicted and sentenced to hard labor, and dishonorably \ndischarged from the Navy. They are now known as the Port Chicago 50.\n  So we are here tonight, Mr. Speaker, demanding justice for their \ncourage and recognition for their service. Instead of being cited for \nmutiny and dishonor, these men should be recognized for standing up to \nthe specter of discrimination and racism in the Armed Forces. As the \ndaughter of a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army, I remember these \ndays very, very vividly as a child.\n  These naval sailors, these men, showed that their courageous act of \ndefiance really is part of the long history of people of color \ndemanding just basic respect for their rights and their lives, which \ncontinues to this day. That is why it is so important for us to stand \nhere tonight and remember their brave actions and how they pushed us \ntowards progress in our Nation and the Armed Forces.\n  But to date, only one of the Port Chicago 50 has been pardoned--only \none. For the remaining 49, their families have been patiently waiting \nfor their names to be cleared of this unjust conviction.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join us in calling for the exoneration of \nthese 49 sailors. These brave sailors should be remembered for their \ncourage. They were heroes. They are heroes. They stood up in the face \nof discrimination and the devaluing of Black lives.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  We must continue to tell the story, which is far too often left out \nof our narratives on civil rights; military history; and, yes, \nCalifornia history; and the history of our Nation.\n  As Dr. King said and, Congressman DeSaulnier, I am reminded of this \ntonight because you are certainly showing us that Dr. King's quote, the \narc of history is long, but it bends towards justice, this is one night \nthat you are helping to bend that arc towards justice.\n  Thank you again, Congressman DeSaulnier, for your leadership and \nensuring that not only we remember those who were lost in this tragedy, \nbut that we move forward and exonerate each and every one of them.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Thank you, Congresswoman Lee. Thank you for all of \nyour support.\n  I do want to thank and recognize my predecessor, Congressman Miller \nand his staff, particularly his former chief of staff, John Lawrence, \nwho put so much effort into this and still has been helpful.\n  I just want to conclude, Mr. Speaker, with a few brief comments and a \nquote from Thurgood Marshall and then a brief quote from Mr. Small.\n  Thurgood Marshall was then chief counsel of the NAACP, and he came \nWest to observe the case. During the trial, Marshall declared:\n\n       This is not an individual case. This is not 50 men on trial \n     for mutiny. This is the Navy on trial for its whole vicious \n     policy towards Blacks. Black Americans are not afraid of \n     anything anymore than anyone else is. Blacks in the Navy \n     don't mind loading ammunition. They just want to know why \n     they are the only ones doing the loading. They wanted to know \n     why they are segregated, why they don't get promoted.\n\n  The future Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Mr. Marshall, \ncontinued. He said:\n\n       I want to know why the Navy disregarded official warnings \n     by the San Francisco waterfront unions--before the Port \n     Chicago disaster--that an explosion was inevitable if they \n     persisted in using untrained seamen in the loading of \n     ammunition.\n       I want to know why the Navy disregarded an offer by these \n     same unions to send experienced men to train Navy personnel \n     in the safe handling of explosives. I want to know why \n     commissioned officers at Port Chicago were allowed to race \n     their men. I want to know why bets ranging from $5 up were \n     made between division officers as to whose crew would load \n     more ammunition.\n\n  Still, these men were convicted, whereupon Mr. Marshall responded \nafter the trial by saying these men were tried and convicted of mutiny \n``solely because of their race and color.''\n  He continued:\n\n       The accused were made scapegoats in a situation brought \n     about by a combination of circumstances.\n\n  He concluded by saying:\n\n       Justice can only be done in this case by a complete \n     reversal of the findings.\n\n  That is why we are here today.\n  Mr. Speaker, the events at Port Chicago and their aftermath played a \nrole in the eventual desegregation of the Armed Forces in 1948. That \nwas a good thing.\n  The rebellion by the Port Chicago 50, like the civil rights movement \nof the 1960s and the ongoing conversation today on violence against \nAmericans of color, are a part of a continued struggle against social \ninjustice.\n  Joseph Small described the events, just before his death, in an \ninterview by the author of a book on the incident. Mr. Small said:\n\n       So my only way of changing what was an impossible situation \n     was not to work. It wasn't a planned thing; it was brought on \n     by circumstances, working conditions--it was inevitable, just \n     the same way the explosion was inevitable. Something would \n     have happened to set off that explosion because of the way \n     they were handling the ammunition; it had to happen.\n       What else can I say? It has been more than 40 years ago, \n     but that is more vivid in my memory than the actual court-\n     martial--the conditions under which we were working, because \n     they were so appalling.\n\n  That is apropos for many instances that we see today in our society.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the Nation seeks to heal the deep racial wound that \ncontinues to permeate into violent acts of our fellow citizens of \ncolor, we must seek to rectify injustices like these in order to \ncontinue to forge a better future--as Dr. King said so well: \n``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.''\n  America would do well to remember Port Chicago; indeed, America must \nremember Port Chicago. For Marshall's words are more poignant today \nthan ever before when he said, during the trial: ``What's at stake here \nis more\n\n[[Page H5225]]\n\nthan the rights of my clients. It's the moral commitment stated in our \nNation's creed.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5225-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5225-H5231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Washington?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with friends and colleagues \nfrom every corner of our great country to support an American \ninstitution that, in its 81 years, has created countless jobs here at \nhome and supported the export of American-made goods around the world.\n  The Export-Import Bank, while first created under Franklin D. \nRoosevelt in response to the Great Depression, is an institution that \nhas supported American manufacturers and producers through both good \ntimes and bad; it has experienced strong support over the years from \nboth Republicans and Democrats.\n  President Ronald Reagan, praising the Export-Import Bank, declared:\n\n       Exports create and sustain jobs for millions of American \n     workers and contribute to the growth and strength of the \n     United States economy. The Export-Import Bank contributes in \n     a significant way to our Nation's export sales.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the charter for the Export-Import Bank recently expired \non June 30 of this year, depriving our Nation of a critical financial \ntool for growing our economy in an age where we must stay as \ncompetitive as possible in the global economy.\n  Today, my colleagues and I will explain the role of the Bank, clear \nup any misconceptions surrounding it, and explain that, like any \ninstitution, it should be reformed to make it leaner and more \ncompetitive; this is still a very worthwhile institution that we should \nsupport and reauthorize as soon as possible.\n  I urge House leadership to allow a vote to reauthorize the Export-\nImport Bank and let the members of this Chamber weigh the merits of the \nBank for themselves.\n  I would like to extend a special thanks to my colleagues, Congressman \nCollins from New York and Congressman Fincher from Tennessee, who \nhelped organize today's Special Order.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher) \nfor his thoughts on the Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington for \nyielding on this important subject and the rest of my colleagues for \ncoming tonight to hopefully shed light on why the Export-Import Bank is \nso important.\n  I have a few stats I just want to read. My comments will be brief. \nThe Bank supports about 200,000 jobs each year at no cost--let me \nrepeat--no cost to the U.S. taxpayer, including 8,315 jobs in my home \nState of Tennessee. That is around 1.4 million American jobs in the \npast 5 years.\n  In fiscal year 2014, Ex-Im Bank supported $27.5 billion in exports \nand 164,000 U.S. jobs. The Bank returned $675 million to the U.S. \nTreasury in fiscal year 2014, reducing the deficit. In fiscal year \n2013, the Bank sent back more than $1 billion. Small businesses \naccounted for nearly 90 percent of the Bank's transactions in 2014.\n  Last year, the Bank had a historically low active default rate of \nless than one-quarter of 1 percent. Its default rate for the past \nquarter was .167 percent.\n  We have a very, very serious obligation to our constituents that we \nrepresent back in our districts. I serve the Eighth Congressional \nDistrict of Tennessee--a wonderful State and a wonderful district--and \nmy constituents send me to Washington to make the government more \naccountable, to make it better, to make it smaller, to make it more \ntransparent, and to make it work for them back in their districts.\n  They don't send me to Washington--I don't go home every week to my \ndistrict, and my constituents come to me and say: Stephen, we wish you \nwould shut down the government this week. We wish you would end, \nStephen, the only good government programs that work. We want you to \nabolish them.\n  They send us up here to make these things work. The Export-Import \nBank is in need of serious reforms, and that is why, a few months ago, \nwe started to work on a reform package, our bill to reauthorize with \nreforms, with 31 reforms, to fix the Bank and to make it work better \nand more transparent and more accountable.\n  For some reason, some of my colleagues in the House have taken a very \ndifferent approach. They have taken a political approach that this is \ngoing to be the hill, so to speak, that they are going to die on and \nthe facts don't matter; all that matters are the political outside \ngroups calling for whatever is in their best interest, not the best \ninterest of our districts and our constituents back home.\n  Think about this. I go home to my district and my constituents come \nup to me and say: Congressman, have you been able to get rid of Freddie \nMac and Fannie Mae?\n  I will say to them: Well, we are working on it.\n  They say: Well, Congressman, have you been able to reform Medicare \nand Social Security and make sure it is solvent for future generations?\n  I say: Well, we are working on it.\n  They say: Well, Congressman, have you been able to do tax reform?\n  I say: Well, we are getting there.\n  They say: But, Congressman, let me make sure I understand that the \nonly thing that Congress did do was get rid of the only thing that \nworked that helped create my job, and now, I am on the unemployment \nline because I don't have a job.\n  Surely, surely, we are better than this and that we can work for our \nconstituents all over this great country.\n  I look back at history, and I look back a few years ago. In 2006, \nthis was voice voted. My chairman, who is on opposite sides with me on \nthis issue, was here in 2006. Now, if this was such a big deal, why in \n2006 was this issue not raised? We are doing more in the way of reforms \nprobably than Ronald Reagan did many, many years ago.\n  Plain and simple, this is about jobs; this is about making sure that \nwe are working for our districts; this is a serious reform bill that \nmoves this Export-Import Bank in the right direction by making it work.\n  I urge my colleagues--hopefully, we get a chance to vote on this in \nthe next week to 10 days, but that we pass this, and we do what is \nright for our constituents.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Thank you, Mr. Fincher. I thank you for bringing \nforward the legislation to reauthorize the Bank and for your compelling \narguments. Those are great strong statistics on the benefits that Ex-Im \nhas given our country, the manufacturers, and employees all over the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. Speaker, next, I yield to the gentleman from the State of New \nYork (Mr. Collins).\n  Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from \nWashington for his work organizing this Special Order and certainly \nthank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher) for his steadfast work \nto ensure the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, and his \nimpassioned speech that he just delivered pretty much sums it up.\n  I rise today in support of the Export-Import Bank, which supports \nhundreds of thousands of jobs and returns a profit to the U.S. Treasury \nand ensures that U.S. exporters can compete on a level playing field in \nthe global market.\n  My chart here says it all. The Ex-Im Bank equals jobs.\n  Not too long ago, I said I was befuddled by why the majority of my \nown Conference seemed focused on ending the charter for the Export-\nImport Bank--and I got to give them the credit for this--they did that.\n  Well, we are here to say that we can reauthorize this Bank, get back \nto supporting small business, and growing jobs because that is what \nthis is all about.\n\n[[Page H5226]]\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  There has been misinformation and, I would say, misguided outside \ninfluences that have come into play, as Mr. Fincher pointed out. This \nhas always been voice voted, and all of a sudden, this became the \ncause, as he said, that someone wanted to die on the Hill for.\n  But why do we want to kill jobs in the United States, jobs that \ncontribute to a surplus of exports? We have a trade imbalance. These \njobs are creating exports that are being shipped overseas to reduce \nthat trade imbalance.\n  In my district alone, the Ex-Im Bank supports over 700 jobs and $100 \nmillion in exports. Reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank is vital for \nmanufacturers of all sizes to grow and to prosper in a competitive \nworld economy.\n  U.S. exporters look to the Ex-Im Bank when they face direct \ncompetition from foreign export credit agencies when regulatory \nconstraints hinder commercial lending, when they are selling in the \nmarkets with political risks or economic uncertainty, or when a foreign \ncustomer requires official export credit as part of the bidding \nprocess.\n  Unlike most, I know from experience. Before coming to Congress, I \nstarted and ran a number of small businesses. One of those small \nbusinesses that I founded in 2004 was Audubon Machinery Corporation, \nlocated in North Tonawanda, New York.\n  Today Audubon is a diversified manufacturing company that, amongst \nother things, exports oxygen-generating systems around the world. These \nare medical-grade oxygen systems used in hospitals in Nigeria, Vietnam, \nMainland China, places where the hospitals don't have the liquid oxygen \ntank outside like they do in the U.S. and Europe.\n  We simply take the nitrogen out of the air we breathe. The air we \nbreathe is 22 percent oxygen and 78 percent nitrogen.\n  We take that nitrogen out of the air, producing 93 percent medical-\ngrade oxygen used in these hospitals throughout the developing \ncountries in Africa, South America, Asia, and, like I said, there are \nmajor exports into Mainland China.\n  The Export-Import Bank plays a critical role in what we do. We pay a \nfee to the Export-Import Bank to provide a guarantee to our commercial \nbank that guarantees a portion of the line of credit we use to buy the \ninventory we need to make the product.\n  I will say it again: In a small business, cash is king. We have to \nbuy materials, and we have to pay our vendors. But we probably are not \ngoing to ship that product for 5 or 6 months, so there is a gap there.\n  We collect our money after we ship, but we have 4 or 5 months in \nwhich we have had to borrow money to buy the inventory to make the \nproduct. That is how business works.\n  The commercial banks in the United States are more than willing to \nloan that money for business done in the United States and perhaps in \nEurope, but in the rest of the world--Africa, Asia, and much of South \nAmerica--the banks will not take that risk.\n  So, with the Export-Import Bank, we pay a fee and they loan us the \nmoney. That is a surplus for the Ex-Im Bank because we are going to \nultimately, certainly, never default on that loan. That is how those \njobs are created.\n  Without the Export-Import Bank, the commercial banks are saying: I am \nnot going to lend you for the inventory you need to ship those hospital \nsystems to Mainland China.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I am fascinated by the example. I had a \nconstituent, actually, who came in to talk to me. He is a manufacturer \nwho manufactures tractors, and tractors cost about $1 million apiece.\n  When he said he was shipping his tractor over to France, the local \nbank that he was dealing with said that there was no way in the world \nit would accept the collateral.\n  So it is a specific example. I assume that is exactly the type of \nthing that we are seeing in small businesses all across the country.\n  Mr. COLLINS of New York. It just comes down to the banks today being \nvery risk averse. I know what they are thinking.\n  Here are their thoughts: We have taken an order from Vietnam to \nproduce a hospital system that costs $250,000. We have to buy the \ninventory. We get the inventory.\n  I think what the bank is worried about is that somehow that order is \ncanceled. When that order is canceled, its fear would be: We are not \ngoing to have any recourse to collect cancellation charges, and we are \ngoing to have this useless inventory in our factory.\n  First of all, in our case, that is not true. We send the same systems \naround the world. In fact, in our case, we would be able to use that \ninventory on a future order.\n  But you can see where the banks would just have a credit policy that \nthey are not going to lend for foreign inventories without some kind of \nbackup. Now, the backup is the Export-Import Bank at about an 80 \npercent guarantee.\n  When I have said I am somewhat befuddled by what we are doing here, I \nhave asked my fellow colleagues directly if they support the Small \nBusiness Administration, the SBA, which makes the very same loan \nguarantees to the very same banks.\n  The small businesses pay a fee for those Small Business \nAdministration loan guarantees for start-up companies.\n  How can you support the SBA, on the one hand, which is helping small \nbusinesses, and not support the Ex-Im Bank, on the other hand, which is \nsupporting small businesses?\n  I will make another point.\n  The default rate on SBA loans is many multiples of that on the Ex-Im \nloans. Why? Start-up companies fail at a pretty regular pace. I can't \ngive you the exact percentage, but we all know that start-up companies \nfail.\n  That is why the SBA makes an 80 percent guarantee for those loans. It \nis so the bank will lend them money. Their risk is very small, but you \nhave a lot of failures.\n  Companies that are producing products and exporting around the world \nhave been in business for 5 or 10 years. You don't open your doors and \nimmediately start making products and shipping them into Mainland \nChina, Vietnam, and Indonesia. No.\n  You are going to wait until you are mature enough to enter those \nmarkets, which is why the default rate is so low. These are small \nbusinesses that have been around for 5 or 10 years.\n  In being around that long, they just need the credit to support the \ninventory for the 4 or 5 months that they are in production. That is \nwhy the default rate is so low.\n  When I have asked fellow Members, ``How can you support the SBA and \nnot the Ex-Im Bank?'' I don't get a good answer.\n  Now, typically, the answer I get is that they will call it the ``bank \nof Boeing'' or the ``bank of General Electric'' because, in competing \nagainst Airbus, which has access to European credit, I would say, \n``Sure. That is another piece of it besides small business, but GE and \nBoeing buy from a lot of small businesses as well. You are absolutely \ninconsistent to say you support the SBA, and you can't support the Ex-\nIm Bank.''\n\n  I know that the moneys my companies have paid for this insurance, if \nyou will, has created that surplus that the Ex-Im Bank returns year in \nand year out.\n  I would like to stay around to continue the discussion, but I think \nit comes back to Ex-Im equals jobs.\n  Ex-Im is creating jobs that manufacture and ship products overseas, \nreducing our trade deficit and creating a surplus for the U.S. Treasury \nto reduce our financial deficit.\n  This should be voice voted like it has been forever. It hasn't been. \nSo now we have got to lead this charge, and that is what we are doing \nhere.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Collins, your stories of small businesses in your \nState and your district, I think, can be told of virtually every \ndistrict in the country. They are very powerful stories.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold), a \ngreat member of our caucus and, technically, a member of our freshman \nteam. I am very happy to have him here this evening.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank my good friend from \nWashington for organizing this Special Order. I want to thank my good \nfriend Mr. Fincher for his work on the legislation, and I thank those \nwho are really talking about trying to create jobs.\n\n[[Page H5227]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, really, what we are talking about here is in terms of \nthe Ex-Im Bank. The Export-Import Bank--it is a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation that we are looking to reauthorize. We are looking to make \nsure that, again, we are creating jobs.\n  As for the reauthorization of the bank, for those who might have \nforgotten and for those who may be tuned in, Mr. Speaker, in 2012, the \nreauthorization passed on a suspension vote of 330-93. It passed in the \nSenate 78-20. This was not three decades ago. This was 3 years ago.\n  There is a reason to support the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank, \nand I appreciate my good friend Mr. Collins for talking about how Ex-Im \nequals jobs. I do believe that is the case.\n  You have all heard the statistics. I mean, 83 percent of the loans \nnationwide from the Ex-Im Bank are going to small businesses. Small \nbusinesses create two-thirds of the net new jobs in our Nation.\n  I have to tell you, in talking to my colleagues around this very \nbody, the number one issue that we encounter is the fact that it is \njobs and the economy. We want to create and make sure that there is a \nrobust number of good, high-paying careers.\n  The Ex-Im Bank enables those small businesses to be able to keep \ntheir doors open, to be able to ship to 96 percent of the world's \nconsumers, which happen to be outside of the United States.\n  It is interesting to me when we talk about this because there are a \nlot of big businesses out there that have the ability and the resources \nto put a plant over in places like Malaysia or Germany or those other \nplaces. It is the small businesses that oftentimes don't have that \nability.\n  You heard me having a conversation with Mr. Collins earlier about \nsomeone who came into my office who was talking about the fact that he \nmanufactures tractors. The tractors aren't big tractors. They are \nfairly small tractors. But the tractors cost about $1 million apiece.\n  If they aren't able to manufacture those tractors here in the United \nStates in getting that Export-Import Bank financing, they will go \nsomewhere else. They have a facility in France that they will be able \nto use. Those are jobs that are going to leave the United States.\n  I do believe that, when we talk about the economic growth in \nmanufacturing, my district and, I know, many of the other districts of \nmy colleagues here are heavy in manufacturing.\n  We are the fourth largest manufacturing district in the 10th District \nof Illinois. We have literally hundreds of jobs--54,000--in the \ndistrict that rely upon exports.\n  I recognize that there are a lot of people who want to talk about \nBoeing, but Boeing actually has three dozen suppliers in the 10th \nDistrict of Illinois. These are three dozen businesses and hundreds of \nemployees who support making things that go into a Boeing plane.\n  You have heard the adage that, when a Boeing plane lands, 21,000 \nsmall businesses land with it. This is important. This is talking about \ngood, high-paying jobs, things that the Export-Import Bank absolutely \nhelps support.\n  The thing that is interesting to me is that, if we choose to not \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank, who loses? Our competitors overseas \nhave export financing. Our small businesses will be the ones that lose.\n  We are going to, in essence, tie one hand behind our back and make us \nless competitive. I can't think of a crazier thing, that of making us \nless competitive.\n  We want to be more competitive. We want to give our small businesses \nevery advantage possible to be able to go out and compete and win. This \nis what we have an obligation to do. This is what we have an \nopportunity to do.\n  I am delighted to be able to stand up here with my friends to talk in \na bipartisan way, actually, about why it is important that we \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  It is because there are jobs and there are businesses in Vernon \nHills, in Wheeling, in Lincolnshire, in Northbrook, in Waukegan, in \nGlenview, in Des Plaines, in Gurnee, in Elmhurst, in Lake Villa, in \nBannockburn, and in Mount Prospect. These are all towns in the 10th \nDistrict that have companies that utilize the Export-Import Bank.\n  This is not some random deal. This is something that small businesses \nutilize in order to make sure that they can sell their goods to places \nall over the globe, to places like France, Germany, India, and China.\n  It is super important that we give them the opportunity to not only \nmake it here in America, but to be able to send it all over the globe.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we are looking for an opportunity to end a government \nprogram, listen, I am all for government accountability and for trying \nto make sure that the government is smaller and more responsive. Let's \nnot focus on a government program that brings billions of dollars into \nthe Federal Treasury and creates jobs.\n  We have heard about the crony capitalism. Frankly, I think that we \nneed to be focusing on how we help small businesses because, again, if \nwe shut down the Export-Import Bank, who loses? It is our small \nbusinesses, not the small businesses that they compete against that may \nbe overseas, because they will have an export financing arm.\n  As my friend Mr. Collins was talking about before, if the private \nsector and the private sector banks would do it, I understand, but \nthere are a lot of those private sector banks and a lot of those local \ncommunity banks, even those mid-sized banks, that see the collateral go \noverseas that they can't touch and that they can't get back.\n  When they walk in for $1 million of financing to send that tractor \noverseas, the answer is ``no.'' Guess what. They can't hire that next \nindividual to create and make that tractor.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  We need export financing. We need to make sure that the Export-Import \nBank has some restructuring. This bill does some of that in terms of \nthe bill that we are looking for, to try to have some changes that go \ninto the Export-Import Bank to make sure that we are having that \nappropriate oversight, to make sure that we are holding them \naccountable. But it is absolutely vital, Mr. Speaker, for good, high-\npaying careers that the Export-Import Bank is reauthorized, and \nreauthorized with an overwhelming support. If it comes to the floor, \nMr. Speaker, I am confident that this passes.\n  I want to thank my good friend from Washington for bringing this up. \nI want to thank my colleagues for standing up and supporting what we \nall know is going to be absolutely good for small business.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I thank Mr. Dold for his comments about the small jobs. \nComing from a State like Washington, as I do, I can certainly relate. \nFully 40 percent of the jobs in my State are related to exports, so we \nunderstand the importance of having all the tools we can at our \ndisposal to make these small businesses successful in the world \neconomy.\n  I would like to yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers), a \ncolleague of mine who sits on the Committee on Rules, for his comments.\n  Mr. STIVERS. I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding. I \nalso thank him for doing this Special Order. This message needs to get \nout. I also want to thank the gentleman from Tennessee, Steve Fincher, \nfor sponsoring the reform bill that makes 31 meaningful reforms in the \nExport-Import Bank.\n  I think it is important to note, we need to reauthorize and reform \nthe Ex-Im Bank. Obviously, the Ex-Im Bank is about jobs. You have heard \nthat message all evening. The charter did expire on June 30. Today, the \nExport-Import Bank can service existing loans, but they can't make new \nloan guarantees. That is why we need to act now to reform and \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  We are facing competition against 59 countries that have similar \nexport credit finance agencies, and it is really important that we \nreauthorize our Export-Import Bank. The worst thing we could do would \nbe to unilaterally disarm in a trade war against these 59 other \ncountries and put our small businesses and job creators and exporters \nat a competitive disadvantage.\n  I want to tell a story about one of the companies in my district \ncalled Davenport Aviation. It is a small exporter that sends aircraft \nspare parts to sub-Saharan Africa. Only 1 percent of exporters use the \nExport-Import Bank, but Davenport Aviation is one that\n\n[[Page H5228]]\n\nreally needs it because in places like Angola and places like \nMozambique, there is a political risk, there is a credit risk, and only \nthe Export-Import Bank can come in and take that risk and make that \nhappen, because, as the gentleman from New York said earlier, it is \nprobably pretty hard to get a bank loan to sell spare parts into \nAngola, Mozambique, and other places in sub-Saharan Africa. Davenport \nAviation has thrived because the Export-Import Bank has been there. Now \nthere are 12 jobs in Davenport Aviation, a company that started with \njust one person just 3 years ago.\n  There are companies like that all throughout my district. J D \nEquipment exports tractors, and Showa Aluminum exports a lot of things \nusing the Export-Import Bank. This bill that Mr. Fincher has created \nwill help make sure those job creators can continue to make and create \nproducts that they export to other countries and create American jobs \nin the process.\n  As you heard, the Fincher bill has 31 reforms that are meaningful. I \nam working on amendments that would create four additional reforms. One \nwould be a reinsurance pilot that would determine the private sector \nprice, an actuarially sound price of this credit insurance just so we \ncould have that conversation. The second is a restructuring of the \nappointment process to make sure that minority and majority views are \nheard on the board of the Export-Import Bank. The third would be a \nreport on any adverse impacts going on to American companies by loans \nthat the Export-Import Bank guarantees. Finally, I have an amendment \nthat would end the discrimination of coal and make sure that we can \nfund an all-of-the-above energy policy through our exports because \nexport markets are an important place for energy and American-made \nenergy. We need to make sure that we create jobs here to export the \nenergy where possible.\n  As you have heard, this debate is about jobs. The Export-Import Bank \nis about jobs. In fact, if we do nothing, America will lose 164,000 \njobs; in Ohio, we will lose 15,300 jobs; and in my district, we will \nlose almost 1,500 jobs. So we have got to act. We need to act to \nreauthorize and reform the Ex-Im Bank.\n  I am working hard to make sure we do that. I appreciate the gentleman \nfrom Washington. I appreciate the gentleman from Tennessee and \neverybody that is participating tonight. It is important to remember \nthis debate is about jobs, and, in fact, the Export-Import Bank \nguaranteed $2.4 billion worth of exports in Ohio since 2007 and has \nhelped make sure that 15,300 Ohioans had jobs.\n  Thank you for this Special Order. Thank you, everyone, for \nparticipating. I urge my colleagues to support reforming and \nreauthorizing the Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Those are powerful, powerful arguments. I appreciate \nMr. Stivers' contribution here this evening.\n  Next, I would like to turn to one of the stars of our freshman class, \na colleague of mine from New York, Ms. Elise Stefanik.\n  Ms. STEFANIK. First, I want to take a moment to thank Congressman \nNewhouse and my colleague from New York, Congressman Collins, for \nspearheading and organizing this Special Order. I also thank \nCongressman Fincher for all of his work and leadership on H.R. 597.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand today to express my support for the \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank and of H.R. 597, of which I \nam a proud original cosponsor. H.R. 597 would reform and reauthorize \nthis critical institution.\n  For the last 80 years, the Export-Import Bank has helped facilitate \nexports on behalf of thousands of businesses and has created jobs in \nall 50 States. Failing to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank would create a \nstark disadvantage for our country's businesses and cause significant \njob loss. In fact, over 40 other nations have an export credit agency. \nIf America's is not reauthorized, our Nation would be the only country \nin the top 20 economies in terms of GDP not to have one.\n  As I travel throughout my district, I hear from manufacturers who are \ndirectly impacted by the Ex-Im Bank. For example, the Plattco \nCorporation out of Plattsburgh, New York, has been in operation since \n1897 and specializes in valve engineering for a wide variety of \nindustrial applications. Through innovation and expertise, this small \nbusiness has become the industry standard, and their products are sold \nin over 50 countries around the world. Exports represent 40 percent of \nPlattco's sales, and over half of these are financed by the Export-\nImport Bank.\n  In addition to financing the overseas sales, the Ex-Im Bank also \nprovides due diligence by determining which customers are creditworthy \nenough to receive a loan. Plattco and their 70 employees do not have \nthe infrastructure or the resources to do this on their own.\n\n  Another example in my district is New York Air Brake in Watertown, \nwhich has been serving the rail industry since 1890. Among their many \nproducts, New York Air Brake develops train brakes and controls which \nare among the most reliable in the world today. New York Air Brake's \nlargest customers utilize Ex-Im Bank. These customers use Ex-Im to \nfinance their railcar sales and other manufactured products around the \nworld.\n  Failing to reauthorize Ex-Im Bank would lead to purchases from \noverseas instead of U.S. manufacturers here. If this were to occur, the \nloss isn't just felt by the company making the sale, but it is also \nfelt by New York Air Brake and their 575 employees who supply railcar \nassemblers with exceptional products.\n  New York Air Brake is truly vital to our economy and our local \ncommunity, and as leaders in Congress, we must continue to support \nthese types of companies that provide high-paying manufacturing jobs.\n  On behalf of Plattco Corporation, New York Air Brake, their \nemployees, and thousands of other small businesses that create jobs in \nNew York's north country and across the U.S., I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I thank the gentlewoman from New York for underscoring \nthe importance of the Ex-Im Bank to small businesses, small businesses \nthat employ a huge number of people around this country. That is very \nimportant to point out.\n  Next I would like to turn to the good gentleman from the State of \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter), another freshman colleague of mine.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the greatest threat to our \nnational security is our national debt. It is the number one issue \nfacing our country right now and one of the primary reasons I sought to \nserve in this body. I have often said that the only way that we are \never going to balance our budget, the only way that we are ever going \nto retire our national debt is by three things: first of all, we have \ngot to cut spending; secondly, we have got to have entitlement reform; \nand, thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, we have got to grow our way \nout of this. The Ex-Im Bank helps us to do that.\n  As a small-business man, having owned three independent retail \npharmacies for the last 27 years, I understand the value in business of \ncutting costs and increasing revenues. It is important. You have to \nboth cut costs and increase revenues, and you have to grow your \nbusiness.\n  The Ex-Im Bank helps us to increase revenues. It helps us to retire \nour national debt. First of all, the Ex-Im Bank has returned money to \nthe Treasury in the form of revenues it generates from loan interest \nand fees. Last year alone, the Bank generated a surplus of $675 \nmillion.\n  Secondly, and most importantly, the Ex-Im Bank encourages economic \ngrowth by supporting the purchase of American-made goods around the \nworld. These purchases sustain thousands of American companies who rely \non exports and put food on the table of hard-working men and women \nemployed by them.\n  In my district alone, there are 19 companies that in recent years \nhave utilized the Ex-Im Bank to export goods overseas. These companies \nrange from Gulfstream, a leading manufacturer of aircraft, to Strength \nof Nature, a company founded by immigrants who fled the Castro regime \nand started a company that now exports many of their goods to the \nCaribbean and to Africa.\n  The Ex-Im Bank helps businesses, big and small, across America to \ncompete with the competitors abroad by leveling the playing field. With \nover 60\n\n[[Page H5229]]\n\ngovernment export credit agencies currently active around the world, \nincluding every modern industrialized economy, allowing the Bank to \nexpire is tantamount to unilaterally disarming ourselves in the \ncompetition for big contracts around the globe.\n  If a company cannot get financing to buy Gulfstream manufactured in \nSavannah, Georgia, they will go to Canada, which actively promotes \nBombardier, or Brazil, which does the same for its Embraer jets. If \nthey can't get a Caterpillar excavator made in Athens, Georgia, they \nwill go to Japan to buy a Komatsu. If they can't get access to an AGCO \ntractor headquartered in Duluth, Georgia, they will go to India to buy \nMahindra.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, as a small-business owner myself, I know that \nAmerican companies can compete when the playing field is level. In a \nperfect world, we wouldn't need an Ex-Im Bank, but we don't live in a \nperfect world. Instead of leveling the playing field for American \nbusinesses, those who would shutter the Bank are stacking the deck \nagainst them.\n  Mr. Speaker, unilaterally closing the Bank would expose our economy \nto a devastating blow at a time when we can least afford it. It would \nalso further erode our global competitiveness and America's influence \naround the globe.\n  While we stand here debating the future of the Ex-Im Bank, our \ncompetitors are leveraging their own versions of their export-import \nbanks to increase their market shares abroad. Every minute we wait, \nforeign countries and companies are expanding. If we don't fill the \nmarket need, countries like Russia and China will, and with it, the \ninfluence of their regimes is on the rise. They relish in every day \nthat we wait.\n  Like any Federal agency, the Ex-Im Bank can and should be reformed to \nmake it more accountable, more efficient, more transparent. I support \nreforms that would bring interest rates more in line with those found \nin an open private market.\n  I support reforms to ensure the Bank is a true lender of last resort \nfor all companies by implementing measures to ensure the Bank's \ncustomers prove that they have exhausted all their options for \nfinancing by private lenders before seeking assistance from the Bank. \nOne way to do that would be to require three letters of denial as part \nof an application. The Bank should also produce a report explaining why \ncertain businesses receive assistance by the Bank in order to provide \ntaxpayers with more information on exactly what the Bank is doing and \nwhy.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Full transparency of the Bank's actions is the only way to hold it \naccountable, while demonstrating the valuable role the Bank plays in \nmaintaining our competitiveness in global markets.\n  I stand here today ready to work with my colleagues to implement \nthese and other necessary reforms to the Ex-Im Bank, but allowing it to \nexpire is a disservice to the constituents that we serve.\n  The Ex-Im Bank not only supports America's manufacturers and the \nworking American families they employ, it helps to promote America's \nnational interests abroad. Most importantly, it helps address our \nnational debt, both through economic expansion and by returning its \nsurplus to the Treasury each year.\n  I want to thank my colleagues--Dan Newhouse, Stephen Fincher, and \nChris Collins--for helping to host this forum and all those working \nwith us to restore the Ex-Im Bank to its important function.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I appreciate your powerful words and the importance of \nthe Ex-Im Bank to your district, to your State, and to our country.\n  Next, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), \nanother member of the Agriculture Committee on which I serve.\n  I appreciate Mr. Rodney Davis taking the time to come here and with \nhelping us make the points on the importance of this authorization.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend \nfrom Washington for leading this special order. Thank you to all of \nthose who are interested in what I think is doing the right thing, \nreauthorizing and reforming the Ex-Im Bank.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of small businesses, American \nmanufacturing, and good jobs right here at home.\n  The simple reality is that more than 95 percent of the globe's \nconsumers live outside of our borders; therefore, our ability to export \nAmerican products around the world has a direct impact on many small, \nmedium, and large companies and their ability to create and sustain \njobs.\n  Unfortunately, many potential global customers are not able to secure \nthe necessary financing to complete a purchase from an American company \nbecause of the instability of their region or another circumstance.\n  In order to connect these American exporters with their buyers around \nthe globe, the Ex-Im Bank can provide vital loans to complete \ntransactions with American companies that otherwise may not have \noccurred.\n  The economic impacts here at home are significant. Last year, the Ex-\nIm Bank provided financing for $27.5 billion in U.S. exports. That \nsupports more than 160,000 American jobs; most importantly, 90 percent \nof all of these public-private transactions were with America's small \nbusinesses.\n  Some have called for ending the Ex-Im Bank on the grounds that it \ncompetes with the private market. That is simply not the case. While we \ndo need to reform this agency, we still need to make sure that the Ex-\nIm Bank is allowed to level the playing field and fill the gaps that \nexist in the private credit market.\n  Additionally, the Ex-Im Bank brings in a surplus of dollars to the \nU.S. Treasury. Last year alone, it was upwards of $700 million. Over \nthe past two decades, the surplus has been $7 billion. I ask many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle: What are we going to do to fill \nthat hole?\n  Ex-Im supports good-paying jobs in Illinois, not only at great \ncompanies like Caterpillar and John Deere, but also at small- and \nmedium-sized businesses, such as the GSI Group in Assumption, Illinois, \nmy home county's largest employer, and also Litania Sports Group in \nChampaign.\n  Congress has already let the Ex-Im Bank expire, but we cannot afford \nto put more jobs at risk. We must reform and reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank \nnow, and I urge a speedy process to do so.\n  I thank my colleague, once again, for his time, his energy, and his \nfocus on this important issue.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Davis, I am very grateful for you sharing with us \ntoday.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole)\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking my friend from \nWashington and my friend from Tennessee for organizing this \nexceptionally important discussion tonight.\n  I think the case, from a national standpoint, in terms of maintaining \nthe Ex-Im or the Export-Import Bank, is really almost uncontestable. It \nis not a new institution. It has been around well over 80 years. It is \nnot a unique institution.\n  As has been mentioned here on the floor several times, literally \ndozens of other countries have a similar tool in their toolbox to \nfacilitate exports.\n  It has not cost the American taxpayer a dime during the course of its \nexistence. It has actually made billions of dollars back, indeed, since \n2007, $2.8 billion last year alone, a billion dollars extra to the \nUnited States Treasury.\n  What it has done and what every American ought to be interested in is \nit creates thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs for our fellow \nAmericans competing in the international marketplace.\n  Now, I can talk about some big companies that have a presence in my \nState that have been enormously well served by the Ex-Im Bank. Boeing \naircraft, we have almost 3,000 Boeing jobs in Oklahoma. That is \nimportant to us, and we are very proud to have them. Halliburton, \nhistorically founded in California, headquartered now in Texas, but \ntheir largest machinery production facility is in my district in \nDuncan, Oklahoma--1,500 jobs. Those are real Oklahomans going to work.\n  What impresses me the most is the opportunities that the Export-\nImport Bank have created for small companies to get into the \ninternational marketplace. The Export-Import Bank in\n\n[[Page H5230]]\n\nOklahoma in recent years has helped 129 exporting firms; 87 of those, \nover two-thirds, are small businesses, and that has made a difference \nin small communities.\n  The small business is the bedrock of the American economy, and Ex-Im \nhelps them open markets that they would never have had an opportunity \nto participate in, absent that particular mechanism. Don't take my word \nfor it.\n  Here is a story from a third-generation Oklahoma company about how \nthe Export-Import Bank has been able to help them. The Mills Machine \nCompany operating in Shawnee, Oklahoma, just outside my district but in \nthe district next to it, has been in business since 1908--over 100 \nyears. It makes drill bits, augers, and other tools for water \nconstruction in geothermal industries.\n  According to the current president, Chuck Mills, who is actually the \nthird generation in the family to run the company--his grandfather \nstarted it; his father maintained it, and he is now operating it. He \nwas the first one to think about operating overseas.\n  How does a small company in the middle of Oklahoma identify and \nfinance overseas sales? He figured out the Export-Import Bank would be \nthe way to open the door for him to create jobs for his employees in \nShawnee, Oklahoma.\n  Today, the Export-Import Bank provides credit insurance when his \ncompany is selling their products abroad, which is awfully necessary \nbecause some of those individual items, while they sound mundane, cost \nup to $30,000 apiece. That is a lot of risk for a small company.\n\n  Access to the Ex-Im Bank has allowed the Mills Machine Company to \nactually increase their exports overseas by 20 percent. Now, when you \nare a company of 20-30 employees, 20 percent is five or six jobs that \nliterally would not have been there absent the services of this Bank.\n  The Export-Import Bank actually allows our companies to compete in \nthe global marketplace where countries often directly subsidize or own \nthe means of productions.\n  We don't have a free market today in every way. Our competitors have \nthis tool. They use this tool aggressively. We need to have the ability \nto counter them, when necessary, with the Export-Import Bank.\n  I want to encourage my colleagues to support this bill to understand \nhow essential it is to some of--not just the biggest, but some of the \nsmallest exporters in the American economy and how many thousands of \njobs it creates.\n  Remember, it has never cost the taxpayers of the United States of \nAmerica a single dime. It has always put billions of dollars, over \ntime, into our Treasury. Most importantly, there are thousands of \nAmericans working today thanks to what the Export-Import Bank has done \nto facilitate the export of American products into the international \nmarketplace.\n  I want to urge my colleagues to support the reauthorization of this \nimportant institution.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Cole, thank you very much for participating tonight \nand pointing out the importance of the Bank to your State and to your \ndistrict.\n  I yield now to gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica).\n  Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Washington \norganizing this special order in support of Ex-Im.\n  I will tell you one of the worst mistakes that Congress could make is \nnot acting to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank.\n  Unfortunately, few people in Congress have been involved in \ninternational trade. For some 7 years, I was very active in \ninternational trade, got into it by accident in other businesses, but I \nhave led delegations and represented some very big corporations, some \nof the biggest in Florida and the United States and some of the \nsmallest companies trying to compete.\n  I have been in every country in South America except the Guianas. I \nhave been throughout the entire Caribbean, trying to sell U.S. \nproducts. I was in Egypt, the Middle East. I took the first trade \ndelegations into the Eastern bloc countries--Lithuania, I went into \nPoland and Slovakia.\n  I have seen international trade up close. I am telling you, folks, it \nis not a level playing field. It is very rough in the global market.\n  Some of our competitors, the Chinese and the Europeans, were doing \ntrade across borders, well, when the Americas were still in loincloths. \nThese are experienced people. They throw their mother-in-law in to \nclose the deal. It is a very tough market out there. To cut the legs \nout from our folks has consequences when it comes to financing.\n  In business and international trade, if you can finance the deal, you \ncan do the deal. Why would we do this? You just heard the other \ngentleman say that this is one of the least risks of guaranteeing or \nproviding a loan, less than 1 percent. Banks are 10 times that.\n  There is no cost to the taxpayer; we actually make money from this, \nbut what we have out there is competition that is unfair, unlevel.\n  It is possible that we can make some reforms. In fact, we should make \nreforms to get us into some areas where we don't have export-import. I \nwas the only Member from the House, at least from the Transportation \nand Infrastructure Committee, to go to the biggest airshow--I hadn't \nbeen for about 12 years--in Europe recently.\n  Our competitors were applauding at the time that America was going to \nlet Ex-Im go down the tubes because they, again, are experts in being \nable to finance things. In aviation, aviation is one of our biggest \nareas of exports, huge opportunities; and these people are now being \nasked to fight and struggle.\n  We should be expanding. For example, I heard from some of our \nmilitary folks at the airshow that other countries have ex-im for \nmilitary foreign sales and that we are losing part of that market while \nothers are getting into it.\n  If you want to send jobs overseas, if you want to kill American \nmanufacturing, if you want to tie the hands of American companies \noverseas, and if you want to close down some jobs in my district--I \nhave a large power generation headquarters, which also manufactures in \nNorth Carolina.\n  Here is a statement from their company. They will lose a $300 million \ncontract, lots of jobs in my district in North Carolina, to Japanese \ncompetitors. There is just one.\n  Here is Caterpillar, not in my district. They are going to lose a \n$650 million opportunity in a competition to an Asian competitor. How \nmany jobs would that be in Illinois? They are not my district. It is \nfor a project in Australia.\n  We are not financing any foreign operations. We are financing \nAmerican products and supporting American jobs. We absolutely must \nreauthorize this important program.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. One of the great things about this body is having \npeople with so many different kinds of experiences. Mr. Mica, you \npersonally know the importance because of your experience in being in \nother countries, of selling American products abroad, how important \nthis tool is to the American businesses.\n  Mr. MICA. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I yield to the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. MICA. I thank the gentleman.\n  And that is where the markets are, and that is a small area we should \nbe supporting, where we are just minor players right now. We should \nactually be expanding.\n  But I thank you for bringing this to the attention of the Congress \nand the American people. And you are going to hear about agriculture \nand how important that is in all of this, and jobs and opportunities \nfor Americans.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I thank the gentleman.\n  And that is a great segue into who I would like to share some of this \ntime with next. I yield to the gentleman, also from Oklahoma (Mr. \nLucas), the former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.\n  Mr. LUCAS. Congressman Newhouse, I am very appreciative of you \norganizing this Special Order to discuss an issue that perhaps not many \nof our neighbors back home have had time to focus on and to have \nspeakers from a variety of perspectives discuss what it really means in \njob creation, economic growth, opportunities in their home districts \nand their communities, the Export-Import Bank.\n\n[[Page H5231]]\n\n  I would be remiss if I didn't note to our colleagues, you and I are \nboth farmers, and one of the common threads in agriculture throughout \nthis great country is, since colonial times, we have always produced \nmore than we could consume in this country. We have always had to sell \nour surplus in the world markets. That is the only way that we could \nmaintain a healthy production agriculture, to have reasonable job \nopportunities, a reasonable standard of living in our agricultural \ncommunities.\n  Export-Import touches on many of those issues, created in the 1930s \nas a tool to help all parts of the American economy have the credit and \nthe ability to sell in the world markets.\n  As a matter of fact, the concept is so practical, it has been so \nwell-defined, as you and I both know, 50-plus other countries have the \nsame type of a system to help their manufacturers, their producers, \ntheir economic interests do business into the outside world.\n  Now, that said, we have been engaged for some time on the Financial \nServices Committee and in this body in a very, at times, heated debate \nabout whether not just should Export-Import Bank be reformed to make it \nmore efficient, make it more accountable, more responsible to the \ntaxpayers, but whether it should even exist at all.\n  Now, some of our colleagues believe that, with a lack of action, the \nofficial expiration of the authorization, it is gone. We have heard our \nfriends say here today that until all of the loans that are \noutstanding, all of the guarantees, all of the obligations that have \nbeen committed to are completed, the institution will continue to \nexist. It simply cannot provide new economic opportunities to do \nbusiness around the world for our people.\n  And that brings us to this point, and I think it is the point that I \nwant to stress. Can Export-Import Bank, in its present form, be \nreformed? Can it be made better? Can it be made more accountable?\n  Of course. There is not an institution in government anywhere that \ncan't be made better, more efficient, more effective, more accountable \nto the taxpayers.\n  But the real tragedy of what is going on here is we have been \npresented, many of us, with the stark debate of end it all or, through \ncircumstances beyond our control, have it reauthorized, most likely in \nits present form, without any of those reforms. That is why many of us \nare on the Fincher bill, because we believe Export-Import serves a \npurpose in helping create better jobs, more economic opportunities for \nmany of our citizens, but that it needs to be done in a more \nresponsible, accountable fashion.\n  I have been highly disappointed that we have not had a debate, a \nmarkup in committee on this very issue that would have ultimately led, \nI believe, to a debate and consideration on the floor of this United \nStates House so that we could potentially have sent a better product \nthan we have now to the other body. We have not been allowed to do \nthat.\n  So now we are faced with a stark contrast. How do we continue this \nvery effective effort at moving our products into the world markets, \ncreating those jobs here at home for our fellow citizens?\n  Either we have to wait for a bill to come from the other body, most \nlikely not containing the level of reforms that we would have placed in \nsuch a reauthorization bill in the House, or, at some point, we will \nhave a markup, either in committee or on the floor, of another piece of \nlegislation where there will be an effort to attach it. That kind of an \neffort probably won't contain the level of Fincher reforms that we all \nwant.\n  That is the tragedy, Congressman. We are going to reauthorize Export-\nImport. It is just, in what form will it be reauthorized?\n  We cannot allow 50-plus of our competitors around the world to have a \ntool, a resource, an ability for their businesses to push their \nproducts into the American economy that we don't match punch for punch \neconomically. We cannot allow that to happen.\n  I hope we are going to work on behalf of our fellow workers, our \nfellow citizens, our fellow businesspeople in this country. But it is a \ntragedy, Congressman, that we are not going to have the kind of \ndiscussion and debate where we could create a dramatically improved, \nrefined, or reformed Export-Import Bank.\n  We each represent our constituents. I care about mine just as you \ncare about every one of yours, and making sure that we have the \nability--the ability--for all those citizens to have good jobs, good-\npaying jobs, good, new economic opportunities, is just too important \nfor us to back away--too important for us to back away.\n\n  If we don't get the reforms that our fellow citizens deserve, it \nwon't be because you and I didn't try. We have tried for months. It \nwill be because the choices thrust upon us by others are either all or \nnothing at all, present or nothing.\n  I want to keep selling those products that our hard-working fellow \ncitizens make into the world market. I want to keep competing \neconomically, blow for blow, with the rest of the world.\n  You know, some have said: Let's just do away with Export-Import. We \nwill establish the principle, and the rest of the world will follow us.\n  Does anybody really believe that, that when we give up our ability to \nsell our products into other markets they will suddenly say: Oh, what a \ngreat principle. We will stop selling into your markets.\n  That is not the way it works, Dan, not the way it works.\n  I appreciate the gentleman's time, his effort on this critically \nimportant issue. Something will happen; it is just how soon and in what \nform.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5231-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5231-H5234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          IRAN'S NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Zeldin). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, there is a great deal of tragedy going on \nin the world. I know that at times there are people around this \nCongress that have felt very much alone.\n  I know there have been times when Presidents have felt very much \nalone, like Abraham Lincoln, a year or so after his son had died. His \nwife was fussing at him. He was going to commemorate a battlefield. \nThere have been people who have been very alone in this town. But, Mr. \nSpeaker, I would suggest that no one in the world feels more betrayed \nand dejected than the leader of our former friend, Israel.\n  Now, Israel is still the friend of many of ours. We still hold it in \nthe highest regard because of its similarity in belief and human rights \nthat we have here, even there in the midst of the Middle East.\n  The President has announced that he is going to the United Nations to \nget their approval before he would even ask for a vote in Congress. \nThat struck a chord. That rang a bell.\n  March of 2011, a letter from the White House in which the President \nadvises that, he says:\n\n       At my direction, U.S. military forces commenced operations \n     to assist an international effort authorized by the United \n     Nation's Security Council and undertaken with the support of \n     European allies and Arab partners to prevent a humanitarian \n     catastrophe and address the threat posed to international \n     peace and security by the crisis in Libya.\n\n  The trouble is, Mr. Speaker, that our President created the \ncatastrophe, created the crisis, the real crisis in Libya, as it exists \ntoday, far worse than anything that anybody conceived would or could \nexist in 2011 before the President went to the U.N. to seek authority \ninstead of coming to Congress.\n  Since 2003, Qadhafi had given up all efforts at supporting terrorism. \nHe had given up efforts, all efforts, at pursuing weapons that the \nUnited States did not give him authority to keep.\n  As some of our Muslim Arab leaders in the Middle East have told some \nof us privately, since 2003, Qadhafi was doing more to help you tamp \nout terrorism than most anybody in the world, and yet this President \ndecided that a small problem in Libya was enough to justify him taking \nout Qadhafi.\n  Oh, I know, we were going to create a no-fly zone, but let's be \nserious. The President's bombing runs that he authorized ended up, even \nin the face of Qadhafi asking to be allowed to just leave, and leave \nthe country peaceably, he asked for a response within 3 days, and this \nPresident authorized bombing, apparently, as an answer.\n\n[[Page H5232]]\n\n  So make no mistake, the incredibly bad judgment in this White House \ncreated a debacle in northern Africa that has spilled into other \nnations around Libya, that has created all kinds of human atrocities, \nthat has created a massive movement of people heading for boats from \nLibya, heading north to anywhere they can go.\n  This President did that without authorization of Congress. He caused \nthat without authorization of Congress. But he did have the consent of \nthe United Nations, as he now says he is going to seek before he gets \napproval for his Iranian deal in Congress.\n  March 21 of 2011, an article by Charlie Savage in The New York Times, \npoints out: ``Some Democratic lawmakers--including Representatives \nJerrold Nadler of New York, Barbara Lee of California and Michael E. \nCapuano of Massachusetts--complained in the House Democratic Caucus \nconference call as the bombing began that Mr. Obama had exceeded his \nconstitutional authority by authorizing the attack without \nCongressional permission.''\n  I would have to say that my friend, Mr. Nadler, Ms. Lee, Mr. Capuano \nof Massachusetts, they were right. I haven't said that a whole lot \nabout my friend, Mr. Nadler, but he was right.\n  The article goes on: ``On Monday, Mr. Obama sent Congress a two-page \nletter saying that as commander in chief, he had constitutional \nauthority to authorize the strikes, which were undertaken with French, \nBritish and other allies.''\n  The article points out: ``As a presidential candidate who promoted \nhis background as an instructor of constitutional law, Mr. Obama \nappeared to adopt a more limited view of executive power when he \nanswered a question about whether a president could order the bombing \nof Iranian nuclear sites without a use-of-force authorization from \nCongress.''\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Then it quotes Mr. Obama. It says:\n  ``The President does not have power under the Constitution to \nunilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not \ninvolve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation,'' Mr. \nObama told The Boston Globe in December of 2007.\n  It mentions further down that, in the Globe survey, Vice President \nJoseph R. Biden, Jr., then a Senator, argued that a President would \nhave no authority under the Constitution to bomb Iranian nuclear sites \nwithout congressional authorization because even limited strikes can \nunintentionally prompt all-out war.\n  Well, they have violated what Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden said before \nthey were in the White House and the Vice President's quarters. They \ncreated a disaster in northern Africa because they believed that their \nopinion was adequate and that the massive number of countries in the \nUnited Nations that hate Israel were better confidants than Congress. \nRegardless of whether that is true or not, it is not constitutional.\n  In March of 2011, there was a national review article by Bill Burk \nwhich points out: ``President Obama's war in Libya is unconstitutional \nwithout congressional authorization. But that is so only because the \nPresident has not yet given us a reason to fight that is \nconstitutionally sound.'' And it goes on.\n  So the President helped create this massive disaster in northern \nAfrica that has human tragedy occurring day after day, people fleeing \nin boats, some dying trying to get away from the Libya that he created \nbecause he decided it was time for Qadhafi to go.\n  Some of our Muslim leader friends in north Africa and the Middle East \ncontinue to ask: ``Does your President not understand that he keeps \nhelping the people that are at war with the United States? Does your \nPresident not understand that he is harming the people that are helping \nstop terrorism in the world?''\n  This deal that has now been cut with Iran, the largest supporter of \nterrorism in the world, is going to do for the Middle East and the \nworld what President Obama's bombing did for Libya.\n  It has to be stopped. This deal has to be stopped. It does not meet \nany of the requirements that the President and all his minions said \nwere going to come out of a deal with Iran.\n  And, oh, yes, there were celebrations here in Washington because they \nwere able to convince Iran into taking back over $100 billion. And, \nalso, we were able to convince them to allow us to take them off the \narms embargo so they could go ahead and start buying weapons from \nRussia, from China, wherever they wish.\n  Let's help the Russian economy. Let's help the Chinese economy. Let's \ngive hundreds of billions of dollars to the largest supporter of \nterrorism in the world and allow them to pursue arms with that money.\n  Isn't there enough terrorism in the world today without this \nadministration being accomplices to death and destruction the world \nover through the assistance, through this so-called deal that it has \ncut with Iran?\n  An article from certainly not a great press friend of the United \nStates, but AFP--the Agence France-Presse has an article from Tehran \nwhich says, ``Hard-Liners in Tehran, brought up on chants of `death to \nAmerica,' have repeatedly voiced opposition to the quest for a deal \nwith a power derided as the `great Satan' ever since the Islamic \nrevolution of 1979.\n  The article goes on further: ``Rather than representing submission to \nthe West, the agreement is likely to consolidate Khamenei's rule, \naccording to Davoud Hermidas Bavand, a veteran political analyst at \nTehran University.''\n  And make no mistake, this is Tehran that is in Iran, from a veteran \npolitical analyst that serves at the pleasure--or keeps his life at the \npleasure of Khomeini.\n  The article says, ``And whatever the evident contradictions of a pact \nwith `the great Satan,' the core of Iran's nuclear program has been \npreserved.''\n  Thank you, President Barack Hussein Obama.\n  Yes, I know there are people celebrating in Washington. Yes, we got a \ngreat deal. We got them to take $100 billion off our hands. We got them \nto agree to start being able for they themselves to buy arms.\n  We got them off the terrorist watch list so they can move more freely \nas they want to create terrorism. It is a great day. Oh, it is time to \ncelebrate.\n  This article, in what may be one of the most understated comments \nabout the deal, says, ``It probably amounts to a marginal win over \nIsrael, Saudi Arabia, and even Turkey.'' And that is from Mr. Bavand, \ndescribing the nuclear deal as a step forward for a war-wracked Middle \nEast.\n  An article from Max Boot in commentarymagazine.com points out that, \nfor a more succinct account, go right to the statement issued by \nTehran's official Islamic news agency. And this comes from that.\n  ``World powers have recognized Iran's peaceful nuclear program and \nare to respect the nuclear rights of Iranian nation within \ninternational conventions.''\n  The second says--and this is from Iran--``The Islamic Republic of \nIran is to be recognized as a nuclear technology power authorized to \nhave peaceful nuclear programs, such as complete nuclear fuel cycle and \nenrichment to be identified by the United Nations.''\n  ``All unfair sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council, including \neconomic and financial sanctions on Iran, are to be lifted, as per the \nagreement and through issuance of a new resolution by the United \nNations Security Council,'' most all of which hate Israel.\n  ``All nuclear installations and sites are to continue their work, \ncontrary to the early demands of the other party''--that would be the \nUnited States--``None of them will be dismantled.''\n  That is Iran's interpretation of the deal being celebrated down the \nstreet here, down Pennsylvania Avenue. They are celebrating because \nthey say none of their nuclear facilities have to be dismantled.\n  It goes on: ``The policy on preventing enrichment uranium is now \nfailed, and Iran will go ahead with its enrichment program.''\n  Further from Iran, they declare that ``Iran's nuclear infrastructure \nwill remain intact; no centrifuges will be dismantled; and research and \ndevelopment on key and advanced centrifuges . . .'' ``will continue.''\n  And that is rather amazing. We heard the President say that they were \ngoing to have to dismantle like two-thirds of their centrifuges.\n  But it appears, from what we can find out about the deal so far, \nthat, actually, they may dismantle some of the\n\n[[Page H5233]]\n\ncentrifuges, but only because we are going to help them install and \nwork with the most advanced centrifuges in the world, more advanced \nthan anything Iran would have now. So far as we know, this is a huge \nboom to their nuclear efforts.\n  This article says, ``The agreement specifies that it would take no \nfewer than 24 days to compel an inspection.'' It is talking about the \nnuclear sites. ``That's plenty of time for the Iranians to `sanitize' \nany suspect site so as to remove any evidence of nuclear activity; and \nit's far removed from the kind of `24/7 access' that President Obama \nsaid just today that inspectors would have.''\n  ``The Iranians had insisted that the agreement stick only to the \nnuclear issue--that's why, for example, the Iranians did not agree, as \npart of this deal, to release the American hostages they are holding or \nto end their support for terrorism or their commitment to Israel's \ndestruction. But it turns out the agreement isn't just limited to \nnuclear issues. It includes a commitment to lift the conventional arms \nembargo on Iran in no more than 5 years and the embargo on missile \nsales to Iran in no more than 8 years and possibly sooner, if Iran is \nsaid to be in compliance with the nuclear accord.''\n\n  And, gee, won't that be interesting. They may be able to have people \nthat hate Israel give them the go-ahead much earlier than 8 years.\n  This article points out, ``What this means is that Iran will soon \nhave more than $100 billion extra to spend not only on exporting the \nIranian revolution and dominating neighboring states, but that it will \nalso, before long, be free to purchase as many weapons--even ballistic \nmissiles--as it likes on the world market. No wonder Vladimir Putin \nappears to be happy: This deal is likely to become a windfall for \nRussian arms makers, although you can be sure that Iran will also \nspread its largesse to manufacturers in France and, if possible, the \nU.K. so as to give those countries an extra stake in not re-imposing \nsanctions.''\n  And that is good news for Ukraine, good news for Georgia, because \nthis means that this deal, if it goes through--and the President is \nalready saying, ``We are going to lift these sanctions. We are going to \nget them the $100 billion plus.'' Some say it is going to be $150 \nbillion.\n  Can you imagine what Russia can do with money that Iran pays it? Why, \nthey could probably take over all of Ukraine with that kind of money.\n  And then the Russians, as they take over more and more of Ukraine, \ncan be putting big posters on their tanks saying ``Thank you, President \nObama. Without your deal with Iran, we would never have had the money \nto take over Ukraine.''\n  And what about Egypt? This is devastating news that this deal is \ncoming to fruition for Egypt. When over 30 million Egyptians come to \nthe street--it would be like over 100 million Americans going to the \nstreets and demanding the ouster of the Muslim Brother president that \nwas seizing all power and demanding that he be gotten rid of. The \nmilitary did as the people of Egypt ordered. What an incredible \npeaceful uprising.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  That was impeachment as peaceably as it could be done since the \nAmericans assisting Egypt did not even help them put in an impeachment \nprovision in their constitution.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is bad news obviously for Saudi Arabia. It is bad \nnews for Jordan. It is bad news for all countries in the Middle East. \nIt is bad news for Syria. It is bad news for Turkey.\n  Oh, there will be some in Turkey and some in Syria that will be just \nshouting with joy, particularly President Assad. He may need to send \nPresident Obama a thank you note for the money that comes flowing in to \nhelp him in Syria perhaps; but there is going to be money spread all \naround to weapons makers and to people who peddle war and destruction \nbecause of what this President has done and agreed to without any \npromise--not even a promise--of giving up terrorism--not even a \npromise, not even a verbal promise, for Heaven's sake, that Iran will \nnot try to destroy Israel.\n  We have this article from AFP also back in March 2 of 2015, this \nyear. The article says: ``Obama told Reuters if `Iran is willing to \nagree to double-digit years of keeping their program where it is,' '' \nthere will be a deal.\n  Well, that is not what President Obama agreed to. This article goes \non--and, again, this is March--``Netanyahu on Monday told a pro-Israel \nconference that a deal with Iran would `threaten the survival of \nIsrael.'\n  ``Obama said that sentiment is wrongheaded, noting Netanyahu's \nprevious opposition to an interim Iran deal as evidence Israel should \nback the talks.\n  `` `Netanyahu made all sorts of claims. This was going to be a \nterrible deal. This was going to result in Iran getting $50 billion \nworth of relief. Iran would not abide by the agreement. None of that \nhas come true.' ''\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, it turns out the President was the one who was \nwrong, and Prime Minister Netanyahu is the one that was exactly right \nthat it was a bad deal, that this was a terrible deal. He was right.\n  Now, I have to admit, Mr. Speaker, that Prime Minister Netanyahu was \nextremely wrong about one aspect of the Iranian deal between it and \nPresident Obama; I have to admit.\n  I think the world of Prime Minister Netanyahu; he is a great man, and \nhe has the potential of being one of Israel's truly great leaders, but \nhe was wrong when he said that this deal was going to result in Iran \ngetting $50 billion worth of relief.\n  He was way wrong because they are going to get maybe $150 billion of \nrelief, but certainly over $100 billion of relief. We have to chalk it \nup as the one area that President Obama was right about Netanyahu being \nwrong.\n  Netanyahu understated the amount of cash this administration was \nwilling to fork over to the terrorist state of Iran. It wasn't $50 \nbillion; it was over $100 billion, possibly $150 billion. There it is \non the record; Netanyahu was wrong. He said $50 billion is what Iran \nwould get, and it was over $100 billion.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's look at this deal and what has been said in the \npast about it. Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman--Mr. Speaker, you \nwill remember that she is the one who was key in the negotiations with \nNorth Korea where we gave them nuclear power plants and material and \nall we got in return was a promise that, if we just gave them \neverything they needed, all the technology to make nuclear bombs, they \nwould use it for nuclear power plants. Of course, we know they broke \ntheir word.\n  When you are dealing with a scorpion and it stings you, you shouldn't \nask later: Why did you do that? You know why. The answer in the old \nfable is: It is because I am a scorpion; it is what I do. That is what \nthe leader of North Korea is, and it is what he did.\n  If you look at the leaders of Iran, there is a similar fable about \nthe snake. Someone warms the snake up, and it ends up biting him. Why \ndid you do that? It is because I am a snake. Perhaps in the near \nfuture, President Obama and Secretary Kerry will be heard to ask: Why \ndid you break all these terms?\n  The answer should be: It is because we are snakes; that is what we \ndo.\n  Mr. Speaker, Wendy Sherman said, on February 4 of 2014, nearly a year \nand a half ago, about the Iranian deal:\n\n       We raised possible military dimensions. In fact, in the \n     Joint Plan of Action, we have required that Iran come clean \n     on its past actions as part of any comprehensive agreement.\n\n  Well, that didn't happen. Wendy Sherman was as wrong about that as \nshe was about North Korea not using the nuclear capacity we gave them \nto make nuclear weapons.\n  Of course, December 7, 2013, President Obama himself said: ``It is my \nstrong belief that we can envision an end state that gives us an \nassurance that even if they have some modest enrichment capability, it \nis so constrained and the inspections so intrusive that they, as a \npractical matter, do not have breakout capacity.''\n  Now, that is a great statement there because he is not saying that we \nwill get Iran to that point. If you look carefully, he says that we \nwill have ``an end state that gives us an assurance.''\n  Well, Iran is willing to give us assurance, but they are not even \nwilling to give us an assurance of what President Obama hoped for, for \ngoodness' sake.\n  Secretary Kerry said, on November 24, 2013: ``There is no right to \nenrich.\n\n[[Page H5234]]\n\nWe do not recognize a right to enrich. It is clear,'' in the NPT, ``in \nthe nonproliferation treaty, it's very, very clear that there is no \nright to enrich.''\n  Well, now, we know that Secretary Kerry was very, very wrong about it \nbeing very, very clear there was no right to enrich; not only is there \na right to enrich, we are going to help Iran enrich. Thank you, \nPresident Obama.\n  Sanctions relief, here is a quote from John Kerry from March 3. \nSecretary of State Kerry said: ``Iran is not open for business until \nIran is closed for nuclear bombs.''\n  Well, we know that is not going to be the case. They are open for \nbusiness, and they are still enriching.\n  Again, Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said: ``This includes a \nlot of dismantling of their infrastructure.''\n  Well, it turns out that is not the case, either.\n  Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, February 4 of 2014, said: \n``It is true that in these first six months we've not shut down all of \ntheir production of any ballistic missile.''\n  Well, it turns out they are not going to at all--how about that.\n  March 5, 2015, Secretary Kerry: ``It will reduce the pressure for a \nregional nuclear arms race, and it will increase the strength of the \ninternational nonproliferation regime. It will also vastly improve the \nprospects for peace both here and elsewhere.''\n  Secretary Kerry was wrong, wrong, wrong.\n  Now, they want the U.N. to pass the deal. Well, gosh, I am sure they \nwill get plenty of votes from people that want the money that the U.S. \nis going to make sure Iran has to buy nuclear weapons.\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu says that the Iran deal is a grave mistake, \nand he is as right now as he was before. This deal has to be stopped \nfor the sake of mankind.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/house-section/article/H5234-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY MATERIAL\n\n\nREVISIONS TO THE AGGREGATES AND ALLOCATIONS OF THE FISCAL YEAR 2015 AND \n                        2016 BUDGET RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 2015.\n       Mr. Speaker: I hereby submit for printing in the \n     Congressional Record revisions to the applicable budget \n     allocations and aggregates pursuant to section 3(e)(1)(B) of \n     H.
