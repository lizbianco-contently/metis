Mr. Speaker, a government for, by, and of the people \ncannot hold its most basic deliberations in secret. I am not talking \nabout matters of national security, but basic, everyday government \ndeliberations.\n  Yet the Department of the Interior, the State of California, and the \nState of Oregon are meeting with select groups in private in places \nlike Portland, Sacramento, and even proposed San Francisco, to make \npublic policy decisions affecting my district in the north end of \nCalifornia and south Oregon without public or legislative input. In \norder to be invited to join these meetings, individuals are required to \nsign confidentiality agreements and agree to a predetermined outcome.\n  The issues involving the Klamath River water and possible removal of \nthe hydroelectric dams are indeed of concern to the public. The \ndecisions regarding whether these dams should be removed and what water \nand environmental policy should govern the region are fundamentally a \npublic policy decision. The deliberations should be made in public and \nfree for all to be involved, yet long-distance locations an hour or a \nfull day's drive away don't make that possible, especially when they \nare held in secret.\n  These secret meetings have been happening for years, and they are \nwrong. The agencies of the government are meeting in secret to create a \n501(c)(3) dam removal entity called the Klamath River Renewal \nCorporation. This new corporation will be the recipient of taxpayer and \nutility rate dollars.\n  These meetings need to be held in public where the people can meet \nand hear what they are planning to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/house-section/article/H1119-7", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1119-H1120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TRUTH IN LABELING\n\n  (Mr. WELCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, this is pure Vermont maple syrup made at a \nfamily farm, Maverick Farm, by friends and neighbors Arthur and Anne \nBerndt. People love it. Sugar makers from Maine to Michigan, it is a \nlabor of love and real additional income in small farm economies.\n  Big companies have figured that out. They know that consumers love \nmaple syrup. But instead of buying maple syrup from those farmers, they \nprovide fake labels to mislead consumers.\n\n[[Page H1120]]\n\nThese are some of the biggest companies in the world.\n  Take a look at some of these companies and the products that they \nclaim have maple in them. Quaker, Kellogg's, Hood, Bakery on Main. They \nsay they have maple, but there is not a trace of maple in it. The \ningredients include rice syrup, artificial flavor, caramel color, \ngelatin, molasses. That is not maple syrup.\n  We who represent farmers producing maple syrup are writing the FDA \ntelling them to have truth in labeling. Let's have real syrup, not fake \nlabels.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/house-section/article/H1120-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    VERA HOUSE WHITE RIBBON CAMPAIGN\n\n  (Mr. KATKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about an important \nissue that faces our society: domestic violence and sexual abuse. \nViolence against women is a worldwide but underexamined problem. Sadly, \nwe are still far from a world where women are free from the threat of \nharassment, battering, and sexual assault.\n  Consider some of these statistics: according to the FBI, a woman is \nbattered every 15 seconds; 2 to 4 million American women are abused \neach year; up to 50 percent of homeless women and children in this \ncountry are fleeing domestic violence.\n  Our country has a moral obligation to stand up against those who \nexploit their power to commit violence against women and children.\n  In an effort to raise awareness and put an end to domestic violence \nand sexual abuse, the Vera House in Syracuse will be kicking off the \nWhite Ribbon Campaign. This campaign is one of the largest efforts in \nthe world to prevent and end domestic violence and sexual assault. The \ncampaign will begin Friday, March 4, and run through March 31.\n  During this month, thousands of my constituents in central New York \nwill be wearing a white ribbon or white wristband to raise awareness \nabout domestic violence and sexual abuse. Wearing the white ribbon \ndemonstrates a personal pledge to never commit, condone, or remain \nsilent about violence against women or children.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/house-section/article/H1120-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRATULATING RIVERSIDE CITY COLLEGE ON THEIR CENTENNIAL\n\n  (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. TAKANO.

Since 1916, RCC has provided \nthousands of students with an engaging and affordable educational \nexperience that prepares them for successful careers.\n  The college boasts of many great alumni who have gone on to lead \nremarkable lives, but the one I admire most is my father. He attended \nRCC to build up credits for a degree in business administration, and \nwith that degree he was able to earn a good-paying job that secured my \nfamily's place in the middle class.\n  I was honored to serve on RCC's board of trustees for 22 years, and I \ntake pride in what the school continues to do for thousands of students \nevery year.\n  Congratulations to Riverside City College on your centennial.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of \nthe 10th anniversary of the Pennsylvania State Floor Hockey Tournament \nat Bald Eagle High School, located in Pennsylvania's Fifth \nCongressional District. This Special Olympics tournament is scheduled \nfor this Saturday and Sunday.\n  Each year more than 300 Special Olympians and more than 100 coaches \nfrom across Pennsylvania compete in this event, which includes teams \nfrom a large number of the Commonwealth's counties.\n  I congratulate the athletes participating in this week's tournament \nin advance for their hard work and perseverance, rising above the \nchallenges to excel in athletics. I look forward to seeing them in \nperson at Bald Eagle High School this weekend.\n  I also commend Special Olympics of Pennsylvania for its work in \nplanning this annual event.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Thompson family has a special connection to these \ngames. My younger son, Kale, who is now a music teacher, was the first \nstudent director when the floor hockey tournament moved to the Bald \nEagle Area site.\n  Along with the annual floor hockey tournament, Special Olympics holds \nits summer games each year at Penn State University in State College. \nThis is a great organization which helps so many people across \nPennsylvania and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/house-section/article/H1120-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF ISABELLA GREENWAY\n\n  (Mr. GALLEGO asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as part of Women's History \nMonth to recognize and celebrate the life of Isabella Greenway, the \nfirst female Member of Congress from Arizona.\n  Congresswoman Greenway was a trailblazer, social activist, and \ndedicated public servant. She worked tirelessly to serve the people of \nArizona and the Nation through the Great Depression and many years \nafter.\n  Congresswoman Greenway was particularly committed to ensuring that \nthose who served the Nation in World War I were taken care of after \nthey returned home. Following the war, she opened Arizona Hut, a \nfurniture manufacturer focused on employing disabled veterans and their \nfamilies.\n  During her time in Congress, she was known for her willingness to \nfight for the rights of veterans, including acting as a vocal defender \nof veterans' pensions and introducing legislation to expand the VA in \nArizona.\n  Congresswoman Greenway was an inspiration for women in our State and \nthroughout our country. She refused to be limited or defined by her \ngender, instead devoting her life to serving and protecting the most \nvulnerable members of our society.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with me in honoring the lasting legacy \nof Isabella Greenway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/house-section/article/H1120-5", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1120-H1121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TEXAS LAWMAN--OFFICER DAVID HOFER\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, he was a son, a brother, and a soon-\nto-be groom. David Hofer's life was ripped from this world on March 1, \n2 days ago, leaving behind his family and his fiancee.\n  Officer Hofer was 29. He was from Fort Worth, Texas. He was shot and \ncoldly murdered after a gunfire exchange with an outlaw in a nearby \npark. The criminal who gunned him down was a 22-year-old drug addict \nwho had been released from prison that very day.\n  Officer Hofer served with the Euless, Texas, Police Department. He \nhad been serving there for 2 years. He had previously served with the \nNYPD for 5 years. He dedicated his life to protecting the rest of us.\n  Mr. Speaker, hundreds of blue lights from patrol cars lit the way as \nOfficer Hofer's body was transported from the hospital.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the 16th police officer killed this year.

Mr. Speaker, I want to give a little history about the \nefforts of the Democratic Party to secure our Southern border.\n  We had an immigration bill last session. In that bill that passed the \nSenate with bipartisan support--not only every Democrat, but also many \nRepublicans, like John McCain and Marco Rubio--we had $40 billion to \nsecure our Southern border. Talk about a secure wall--security, making \nsure that illegal products and illegal people do not cross across that \nborder--we had that.\n  Thanks to the Republicans' failure to take action in this body, the \nHouse of Representatives, and simply pass the Senate bill, there is \nstill no security on the Southern border. There are people, illegal \ndrugs, and illegal products sneaking across every day because this body \nhasn't acted.\n  Now, it is pie in the sky to think that some other country is going \nto pay for a wall to protect America. It isn't going to happen.\n  What we did is we actually had fines for people who were here \nillegally. So people who are here illegally were actually the very ones \nwho contributed money back into our coffers to help secure our Southern \nborder, not to mention the additional economic benefit and taxes that \nthey would pay going forward.\n  It is time to act on immigration and secure our border.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/house-section/article/H1121-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  0915\n                      TRIBUTE TO COACH JIM BELDEN\n\n  (Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a beloved \nmember of the Hamilton County, Indiana, community, Jim Belden.\n  Jim was a dedicated public servant and a devoted husband, father, and \ngrandfather. Sadly, he passed away after a battle with cancer. He will \nbe dearly missed by the Hoosier community, but what a legacy he left.\n  Jim left his mark as a family man, a teacher, a U.S. Navy veteran, \nand a 23-year member of the Hamilton County Council, but he is best \nknown for being one of the best football coaches in Indiana, an Indiana \nFootball Hall of Fame coach. I am the daughter of a high school \nfootball coach as well.\n  For more than 30 years, Jim coached and mentored young men in \nWestfield, Noblesville, and Carmel High Schools. He led Carmel High \nSchool to four State championship titles and is the 12th winningest \ncoach in Indiana State history.\n  I attended his memorial service just last weekend. There were \nhundreds of players there. I heard from those whose lives had been \ntouched. There were those he coached who were now not quite so young, \nbecause he coached in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and the 2000s.\n  I also heard from the students he taught, the assistant coaches, the \nfaculty he worked with, the community he served, and, most importantly, \nhis family, who loved him so dearly.\n  I offer my deepest condolences to his family, especially his wife \nBev. They had just celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. We all \nmourn his loss and cherish his memory.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Alabama?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 635 provides for \nconsideration of H.R. 4557, the Blocking Regulatory Interference from \nClosing Kilns Act of 2016. The resolution provides for a closed rule. \nNo amendments are made in order, as none were filed with the Rules \nCommittee. Additionally, the rule also provides for standard \nadjournment authority.\n  H.R. 4557 is an important piece of legislation. It is a bipartisan \nbill that addresses an unfortunate recurring theme: overreach by the \nEPA that takes jobs away from hardworking Americans.\n  Last September the EPA finalized the National Emission Standards for \nHazardous Air Pollutants for Brick and Structural Clay Products and \nClay Ceramics, commonly known as Brick MACT. Only in the Federal \nGovernment would we string that many words together and think it makes \nsense.\n  In that rule, the EPA set stringent standards for brick industry \nemissions of mercury and nonmercury pollutants as well as health-based \nstandards for acid gases.\n  EPA previously promulgated Brick MACT standards in 2003. That rule \nwas vacated by a Federal court in 2007, but, by that time, many brick \nmanufacturers had already spent millions of dollars in irreversible \ncompliance costs.\n  Now, let's be clear. Those aren't just costs that are borne by those \nbusinesses. Those get passed along to the American consumers, raising \nthe price of brick to each and every one of us.\n  The brick industry faces again the uncertainty of having to spend \nmillions of dollars to comply with revised Brick MACT while the fate of \nthe rule makes its way through the court system.\n  Mr. Speaker, the brick industry employs thousands of Americans at \nmore than 70 brick plant and supporting facilities nationwide. These \nfacilities are located in 38 States. Alabama, my home State, is one of \nthe top five States for brick manufacturing capacity and faces some of \nthe largest job losses.\n  Unlike other industries targeted by EPA's overreach, the brick \nindustry is dominated by small, family-owned businesses that have been \nstruggling in our current economy.\n  EPA estimates industry-wide annual compliance in Brick MACT will cost\n\n[[Page H1122]]\n\n$25 million annually. The industry estimates that the costs may be as \nmuch as $100 million per year. For a facility with two kilns, which is \nthe industry average, costs are estimated to be $4.4 million.\n  Remember, those costs get passed along to us consumers in the cost of \nbricks. These costs will likely cause many of these small facilities to \nshut their doors and are, of course, over and above the millions of \ndollars already spent by the industry to comply with the earlier rule \nthat was vacated by the D.C. Circuit.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4557 ensures that the brick industry will not again \nhave to make millions of dollars in expenditures before Brick MACT \nworks its way through the courts.\n  H.R. 4557 would implement a legislative stay to Brick MACT and block \nthe rule until all related court challenges have been resolved by the \nFederal courts.\n  Opponents of this bill argue that a legislative stay is unnecessary \nbecause the brick industry can request a judicial stay in Federal \ncourt; however, as an attorney, I can tell you that the standard to \nreceive such a stay is incredibly high and such stays are rarely \ngranted.\n  The recent case of Michigan v. EPA provides a great example of why \nthis legislation is necessary. In that case, the Supreme Court found \nthe EPA's Utility MACT rule to be legally flawed and remanded the case; \nhowever, by that time, utility companies had already been forced to \nspend billions of dollars to comply with Utility MACT. Remember, that \ngets passed along to the consumers in our utility bills.\n  EPA Acting Administrator Janet McCabe stated that, although EPA lost, \nthe Supreme Court's decision was of limited practical effect because \nthe majority of power plants were already in compliance or well on \ntheir way to compliance. Thus, the EPA was, in practicality, able to \nevade any meaningful judicial review, which makes a mockery of this \nprocess.\n  The EPA should not get to do the same again to the brick industry \nwhile Brick MACT makes its way through the court system. Thousands of \nAmerican jobs should not be put at risk due to a rule which has already \nbeen vacated once. Again, the consumers of America should not be \npenalized for the same reason.\n  I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 635 and the \nunderlying bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule and the \nunderlying bill. The Blocking Regulatory Interference from Closing \nKilns Act--certainly, a mouthful to say--is yet another of the endless \nlist of attempts by this body--and it will not become law--to block \nimplementation of an administrative rule or regulation that some people \ndon't like, rather than tackling the issues that this country cares \nabout and that I hear from voters back home when I have townhall \nmeetings or I am at the grocery store.\n  I hear about fixing our broken immigration system and securing our \nborder. I hear about balancing the budget deficit. I hear about making \nsure that Medicare and Social Security are solvent and there for the \nnext generation. I hear about making sure we create jobs, that housing \nis affordable, and that our roads and bridges are safe so traffic can \nflow safely and quickly.\n  Yet, here we are again, spending an entire legislative day debating a \nbill that won't become law, which you will certainly hear about over \nthe next couple of hours, regarding a series of regulations around \nbrick kilns.\n  Once again the Republicans are approaching a complex rulemaking \nprocess with a knee-jerk reaction in a nontransparent process with a \nclosed rule, not even allowing a debate for a single amendment.\n  Not only is this bill not transparent and not necessary, in this \nparticular case, it sets a bad precedent because the courts already \nhave the authority to issue a stay of compliance on a final rule.\n  As we saw through the recent delay of the Clean Power Plan, our \njudicial and legislative systems are separate for a reason.\n  Let the courts do their work and let us do ours. Let us not preempt \nthe courts from their normal process. Our judicial and legislative \nsystems are separate. Individuals, organizations, and companies have \nplenty of recourse and options through the court system to address this \nmatter.\n\n  The floor of the House is not the place to be requesting a stay. If \nthere was something done that was illegal or wrong, the place to \nrequest a stay is the courtroom.\n  But time and time again legislation like this has come to this floor, \ndisposing of the judicial process and shortcutting the justice system \nthat we have to delay a rule until all legal challenges are completed, \nwhich effectively means that frivolous lawsuits can jam up the rule \nindefinitely and forever.\n  Over the past 45 years, it is proven that clean air regulations are \nimportant to protect the public health and consistent with growing a \nstrong economy.\n  Of course, I understand the pressure requirements placed on brick and \nclay ceramic makers. They have legitimate reasons to provide input to \nquestion or contest the rule.\n  The judicial avenue is and will be available to them. That is the \nappropriate venue to request a stay, not the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  There are several brick and clay companies in my State of Colorado, \nsuch as the Summit Brick & Tile Company in Pueblo, Colorado. I know \nthese companies updated and changed their industry after the 2004 rule.\n  But, unfortunately, like so many rules under the administration of \nGeorge Bush, the rule is written so poorly that it was vacated by the \ncourts in 2007, which means there is no rule under the authority of the \nClean Air Act, which this Congress has made the law of the land, that \nsets standards for eliminating air pollution in this industry. Not only \nis that unacceptable, but, of course, it needs to be rectified \nurgently.\n  There is nothing special about brick kilns. Like anything else, of \ncourse, they affect air quality. I have a picture of what we are \ntalking about here.\n  Of course, like any other economic activity that creates issues \nregarding air quality, we need a nuanced and thoughtful rule that \nensures that the economic activity continues, subject to maintaining \nthe public health.\n  In fact, the EPA has a responsibility under section 112 of the Clean \nAir Act to control pollution from stationary sources of pollution, like \nbrick kilns.\n  Let me repeat that. The EPA was actually required by Congress to \nimplement a rule that covers this industry because, according to the \njudiciary, President Bush enacted the rule incorrectly.\n  If Congress wants to get at the underlying statutes, let's have that \ndebate. Let's talk about what the EPA should and shouldn't do.\n  I believe that we should close down loopholes that exempt fracking \nfrom regulation under the Clean Air Act. We have a series of bills that \nwould do that--the BREATHE Act and the FRESHER Act--to ensure that the \nsmall site exemption does not occur, does not exist with regard to \nfracking activities that, in the aggregate, can have a considerable \nimpact on air quality.\n  We have seen areas of our State and our neighboring State of Wyoming \nhave worse air quality than downtown Los Angeles because of the \nextraction and fracking-related activity, which is largely exempt from \nthe clean air law.\n  That is the debate I would be happy to have. Let's debate the \nappropriate jurisdiction of the EPA. If there is something we got wrong \nin that with regard to brick kilns and their authority or \nresponsibility, that is the place to have the debate.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  It is not to give an indefinite stay to simply implement what is the \nlaw of the land and the will of Congress, which is the EPA's \nresponsibility.\n  Congress has told the EPA, through the Clean Air Act, that they have \nthe responsibility under section 112 to control pollution from \nstationary sources of pollution. They tried to do it under President \nBush. It was tossed out by the courts because it was improperly \nconstructed, and they are doing their job.\n  Yet, Congress is trying to use something that is normally a judicial \nprocedure, a stay, to get around the very\n\n[[Page H1123]]\n\nmandate that Congress gave the Environmental Protection Agency. So it \nis simply the wrong way to go about it.\n  Brick and clay plants, if left unregulated, which is why they are \ncovered under the Clean Air Act, can be major sources of toxic air \npollutants, like hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, and hazardous \nmetal, heavy metal pollutants that can endanger people with everything \nfrom asthma to cancer.\n  Now, I don't know about you, but I would rather have my children \nrunning around a playground of a town where plants that put out \nhazardous pollutants are regulated in a thoughtful and responsible way, \nwhich is what this rule attempts to do.\n  That is why opponents of this legislation include the Center for \nBiological Diversity, League of Conservation Voters, League of Women \nVoters, National Resource Development Council, the Sierra Club, and the \nUnion of Concerned Scientists.\n  All of these experts understand that, for 15 years, Congress has \nexpected air pollution from these facilities to be covered by the Clean \nAir Act standards, and that delaying the process further is \nirresponsible, prevents the EPA from doing their mandate that Congress \nhas given them, sets a dangerous public health precedent, and will \nendanger lives of American citizens.\n  Not only is this a treacherous pattern but, again, it is a waste of \ntime. This bill won't become law. It came out of committee on a party-\nline vote. The majority knows that, even in the off chance that the \nSenate were to consider this legislation, which I highly doubt, the \nPresident would veto the bill.\n  It was indicated in the Statement of Administration Policy that I \nwill include in the Record, Mr. Speaker, which reads, in part, H.R. \n4557 would create ``an incentive for parties to litigate this \nrulemaking and the related corrections notice for as long as possible \nin order to delay air pollution reductions.''\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n H.R. 4557--Blocking Regulatory Interference from Closing Kilns Act of \n          2016--Rep. Bill Johnson, R-OH, and seven cosponsors\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4557, which could \n     extend indefinitely deadlines for the brick and structural \n     clay industry to limit mercury and other hazardous air \n     pollution. Specifically, H.R. 4557 would extend compliance \n     deadlines for the Brick and Structural Clay National Emission \n     Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants until all litigation \n     on the final rule is complete, thereby creating an incentive \n     for parties to litigate the rulemaking and the related \n     corrections notice for as long as possible in order to delay \n     air pollution reductions. In the meantime, H.R. 4557 would \n     undermine the public health protections of the Clean Air Act \n     (CAA) by allowing further emissions of approximately 30 tons \n     per month of toxic air pollution from brick and clay products \n     production facilities. These toxic emissions include mercury, \n     gases, and other hazardous metals which are associated with a \n     variety of acute and chronic health effects, including \n     cancers.\n       The CAA required the Environmental Protection Agency to \n     finalize pollution standards for toxic air pollution from all \n     industrial sectors by 2000. Since then, sources in many other \n     sectors have been complying with standards that limit their \n     emissions of cancer-causing toxic air pollutants. The subject \n     rule reflects CAA requirements while providing flexible \n     compliance options and the maximum time allowed by law for \n     compliance. It also makes distinctions between requirements \n     for small and large kilns in order to reduce the impacts on \n     small businesses.\n       Since its enactment in 1970, and subsequent amendment in \n     1977 and 1990--each time with strong bipartisan support--the \n     CAA has improved the Nation's air quality and protected \n     public health. Over that same period of time, the economy has \n     grown over 200 percent while emissions of key pollutants have \n     decreased nearly 70 percent. Forty-five years of clean air \n     regulation have shown that a strong economy and strong \n     environmental and public health protection go hand-in-hand.\n       Because H.R. 4557 threatens the health of Americans by \n     allowing more toxic air pollution, if the President were \n     presented with H.R. 4557, his senior advisors would recommend \n     that he veto the bill.\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Again, so long as even there are the most frivolous \nlawsuits and anybody could continually file a lawsuit, and so long as \nany one of them is pending, the rule does not take effect. It is \nindefinitely stayed.\n  So, yet again, we are debating something on the floor going nowhere. \nWe are not debating improving our roads and bridges. We are not \ndebating securing our southern border. We are not debating balancing \nour Federal budget deficit. We are not debating making America more \ncompetitive and bringing jobs from overseas and China back home here \nand creating a growing middle class. Instead, we are wasting time on \nlegislation that won't become law, that shouldn't even become law \nbecause it is the inappropriate role of this body.\n  There are so many things that we could be talking about even within \nthe energy realm and the EPA realm that would be productive \ndiscussions. I will give you an example.\n  I have had the opportunity in hearings in the Natural Resources \nCommittee to bring up a bipartisan bill that I have with Mr. Gosar \ntwice this week, and this is the third time. It is a bill that would \ncreate jobs and create renewable energy. It is called the Public Lands \nRenewable Energy Development Act.\n  Why don't we have a rule on that bill or bring it up on suspension?\n  Mr. Gosar and my bill would incentivize renewable energy development \nby streamlining the permitting process on public lands for renewable \nenergy projects.\n  Isn't that something we can come together about, making sure that we \ncan find a way to expedite siting for renewable energy products on \npublic land, creating jobs and creating clean energy?\n  Or we could be discussing the need for a permanent reauthorization of \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund, something that just last week was \noffered as a bipartisan amendment by myself and Mr. Grijalva and Mr. \nSanford of South Carolina.\n  But, of course, that amendment was not given an hour of debate, 2 \nhours of debate, like this. We have the rule, we have the bill. The \nentire legislative day is discussing a stay on brick kilns. It should \nbe in a courtroom, not in the U.S. House.\n  We weren't even given 10 minutes. We weren't even given 1 minute to \ndiscuss that bipartisan amendment from Mr. Grijalva and Mr. Sanford and \nmyself.\n  Look, the list goes on and on of what we could be doing. It has been \nsaid that politics is the art of the possible.\n  When the American people look at our proceedings on the floor and \nwhat the Republican majority is doing with Congress, is it any wonder \nthat the approval rating of Congress is 8 percent?\n  The people look at Congress and say, look, you are spending an entire \nday debating a stay on kiln rules. First of all, why are you talking \nabout it? It should be in a courtroom.\n  Second of all, aren't there critical national priorities that you \nneed to be debating right now to create jobs, make America more \ncompetitive overseas, improve our schools, make college more \naffordable, balance our deficit, fix our broken immigration system, \nimprove our roads and bridges, make America more competitive and grow \nthe middle class? Aren't there?\n  That is what 92 percent of the American people are crying out. There \nis still time for this Congress to listen. I hope that we begin.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama for \nhis important work on this issue, and also the gentleman from Ohio.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 4557, the BRICK Act. This legislation \ndelays an unnecessary EPA rule that imposes overly strict emission \nstandards on American brick kilns.\n  Manufacturers shouldn't have to deal with the hassles of an \noverzealous regulator in the first place, but they should at least get \nto have their day in court fighting this unreasonable regulation before \nincurring millions of dollars of expense to comply.\n  Since 2003, brick manufacturers have reduced emissions from kilns by \n95 percent. However, EPA decided to impose another Washington mandate \non small businesses, which they may not even be able to meet.\n  Shuttering U.S. brick factories will lead to higher costs for \nAmerican consumers, making it even more expensive to open a business or \nraise a family.\n  Additionally, manufacturers will shed good-paying jobs in places like \nMalvern, Arkansas. And, once again,\n\n[[Page H1124]]\n\nour manufacturing needs will move offshore to a place that pollutes \nmuch worse than we do here.\n  Not only is the EPA out of touch with reality on this issue, they \nexhibit no common sense when they regulate jobs away from America and \nsend them to countries that pay sub-par wages and have sub-par \npollution control technology. They have a lose-lose proposition.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the same EPA that negligently released millions \nof gallons of toxic mine water into the Animas River, tried to cover up \nand minimize their actions, refused to take responsibility, and \nresisted being held accountable.\n  If anyone needs more regulation, it is this out-of-control Federal \nagency, not hard-working Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, for the sake of our environment and economy, I urge the \nHouse to pass the BRICK Act to keep the air cleaner and to save good-\npaying jobs here at home.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to talk a little bit more about when we say this bill will \nnever become law what exactly we mean and I mean when I indicate that.\n  There have been an enormous number of bills that have passed the \nHouse of Representatives. As an example, repealing the Affordable Care \nAct, ObamaCare, taking health care away from tens of millions of \nAmericans--that has passed this House in one form or another 64 times. \nSo 64 times the House of Representatives has voted to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act. That is clearly what people who have been elected \nto the House have decided to do.\n  The House of Representatives alone, however, doesn't get to make the \nlaw. We have the United States Senate and we have a President. The \nUnited States Senate usually requires, as a procedural matter, 60 votes \nto move legislation forward. And of course, even after a bill in the \nsame form passes the House and the Senate, for it to become law, the \nPresident needs to sign it. If the President vetoes it, it immediately \ncomes back and will require two-thirds to override the veto.\n  So what we are talking about with this bill around kilns, like this \none here, we are talking about a bill that probably will pass the \nHouse. I expect that that is what we are spending a whole day on. I \ndon't think the Republicans would want to spend a whole day on it if it \nwas going to fail. So let's assume it passes.\n  I have heard no indication whatsoever that the Senate is going to \ntake this up in any way, shape, or form. In the unlikely event that the \nSenate takes it up, they have the challenge of getting 60 votes.\n\n  The bill had no bipartisan support in committee. It is hard to see \nhow they would get enough Democratic support in the Senate to get the \n60 votes to pass the bill. Even if they somehow did, President Obama \nand the administration is, of course, against providing a stay against \ntheir own rule that they promulgated. Therefore, we are spending an \nentire day doing nothing, talking about brick kilns, fiddling while \nRome burns.\n  The American people are upset, Mr. Speaker. The American people want \nthis Congress to tackle the issues that affect them and their family \naround their kitchen table: rising rents and mortgage prices; maybe the \nmom or the dad or the kids lost their job and need to get back to work; \nmaking sure that they have a way to commute to work every day, and that \nour roads and bridges are strong, and they spend a minimal amount of \ntime in traffic so they can spend more time with their family or at \nwork earning money; balancing our budget deficit to secure a strong \nfinancial future for our country; making sure that Medicare and Social \nSecurity are there and safe, not only for today's retirees, but for the \nnext generation and the next generation of American retirees; securing \nour southern border and replacing our broken and nonsensical and costly \nimmigration system with one that works for America to make us more \ncompetitive, generate more revenues, unites families, and reflects our \nvalues as a Nation of immigrants.\n  We could be doing any of those things. We could be debating any of \nthose things. No one says they are easy. It starts with time to debate \nhere on the floor of the House. What a great way to spend a day, a \nThursday.\n  By the way, Speaker Ryan and the Republicans don't even have us \nworking Friday, tomorrow. They are sending us all home on Thursday, \nafter spending a day debating brick kilns. We are not even debating \nanything tomorrow, Friday, or Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday or \nThursday or Friday of next week.\n  I mean, look, the American people would love this kind of job which \nthe Republican majority has given themselves with the congressional \ncalendar where we have worked 3\\1/2\\ days this week, get Friday off, \nall of next week off, and spend a whole day debating brick kilns, \nrather than the issues that the American people care about.\n  That is what is going on here. That is why Congress has such a low \napproval rating.\n  Well, look, let's begin by debating the issues that people care \nabout. They are hard. I get that. Fixing our broken immigration system, \nbalancing our budget deficit, securing Medicare and Social Security, \nare not easy issues.\n  But why don't we spend a day doing that, today, all day, having ideas \nfrom both sides of the aisle, having Members speak about their plans to \nmake America better and stronger, rather than debating a court \nprocedure, a stay on brick kilns, all day, and then rewarding ourselves \nwith a day off tomorrow.\n  Job well done, Congress. We did a court procedure on brick kilns as \nour work product and, for that, we deserve a week and a half off.\n  That is the job that Congress has defined for itself, and it is why \nthe American people are so outraged.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule that would require the Republicans to stop their \npartisan games and hold hearings on the budget proposal, the \nPresident's budget.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, if we pass this previous question motion that \nI am making, we can actually begin the important discussion of how we \ncan bring our budget into balance and restore fiscal responsibility.\n  Let's have hearings on the President's budget proposal. Let's talk \nabout the tradeoffs around investments and savings. Let's have those \nmeaningful discussions, rather than to spend an entire day on brick \nkilns, and then giving ourselves a week and a half off.\n  We can still salvage this Congress for the American people. We can \nrestore trust in the integrity and the desire of the American \nGovernment to do good and tackle the big issues we face. I am confident \nwe can.\n  That can begin by passing my previous question motion and getting to \ndebate about the budget and balancing our budget and the tradeoffs and \ninvestments in our future, rather than debating kilns and giving \nourselves a week and a half off.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I was very interested to hear my colleague talk about what makes the \nAmerican people frustrated and angry right now. I have just come \nthrough a primary campaign for my seat in Alabama. I spent a lot of \ntime with the citizens of the United States in my district. They are \nindeed frustrated and angry, and let me tell you why. They are \nfrustrated and angry because we have a government in the Federal sphere \nthat is out of control, and it is taking away their jobs.\n  This regulation will take away jobs from people in Alabama. It will \ntake away jobs from people in 38 States. That is what makes them angry: \na Federal Government that cares so little about them that they would \nput out a regulation like this that kills jobs, that raises the price \nof bricks on those of us who buy them to build our homes, and the \nFederal Government thinks that is necessary. But we have to do this \ntoday because we have a Federal Government that doesn't understand that \nits role is not to do that.\n\n[[Page H1125]]\n\n  So let's get back to what this really means. This is not a partisan \nissue. Two of the sponsors of this bill are from the other party. My \ncolleague from Alabama (Ms. Sewell) is a sponsor of this bill and the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop) is a sponsor of this bill because \nthey understand it is going to hurt their constituents. It is going to \nhurt the average working person in this country.\n  My colleagues on the other side don't get that, and because they \ndon't get that, there is no job too small for them, in their minds, to \nkill. There is no business too small for them to put out of business. \nThere is no amount of money that they are going to increase what we \nconsumers have to pay that is too much for them. They would kill every \njob, and they would hold back every consumer's ability to get a home at \na decent price to get some little, small, almost nothing benefit.\n  There were no amendments offered as part of this debate today because \nnone were offered in committee and none were offered to the Rules \nCommittee. So this is not a closed debate because we are trying to \nclose off amendments. There aren't any amendments.\n  Now, I heard a lot about a judicial stay. I said this in my initial \nremarks: saying that there is a ``possibility'' for a judicial stay \nsays nothing about the practicality of it. I addressed that in my \nopening remarks. Let me just tell you, as a practical way, it is almost \nimpossible to get this stay. Yet, when they got a stay several years \nago, it was so late in the game that the brick industry had to go ahead \nand make all the changes, which cost jobs and increased the price of \nbricks for the rest of us.\n  Here is the truth. My colleague said that there is an obligation to \nhave a rule here. There is already a rule on particulate matter, and \nmost of the benefits in the rule that has been proposed here are to \nparticulate matter. It is already regulated.\n  And, oh, by the way, when that prior regulation that was turned back \nby the Supreme Court was put out there and the industry had to go ahead \nand comply with it, they had already reduced emissions by over 90 \npercent.\n  So what we are talking about in this regulation is another effort to \nget at some small, little, almost imperceivable benefit at the cost of \nhundreds, if not thousands, of American jobs. I am astonished that this \nadministration is so insensitive to that. The people of America are \nangry and frustrated because of that.\n  Now, I know that we are going to be having debates about some of the \nissues that my colleague talked about, and I am looking forward to \nthose debates. But to the people who work in the industry, this is an \nimportant issue. It may not be important to other people in this House, \nbut it is important to people that work for these brick businesses. It \nis important to me as a consumer looking at what it is going to cost me \nfor buying new bricks.\n  So I would hope that there would be greater sensitivity from this \nadministration for my colleagues in this House to people who are being \nhurt by this rule, and I hope that we will all take this very seriously \nas the important issue that it is.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to, first of all, congratulate the gentleman from \nAlabama. He had a recent election and triumphed, and, of course, we \nwill be excited to continue to serve with him.\n  When we run, it is difficult. We have our ear to the ground, and we \nhear people. The gentleman mentioned that people were angry back home. \nI think there are a lot of people in my district that are angry, too. \nBut again, I want to ask the gentleman: Is what they were angry about \nthis brick kiln rule, or were they angry about the failure of Congress \nto secure our borders and the failure of Congress to balance our \nbudget, all those things? I want to ask whether what you heard about in \nthat anger was about brick kilns, or was it about other issues.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Alabama.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, they are angry about a Federal Government \nthat is overreaching and hurting them. That is what they are angry \nabout.\n  Mr. POLIS. Did anybody who was angry bring up brick kilns as \nsomething they were angry about?\n  I yield to the gentleman from Alabama.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, they brought up the EPA over and over again. \nI hear about the EPA everywhere I go.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, as I indicated, it would \nbe an appropriate discussion for us to talk about the statutory \nobligations of EPA. We might have differing opinions. I think they \nshould have the authority, we should remove the small site exemption, \nand they should look at emissions from the fracking industry and the \nextraction. But that is a valid discussion to have.\n  Instead of that, we are saying you are doing what we told you to do, \nbut we want to grant a stay. So Congress, under the EPA in section 112, \ndirected the EPA under the Clean Air Act to promulgate these \nregulations. President George Bush did so. They were tossed out, and \nnow there is a new set of regulations going forward to implement what \nCongress wanted the EPA to do.\n  Now, if the gentleman from Alabama doesn't want the EPA to do that, \nlet's have that discussion about EPA's authority. I am happy to do it. \nI have ideas. Maybe there are some areas the EPA shouldn't have that \nmandate authority. There are other areas, like making sure we look at \nemissions from fracking where we need enhanced authority because there \nis something called the small site exemption in the Clean Air Act, \nwhere, even though each particular fracking pad has a very small \ncontribution to air quality, when you start having thousands of them in \na limited area--which we do--it starts looking a lot less like a couple \nautomobiles and a lot more like a large industrial factory. So they \nshouldn't be exempt just by nature of being small, because when you \nhave a lot of small things, it equals not only one big thing, it equals \n10 big things and 100 big things.\n  We have over 40,000 active wells in the greater Weld-Larimer County \narea alone, and there is an enormous impact on our air quality, which \nis exempt under the small site exemption.\n  So again, section 112 directs the EPA to promulgate these rules. If \nwe want to open up the mandate that Congress has given the EPA, let's \nhave that discussion.\n  As an individual legislator, I might trade you this brick kiln \nauthority if we can close the small site exemption. I would say, fine; \nmy constituents care more about closing that small site exemption than \nthey do if there are two brick kilns in our entire State. So I think, \nin general, my constituents and Coloradans care more about making sure \nour air quality is good and protected with regard to the emissions from \nthe fracking activity than from the two brick kilns. So I would be open \nto that as a legislative compromise. That is how legislation is made. \nBut we are not allowed to have that debate.\n  The gentleman mentioned, oh, no amendments were brought forward. \nGuess what? We did a motion in the Rules Committee--I am sure the \ngentleman from Alabama remembers--yesterday to do an open rule on this. \nIf that had passed--and it failed on a partisan vote. Not a single \nRepublican voted to allow an open rule on this bill. If that had \nsucceeded, if that had passed, that open rule the Democrats wanted, we \ncould then introduce amendments like the ones that I mentioned to talk \nabout the authority of the EPA or other issues that we have to improve \nthe statutory requirements in charge of the EPA. Right on the floor, we \nwould have the opportunity to do that. Instead, we have an entire day \non brick kilns without even being allowed to introduce amendments that \naffect our clean air and water in any way, shape, or form. I think we \ncan do better.\n\n  The gentleman also asked what the impact of the brick kilns on this \nis. The EPA estimates that the brick and clay rule would reduce \nnational air toxins by approximately 375 tons in 2018. Again, that is \nwhat Congress has told the EPA to do under the Clean Air Act.\n  If Congress wants the EPA to do something different, let's have that \ndiscussion, section 112, other sections of the Clean Air Act, of the \nmandate that Congress has given the EPA. Let's not use a court \nprocedure, a stay, that\n\n[[Page H1126]]\n\nwon't become law to short-circuit something that Congress has told the \nEPA to do. It is positively schizophrenic for Congress to require an \nagency to do something and then say we are not going to allow you to do \nwhat we told you to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, if I heard the gentleman correctly, he wants \nan open rule. Let me restate: we had no amendments offered at the \ncommittee of jurisdiction and no amendments offered before the Rules \nCommittee, so that would fly in the face of our desire here to have \nregular order. What he has proposed is not regular order. He is \nproposing chaos, and I don't think the American people want us to be in \nchaos around here.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from the great State \nof Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), a great conservative leader.\n  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time to speak \non the rule.\n  Our process for a bill to get to the floor is it has to go through \nthe Rules Committee. This was a very, very important bill. It was \ninteresting in the debate, listening to the sides, because there is an \nargument by constituents of having clean bills: one bill, one issue, \nsimply understood, vote on it, instead of this horse trading that \nsometimes gets proposed: you give me this for my giving you that. I can \ntell you one thing, I know in my district they really don't like this. \nThey want us to be accountable for a bill.\n  I also get frustrated with how easy it is to throw away jobs: I only \nhave blank kilns in my State. Those are good-paying jobs for families, \nand they are important to the fabric of those communities. Just to say, \n``Look, I have only got two. I don't really worry about them. Let's \ntrade them off'' is really troublesome, and I am sorry we fall into \nthat type of debate.\n  This is really part of a bigger debate in that the courts have \nalready done this with the Clean Power Plan, the climate change bill. \nThe debate is, ``Okay. EPA, you can do the regulation. Do the \nregulation.'' What the EPA likes to do is do the regulation; and they \nplay this game: ``We know it is not legal, so we will impose the \nregulation. We know it is not legal. We are going to force industry to \ncomply,'' and then when the courts say it is not legal, they have \nalready gone too far, and the jobs have been lost.\n  That is factual. That is what happened in 2003. That is what happened \nwhen the EPA promulgated the MACT rules in 2003. The rules were vacated \nby the Federal court in 2007--vacated--which means you can't do it. But \nthe industry already was forced to do it, either to spend millions and \nmillions of dollars, or they had to close.\n  So fast-forward. Where are we today?\n  The courts have done this on the Clean Power Plan, the big climate \nchange rule. What the Court just said for the first time, the Supreme \nCourt said: No, we are not going to force the States to implement the \nClean Power Plan until it is litigated in the courts. They put a stay \non everyone and said: Don't do anything. Let's have the legislative-\njudicial debate and fight.\n  That is what this bill does. Let's just have the litigation on the \nlegality of this new rule. If it comes up that it is legal, then the \nindustry is going to have to comply. But if it comes out that it is not \nlegal, guess what. We are going to save jobs. We are going to save \ncommunities, and we are going to save the family income for two kilns \nin a State or maybe more, depending upon the brick-producing capability \nof individual States.\n  So I am down here just to thank the Rules Committee for bringing this \nbill to the floor.\n  I look forward to the debate. It is much more than brick kilns. It is \nabout when can the EPA force a company to do something. We would hope \nthey could only do it after it has been ruled legal by the courts if \nsomeone challenges a rule, and that is what this does.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  There is a way that our process works around here. If a rule is \nillegal, it will be tossed out by the courts. George Bush's attempt to \nimplement the Clean Air Act, section 112, around brick kilns was tossed \nout.\n  What this bill does is says that, so long as there is a court \nchallenge, there is some sort of presumption that the rule be tossed \nout and, therefore, an indefinite stay.\n  Now, there can be challenges all the time. The minute one fails, \nanother one can be launched. No bones about it. This would indefinitely \nprevent this rule from ever taking effect with regard to brick kilns.\n  I have to say, Mr. Speaker, I haven't heard from a single constituent \non this issue. Like the gentleman from Alabama, my constituents are \nangry. They are angry at Congress and worried about the direction of \nthe country.\n  They want Congress to replace our broken immigration system with one \nthat works and secure our southern border. They want Congress to return \nto fiscal responsibility and balance our budget. They want to make sure \nthat college is affordable for the next generation. They want to make \nsure they have good jobs here at home.\n  They want to make sure that we encourage companies to locate and grow \nhere in America rather than take tax advantages for relocating overseas \nor inverting their headquarters to occur overseas, as occurs with \ntoday's Tax Code. Those are some of the many issues that my \nconstituents want me to talk about here.\n  I just had a townhall meeting last week in Fort Collins, Colorado, \nthe biggest city in my district. About 100 people came. Not a single \nperson was angry about brick kilns.\n  But, yes, there was a lot of anger there about some of the issues I \nindicated: people frustrated with why Congress refuses to act on making \ncollege more affordable, why Congress has refused to act in making sure \nthat Medicare and Social Security are there for the next generation, \nand why Congress doesn't put our country on the course of fiscal \nresponsibility and reduce our debt-to-GDP ratio.\n  But, instead, we are debating a bill that won't become law without \nallowing amendments here on the floor. That is what a closed rule \nmeans. If it was an open rule, I would be able to offer my amendment to \nclose the small site exemption with regard to fracking, but I can't.\n  We are debating a bill that won't become law, attacking a rule that \nis merely implementing what Congress has told not just this President, \nbut any President, to do. George Bush tried. Obama tried.\n  It is because Congress, under the Clean Air Act, tells the executive: \nYou have to do this under section 112. And then, when they do it, there \nis the issue that went through the courts.\n  That is appropriate. That is their role. But when they implement what \nCongress has told them to do, we are saying: No. There is an indefinite \nstay.\n  That is what this bill would do.\n  I know, Mr. Speaker, regardless of what they think about any of the \npolicies or rules put out by this administration or any administration, \nit is not the place of Congress to issue stays on rules. It is the role \nof the courts.\n  The Constitution established three branches in our government for a \nreason under our Constitution. It is the courts' job, not Congress' \njob, to interfere with the legal process.\n  It is not Congress' job to take that responsibility away from the \njudicial branch, especially with a bill that would actually encourage \nmore frivolous litigation by rewarding frivolous litigation and endless \nappeals when we already have too much of that in our court system.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' to defeat the \nprevious question, which, if we succeed on that vote, we can \nimmediately get to hold hearings on the President's budget proposals.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule as well, again, a \nclosed rule, not allowing amendments here on the floor of the House.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The American people are sick and tired of a Federal Government that \nis out of control. I can't imagine the Founders of this country in that \nconstitutional convention in Philadelphia in 1787 saying: Now, let's \nthink about a\n\n[[Page H1127]]\n\ngovernment agency established under our Constitution that is going to \nregulate bricks.\n  No wonder the American people look at the Federal Government and say: \nHave you lost your mind? What are you doing?\n  These other issues that my colleague talked about are important. But \nwe have to stop here in this Congress to deal with another out-of-\ncontrol Federal agency--and the EPA is one of the most out-of-control \nFederal agencies--to protect the American people and, yes, to protect \ntheir jobs, to protect the consumers of America from unreasonable \nincreases in the cost of things like bricks because another agency has \ndone something to them.\n  Yes, I think the American people are sick and tired of that, and I do \nthink it is the role of this Congress to do something about it.\n  The EPA would have no power except for the fact that this Congress \nhas delegated its own legislative power to the EPA. Indeed, it is our \nrole to not only provide oversight to that power but, on particular \noccasions, to take it back.\n  Frankly, in my judgment, we don't take it back enough. If we took it \nback more, we would be protecting the American people more and their \njobs and the cost of things that they buy every day.\n  I understood what my colleague just said. I heard it. But once again \nI don't think he is thinking about those people who work for these \nbrick companies and I don't think he is thinking about the consumers of \nAmerica, who are ready for the Congress to do its job to protect them. \nThis is one way that we can do that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 635 and \nthe underlying bill.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n      An Amendment to H. Res. 635 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec 4. Immediately upon the adoption of this resolution it \n     shall be in order without intervention of any point of order \n     to consider in the House the resolution (H. Res. 624) \n     Directing the Committee on the Budget to hold a public \n     hearing on the President's fiscal year 2017 budget request \n     with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget as a \n     witness. The resolution shall be considered as read. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the \n     resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening \n     motion or demand for division of the question except one hour \n     of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and \n     ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget.\n       Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of House Resolution 624.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution. . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Ribble). The question is on ordering the \nprevious question.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be \nfollowed by 5-minute votes on adopting the resolution, if ordered, and \nsuspending the rules and passing S. 1826, if ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 233, \nnays 174, not voting 26, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 106]\n\n

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 635, I call \nup the bill (H.R. 4557) to allow for judicial review of any final rule \naddressing national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for \nbrick and structural clay products or for clay ceramics manufacturing \nbefore requiring compliance with such rule, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration in the House.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 635, the bill \nis considered read.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4557\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour \nequally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member \nof the Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n  The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rush) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous materials on H.R. 4557.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Today, we have the important opportunity to protect the American \nbrick manufacturing industry and the ceramic kiln industry and its \n7,000 employees from a costly regulation that has yet to survive a \njudicial scrutiny.\n  At this time, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nBishop), one of the original sponsors of this bill.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding, and I certainly appreciate the opportunity to speak on this \nbill.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 4557, the Blocking Regulatory \nInterference from Closing Kilns Act, or the BRICK Act. This legislation \nis important to preserving the viability of brick manufacturing \nfacilities all across the country.\n  Simply put, the BRICK Act pauses the EPA's 2015 National Emission \nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants until court challenges of the \nrule are resolved. I am very concerned that brick manufacturers in my \ndistrict, as well as those in the districts of my colleagues, may be \nrequired to spend hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars to \nsatisfy an EPA requirement similar to the EPA's 2003 rule, a rule, it \nshould be noted, that was vacated by the Federal courts.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  For example, Cherokee Brick & Tile from Macon, Georgia, spent over \n$1.5 million to install controls in order to comply with the EPA's \ninvalidated 2003 rule.\n  Cherokee is a small, family-owned business, and as my colleagues with \nsmall businesses in their districts can attest, $1.5 million is a very \nsubstantial sum that can cut heavily into a bottom line. This rule \nimpacts more than just Cherokee Brick & Tile in my State, but also \nGeneral Shale and Pine Hall Brick, among others.\n  A basic material for home building and construction, bricks are more \nthan just a figurative cornerstone in the United States construction \nindustry. Passing this legislation would guarantee the EPA would wait \nuntil its 2015 emission standards are reviewed by the courts before \nimplementing the rule and before manufacturers across the country are \nneedlessly required to spend millions of dollars.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 4557, the BRICK Act.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4557 is an unnecessary bill that would set a \nterrible precedent.\n  As the Statement of Administration Policy, which outlines the \njustification for President Obama's veto threat, states:\n  ``H.R. 4557 would undermine the public health protections of the \nClean Air Act by allowing further emissions of approximately 30 tons \nper month of toxic air pollution from brick and clay products \nproduction facilities. These toxic emissions include mercury, gases, \nand other hazardous metals which are associated with a variety of acute \nand chronic health effects, including cancers.''\n  Mr. Speaker, the statement from President Obama goes on to say:\n  ``Because H.R. 4557 threatens the health of Americans by allowing \nmore toxic air pollution, if the President were presented with H.R. \n4557, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.''\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4557 is the wrong remedy at the wrong time. Mr. \nSpeaker, this bill is premature.\n  While I understand that the industry feels that it has been penalized \nfor complying with the 2003 rule, that is not sufficient reason in \nitself to set up a unique process that incentivizes all parties that \nobject to this rule to file endless challenges to the rulemaking.\n  The Brick and Clay Maximum Achievable Control Technology, or MACT, \nregulations that are the subject of this legislation are the subject of \nongoing legal actions by industry and by public health communities \nacross this Nation.\n  The courts already have the ability to grant a stay on this rule, yet \nfor some reason the industry has not yet made that request to the \ncourt. But there are a number of pending cases filed by the industry on \nthis very rule.\n  This week, Mr. Speaker, it was reported that the industry petitioned \nthe court to put four suits on hold until the EPA decides whether to \ngrant their requests to reconsider the regulations.\n  The pending decision by the court and by the EPA indicate that there \nis no need for H.R. 4557, as there are ample remedies available under \nthe Clean Air Act to address concerns about this rule. Additionally, \nMr. Speaker, H.R. 4557 does not actually address the merits or the \nfaults with the Brick and Clay MACT rules.\n  Instead, what this bill does is takes these rules and this rulemaking \noutside of the process in the Clean Air Act that allows the EPA to \nissue final rules with deadlines for their implementation, without \nwaiting for the conclusion of all the appeals and all the reviews.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill would also delay any subsequent rule issued \nthat is similar in scope and similar in objective until any legal \nchallenges to it were completed as well. In other words, Mr. Speaker, \nthis bill allows an opportunity for endless lawsuits on this very \nissue.\n  I fear, Mr. Speaker, that if H.R. 4557 were to become law, we would \nend up in a situation where we would never, ever control air polluting \nemissions from these facilities, no matter how cost-effective or how \nnecessary that rule might be. Mr. Speaker, this is a policy that we \nmust reject.\n  As the Statement of Administration Policy also noted, if rules cannot \ngo forward until all legal actions are complete, there is a strong \nincentive to use frivolous legal challenges to prevent any rules from \nbeing implemented.\n  Under that scenario, we never would have achieved the improvements in \nair quality and in public health that have been accomplished under the \nClean Air Act. We know, Mr. Speaker, that the Clean Air Act has \ndelivered many cost-effective health benefits to the American people \nover the years.\n  It has been demonstrated many times that we do not have to make a \nchoice between healthy air and jobs in this Nation. We can have both.\n  We cannot agree, Mr. Speaker, to setting this precedent and \nestablishing a process that will delay important public health \nprotections and encourage, at the same time, frivolous legal challenges \nto our clean air rules.\n  The brick, clay, and tile industries would be better served by \npursuing the options available to them right now under the Clean Air \nAct.\n  For all of these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I must urge all of my \ncolleagues to oppose this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nJohnson) for introducing this important bill. This is an industry that \nhas been hard hit by the recession. It has lost 45 percent of its jobs. \nThere are 70 of these plants around the country, and they employ 7,000 \npeople.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson), the \nsponsor of the legislation.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, the BRICK Act would simply allow \nfor the consideration and completion of any judicial review regarding \nthe\n\n[[Page H1131]]\n\nEPA's 2015 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for \nthe brick, clay, and tile industries before requiring compliance.\n  So why is this important? Because this rule needlessly jeopardizes \ngood-paying jobs all across America, as the chart right here next to me \nclearly demonstrates.\n  And for what reason? Why are they jeopardizing these jobs? The EPA \nitself concedes in the rule: ``We do not expect that the combined \nemissions . . . would result in substantial cumulative health and \nenvironmental impacts.''\n  Instead, the real health impacts due to this rule will be felt by the \nworkers who lose their jobs, their health benefits, and even the \neducation and training opportunities offered by their employers.\n  The brick industry primarily consists of small, family-owned \nbusinesses. They are often located in small communities that depend on \nthe plant for good-paying jobs.\n  To comply with the EPA's requirement, these small businesses will be \nforced to borrow millions of dollars to pay for the required control \ntechnology. Many brick companies are already struggling to find the \ncapital for plant modernization. I can't imagine how difficult it will \nbe for these companies to secure the needed investments to pay for new \ncontrol equipment, equipment that provides zero return on investment.\n\n  And let's not forget that the brick industry has already been through \nthis before. The EPA finalized a similar rule in 2003 that required \nbrick companies to spend millions of dollars on control equipment. A \nfew years later, a Federal court vacated that rule.\n  Unfortunately, the brick industry couldn't roll back the clock and \nrecover the investments they had made. Worse yet, the EPA's new \nemission rules use the reductions achieved by the vacated rule as the \nbaseline for further reduction requirements, so the industry \nessentially got no credit for the hard work that they had already done.\n  This history further underscores why this legislation is so \nimportant. It also baffles me when I hear some of my colleagues say the \nBRICK Act is not needed because parties can already seek a judicial \nstay.\n  However, the EPA has effectively indicated, in a statement for the \nRecord submitted to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, that they \nwould oppose any requests to stay the rule.\n  Further, while the EPA's Clean Power Plan was recently stayed, the \nparties were only able to obtain relief by going to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. Here, the EPA's rule threatens the very existence of small brick \nand tile companies. These companies do not have unlimited resources to \nlitigate against the Federal Government, and their jobs should not be \nput at risk due to a rule which has been vacated once already and has \nyet to be reviewed by the courts.\n  Mr. Speaker, the brick industry is part of our American culture. It \nhas helped build some of the most iconic buildings, cities, and towns \nin existence in our country today. We must make certain our regulations \nand laws preserve this industry, not destroy it. The BRICK Act will do \nthat.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers right now.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I rise in favor of this very important, I think, legislation \nsponsored by my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Johnson). I want to thank him \nfor his leadership on this bill because it is a very pro-growth jobs \nbill. I think it is very important that we pass this.\n  I happen to be the chairman of the House Committee on Small Business, \nand our Nation's brick industry is primarily made up of small, family-\nowned businesses that employ thousands of workers. In Ohio alone, brick \ncompanies directly employ more than 700 workers and ensure the \nlivelihoods of thousands of other workers.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  Brick is used to construct, as we all know, residential homes and has \nbeen used to build some of our country's most iconic landmarks, such as \nIndependence Hall, the birthplace of this great Nation.\n  With the severe downturn in construction during the Great Recession, \nthe brick industry suffered significantly and still has not fully \nrecovered. The industry is operating at about 50 percent of its \ncapacity and suffered a 45 percent job loss from 2005 to 2012.\n  Now, small brick manufacturers are facing a costly new EPA regulation \nthat may make it impossible for them to keep their doors open. That \nmeans those jobs would go away.\n  Compliance will require many companies to remove and replace costly \nair pollution control equipment with new devices that may not be able \nto meet the new, stringent emissions standards.\n  It is estimated to cost $4.4 million to retrofit two kilns--the \naverage number of kilns in a facility--with the new pollution control \nequipment. While the regulation is being challenged in Federal court, \nit just makes common sense to delay the compliance deadlines until that \nmatter is resolved.\n  As chairman of the Small Business Committee, I urge my colleagues to \nstand up for small brick manufacturers and support this bill. This is a \njobs bill.\n  Again, I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson) for his \nleadership in moving this bill forward.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The gentleman \nfrom Illinois has 21\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from \nKentucky has 22\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the BRICK Act.\n  I agree with my colleagues that the brick, clay, and tile industries \nare in a tough position. The Bush administration issued final brick and \nclay emission standards--or Brick and Clay MACT standards--in 2003, 3 \nyears after they were supposed to be completed.\n  Unfortunately, the rule was flawed and, when challenged, the court \nvacated those standards as unlawful. As a result, the EPA Administrator \nwas able to redo the brick and clay rule.\n  I am sympathetic to the fact that the brick, clay, and tile \nindustries have been facing some real challenges since 2007, when the \nhousing market began to decline, but some proponents of this bill will \nhave you believe that all of the challenges are a result of the \nimprovements the industry must make to meet the 2015 Brick and Clay \nMACT rule. What they refuse to acknowledge are the real health benefits \nthat will come with the reduction of several major air pollutants.\n  I understand the industry stakeholders' reluctance to make further \ninvestments in pollution control technology to comply with this rule, \ngiven their previous experience with the 2003 rule, but the Clean Air \nAct provides a number of remedies that are available to them.\n  The courts are the proper venue for resolving issues with the Brick \nand Clay MACT. To date, industry groups have filed lawsuits on the \nmerits of the rule, but none of the interested parties have actually \nasked the court to stay the rule's compliance dates.\n  The industry can also ask EPA to reconsider the rule, which I \nunderstand has already happened. In fact, earlier this week industry \ngroups asked the D.C. Circuit Court to postpone consideration of their \npending lawsuits until EPA makes a decision on whether to reconsider \nthe rule. Neither of those remedies require action by Congress, but a \nlegislative quick fix is the only remedy the proponents of this bill \nappear to care about.\n  H.R. 4557 does not resolve the ongoing issues with this rule. In \nfact, it is far more likely to create a drawn-out rulemaking process \nfueled by an endless stream of court challenges. That wouldn't resolve \nany of the industry's problems with the Brick and Clay MACT rule.\n  The bill also sets, in my opinion, a terrible precedent by delaying \nall of the rule's compliance requirements until all legal actions are \ncomplete.\n  If this remedy sounds familiar, that is because it is. The majority \nincluded a similar provision in a bill we considered earlier in this \nCongress: H.R. 2042,\n\n[[Page H1132]]\n\nthe Ratepayer Protection Act. I opposed that bill, and I oppose this \none for the same reasons.\n  If we had included a litigation delay policy in the Clean Air Act, we \nwould never have achieved the improvements in air quality and public \nhealth that we now enjoy.\n  The Clean Air Act provides ample opportunities for industry and the \npublic to influence the development and implementation of regulations. \nThese tools should be used in this case.\n  Finally, I do not support legislation to resolve the issues being \nraised by the bill's supporters. These issues can and should be \nresolved by the courts.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject this attempt to get around the \ncourts. I ask that they vote ``no'' on H.R. 4557.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell), one of the original cosponsors \nof this legislation.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to voice my support \nfor H.R. 4557, the BRICK Act.\n  I want to tell a story about a small company in my hometown of Selma, \nAlabama. Henry Brick Company has been a family-owned business since \n1945, providing jobs and economic support to the Black Belt of Alabama.\n  In 2003, the EPA passed a rule requiring Henry Brick Company, along \nwith all other brick and structural clay manufacturers, to reduce their \nair pollutant emissions.\n  In order to meet these new regulations by 2006, Henry Brick Company \nof Selma, Alabama, spent $1.5 million to come into compliance with the \nrule. This was a major financial burden for this small company, but \nHenry Brick Company is a good corporate citizen and understands the \nimportance of protecting our environment.\n  However, 1 year after they spent $1.5 million, the courts vacated the \nEPA's 2003 regulation. So the EPA went back to the drawing board to \ncreate a new rule, but they did not give these brick companies credit \nfor emission reductions achieved under the previous rule.\n  On the contrary, in their new rule, the EPA actually used the \nemission reductions achieved under the vacated rule as a baseline for \nfurther reduction requirements.\n  Now, Henry Brick Company faces a new brick and clay manufacturing \nrule with even stricter emissions requirements and must come into \ncompliance by December 2018.\n  This time the small company may have to spend up to $8 million to \ncomply with the new emissions standards, leaving Henry Brick Company \none step closer to being forced to close their doors.\n  I am supportive, Mr. Speaker, of reducing emissions, and I am also in \nfavor of protecting our environment. But this must be done in an \neconomically viable way. It is simply unfair for regulators to continue \nto move the goalposts on small brick manufacturers like Henry Brick \nCompany.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. That is why I support this legislation to \ndelay the enforcement of the new EPA rule until all of the legal \nchallenges have been concluded.\n  This is a necessary and commonsense bill. I ask my colleagues to vote \n``yes'' on final passage.\n  I want to thank Representative Johnson of Ohio and all of those that \nare working hard to make sure that small brick companies, like Henry \nBrick Company of Selma, Alabama, do not have to close its doors.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4557, the BRICK Act.\n  Once again American businesses find themselves facing millions of \ndollars in compliance costs due to burdensome EPA regulations.\n  It is estimated that the EPA's Brick MACT rule may cost the brick and \nceramics industry up to $100 million per year, with the cost of \ncompliance for the average facility at approximately $4.4 million.\n  In addition, the industry will not be able to meet the requirement \ndeadlines imposed by the rule, which is currently being challenged in \nFederal court.\n  The EPA's first attempt at a Brick MACT rule was judicially vacated, \nbut not before the industry spent millions in compliance measures \nultimately found to be invalid.\n  Small brick and ceramics businesses have been the hardest hit by the \nfirst rule, and if this situation repeats itself, many of these \nbusinesses will be forced to close their doors for good.\n  H.R. 4557 would provide much-needed regulatory relief to brick and \nceramic businesses by stating that no additional compliance measures \nshall be mandated by the EPA until judicial review of the rule is \ncompleted.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, which will protect a \nvital industry and its thousands of jobs from potentially devastating \nregulatory uncertainty.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMississippi (Mr. Kelly).\n  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the \nBlocking Regulatory Interference from Closing Kilns Act, or the BRICK \nAct.\n  Rules handed down by the EPA have real-world consequences on \nbusinesses and our economy. You have heard the backstory today \nregarding the 2015 Brick MACT standards and the impact it will have on \nthe brick manufacturing industry.\n  In my district, Columbus Brick Company, a fifth-generation, family-\nowned small business, will be forced to spend millions of dollars in \ncompliance costs and significantly downsize or go out of business and \ntell 85 dedicated employees to find a new job. What is even more \ndisappointing is that Columbus Brick has been forced to navigate this \ndecision before.\n  The EPA promulgated Brick MACT standards in 2003, and then the rule \nwas vacated by a Federal court in 2007, but not until a significant \nmonetary investment had been made by Columbus Brick in an attempt to be \nin compliance. That is why it is imperative that we pass the BRICK Act \ntoday.\n  Companies like Columbus Brick aren't asking for zero regulation, but \nthey are asking to be regulated fairly, to have a seat at the table in \ndetermining new rules, and some certainty when it comes to making \nfuture business decisions.\n  The American people deserve better. They deserve a government that \ncan ensure citizens have clean air to breathe without eliminating \nessential industries.\n  That is why I urge you to support the BRICK Act. Let's wait until \njudicial review is complete so our businesses aren't forced to make \nunnecessary, costly decisions with minimal or unknown environmental \nbenefits.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't know why we are even here debating this issue, \nwhich is an important issue, but not a prevailing issue. This is an \nissue that concerns one industry.\n  It is a concern that is already under consideration by the courts and \nby the administration. In fact, Mr. Speaker, it is a problem that is \nmore appropriately addressed by those branches of government than by \nthis Congress.\n  There are many other issues that this Congress has before it that it \nis our job to address. Yet, Mr. Speaker, we are not spending ample time \non those things that are closely tied to the economic benefits and jobs \nfor all Americans.\n  Our water infrastructure, Mr. Speaker, is in dire need of repair and \nmaintenance. We spend little to no time on our water infrastructure and \nthe problems associated with it.\n  We have Superfund sites and brownfield sites that need to be cleaned \nup and put to productive use. No time, no energy, no congressional \nresources are used to address these vital issues.\n  Our States need support for modernizing and hardening the electricity \ngrid. We are AWOL on these issues.\n  And still, Mr. Speaker, many Americans are underemployed, unemployed, \nand underpaid for the work that they are doing.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  Where is the time allocation, the resource allocation? Where are our \nefforts on behalf of these people?\n  All of these things, Mr. Speaker, particularly and especially the \ninfrastructure issue, must be addressed by the Congress. There is no \nother place that\n\n[[Page H1133]]\n\ncan address these issues as appropriately, as effectively, as \nefficiently, except this Congress. And these issues, these \ninfrastructure issues affect every industry, every State, every \nAmerican in our Nation.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, let us use this body's time and efforts on the \ncritical issues that are of great importance to the American people. \nMr. Speaker, our time could be better served if we would just address \nsome of these prevailing issues of the day.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I will conclude my remarks over on this side. I was listening to the \ndebate on the rule about this bill, and some people did make the \ncomment that this was not a particularly important issue.\n  I might say to the 7,000 people employed in this industry, to the \nowners of the companies, this is very important because some of them \nmay very well lose their business, may very well lose their jobs.\n  So we have two goals with this legislation. One is simply to say this \nregulation coming out of EPA needs to be considered by the courts \nbefore these companies are required to invest significant sums of \nmoney.\n  In fact, the industry itself has said that the average plant has two \nkilns, and a plant with two kilns would have to spend roughly $4 \nmillion to meet the requirements of this regulation.\n  Now, remember, in 2003, EPA came out with a regulation for this \nindustry and, by 2006, the industry had to comply. They did comply and \nthey reduced emissions of the regulated substance by 96 percent.\n  We see a pattern developing at EPA. They know full well that this \nPresident would veto any legislation that changes in any way anything \ncoming out of EPA, so the only avenue left to the regulated parties is \nto file a lawsuit.\n  So just as the brick industry filed a lawsuit in 2003 on that extreme \nregulation, they had to comply by 2006; and then the Court, in 2007, \nafter they had already complied, ruled that the regulation was illegal, \nbut the money had already been spent.\n  Now, the money has already been spent, 96 percent reduction has \noccurred, and now the EPA is coming back with a new regulation.\n  So these people involved, they have no avenue. I mean, they are \ntalking to EPA, pleading with EPA, and EPA, as usual, is not \nresponsive.\n  So all this legislation does is say, we are not trying to reverse the \nregulation, change the regulation. We are simply saying, let the Court \ndecide.\n  And guess what?\n  A pattern is also developing over at EPA because they are losing \nthese court cases.\n  Now, on the Clean Energy Plan, which was one of the most extreme \nregulations ever to come from EPA, 3 days before Judge Scalia died, the \nSupreme Court issued a stay on the Clean Energy Plan, saying that you \ncannot implement this plan until the judicial remedies have been \nexhausted.\n  Then, even under Utility MACT, that also went to the Supreme Court, \nand the Court said, well, you didn't consider certain costs; we are \nremanding this. But most of the industries have already spent the \nmoney, met the requirements, and some of them have closed as well.\n  So the question becomes, are we going to let an EPA adopting extreme \nrules under this administration make all the decisions?\n  Or will the Congress of the United States try to stand up and pass \nsome legislation, not reversing, not changing, but simply saying, since \nlawsuits have been filed, let's give the Court the opportunity to \ndetermine if the regulation is legal or not legal?\n  So that is all we are doing here.\n  I want to thank those who introduced this legislation, both the \nDemocrats and Republicans. And I would urge our colleagues to pass this \nlegislation, to simply provide some commonsense balance, and let the \ncourts make a decision before we require the companies to spend all \nthis money and, in many cases, lay off employees and, in some cases, \neven close the business.\n  So I would urge the passage of H.R. 4557.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I voted against H.R. 4557, the Blocking \nRegulatory Interference from Closing Kilns Act of 2016, yet another \nbill in a series of Republican attempts to block EPA's ability to \neffectively regulate pollution in a way that protects our health and \nthe environment.\n  H.R. 4557 would delay the enactment of an important rule limiting \nmercury and other hazardous pollution from clay and brick products \nproduction facilities. I was disappointed to see it pass the House, but \nI know that President Obama and Democrats in the Senate will ensure \nthat this misguided bill does not become law this year.\n  The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to establish standards for \npollution from all industrial sectors, and many other sectors are \nalready complying to improve air quality. There is no reason to further \ndelay this rule, and no reason for this legislation.\n  I am hopeful that House Republicans will drop its obsession with pro-\npollution bills and allow us to get to work on a budget and bills that \nwill improve the lives of Oregonians.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, we have the opportunity today to help many \nstruggling small businesses and the jobs they support by voting yes on \nH.R. 4557, the BRICK Act.\n  How did we get here? Last October, the EPA finalized an extremely \nstringent new rule for the brick making industry. Most of the companies \nthat find themselves threatened by this rule are small businesses--many \nare family-owned--and the industry is still dealing with the effects of \nthe recession and the weak recovery that continues to suppress demand \nfor bricks and other building materials. Few, if any, brick makers can \neasily afford the estimated $4.4 million dollars it will take to bring \na typical facility into compliance and the industry is currently \nchallenging the rule in federal court.\n  The BRICK Act simply extends the compliance deadlines for the rule \nuntil after judicial review is complete. This commonsense step would \nprevent brick makers from having to initiate costly and potentially \nirreversible compliance steps--and in some cases shut their doors \nentirely and lay off workers--over a rule whose legality is still in \nquestion.\n  This is far from a hypothetical concern. EPA's last set of Brick \nstandards in 2003 were vacated by a federal court in 2007, but by that \ntime the industry had already been forced to spend millions on \ncompliance. None of us want to see that happen again. It's a matter of \nfairness. It's a matter of commonsense.\n  For the sake of brick makers and their thousands of employees across \nthe country, including nearly 2,000 in Michigan I urge my colleagues to \nvote yes on the BRICK Act.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 635, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, on that, I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15-\nminute vote on passage of the bill will be followed by a 5-minute vote \non agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal, if ordered.\n  The vote was

Mr. Speaker, the President has a history of legislating \nthrough government agencies, and his flavor of the week continues to be \nthe EPA.\n  Using faceless EPA bureaucrats, this administration issues new rules \nand regulations daily, passing them out like candy. Not only are they \ncostly and time-consuming, these rules affect the heart of America's \nprosperity and economic growth: our small businesses.\n  I rise today in support of legislation that works to block the \noverreaching hand of this administration and protects Americans and \nAmerican businesses from more burdensome regulations.\n  The BRICK Act delays a harmful EPA rule from being implemented until \nall judicial review has been completed. To me, this legislation is \nplain common sense.\n  Congress needs to stand up to this administration, which continues to \nlegislate outside its jurisdiction, and increasingly, the courts \nconfirm my claims. The legislative process begins and ends with \nCongress.

Mr. Speaker, I ran for Congress on the idea of no budget, \nno pay. If Congress can't do its job and pass a budget, they don't \ndeserve a paycheck. No hardworking American gets paid for not doing \ntheir job. So why should we?\n  Just a few months ago we passed a bipartisan 2-year budget agreement \nthat moved us away from the harmful sequester. Now many of my \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page H1136]]\n\non the other side of the aisle are threatening to go back on that \nagreement and keep us from having a budget at all. That is what \ngridlock looks like, and that is what people hate about Congress.\n  What are we going to do to fix it? Come in to work 10 days in the \nentire month of March. Maybe if we came to work, we could debate and \npass a budget and spending bills that will spur economic growth and \ncreate high-quality jobs.\n  But, instead, we have 2 months on the calendar this year where we \ndon't come to work at all, even once. A 5-day workweek is expected from \nmost Americans. Why should Congress be any different?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/house-section/article/H1136-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  (Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate March as Women's \nHistory Month. As this month is also Red Cross Month, I want to \nrecognize one woman in particular: Clara Barton.\n  Ms. Barton was a nurse during the Civil War and a teacher before \nfounding the American Red Cross in 1881. She then served as the \norganization's first president. Her compassion and accomplishments are \ntruly inspiring, and her work has literally helped millions.\n  Unfortunately, in our society today, women make up less than 5 \npercent of CEOs and are equally underrepresented in other areas. As a \nfather of two daughters, ensuring that young women can achieve anything \nthat they set their mind to is personal for me.\n  In the 10th Congressional District, we run a Young Women's Leadership \nAcademy. This program is designed to help young women develop the \nleadership skills necessary to overcome any and all challenges thrown \ntheir way.\n  This unique program gives young women the opportunity to learn from \nother inspiring female leaders, such as our own colleague, \nCongresswoman Elise Stefanik, the youngest woman ever elected to the \nUnited States Congress.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to start similar programs in their \ndistrict so that we can all do our part to help inspire young women to \nbecome leaders in their chosen fields.\n  Of course, this is just a small part of the solution. As we celebrate \nthe inspiring achievements of women this month, we must rededicate \nourselves to doing more to tear down barriers and ensure gender \nequality in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/house-section/article/H1136-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING EDWARD CHOW, JR.\n\n  (Ms. DUCKWORTH asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. DUCKWORTH.

Out of uniform, Ed has continued serving his fellow \nAmericans, dedicating his life to supporting fellow vets.\n  Ed's illustrious public service career culminated in leading the \nState of Maryland's Department of Veterans Affairs.

From Bullfeathers to AOL, \nfrom his home above the Potomac to the orphanages in Vietnam, from the \nKennedy Center to the International Commission on Missing Persons, Jim \nKimsey has been a transformational leader.\n  Despite his too-short life, Jim's resume is long and deep: founder \nand CEO of AOL, chairman of Refugees International, Library of Congress \nTrust Fund Board, Executive Committee of the National Symphony \nOrchestra, Kennedy Center Board of Trustees, West Point Board of \nVisitors, an Army tour in the Dominican Republic and two in Vietnam, \nthe Army Ranger Hall of Fame, and so much more.\n  But for Jim's myriad of friends, he was so much more than a list of \nachievements.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Rothfus).\n\n\n                           Planned Parenthood\n\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, this week, the House Select Investigative Panel on \nInfant Lives began hearings to look into Planned Parenthood's \nharvesting and trafficking of human body parts, which was revealed in a \nseries of undercover videos last year. These were videos that even \nDemocrat Presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, in her words, \n``obviously found disturbing.''\n  Since the release of the videos last year, some have rushed to defend \nthe organization, and Planned Parenthood and its allies have been in \nfull damage control mode. Among the more bizarre defenses has been that \nthe videos were heavily edited, as if the statements made by Planned \nParenthood officials and a worker who harvested body parts really \naren't what they appear to be.\n  I do not serve on this select committee, but if I did, I would really \nwant to take a hard look at that defense. The term ``heavily edited'' \nsuggests that important, qualifying context may have been omitted in \nthese videos;\n\n[[Page H1137]]\n\nbut I struggle, Mr. Speaker, with trying to understand any context that \nwould soften the language in these tapes.\n  For example, in what context is this okay?\n  ``We have been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we \nknow that, so I am not going to crush that part.''\n  What about: ``A lot of people want intact hearts these days,'' or \n``always as many intact livers as possible''?\n  Do the defenders of Planned Parenthood think that they are talking \nabout chicken hearts or livers at a butcher shop as opposed to baby \nbody parts?\n  Just in what context does this sound right?\n  ``Yesterday was the first time she said people wanted lungs.''\n  How about: ``Some people want lower extremities, too''--that would be \nlegs. ``I don't know what they're doing with it. I guess they want the \nmuscle''?\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, what is the situation in which these statements \nwould not shock a sensitive conscience?\n  What about this line? When is this an acceptable statement?\n  ``Using a `less crunchy' technique to get more whole specimens.''\n  In that phrase, the context is you have a Planned Parenthood official \nwho is talking about a ``less crunchy'' type of abortion, which begs \nthe obvious question: What does that even mean?\n  Can anyone who defends Planned Parenthood give me the context in \nwhich this sounds good?\n  ``I know I've seen livers; I've seen stomachs; I've seen plenty of \nneural tissue. Usually you can see the whole brain, usually, come \nout.''\n  What about: ``I don't think it would be as war torn'' when discussing \nwhat fetal remains look like during a second trimester abortion? What \nwould that sentence sound like in an unedited video?\n  At one point in a video, a clinic worker brings in another fetal \nbody, saying, ``And another boy.'' A boy. In another context, you might \nhear ``and another boy'' if a mom is giving birth to twin sons, but \nthat is obviously not the context of these videos.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, can someone please tell me the context in which \nthis dialogue does not mean what it says?\n  ``This is a really good fetus, and it looks like we can procure a lot \nfrom it . . . we're going to procure brain.'' Further: ``So she gave me \nthe scissors and she told me I have to cut down the middle of the face; \nand I can't even, like, describe, like, what that feels like. And I \nremember picking it up and finishing going through the rest of the face \nand just picking up the brain and putting it in a container . . . and \nI'm just sitting there, like, what did I just do?''\n  What is the context in which these words might not be what they seem?\n  I can think of one: perhaps if you had a screenwriter who was talking \nabout a new horror film she was writing.\n  But this is no horror film, Mr. Speaker. These words are direct \nquotes from a technician who is engaged in a real-world practice that \nis appalling, barbaric, and indefensible--the harvesting of fetal body \nparts for money.\n  It is not easy to come to the floor of the House to speak these \nwords. I would prefer not to. It is uncomfortable to listen to these \nwords, and many people would prefer not to hear them. If that is the \ncase, Mr. Speaker--if I don't like talking about this and if people \ndon't like hearing about it--why, for goodness sake, are we allowing \nhard-working taxpayers' dollars to go to the organization that is \nresponsible for them?\n  We are a better nation than what is revealed in these videos. There \nare 13,000 other health clinics that are capable of providing health \ncare for women, clinics which do not perform abortions. It is past time \nthat the $500 million in Federal dollars that Planned Parenthood \nreceives every year be redirected to those clinics.\n  I thank the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                      When Weakness is Provocative\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT. I thank Mr. Rothfus, my friend from Pennsylvania. He is \nexactly right. We have so many people across this Nation who understand \nthe tragedy of taking a child's life before it is fully born.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know there are some people, like our friend Donald \nTrump, who say Planned Parenthood has done a lot more good; but the \ntrouble is, so often, Planned Parenthood takes money from the Federal \nGovernment and then just refers the women out. Of course, that has been \nperpetuated by this administration in its making it sound like Planned \nParenthood does mammograms and other things that they don't do. They \nrefer people to other people.\n  Why not have that money not get held up at Planned Parenthood? Why \nnot have that money go directly to the thousands of healthcare \nproviders that actually provide the care that the women are seeking and \nnot have it go to Planned Parenthood so that they can get money from \nthe government and then keep their abortion business going?\n  That also leads right into this article today from the National \nReview, Jim Geraghty, regarding ObamaCare. Headline: ``Deductibles \nIncreased in 41 States under ObamaCare.''\n  It reads:\n\n       Freedom Partners unveils a new `Deductibles Tracker' \n     showing how much deductibles have increased, on average, in \n     each State. I know this will shock you, but most people are \n     finding their deductibles are going up and, in some cases, \n     way up.\n       Their analysis shows deductibles have increased in 41 \n     States under ObamaCare--in some States, like Mississippi, by \n     over $1,000. Seventeen States, representing over half of \n     total exchange enrollment, are seeing double-digit spikes. \n     The largest increases were in Mississippi, which went up 39 \n     percent; Washington State went up 31 percent; South Carolina \n     went up 26 percent; Louisiana went up 24 percent; Florida \n     went up 23 percent; Minnesota and Vermont went up 22 \n     percent; Arizona went up 21 percent; North Carolina went \n     up 20 percent.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, what makes it so incredibly difficult is knowing there \nare Federal dollars that are being used for abortion and being used for \npurposes that are against the religious beliefs of so many Americans. \nWhen we think that the whole object we were told for having ObamaCare \nand passing it against the will of the majority of the American people \nwas so that we could make sure everybody had insurance, now it appears \nthat there has not been much change in the net number of people covered \nunder insurance.\n  Oh, yes, it is true. There are some people who were paying for their \ninsurance who no longer have it--they can't afford it anymore. It is \ntrue that we have some people who were not paying for it who are having \nit provided now, but it really appears to have been more a transfer of \nworking people's money to people who were not working.\n  It appears that we have been moving into a socialist agenda for some \ntime, and that goes back to what President Obama said when he first \nran, telling ``Joe the Plumber'' that he wanted it to be about \nspreading the wealth around. The pilgrims found out that, at least in \nthis world, if you try to share and share alike--the Early New \nTestament tried it, and it didn't work--and if you start allowing \npeople who are not working to have the same benefits as those who work, \nyou will have more and more people who are not working.\n  I hear from so many of my constituents--I know I hear from others of \nmy friends here in Congress--that constituents are hurting. Their \ninsurance is costing more, and like this article points out, the \ndeductibles have gone higher. Ask one of my staff, who is not making \nvery much.\n  If you make $30,000 and if you have a deductible of $6,000 as a \nhealthy young person, what that basically means is that every dime you \nare paying into health care is not going to help your health care \nwhatsoever. You are paying for the new IRS agents, the new navigators, \nand the new government union workers who will never spray Bactine on \nanybody's cut, who will never put a Band-Aid on. They will just keep \nadding forms, adding requirements, taking more time away from the true \nhealthcare providers and more money away from the true healthcare \nproviders for bureaucrats.\n  I know, back when I was an exchange student in the Soviet Union and \nwhen I went and toured some of the most up-to-date facilities in what \nwas the Soviet Union at the time, I thanked God that I lived in \nAmerica. I thanked God that we had such incredible health care and that \nI didn't have to rely on what appeared to have been 30- or 40-year-old \nantiquated healthcare methods and equipment for my health care.\n  Even living in the small town of Mount Pleasant, as I did, I knew we\n\n[[Page H1138]]\n\nhad a lot better healthcare facilities in my hometown where I was \ngrowing up than they did in one of the largest cities--well, the \nlargest city in Ukraine--Kiev, where I toured facilities. I toured a \nmedical school and I couldn't believe how far behind our medical \nschools that they were.\n  It is what happens when you continue moving towards socialized health \ncare. I know Mr. Trump, initially, wanted the government to provide \neverybody's health care, but apparently in his being informed that \nconservatives don't like that, he is now saying no, that that is not \nwhere he is going.\n  We know that President Obama, back before he was President, was \ncaught on video saying that we want to go to single payer--in other \nwords, socialized medicine--where the government is in charge of \neverybody's health care.\n  I know I have got conservative friends who say, Louie, we don't have \nto worry. We don't have to fight ObamaCare, because socialized medicine \nalways fails. They are wrong. Socialism always fails. As Margaret \nThatcher said, eventually, you run out of other people's money.\n  You incentivize not working and penalize working, and that is what we \nare doing here in America now. We are moving in that direction, toward \nsocialism. The only time true capitalism, true free liberty, \nentrepreneurism in the marketplace fails is when it starts moving into \nsocialist tendencies and adopting socialist ways. Then that can spell \ndoom for capitalism, those who want to have a dictatorial Federal \nnational government. That is where they want to see things go.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  But it is ironic that when a free market society struggles, it is \nwhen they start incorporating socialist tendencies and rewarding \nimproper conduct or nonworking. Then you have a lot more people not \nworking.\n  You incentivize people not to hire. You penalize people for hiring. \nYou penalize people for hiring more than 50 people, like ObamaCare \ndoes.\n  I have talked to people that still say that they could hire more, but \nthey are not going to because of ObamaCare.\n  That means there are people walking around today going from business \nto business, looking for a job that will not find that business that \nwill hire them because of ObamaCare.\n  When you have young people with \n5-, 6-, $7,000 deductible health insurance, they are paying for the \nbureaucracy. They are not paying for health care.\n  Apparently, some religious beliefs dictate against birth control. \nMine doesn't, my Christian beliefs. But I absolutely respect the \nreligious beliefs of those who are against it. They should not have to \npay for people to violate their religious beliefs.\n  That used to be the way this country grew and was blessed by God. But \nas we turn further and further away from what was a blessing to \nAmerica, then the world hurts. I have seen it in Africa, the Middle \nEast, Asia, South America.\n  When we are not strong--as I have said numerous times, quoting a \nSouth African gentleman: When you get weak, we suffer. Please tell \npeople in Washington to quit getting weaker. We suffer when you are \nweaker.\n  These kind of programs, ObamaCare, make us weaker. When we provide \nthe resources, the ability for the largest supporter of terrorism in \nthe world to have over $100 billion, which they say some of it is for \nsure going to be spent on more terrorism, that is the kind of activity \nthat will not be blessed. That is the kind of activity that brings a \nnation's demise.\n  So health care is costing more. Deductibles are going up. People are \npaying more for higher deductibles, less coverage. Yes. There are some \nwho, because of the government subsidies, are saying: Well, mine's a \nlittle less than it was before. But the people that are working are \npaying more, and it is devastating.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is critical that those of us who have a voice in this \ncity make our voices heard for those in our districts. You can't be \nlistening to the talking heads in this town and think you have heard \nfrom America.\n  I mean, look at Politico. Last week they said I had a close race. \nTuesday, with one opponent spending tremendously more than I did, two \nopponents, I won with 82 percent. So that is what Politico calls a \nclose race.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know that I didn't win with 82 percent because of my \nlooks and certainly not because of the way I sound.\n  It is because I make my voice heard for the huge majority of people \nin east Texas with all the common sense they have got. That is what I \nam hearing from them.\n  They are outraged that we have allowed ObamaCare to last as long as \nit has. They are suffering. They are outraged that this administration \nhas turned on our friend, Israel, and seeing that Iran is rewarded for \ntheir massive misconduct, as they have continued to be the largest \nsupporter of terrorism in the world, with this administration as an \naccomplice, as an enabler. There are consequences to nations and \ngovernments that enable crime and misconduct and terrorism and abuse.\n  For those who believe in the Bible, it was Hosea. God was explaining \nwhy he was about to come down on the children of Israel. I love the \nrather loose translation when he says that it is because they have \nselected leaders who were not my choice.\n  So people around the country can say all they want: Well, this \nPresident is not my President. This Governor is not my Governor. This \nperson is not my elected representative.\n  I don't agree with them. But everyone in the country will suffer the \nconsequences of poor choices as leaders. That is the way self-\ngovernment works.\n  Now, I have been reporting, Mr. Speaker, from this very podium for \nyears about the misuse and abuse and providing our security by Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I am very grateful to Judicial Watch. In their lawsuit against \nHomeland Security, they have been able to obtain records that verify \nwhat some of us have known to be true because of whistleblowers \nproviding us information. While some, whether CNN and other places, \nbelittle what we have said, we knew what we were talking about, but we \ncouldn't give the sources.\n  Judicial Watch. This headline says: ``Homeland Security Records \nReveal Officials Ordered Terrorist Watch List Scrubbed.''\n  It says: ``Judicial Watch announced today that it obtained 183 pages \nof documents from the Department of Homeland Security revealing that \nthe Obama administration scrubbed the law enforcement agency's \n`Terrorist Screening Database' in order to protect what it considered \nthe civil rights of suspected Islamic terrorist groups. The documents \nappear to confirm charges that Obama administration changes created a \nmassive `hands off' list. Removed data from the terrorist watch list \ncould have helped prevent the San Bernardino terrorist attack.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I would also submit that we have seen the email--I \nbelieve Senator Grassley requested more information about it.\n  To my knowledge, we have not seen additional explanations or \ninformation about the email about a person's terrorist ties, indication \nthat he was a radical Islamist. The email response was: Oh, this guy's \non the Secretary of Homeland Security's hands-off list.\n  We have read stories about the White House allowing at least one or \nmore individuals with terrorist ties to come to the White House. There \nare consequences for ignoring the law, ignoring the lawbreakers, and \nnot protecting our homeland.\n  The article says:\n  ``The new documents were produced in response to a Judicial Watch \nFebruary 2015 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed back on \nFebruary 13, 2015.''\n  It should be noted, I mean, that that is over a year ago. The Freedom \nof Information Act request should have been answered promptly, but this \nadministration is too caught up in trying to cover up their own tracks.\n  That is why we haven't even gotten the Attorney General to provide \nMembers of Congress the documents showing support for terrorism, the \nboxes of documents that were provided to people who were convicted of \nsupporting terrorism.\n  The Justice Department provided it to them. I have asked repeatedly, \nand the most I have gotten is reference to a few Web sites.\n  They covered up their own wrongdoing. They have covered up ties to \nterrorism. They have covered up for\n\n[[Page H1139]]\n\npeople who have supported terrorism. And there are consequences for \nthat. You learn more when you leave this town, Washington, D.C.\n  But when you have people in Africa, Egypt, Jordan, UAE, India, and \nAfghanistan telling you that your administration in America is \nsupporting violence by not standing up against radical Islam and when \nyou hear that from Muslim leaders who recognize the failures of \nthis administration, then you know that the whole world is seeing what \nis going on and it is only here that people have become so blind.\n\n  I know there are people in the Republican establishment that just \ncannot believe that a man like Trump, who has spent his whole life \ntaking one position, could be leading so big in different contests.\n  And, yes, my friend Ted Cruz is doing quite well. It is nice to see \nsomebody that has been consistently doing well. But around the world \nthey see what is going on.\n  The Republican establishment doesn't seem to understand. People are \nfurious. They are furious about ObamaCare. They are furious that we \nturned on our friend, Israel. They are furious that we have enabled \nIran to continue their terrorist ways.\n  All of this at the same time--of course, this was--Donald Trump's big \nissue that shot him to the top is border security.\n  This article from today from KRWG News, ``Border Crime Taking A Toll \nOn Residents In Southwest New Mexico, Arizona,'' says: ``Residents of \nNew Mexico's Bootheel and parts of southern Arizona say human smuggling \nand drug trafficking is taking its toll on the region.\n  ``The Deming Headlight reports that residents are scheduled Thursday \nto express their concerns to Federal officials during a meeting at the \nAnimas Community Center in Animas, New Mexico.\n  ``Judy Keeler, a longtime resident of the rural border region, says \nher home was recently burglarized and it's not an unusual episode for \nother residents.\n  ``Residents have said State Highway 80 has become a favorite for \nMexican cartel drug runners who manage to navigate out of the \nPeloncillo Mountains along the Arizona-New Mexico border. They want an \neven more increased presence from the U.S. Border Patrol.''\n  Apparently, they are not going to get it.\n  We still hear people say there is no way to secure our entire border, \nbut this brings back a recollection in history.\n  One of my least favorite Presidents, Woodrow Wilson, secured the \nborder after Pancho Villa had some of his thugs come across the border \nand kill American families. Americans back then with good sense said: \nWe can't have that.\n  They spurred the President on until he sent tens of thousands of what \nwe call National Guard troops now, and they secured the border. Nobody \ncame across our border that we did not want to come across. He did it \nback in the early 1900s, and we can't do it now.\n  Well, the truth is, Mr. Speaker, we could do it now, but you have to \nhave an administration with the will to provide for the common defense \nof the American people.\n  Instead, we have enabled a massive amount of crime across the border \nregions that is spilling into other areas of the country. Drugs are \nspreading around the country.\n  We have heard, also, from the FBI Director himself. There are ISIS \ncells, and there are ISIS investigations in every State in the Union. \nSo when are they going to be triggered?\n  We know that, when they are triggered with reports like we have just \nread here, the administration has continued to cleanse our Homeland \nSecurity records to purge training material for the FBI, for \nIntelligence, for Homeland Security so they don't actually learn \nexactly what radical Islam is. They don't actually learn the verses in \nthe Koran that are relied upon by radical Islamists.\n  When we do finally have a Muslim leader like President Sissi in \nEgypt, who stands up in front of a room of Muslim imams and demands \nthat they take back their region from the radical Islamists, this \nadministration chooses to try to punish him and not help him, like this \nadministration did, and wanted to do more for the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  I am tired of hearing from foreign Muslim leaders their question: Why \nis your country still helping the Muslim Brotherhood? Don't they know? \nDon't you know? The Muslim Brotherhood has been at war with you since \n1979, and you keep helping them.\n  Well, that is the way you lose a country. You lose it. We have got \nour choice. Fiscal irresponsibility, which is immoral. Instead of doing \nlike all preceding generations in this country, which have always had \nas their theme, ``we want to make our country better for our children \nthan we had it,'' now we have gone through a couple of generations who \nhave said: You know what? Forget the future generations. We want future \ngenerations' money spent on us now.\n  Fifty years ago, seventy-five years ago, one hundred years ago, even \nwhen cars were first invented, you would not have seen a bumper sticker \nlike is not uncommon today, retired persons say, ``We are spending our \nchildren's inheritance.'' You wouldn't see that because they wanted to \nmake the country better than they had it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know you personally, and you and I and our colleagues, \nwe talk about it. We have talked about it today--heated conference--\nbecause we want a better country even than we have had with more \nopportunity, more freedoms, as we see freedom slipping away.\n  Adam Kredo has a story here:\n  ``The flow of illegal immigrant children into the United States is \nexpected to rise to record-breaking numbers in 2016 as deportations \ndecrease, according to leading members of the Senate's Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  ``At least 20,455 unaccompanied minors have been caught during fiscal \nyear 2016 along the U.S.-Mexico border as of last month, according to \nCommittee Chairman Senator Chuck Grassley, who warned that if this \ntrend continues, the number of illegal minors could eclipse a massive \n2014 surge that strained the resources of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and prompted investigations into the Obama administration's \nhandling of the issue.''\n  Now, one of many problems is you have people that are coming to \nAmerica because there are more opportunities here, which begs the \nquestion: Why are there more opportunities here than there are in their \nhome country?\n  When you analyze the situation, what you find is the reason they \ndon't have businesses booming in their home country is because of graft \nor corruption or a corrupt government or a dictatorship because, as the \nold saying goes, ``capital is a coward.''\n  Money to capitalize or invest always goes to where it feels safest--\nthat is why it is ``capital is a coward''--and it is not very safe in \ncountries where the government is corrupt, the rule of law is not \napplied across the board, and the laws are not enforced across the \nboard.\n  One of the great ironies in the world right now is that people are \nleaving countries where there is violence and the rule of law is not \nenforced. They are coming to America where, for most of our history, we \nhave done a better job than most any country ever in enforcing the law \nacross the board.\n  Once here illegally, those same people are saying: Now that we are \nhere, we want you not to enforce the law across the board. We want you \nto ignore your law on immigration and law on becoming citizens. Ignore \nit.\n  If we do that, it will make us like the corrupt countries they came \nfrom and make us a land of no opportunity, where people will have to go \nto some other country where they enforce the law.\n  I have had even Members of Congress say: Well, if it all goes bad, we \nwill all pack up and head to Australia. But I was talking to some \npeople from Australia this year, and I mentioned that to them, and they \ndidn't laugh. They looked very somber.\n  They said: You know, if something happens to the United States, you \nare not going to be coming to Australia, because China will take us \nover like that. If the United States is not standing strong, they said, \nour country, Australia, will be gone. China would grab us up in a \nheartbeat.\n  It is important that America stand strong. You can't stand strong \nwhen\n\n[[Page H1140]]\n\nyou are financially bankrupt. You can't stand strong when you are \nmorally bankrupt. We seem to have our choice of ways we could meet our \ndemise.\n  Our military is being degraded under this administration, the Navy \ngoing back to its size back in--was it?--the early 1900s before World \nWar I. Weakness is provocative. I haven't heard anybody else notice. \nMaybe there is no correlation; maybe there is.\n  It seems historically, from my study of history, that when a nation's \nenemy sees that nation's biggest friend pulling away and not being as \ngood a friend, then that enemy is provoked to attack. But it was in May \nof 2010 when this administration sided with Israel's enemies in \ndemanding that Israel disclose all their weapons systems, including any \npotential nukes. I was shocked by that. The United States had never \nsided with all of Israel's enemies like that before.\n  I thought about the Bible story of King Hezekiah when the Babylonian \nleaders had come to visit and schmoozed with him, and Isaiah asked him: \nWhat have you done with the Babylonian leaders? Of course, this is a \nTexas paraphrased version, but he bragged about: I have taken them and \nshown them all of our treasure. The most literal translation from the \nHebrew says: And I showed them all the defenses we have in our arsenal, \nour armory.\n  Isaiah explained: You are going to lose the country.\n  You don't show your enemy--you don't even show your friends--all of \nyour defenses, and yet we were demanding that of Israel. Within 48 \nhours, Israel's enemies launched a flotilla to go challenge the lawful \nblockade of the Gaza Strip. All that Israel was doing was trying to \nprevent more rockets from going in because the rockets were being \nlaunched at them every day--totally legal. They were trying to defend \nthemselves against rocket attacks and created a terrible situation at \nthe blockade.\n  But as America continues to help fund Iran's desire to support \nterrorism, and as this administration has turned its back on nations \nlike Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, I hear from leaders in those countries \nwhere they say: You know, all we wanted was a little help against our \nenemy.\n  Of course, in Nigeria, having been there and having met with so many \nof the parents of girls who were kidnapped by Boko Haram, radical \nIslamists, we then hear that our administration here says: Oh, yeah, we \nwill give you some help, but you have got to change your religious \nbeliefs. You have got to change your laws so it supports same-sex \nmarriage and you fund abortion, and then we will give you more help.\n  The President in Kenya basically said at a news conference, in \neffect: You take care of your country. You are not going to come tell \nus what our religious beliefs and laws should be.\n  As a Nigerian Catholic bishop stated: Our religious beliefs are not \nfor sale--not to President Obama, not to anybody.\n  But there are consequences in world history when one nation tries to \ndestroy the religious beliefs of another country--their closely, firmly \nheld religious beliefs. There are consequences when a nation forgets to \nsay: Thank You, God, for all of our blessings. Thank You, God, for \nprotecting us. Thank You for allowing us to live in the greatest \ncountry, a country in which there is more opportunity, more assets per \nperson than anywhere in the world.\n\n  This is the one country where the number one health problem for our \nNation's poor is obesity. It is a terrible problem that we need to deal \nwith. But where in history do you have a country where the nation's \npoor have, as their number one health problem, obesity?\n  This Nation has been blessed beyond anything that people could have \never dreamed when this Nation was founded. But the Founders did see one \nthing. They saw the threat of giving more and more power to a Federal \nGovernment.\n  I was fortunate to call Justice Scalia a friend. A group of seniors \nfrom my hometown of Tyler, Texas, from my church, Green Acres Baptist, \ncame up to Washington, D.C. They said: Hey, you are supposed to be \nfriends with Justice Scalia. We would love to meet him. That is one \nthing we really want to do in Washington.\n  So I called over, and Justice Scalia, bless his heart, he said: Sure, \ncome on over.\n  So they arranged it. We had the meeting. He walks in. They are all \nseated there, the seniors from my church, and Justice Scalia could be \nvery talkative. I treasure meals with him, exchanging jokes and \nstories. It made you feel good about the world. He walks in and leans \nup against the table at the front: So, you want to meet me. What is \nyour question? What questions have you got?\n  It kind of took them by surprise. One said: Do you think we are the \nfreest Nation in history because of our Bill of Rights?\n  Justice Scalia, in his inimitable style, said: Oh, gosh, no. No. The \nSoviet Union had a better Bill of Rights than we did.\n  I had forgotten. I made an A on a paper in college that I did about \nthe Bill of Rights and the Constitution of the Soviet Union. Yeah, they \nwere promised all kinds of rights, but the government was given the \npower to erode all of the rights that were said to be protected.\n  He said: No. The reason that we are the freest country in history is \nbecause our Founders did not trust government, and so they wanted to \nmake it as hard as possible to pass laws. See, the Founders thought \nthat gridlock was a blessing, gridlock was a great thing, because it \nmeant that, as people anticipated passing laws, it would be tough \nbecause many laws regulate what you can and can't do.\n  The more laws you pass, just as this administration has shown the \nAmerican people, as it has set all-time records for the most pages of \nregulations--there are over 79,000 new pages of regulations every year. \nHow can anybody make a living with that kind of regulation coming out \nyear after year, certainly for the last 7? Incredible.\n  The Founders knew that. They wanted to make it hard for any \ngovernmental agency, any government bureaucracy to create laws that \ntook away freedom because they had some libertarian tendencies.\n  Justice Scalia, said: So they wanted it hard to pass laws, so what do \nthey do? They create a legislature with two Houses, and certainly that \nwas part of the compromise. But in England, the House of Lords is not \nparticularly powerful, but they wanted both houses with the power to \nstop what the other one was doing. They wanted it very difficult in one \nhouse to pass a law.\n  I think they would cringe if they saw all the bills that are just \npassed with unanimous consent or on suspension that we do more and more \nand more, because they wanted it tough to pass laws.\n  I have friends say: You guys should be in session more often.\n  I say: You don't know what you are asking for, because every day we \nare in session, we pass some new bill, we pass some new law.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Many of those laws take away freedoms of Americans. The Founders knew \nthat. That is why, Justice Scalia said, they created two Houses. If one \nHouse got a law through it, the other one could stop it cold. But that \nwasn't enough to protect our freedom.\n  We want an executive, but not one like a prime minister. The prime \nminister is elected by the legislature. We don't want that. We want it \ntough.\n  We want independence. So we are going to have a chief executive, a \nPresident, that is elected totally separate from the legislature.\n  Even if the House and Senate finally agree on something, we will give \nhim the power to just say: No. I am not going to let it happen.\n  But that is not enough. We want more gridlock. So let's create a \njudicial branch, as they did in Article III, that could turn around and \nsay: No. The House, Senate, and the President may have agreed, but we \ndon't agree.\n  It is not consistent with the Constitution. Justice Scalia said that \nis why we are the freest Nation in history: because our Founders did \nnot trust government.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, it concerns me when I see voters begin to think that \nour hope is going to arrive on Air Force One. One of my greatest \nthrills was becoming friends with Chuck Colson.\n  As Chuck Colson said: Our hope will not arrive on Air Force One.\n\n[[Page H1141]]\n\n  The old saying, the axiom, is true: democracy ensures a people are \ngoverned no better than they deserve.\n  If you want a good President, you have got to be a good country. An \nimmoral country is not going to elect a great leader. They are going to \nelect an immoral leader.\n  When you see Christians who believe that the only way to the saving \ngrace of Jesus is to ask for forgiveness and, as the Bible says, \nbelieve in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved, it is amazing \nto see Christian leaders saying they are going to put their faith in a \nguy that says he has never had to ask for forgiveness. But that was \nmodified later to: Well, I don't think God's concerned with trivial \nthings like that.\n  If I were God, I wouldn't be. But thank God I am not God. He seems to \ncare about every individual. If you believe the Bible, that is what it \nsays.\n  And then, if there is not enough bad news, this comes from KPNX \ntoday: ``Attorney General Report: Possible smuggling trail between the \nMiddle East and Arizona border.''\n  We have talked about that before. Long before, the Attorney General \nindicated that there appeared to be a trail between the Middle East and \nthe Arizona border.\n  We have this story this week from Stephen Dinan from The Washington \nTimes: ``Top border chief to agents who object to Obama amnesty: `Look \nfor another job.' ''\n  There you are, Mr. Speaker. When the head of the border agency says \nthey are not going to enforce the laws that exist, then one of two \nthings, either that is what the country deserves because it has become \nimmoral and lawless or the country rises up and says: We will never \nhave another administration like this. As long as we are alive, we are \ngoing to make sure we have an administration that enforces the law, no \nmatter who it is.\n  Apparently, since people govern no better than they deserve, we now \nfind out that Hillary's highly paid IT guru at the State Department had \nno actual national security experience.\n  So, apparently, we elected an administration that ensured people were \ngoverned no better than they deserve and, apparently, they felt like we \ndidn't deserve a State Department with national security experience.\n  Is it any wonder--I thank God--that there have been more Benghazis \nunder that kind of attitude? One was too many.\n  We see yesterday that the Justice Department grants immunity to the \nstaffer who set up the Clinton email server. I have been a prosecutor. \nI have been a judge. I have been a chief justice. When someone grants \nimmunity, they are closing in on a prosecution. That is the intent.\n  You don't grant immunity to someone and someone doesn't normally seek \nimmunity unless they are concerned that they may have violated the law. \nThey seek immunity because they violated the law.\n  Immunity is granted when, with the prosecution, the investigators--in \nthis case, the FBI--feel that laws are being violated. So we are going \nto grant immunity to this person so that we can get the person further \nup.\n  But I still maintain that, as long as Hillary Clinton does not \ncondemn or expose the Obama administration to any of the truth about \nwhat went on in Benghazi and about the hands-off list of terrorists and \nhomeland security, I do not see her getting indicted. It is a good \ninsurance policy.\n  Another article from the New York Times: ``As Campaign Unfolds, So Do \nInquiries Into Hillary Clinton's Emails.''\n  So many voters don't seem to care. Why? Because people are governed \nno better than they deserve. If they are more concerned about \nthemselves than their children, they are going to get what they \ndeserve.\n  Well, we had Mitt Romney come out today just before we voted \ncondemning Donald Trump as phony and a fraud. Everybody knows that \npeople across this country are furious with the establishment.\n  So if that idea was Donald Trump's--to get Mitt Romney to come out \nand condemn him--it was a brilliant plan. Because that is like asking \nMarv Levy to tell you how to win the Super Bowl, after he lost four of \nthem.\n  In any event, Mr. Speaker, this country is in grave danger. I was all \nover the 12 counties that I represent. This country has so many great \ncitizens. They deserve better than what they are getting.\n  I hope and pray the majority in the country will wake up and see the \ndangers to our own national defense, to our own national security, from \ngovernment intrusions into our private lives, from drugs that are \ncoming in through Mexico, and from terrorists that are coming into this \ncountry. The FBI Director himself says we have got them in every State.\n  We are in big trouble. It is time the American people woke up and \nsaid, as our parents did: We don't care what has happened before. We \nare going to make sure this country is left in better shape, with more \nopportunity, than we had growing up.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are going to have to hurry. The clock is ticking.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/house-section/article/H1141-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n APPOINTMENT OF MEMBERS AS CONGRESSIONAL ADVISORS ON TRADE POLICY AND \n                              NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
