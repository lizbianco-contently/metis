The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, my State of West Virginia \nis experiencing a crisis. West Virginia is leading the country in a \nrather grim category: drug overdoses. This issue goes beyond party \nlines, and it is ripping our State apart.\n  President Obama is bringing national attention to our drug crisis by \ncoming to my district this afternoon to discuss the prescription drug \nand heroin epidemic.\n  The statistics are disturbing. Overdoses in West Virginia increased \nby 134 percent between 2012 and 2013, which accounts for about 34 drug \noverdose deaths per 100,000 West Virginia residents. This overdose rate \nis more than double the national average.\n  There is no magical solution to this epidemic. We need local, State, \nand Federal officials to work together to effectively fight back. One \nof the ways that we can do this is to have the Federal Government \nsupport the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program, also known \nas HIDTA. The HIDTA program provides needed funds to law enforcement to \ncombat drug trafficking while also helping local treatment and \nprevention efforts.\n  I have been hosting roundtable discussions across my district to hear \ndirectly from communities that are affected by the drug epidemic. I \nrecently held one of these discussions in the town of Romney, West \nVirginia, in September, to talk about the ongoing issues they face in \nthat community.\n  Officials at the meeting agreed that we need to utilize all resources \navailable at the local, State, and Federal levels, and we agreed that \nHIDTA was a key tool in fighting back. It was also pointed out that \nfoster parents are needed to help care for children whose parents are \nstruggling with drug addiction issues.\n  So you can help, too.\n  But addressing drug trafficking is not the only thing that needs to \nbe done to help fight the epidemic. We need to help the youngest \nvictims of our shared battle with this crisis: infants who are born \naddicted.\n  That is why I cosponsored and voted for H.R. 1462, the Protecting Our \nInfants Act of 2015, which passed the House unanimously and is awaiting \naction in the U.S. Senate. This bill addresses a condition called \nneonatal abstinence syndrome by helping to find the best way to \ndiagnose, evaluate, and coordinate Federal efforts to help research and \nrespond to this debilitating condition. Infants who suffer from \nneonatal abstinence syndrome can experience seizures, respiratory \nimpairments, tremors, fever, and difficulty feeding.\n  Research published by the Journal of Perinatology found that the \nnumber of infants suffering from withdrawal grew nearly fivefold from \n2000 to 2012. Evidence also shows that an infant is born with drug \nwithdrawal every 25 minutes in the United States.\n  In West Virginia, it is estimated that, in 1 out of every 13 births, \na baby is addicted to drugs. This is a problem that needs serious \nattention immediately, but this is just one crucial step.\n  To help fight addiction, one of the latest tools available to the \npublic in West Virginia is a new 24-hour call line that has been \nlaunched to help people battling substance and mental health issues in \nWest Virginia.\n  The call line is 1-844-HELP4WV. The line is open 24 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week, with the promise of never being put on hold. We must \ncontinue to work together to fight this epidemic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7031-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7031-H7032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGALIZING MARIJUANA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, advocates from the new emerging \nmarijuana industry in Oregon are descending on Capitol Hill at a very \ncritical time for this fledgling industry.\n  They have a report about the implementation of Oregon's Ballot \nMeasure 91--overwhelmingly approved by voters last year--to legalize, \ntax, and regulate marijuana at the State level. Possession became legal \nJuly 1. Retail sales were authorized in existing dispensaries on the \n1st of October to significant interest around the State.\n\n[[Page H7032]]\n\nThe first week saw an estimated $11 million in sales.\n  They are working hard to implement the spirit and the letter of the \nmeasure, working closely with the Oregon legislature to refine it, \nlearning from the experience of States like Washington and Colorado \nthat have already legalized adult use.\n  Theirs is a positive story of economic opportunity, product \ndevelopment, tax revenues, more freedom for individuals, and \neliminating the racial disparities in the enforcement of a failed \npolicy of prohibition that comes down heavily against young men of \ncolor, especially African Americans.\n  At the same time, there was a scathing report this week from \nBrookings Institution researchers John Hudak and Grace Wallack that \ncalled out the roadblocks that are being put in place by law \nenforcement and Federal policies that stifle medical marijuana \nresearch, that interfere with the science and the doctor-patient \nrelationship in ways that are completely unwarranted, \ncounterproductive, and destructive.\n  They come at a time when the Federal Government has told the Drug \nEnforcement Agency to stop harassing medical providers after Congress \nclearly passed legislation to protect the industry and, more \nimportantly, a patient's right to medicine.\n  The Rohrabacher-Farr amendment passed with strong bipartisan support, \nclearly specifying that the Federal Government should not interfere \nwith State-legal medical marijuana operations.\n  The Department of Justice, unfortunately, took an outrageously flawed \nposition, which infuriated those of us who authored these provisions \nand have worked to pass them over the last 2 years. The DEA ignored the \nlaw, and the Department of Justice defended them in this unfortunate \naction.\n  It is the latest example of how far out of touch the Federal \nGovernment agencies are with the reality on the ground, with the will \nof the majority of the American people, who think that marijuana should \nbe legal, and with the policies of the President himself.\n  President Obama has declared marijuana no more harmful than other \nperfectly legal substances, like tobacco, which is, in fact, true, and \nthat he had bigger fish to fry than fight against State legalization. \nUnfortunately, some parts of his Federal Government are still frying \nthose fish.\n  The good news is that the tide has turned. As I mentioned, the \nmajority of the American people now think marijuana should be legal, as \n23 States, the District of Columbia, and Guam now have medical \nmarijuana and 17 more have authorized a limited version of medical \nmarijuana. We have 4 States and the District of Columbia that permit \noutright adult use, with more States considering this over the course \nof the next year.\n  All the Federal Government has to do, as Secretary Clinton recently \nsaid in Colorado, is just stay out of the way. Stop interfering. Let \nlegal marijuana businesses have bank accounts. Don't force them to be \nall cash. Let them deduct their business expenses from their taxes \ninstead of penalizing them with grotesquely punitive levels of tax. Let \nthe States continue in their efforts at reform. Let them treat it just \nlike we do alcohol.\n  The day is fast coming when the Federal policy will be to robustly \nresearch and, ultimately, deschedule--or remove--marijuana from the \nControlled Substances Act, no longer pretending that it is or should be \na Schedule I controlled substance, and, instead, tax and regulate it at \nthe Federal level.\n  In the meantime, the States will continue marching forward; the \npublic will continue to request that we, at the Federal level, stop \ninterfering with medical marijuana; and Congress will continue our \nefforts with increasingly large, bipartisan majorities to make this \npolicy work to replace the failed attempt at marijuana prohibition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7032-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7032-H7033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRESS AND ISRAEL MUST STAND TOGETHER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, the United States and Israel share the \nsame principles and values: fundamental ideas like freedom, democracy, \nrespect for the rule of law, and human rights.\n  Our nations also share, sadly, the same security concerns, like \nfighting terrorism and seeing stability in the Middle East, two issues \nthat seemingly grow worse for the entire region day by day, but \nespecially for Israel. Many of the recent tragic terror attacks and \nincidents of violence in Israel have been incited by both the \nPalestinian Authority and Hamas, with Abu Mazen openly inciting the \nviolence himself.\n  Tomorrow the Foreign Affairs Committee will mark up a resolution that \nI introduced alongside my south Florida colleague, Congressman Ted \nDeutch, which condemns the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement by \nAbu Mazen and the Palestinian Authority. When Israeli citizens cannot \nwalk out of their homes to go safely to work or to go to the grocery \nstore for fear of another terrorist attack, we must hold the \nPalestinian leadership accountable.\n  Abu Mazen is also threatening Israel at the United Nations, where he \nseeks to delegitimize Israel and seeks unilateral Palestinian \nstatehood. Just last month, Abu Mazen told the U.N. General Assembly \nthat Palestinians would not abide by past agreements, proving, once \nagain, that he is no partner for peace.\n  This morning a maneuver was foiled at UNESCO when the P.A. attempted \nto include incendiary text in a resolution that claimed the Western \nWall was part of a Muslim holy site; and, next week, Abu Mazen is \nscheduled to speak at a special meeting at the U.N. Human Rights \nCouncil.\n  You have got to be kidding: Abu Mazen speaking at a Human Rights \nCouncil.\n  President Obama must hold Abu Mazen accountable instead of continuing \nto give him a pass for his actions and show that actions have \nconsequences.\n  But these aren't the only challenges that Israel faces. In addition \nto the terror inside Israel, it remains surrounded by threats like \nISIL, Iran, Syria, challenges that are shared by the United States.\n  The Iran deal is riddled with loopholes, with ambiguities, and with \noutright dangerous provisions, including a sunset clause that paves the \nway for a nuclear-armed Iran in as little as 15 years--just bide the \ntime. It also includes the lifting of the arms embargo against Iran and \nthe lifting of sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program.\n  In addition, the Iran deal releases billions of dollars that is \nallowing the regime to increase its terror financing and helps fulfill \nits destructive ambitions in the Middle East.\n  For years, Congress, not the administration, has led the charge to \npush back against Iran and to sanction it through an effective \nsanctions program that constricts its energy, transportation, and \nfinancial sectors.\n  It is now up to Congress to be proactive again, to get out in front \nof the Iranian deal, and to ensure that the administration holds Iran \naccountable and will not allow incremental cheating, because it is \nalmost impossible to see this administration scuttling the deal for \nanything less than a major violation on Iran's part. We need to develop \nstronger sanctions against Iran for its illicit behavior and ensure \nthat the administration fully enforces the sanctions on the books.\n  While the U.N. resolutions implementing an arms embargo and \nrestricting Iran's ballistic missile program are still in place, Iran \nis already testing our resolve. It is violating these resolutions. It \ntest-fired a ballistic missile, and it continues to ship arms to Assad \nand Hezbollah to use against the people of Syria and against Israel.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Congress must move to enact additional sanctions against Iran, and we \nmust designate and sanction Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and the \nQuds Force, because they will be the big winners in this sanctions \nrelief. We must target Hezbollah and Iran's other proxies because you \ncan be sure that, with Hezbollah, it is only a matter of when, not if, \nit decides to attack Israel.\n  We must ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself from \nHezbollah and from other outside threats. With Iran providing Hezbollah \nwith more advanced rockets and missiles, even with precision-guided \nsystems, Israel is facing an enemy with almost 150,000 rockets pointed \nat every major city in\n\n[[Page H7033]]\n\nIsrael. Congress needs to get more funding to Israel for its David's \nSling system, for its Iron Dome system; and we need to do it sooner, \nrather than later.\n  Israel is an oasis of freedom in a desert of tyranny, a desert of \nterror and instability; and it is absolutely vital, Mr. Speaker, that \nCongress and Israel stand together to face these challenges united. The \nPresident won't do it. The Congress must.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7033-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMUNITY VOICES: WHY NUTRITION ASSISTANCE MATTERS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I recently had the pleasure of speaking \nwith a group of people involved with Community Voices: Why Nutrition \nAssistance Matters. It was inspiring to hear about the real and \npositive impacts our Federal nutrition programs have in the daily lives \nof Americans all across this country.\n  Community Voices is a summer-long national campaign launched by the \nCenter for American Progress, the Coalition on Human Needs, Witnesses \nto Hunger, the Food Research and Action Center, Feeding America, and \nthe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n  It was started to share the personal stories of individuals and \nservice providers who experienced firsthand programs like SNAP or WIC \nor school meals. These contributors are the real experts when it comes \nto the importance and effect of our vital nutrition assistance \nprograms.\n  The Community Voices campaign culminated in this booklet, a \ncompilation of many of these personal stories. I would like to take a \nmoment and share a few of these stories.\n  Jonetta, from Sacramento, California, says:\n  ``Several years ago, I left an abusive relationship, and now I am \nraising my daughter by myself. My daughter participates in the school \nmeal program and the after-school snack program. The snack program \nreally helps so that my daughter isn't as hungry when she gets home \nfrom school.\n  ``We also receive $356 a month in SNAP. This money is supposed to \nsupplement my food budget, but it is really all of my food budget \nbecause my income barely covers my rent. Right now, I'm homeless, and \nit is hard to find a place to live for less than $500 a month.\n  ``Because of SNAP, we are not starving. As a mom, I try to cut out a \nlot of bad food from my family's diet, but it is a difficult task to \nbuy the healthier food because it is expensive. It's also very \ndifficult because we have been homeless for a couple of months, so I \nhave to use other people's refrigerators.\n  ``I am very thankful for these programs and to all the people who are \ntrying to make all these programs better. They really helped me and my \ndaughter.''\n  Let me share another story from Linda from the Massachusetts \nCoalition of the Homeless:\n  ``Several years ago, I volunteered at a summer program at a park in \nMorgantown, Kentucky, assisting with skill-building activities. Without \nthis nutrition program, the kids who came would not have had lunch, \nsince school was not in session. If the kids didn't come to that park \nfor nutritional food, I'm not sure they would have gotten it anywhere \nelse. None of the food was wasted; and if there was any food left over, \nthe kids would take it back to their families.\n  ``Food is a basic human right, and our government sometimes forgets \nthat and needs to be reminded. This is a moral imperative for our \ncountry to make sure that all people, especially children, have the \nresources needed to develop--even more so for families and children in \npoverty.''\n  I want to thank Jonetta, Linda, and all of those who took the time to \nshare their stories. They remind us that these programs are helping \nreal families who are trying to do their best in very difficult times.\n  Mr. Speaker, all too often the discussion around SNAP and our other \nantihunger programs is punctuated by misinformation, false stereotypes, \nor downright nasty rhetoric. It is frustrating, and it is wrong.\n  Community Voices reminds us what a positive difference these programs \nmake for families who are really struggling.\n  The data backs up just how important these programs are. In 2014 \nalone, for example, SNAP lifted 4.7 million people out of poverty, \nincluding 2.1 million children. Ninety-two percent of benefits go to \nhouseholds with incomes below the poverty line, which includes millions \nof struggling families working hard every day to put food on the table.\n  Federal investment in our nutrition programs is one of the smartest \ninvestments we can make. For example, for every $1 spent on preventive \nservices for a pregnant woman in WIC, the program saves $4.21 in \nMedicaid costs by reducing the risk of preterm birth and associated \ncosts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have long believed that we need to hear firsthand from \nthe people who are directly touched by SNAP, WIC, or school meals. They \nare the real experts, and they can guide us, as Members of Congress, as \nwe work to strengthen and improve these programs.\n  Every Member of Congress should have received a Community Voices \nbooklet. It is a call to action to protect our vital nutrition \nassistance programs. I encourage you to read the stories about how \nthese programs are helping families who need them most. Without them, \nhunger would be much, much worse in this country.\n  I urge you to keep their stories in mind the next time proposals come \nbefore Congress to cut funding for WIC or restrict access to SNAP or \nmake it more difficult for kids to get healthy meals in school. Harmful \nchanges like these would hurt real families who are already struggling. \nWe should not make their lives more difficult. We should not be making \nhunger worse in this country. Mr. Speaker, we can and we should do more \nto end hunger now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7033-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7033-H7034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FIRE PREVENTION MONTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize \nOctober as National Fire Prevention Month and would like to thank all \nthe firefighters across my district and across the Nation for all that \nthey do to keep our communities safe.\n  In 2013, departments across the United States responded to nearly \n400,000 fires, resulting in $7 billion in property damage and more than \n2,700 deaths. That, unfortunately, amounts to an average of eight \npeople every day.\n  Of those who lost their lives as a result of fire, one in four was \ncaused by a fire that started in a bedroom. This is one of the reasons \nwhy one focus of this year's Fire Prevention Month is to raise \nawareness that every bedroom needs a working smoke detector.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a volunteer firefighter with nearly three decades of \nexperience, I know that smoke detectors save lives. The statistics \nprove this, showing that working smoke detectors cut the risk of dying \nin a fire by half.\n  Smoke detectors are inexpensive and easy to install. I urge everyone \nto take action to help prevent future tragedies.\n\n\n                 Goodwill Industries' 50th Anniversary\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the \n50th anniversary of Goodwill Industries of North Central, located in my \ndistrict. This organization assists people across a huge portion of \nnorth central Pennsylvania, including 13 counties.\n  Goodwill has been a valuable part of its region since its launch in \n1966. Over the years, their service area has grown to cover more than a \ndozen counties, 20 stores--the most recent addition, our 21st store, \nwhich is an online store they operate--and has created jobs for more \nthan 500 people. Last week, I visited Goodwill's distribution center in \nJefferson County, Pennsylvania, and learned more about the \norganization's plans to open an additional three stores as well as a \ndonation training center.\n  Fifty years after its founding, hard work and determination are still \nthe cornerstone to Goodwill of North Central's foundation.\n  It certainly helps that this great local organization is backed by a \nhighly regarded national network. Across\n\n[[Page H7034]]\n\nthe United States, Goodwill is considered one of the top five most \nvaluable and recognized nonprofit brands and is the second-largest \nnonprofit organization. Pennsylvania alone is served by 10 Goodwill \nIndustries service areas; and Goodwill has solid ties to the \ncommunities it services through partnerships with local businesses, \nschools, and human service agencies, helping individuals overcome life \nchallenges through opportunity, education, training, and employment.\n  I often say that I wear many hats during my day-to-day routine: \nfather, husband, community member, caregiver, legislator, and so on. I \nam sure most of you would agree with the fact that the different roles \nthat you fulfill in your life provide you with diverse perspectives and \nhelp shape your outlook on what is most important. My experiences have \nsolidified my belief in the value of community. Whether we are talking \nabout our national economy, the quality of our health care, or closing \nthe skills gap, we can agree that the most successful efforts start in \nour local communities from the ground up.\n  Those who donate to Goodwill can have peace of mind that their money \nis going to the right place, since 90 cents of every dollar is directed \ntoward its mission and its services. These services were provided to \nnearly 1,200 people across the north central region in Pennsylvania in \n2013, providing an immensurable benefit to our region.\n  The 50th anniversary celebration is a great time to reflect on all of \nthe growth that Goodwill Industries of North Central has achieved as a \nteam and to continue to prepare your plans for the future. I commend \nthem for all their remarkable accomplishments, and I look forward to \nthe great things that are to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7034-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFAULT PREVENTION ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nConnecticut (Mr. Himes) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning in some horror and alarm \nover the so-called Default Prevention Act that this Chamber will be \nconsidering. Of all the Orwellian names that the House comes up with \nfor legislation, this one is truly deserving of an award by the \nMinistry of Truth.\n  For those of you at home who have not been following the swirling, \nmadcap antics around the House of Representatives lately, let me assure \nyou that the Default Prevention Act in no way prevents a default. The \nDefault Prevention Act, in fact, specifies that two categories of \npeople get paid in the event that the Congress does not raise the debt \nceiling. It specifies that private bondholders of U.S. Treasuries will \nget paid interest, and it specifies that Social Security recipients \nwill be held harmless. They will get paid.\n  Now, at some level, maybe that sounds attractive; but everybody else \nthat is expecting a check or a salary or some form of repayment by the \nUnited States Government, they are out of luck.\n  1.4 million Active-Duty troops, they are not in this bill as somebody \nwho gets paid if the government doesn't raise the debt ceiling. Four \nmillion disabled veterans are out of luck under this bill. One million \ndoctors who today are providing Medicare services to our senior \ncitizens are out of luck. Sorry. You didn't make it into the Default \nPrevention Act cooked up by the Republican majority.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that stunningly and explicitly defines \nfor the world, tells everybody exactly how the U.S. Government intends \nto be a deadbeat, who we are going to pay and who we are not going to \npay, and here is how we are going to be a deadbeat.\n  Why would you do that? What possible sense does that make?\n  There are all kinds of reasons why this is a terrible piece of \nlegislation, but let me just focus on two.\n  Number one, I hear constantly from my friends on the Republican side \nof the aisle that everything creates winners and losers: the Affordable \nCare Act, the Ex-Im Bank, you name it. Dodd-Frank creates winners and \nlosers. This bill very explicitly creates winners: Social Security \nrecipients and bondholders.\n  By the way, who are these bondholders? Who holds United States \nTreasury debt? Do you?\n  I will tell you who holds most of it: China. China does. This is why, \non the Democratic side of the aisle, we have called this bill the Pay \nChina First Act, which is actually a much better description of what \nthis act actually does than the Default Prevention Act.\n  More seriously, Mr. Speaker, I worked in the capital markets for a \nlong time. There is no way to gracefully default on your debt, to say, \n``Oh, we will pay interest; we will pay Social Security. But we are not \ngoing to pay soldiers; we are not going to pay Medicare.'' Once you \ntell the world that we do not intend to abide by our obligations, the \nworld loses its faith in the United States.\n  Folks, this debt ceiling is a fiction. It is an absurdist fiction. \nWhat do we get from it? The debt ceiling has never prevented the \naccumulation of debt. That happens because this Chamber and the United \nStates Congress chooses to spend more money than it chooses to tax and \nbring in.\n  There are really only two ways to reduce the deficit and the debt: \nyou can tax more, which nobody likes to do; or you can spend less, \nwhich it turns out that nobody really wants to do either because, of \ncourse, everybody in this Chamber has the things that they want to \nspend their money on, but the other guy's stuff, well, that we are \ngoing to cut.\n  So we have the ultimate hypocrisy of saying we are going to tax too \nlittle and spend too much, create a deficit, but then we are going to \nvote on this magical thing called the debt ceiling that will allow us \nto say ``I am not raising the debt ceiling because I oppose spending.'' \nIt is absurd. And you know what? It leads to legislation like this.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Mr. Speaker, we have seen this movie before. Pretty soon in the next \ncouple of days, grown men and women in this Chamber are going to talk \nabout maybe the Treasury minting a high-denomination platinum coin to \nsolve this problem, as though we were characters in some kind of \n``Harry Potter'' movie instead of responsible legislators.\n  This needs to stop, Mr. Speaker. My constituents are sick and tired \nof the House of Representatives acting in this fashion: ideological and \nabsurd. My constituents want us to come together to deal with the real \nproblems facing America: of improving the economy, of making education \naccessible. But, no, we are going to spend some time on this absurdly \nnamed Default Prevention Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this thing and move on to more \nserious issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7034-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7034-H7035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OUR NATION'S DEBT TAX\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Olson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, in a mere 14 days, America will hit the limit \nfor our national debt; but rather than working with Congress to address \nthe causes of our debt, President Obama is demanding we dump more debt \non our kids and grandkids.\n  President Obama is very different from Senator Obama. Here is a photo \nof Senator Obama speaking on the Senate floor, and here is what he said \non our national debt on the Senate floor on March 16, 2006:\n  ``The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt \nlimit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. \nGovernment can't pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on \nongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our \ngovernment's reckless fiscal policies.\n  ``Over the past 5 years, our Federal debt has increased by $3.5 \ntrillion to $8.6 trillion. That is `trillion' with a `T.' That is money \nthat we have borrowed from the Social Security trust fund, borrowed \nfrom China and Japan, borrowed from American taxpayers.\n  ``Numbers that large are sometimes hard to understand. Some people \nmay wonder why they matter. Here is why: This year the Federal \nGovernment will spend $220 billion on interest.''\n  The $8.6 trillion that horrified Senator Obama in 2006 has exploded \nto $18.1 trillion on President Obama's watch. ``That is `trillion' with \na `T,' '' to quote Senator Obama.\n  Senator Obama later explained:\n  ``Every dollar we pay in interest is a dollar that is not going to \ninvestment\n\n[[Page H7035]]\n\nin America's priorities. Instead, interest payments are a significant \ntax on all Americans, a debt tax that Washington doesn't want to talk \nabout.''\n  Senator Obama abhorred a debt tax that Washington didn't want to talk \nabout, and now he refuses to talk about his new debt tax.\n  Senator Obama closed by saying:\n  ``Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and \ninternationally. Leadership means that `the buck stops here.' Instead, \nWashington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs \nof our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a \nfailure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I, therefore, intend \nto oppose the effort to increase America's debt limit.''\n  If Senator Obama thought that a national debt of $8.6 trillion with a \nT is a ``failure of leadership,'' what has changed? Why is President \nObama okay with a new debt tax of over $20 trillion, trillion with a T?\n  Clearly, President Obama has forgotten Senator Obama's words, but the \nAmerican people remember. On their behalf and on behalf of all young \nAmericans who will be crushed by this new debt, I ask President Obama \nto decrease our debt by working with Congress to stop his new debt tax.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7035-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7035-H7036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DONALD TRUMP HOSTING ``SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE''\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, did you hear that ``Saturday Night Live'' \nhas invited Donald Trump to host the show in November? Now, let me get \nthe exact quote from July when Donald Trump launched his ``make America \nhate again'' campaign. He said:\n  ``When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best . . . \nThey're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing \nus those problems. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. \nThey're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.''\n  ``They're sending us not the right people. It's coming from more than \nMexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's \ncoming probably from the Middle East.''\n  While much of what Donald Trump says is hilarious, intentionally or \notherwise, bald-faced racism for political gain isn't funny. His \nstatements should disqualify him from being able to take the stage in \nany entertainment venue and speak to the American people as if what he \nsaid was no big deal.\n  It is not that I don't get the joke--I haven't been kidnapped by the \npolitically correct police--but when public figures cross certain \nlines, they should lose their privileges to host TV shows, at least \nuntil they have apologized for their unacceptable behavior. To put \nDonald Trump on the air in America's living rooms on the signature \ncomedy show of one of the most important national networks after saying \nthat Mexicans are rapists, drug dealers, and criminals, that is a \ncorporate blunder too big to be ignored.\n  What happened, NBC and Comcast? Within a couple of weeks after Trump \nlaunched those racist bombs, you dumped Trump. You dumped his TV show \non your network. You dumped his pageants and other ventures on NBC and \nUniversal networks like Telemundo.\n  In July, NBC said: ``Due to the recent derogatory statements by \nDonald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business \nrelationship with Mr. Trump.''\n  NBC said: ``Respect and dignity for all people are cornerstones of \nour values.''\n  NBC, you were not alone in dumping Trump. Macy's Department Stores \ndumped Trump's clothing line, Serta dumped Trump's mattresses, chef \nJose Andres pulled his new restaurant from a Trump hotel, and Univision \ndumped a Trump pageant. Even NASCAR and ESPN dumped Trump. Corporate \nAmerica stepped up to the plate and dumped Trump, and we all applauded.\n  Let's be clear: the goodwill that corporate America earned from \ndumping Trump didn't just come from the Mexican-American community. No, \nwhen Trump says Mexicans are murderers, rapists, and drug dealers, \nPuerto Rico knows he is talking about us, too, and Colombians and \nSalvadorans, and pretty much everyone in the Latino community.\n  Look, Americans aren't very good at telling us apart; so when we are \nunder attack by a tycoon running for the Republican Presidential \nnomination, we can't tell us apart either. We are all family.\n  What happened, Comcast, Universal, and NBC? Now, 3 months later, have \nDonald Trump's words been expunged? Did I miss an apology on one of his \nalmost nightly television appearances? Has he confessed his racist and \nhateful call to action?\n  Well, NBC installing Trump as SNL host may be good for ratings, but \nit is a bigger deal than a cameo or being a guest on ``The Tonight \nShow.'' I am calling you out.\n  If Donald Trump had said gays and lesbians were murderers and raping \nAmericans, would he get to host a show? It is every bit as much a \nfiction and a lie.\n  Donald Trump has said some pretty awful things about women \nindividually and collectively. But what if he said most women were \ncriminals? Would the writers be thinking up sketches for Trump if he \nhad slandered an entire gender rather than an entire ethnic group?\n  Trump says he wants to do away with the part of the Constitution that \nallowed freed slaves, freed African American slaves to be treated fully \nas American citizens. Yes, Trump thinks we do not need the 14th \nAmendment to the Constitution.\n  But what if he said that Black people were murderers, rapists, drug \ndealers? Would you still pitch skits with Donald Trump and some \nlighthearted banter?\n  What if all the Latino cast members all walked off the job at \n``Saturday Night Live''? Oh, wait, you don't have any Latino cast \nmembers.\n  I do seem to remember Comcast spending a lot of time on Capitol Hill \nwhen they had a merger deal with Time Warner and they wanted support \nfrom Members of Congress. Comcast said Latinos were so important to \nthem, and they had plans to do this and that and the other thing to \nsupport the Latino and immigrant community.\n  What happened? The merger didn't go through, so you no longer feel \nthe sense of corporate responsibility to the 55 million Latinos that \nlive in the USA? Giving free airtime to people who insult and malign \nthem is now part of your business model?\n  I just want to say one last thing to producer Lorne Michaels. I \nwonder if he had said that Canadians were rapists, murderers, and drug \ndealers, would you be inviting him on SNL?\n  Mr. Speaker, I place in the Record a letter that I sent NBC Comcast \nyesterday.\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 2015.\n     Mr. Brian Roberts,\n     Chairman/President/CEO, Comcast Corp,\n     Philadelphia, PA.\n     Mr. Stephen B. Burke,\n     President/CEO, NBCUniversal,\n     New York, NY.\n       Dear Messrs. Roberts and Burke: Having Donald Trump as a \n     guest on every news and entertainment program is one thing, \n     but allowing him to host Saturday Night Live is another. It \n     is a level of endorsement that says to America that every \n     hateful and racist thing Donald Trump has said since the \n     moment he launched his campaign is acceptable and no big \n     deal.\n       Well, it is a big deal. He said Mexicans are rapists, \n     criminals and drug-dealers, and to be clear, when he said \n     Mexicans are those things, he was tarring all Latinos and all \n     immigrants. His exact words were, ``They're sending us not \n     the right people. It's coming from more than Mexico. It's \n     coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming \n     probably from the Middle East.''\n       The reaction in July from NBC was swift and clear: ``Due to \n     the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding \n     immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship \n     with Mr. Trump.'' And NBC said, ``Respect and dignity for all \n     people are cornerstones of our values.''\n       Serta, Macy's, NASCAR, Univision, and ESPN were among the \n     others that also acted to dump Trump.\n       Three months later, because he is a ratings and comedy \n     bonanza, Lorne Michaels and Saturday Night Live (SNL) are \n     giving the Trump campaign 90 minutes of free network airtime.\n       I think I speak for a lot of Americans, especially \n     immigrant Americans and Latino Americans, when I say that if \n     SNL is allowed to proceed, it would be a huge corporate \n     blunder.\n       When Comcast sought a merger with Time Warner, I and a lot \n     of my Congressional Hispanic Caucus colleagues heard from you\n\n[[Page H7036]]\n\n     about your commitment to the Latino community and the level \n     of corporate responsibility you pledged to your diverse \n     audience. I certainly hope that your commitment to ``respect \n     and dignity for all people'' was not some hollow promise and \n     is in fact a cornerstone of your values.\n       Please disinvite him. Make a statement: Derogatory \n     statements of the nature trumpeted by Trump about any group \n     disqualifies someone from hosting shows on your network. Send \n     a message that racism is not funny and that responsibility to \n     your viewers and the public is more important than ratings. \n     It is a chance for your company--again--to show you are \n     committed to your audience in more ways than just the ad \n     revenues they provide you.\n       Please do the right thing and dump Trump.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Luis V.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Jenkins) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, President Obama is coming \nto West Virginia today to talk about our State's and Nation's drug \ncrisis. What I hope he will also talk about on his visit to our capital \ncity, Charleston, what I hope he will acknowledge, is our State's jobs \ncrisis. West Virginia has lost good jobs: jobs in our coal mines, jobs \nin our schools and small businesses, jobs in our small towns and \ncommunities throughout southern West Virginia.\n  Regulations from the President's own Environmental Protection Agency \nare forcing coal mines to close. Our coal miners are out of work. Our \ncoal families are facing an uncertain future. We have lost an estimated \n43 percent of our coal jobs in just the last 6 years under this \nadministration's policies.\n  Eighteen percent--18 percent--of unemployed people reported using \nillegal drugs. That is more than twice the number of people who used \nillegal drugs who were employed. The best antidrug policy is a good \njobs policy.\n  West Virginia has the highest overdose rate in the country. We also \nhave the highest unemployment rate in the country. Nearly every family \nin this State has been touched by drug abuse and, tragically, far too \nmany families. There are those who have suffered and actually buried a \nloved one due to the horrible disease of addiction.\n  The President will announce several initiatives to help address the \nheroin and opioid crisis. He is going to talk about prescriber \ntraining. He is going to talk about access to naloxone, a powerful \nantidote to an overdose. He is going to talk about public education.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  He is going to talk about public education. These are all excellent \nsteps. These are actually things we already are doing in West Virginia. \nWe have taken great strides on many fronts, including these in West \nVirginia, to arrest this problem.\n  These proposals, however, I am afraid, do not go far enough to really \nmake a difference and treat those battling addiction. The President \nneeds to propose a strong plan to get people real treatment to address \ntheir addictions and become healthy and productive members of society \nagain.\n  Many West Virginians who want treatment don't have anywhere to go. \nThose suffering from addiction are forced to leave West Virginia to \nfind help, treatment, and their families are falling apart.\n  To improve West Virginia, to give West Virginians hope for a better \nfuture, to give them an alternative to destructive lifestyles, we have \nto get people back to work.\n  Mr. President, a good job solves a lot of problems.\n  West Virginians are a proud people. We are not asking for a handout. \nWe want to do a full day's work for a full day's pay.\n  The administration is crushing West Virginia's coal miners, \nmachinists, healthcare workers, truckers, small business owners, and \nMain Street.\n  Mr. President, if you want to help win the war on drugs, stop your \nwar on coal. What we need is the Federal Government to get out of the \nway of West Virginia, and let us get back to work.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Olson).

Mr. Speaker, over the past 15 years, we have \nhad thousands of young Americans killed and thousands more maimed and \ntrillions of U.S. taxpayer dollars spent in our failed attempts at \nnation building in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other parts of the Middle \nEast.\n  Surely, surely, we have learned a very expensive lesson, that we \ncannot run the Middle East. In fact, in some ways, our good intentions \nhave made things worse.\n  Now some companies and people who make money off of an \ninterventionist foreign policy are clamoring for us to get in an even \nbigger way in bloody Syria.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not true conservatism.\n  Mr. Speaker, the conservative columnist Thomas Sowell wrote recently \nand said: ``What lessons might we learn from the whole experience of \nthe Iraq War? If nothing else, we should never again imagine that we \ncan engage in `nation-building' in the sweeping sense that term \nacquired in Iraq--least of all building a democratic Arab nation in a \nregion of the world that has never had such a thing in a history that \ngoes back thousands of years.''\n  David Keene, the conservative opinion editor of the Washington Times, \nwrote:\n\n       The concept of U.S. national interests was stretched beyond \n     any rational meaning. America took on more than we could \n     possibly handle. The result is a generation of young \n     Americans who have never known peace; a decade in which \n     thousands of our best have died or been maimed, with little \n     to show for their sacrifices; our enemies have multiplied; \n     and the national debt has skyrocketed.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, President Kennedy said in one of his most famous \nspeeches at the University of Washington in 1961:\n\n       We must face the fact that the United States is neither \n     omnipotent nor omniscient, that we are only 6 percent of the \n     world's population, that we cannot impose our will on the \n     other 94 percent of mankind, that we cannot right every wrong \n     or reverse each adversity, and that, therefore, there cannot \n     be an American solution to every world problem.\n\n  The only difference now, Mr. Speaker, is that we are 4 percent of the \nworld's population instead of 6 percent that he mentioned. But I would \nrepeat those words of President Kennedy: ``We cannot right every wrong \nor reverse every adversity and that, therefore, there cannot be an \nAmerican solution to every world problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7036-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Human Rights Council for an \nemergency meeting next week where he will surely spew more of his \ndangerous rhetoric and even further inflame the tensions between the \nPalestinians and Israelis.\n  The U.S. has had a clear policy of defending Israel from these biased \nattacks at the U.N., but recently we have seen perhaps a troubling \nshift in policy by the current administration.\n  The administration's refusal to stand publicly and firmly with Israel \nemboldens groups at the U.N. to push forward with these initiatives and \nundermines longstanding U.S. policy. If the administration won't \ncounter these efforts at the U.N., then Congress must use every tool at \nour disposal to hold these agencies and Abu Mazen accountable.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must send a clear message to all the member states at \nthe U.N. that Congress stands with Israel and that we will not allow \nthese efforts to continue that seek to undermine the Jewish state, our \nbest ally, and the U.N.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7037-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RHODE ISLAND WALK FOR EPILEPSY\n\n  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 2015 Rhode \nIsland Walk for Epilepsy, which will take place this Saturday, October \n24, at Slater Memorial Park in Pawtucket.\n  One in 26 people will develop epilepsy at some point in their \nlifetime. Today in the United States, there are 4.3 million adults and \n750,000 children who are living with epilepsy or a seizure disorder.\n  There is no known cure for epilepsy, and it is critical that we do \nmore to support research that will help develop new forms of treatment \nfor those suffering from this disease.\n  I want to extend my deep gratitude to everyone who has been involved \nin planning this year's Rhode Island Walk for Epilepsy. I want to \nespecially recognize one of my constituents, Robbie Thorp, whom I had \nthe opportunity to meet with in April of this year when he was selected \nto serve as Rhode Island's ambassador for the Kids Speak Up conference \nin Washington, D.C.\n  Robbie is an impressive young man who has already demonstrated \nhimself to be a strong advocate for epilepsy awareness in Rhode Island.\n  Again, I extend my best wishes for a successful event to him and \neveryone taking part in this Saturday's Rhode Island Walk for Epilepsy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7037-6", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GARLAND DENNY--A DEDICATED PATRIOT\n\n  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PITTENGER.

During the Korean war, Mr. \nDenny served our country aboard the USS Franklin D.

Mr. Speaker, as Republicans bicker behind closed doors, \nthe deadline to raise the debt limit draws closer and closer.\n  If we fail to act in time, interest rates will skyrocket, the dollar \nwill plummet, and the stock market could collapse. That is \nunacceptable. It is time to bring this manufactured crisis to an end.\n  Let's not fool ourselves. Even if the Republican leadership does \nmanage to pass a last-minute extension, the mere threat of a default \nwill inflict real damage on the American economy. Economists tell us \nthat the 2011 debt limit standoff cost American jobs and contributed to \nthe downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, and we are repeating the same \nmistake today.\n  That is why the true threat to our fragile economic recovery isn't \nour budget deficit; it is the leadership deficit that exists within the \nRepublican Party. Unfortunately, for conservative Republicans, \nirresponsibility has become a badge of honor and recklessness a source \nof pride.\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people want leadership instead of \nbrinksmanship. They want cooperation and compromise instead of deadlock \nand dysfunction.

Mr. Speaker, last week, the Social Security \nAdministration announced that there would be no\n\n[[Page H7038]]\n\ncost of living adjustment to Social Security benefits next year.\n  This news has seniors in western New York worried. The price of food, \nhousing, and health care have increased. Without a corresponding \nincrease in benefits, seniors will be asked to do more with less.\n  The formula used to determine cost of living adjustments is not \nproperly reflecting the senior economy. Seniors spend more on housing, \nfood, and medical care and less on travel and education. That is why I \nsupport legislation to adopt a new formula, called the Consumer Price \nIndex for the Elderly, that would give weight to price increases in \nhousing and medical care and more accurately reflect the costs incurred \nby seniors.\n  Unless Congress acts, the incomes of 60 million Americans will be \neffectively reduced.

Mr. Speaker, despite the destruction of \nthe thousand-year rain event flooding, it was a testament to the people \nof South Carolina working together.

During the \nflooding, over 500 roads and bridges were closed. I know firsthand, as \nthe road I live on was washed out, the location of our family home for \nthe last six generations, which was named by my grandmother.\n  Donations and volunteers have come from across the Nation. The \nSalvation Army, led by Major Roger Coulson, has provided over 50,000 \nmeals to displaced persons in the flooding. The Red Cross, inspired by \nnational president Gale McGovern's visit, has operated 26 shelters.\n  I appreciate the positive spirit of the people of South Carolina \nspontaneously coming together as family and neighbors before turning to \ngovernment.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and the President by his actions \nmust never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n  Thank you, Coach Steve Spurrier, for developing winning Gamecocks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7038-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MUST-ACT DEADLINES\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, well, even some of my Republican colleagues \nacknowledge that there is chaos in their conference and that chaos has \nconsequences. Governing from one manufactured crisis to another, we \nhave piled up a whole series of must-act deadlines.\n  In just 8 days, the U.S. Government will default unless Congress \nacts. Once again, Republicans are jeopardizing the full faith and \ncredit of the United States.\n  Unfortunately, that is just one of the deadlines that we face in this \ncalendar of chaos. In just weeks, we have got to pass another budget or \nface another GOP-engineered shutdown.\n  We have to pass a highway trust fund bill. Hopefully, it is not \nanother short-term patch but something that actually gets Americans \nworking and rebuilds our infrastructure.\n  Sadly, the Export-Import Bank still sits idle. Fortunately, a handful \nof courageous Republicans joined all Democrats, and next week, \nhopefully, we will be able to get that moving again. It shouldn't take \nthat kind of an extraordinary measure. We ought to be able to do it \nthrough the normal course of legislation.\n  This chaos is out of hand.\n  Hardworking Americans go to work every day.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to bring \nresponsible budgeting to our Nation's Capitol. First of all, this means \nfunding the government every year without a shutdown, but also it means \nbalancing the budget.\n  Since I have served in Congress, we have been consumed by fights over \ndeficit reduction and budget priorities. We have gone from crisis to \ncrisis, never coming up with a long-term plan. After the crisis is \nover, nothing happens.\n  Recently, I introduced a balanced budget amendment that would add \ndiscipline to the budget process and require the government to spend \nwithin its means. Balanced budget proposals are not new. But unlike \nmost proposals, my amendment protects Social Security, enables long-\nterm capital investments, and ensures that we can respond to \nemergencies.\n  In Delaware, like most States, the law requires the State to have a \nbalanced budget. As Delaware Secretary of Finance, I helped make that \nhappen. We should hold the Federal Government to the same standard.\n  If the United States is going to continue to be the strongest economy \nin the world, we need to address our budget deficits now. I urge my \ncolleagues to bring order and responsibility to our budget process by \npassing my amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7038-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                   NATIONAL DYSLEXIA AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BUCSHON.

Over time, she discovered her strengths in math and \nscience, which helped her increase her confidence.\n  It wasn't until high school that we found out she actually has \ndyslexia.

Worse \nyet, these policies disproportionately impact minorities and the poor. \nAfrican Americans are 50 percent less likely to receive psychiatric \ntreatment. Outpatient mental health spending for African Americans is \n40 percent lower.\n  While there is an overall shortage of mental health professionals, \nonly 3 percent of psychiatrists and 2 percent of psychologists are \nAfrican American. The rate is similar for Latino mental health \nprofessionals and worse for Native Americans.\n  If you are a minority or low income and have a serious mental \nillness, you are more likely to end up in prison, where 80 percent of \ninmates don't receive any treatment.\n  If you are low income, Medicaid makes it harder for you to access \ninpatient mental health treatment, won't let you see two doctors on the \nsame day, and says, you can't take the medications your doctor \nprescribed.\n  Stop this discrimination.

Mr. Speaker, it is time to get real about gun violence in \nAmerica. As the entrusted voices for millions of Americans, we have a \nresponsibility to address gun violence. In our schools, in our movie \ntheaters, and even in our churches the threat is ever present.\n  Most recently a dangerous individual went on the campus of a \ncommunity college in Roseburg, Oregon, and opened fire, taking nine \nlives and injuring seven. My thoughts and prayers are with the family \nand friends as they mourn.\n  Chris Mintz, a veteran from Randleman, North Carolina, was among \nthose injured while rushing into the crossfire in an effort to defuse \nthe situation. I am honored by his bravery, and I wish him a speedy and \nfull recovery.\n  From Newtown to Blacksburg, to Aurora, to Charleston, these senseless \nshootings are becoming far too common. It is not just mass shootings \nthat are bothersome because every day 88 people die because of gun \nviolence.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of our children \nand salute the medical researchers and the pediatricians who are \nseeking to find cures for debilitating and preventable childhood \ndiseases.\n  The leadership of the U.S. is crucial in helping end many of these \nchildhood and maternal deaths. That is why we have included specific \nprovisions in 21st Century Cures for children.\n  Cures bring benefits. Let me give you an example: polio. In 1988, the \nWorld Health Organization had a resolution to support the worldwide \neradication of polio. Through the work of American researchers, private \ncitizens, and Rotarians, polio vaccines have nearly eradicated this \nscourge worldwide.\n  American leadership should continue to help end preventable childhood \nand maternal deaths.\n\n[[Page H7040]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7040-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING NATIONAL FOREST PRODUCTS WEEK\n\n  (Ms. GRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. GRAHAM.

The Apalachicola National \nForest alone is nearly 1,000 square miles.\n  Just last week, I participated in a work day with the Nature \nConservancy in the Apalachicola Forest to learn how responsible \nmanagement can boost the economic and environmental value of \nforestland.\n  I am proud that north Florida forests make such an important \ncontribution to our country's economy and our environment.

Mr. Speaker, I also rise today in recognition of \nNational Forest Products Week and the men and women across our country \nthat work in this crucial industry. Forest products have been an \nintegral part of the North American economy even before our States were \nunited.\n  From our beginnings, forest products built ships and were the main \nsource of fuel. Through our industrialization, forest products became \nthe foundation of our vast rail system and the media that fills our \ngreat libraries. Today so much of everything we get is shipped and \ncontained in forest products. Forest products have always been the \nbackbone of housing, a critical sector of our economy.\n  Forest products are green, renewable, and sequester carbon. We have \nbeen prolific in perfecting our conversion technologies, developing new \nproducts, and growing more timber. In fact, we have more trees today in \nAmerica than in 1900.\n  To keep our forests healthy and our economy strong, we need to \ndevelop more markets at home and abroad for our forest products, and we \nneed to commit more research to find cost-effective ways to utilize our \nwoody biomass, a vast, renewable, carbon-neutral fuel source.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7040-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT NEED FUNDING\n\n  (Mr. HASTINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HASTINGS.

I will \nproudly wear this label today for the number of people around our \ncountry and around the world that are suffering from cancer.\n  On Monday, I participated at Nova Southeastern University with \nexperts in genomics and studying this issue. I learned from them that \nonly 8 percent of grants are made from the National Institutes of \nHealth. That is an incredible resource for all of us, and we need to be \nabout the business of increasing the National Institutes of Health's \nopportunities to go forward on breast cancer.\n  The second part of my remarks this morning, Mr. Speaker, deals with \nairport workers, specifically in Fort Lauderdale and elsewhere. They \nare fighting for $15 an hour. These are the people that clean up the \ntoilets at the airport in Broward County. They are the people who carry \nthe people on the airplane with wheelchairs. We can at least afford $15 \nan hour for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7040-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1230\n           REAUTHORIZE THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  (Mr. TROTT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. TROTT.

Our soldiers and their families \ndeserve better than an administration that plays politics with the pay \nfor our troops and puts our national security on the line just to prove \na political point.\n  What I find most shocking is the President spent the last several \nmonths fighting to lift economic sanctions so that Iran's terrorist \narmy could receive billions in aid, and now he is planning to block \nfunding for America's military. This is unbelievable. Our soldiers \ndeserve better. Our Nation deserves better.\n  America is facing increased threats from around the globe. We have \nsoldiers fighting in Afghanistan. We have military families bravely \ncontinuing with their lives as their loved ones risk their lives for \nfreedom.\n  Not only do we need to fully fund our troops, but we need to show the \nworld that, when it comes to our defense and national security, the \nUnited States stands as one strong, unified body.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time the President drops the partisan games and \nstands with our troops.

During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 480 provides for \nconsideration of H.R. 10, the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results \nReauthorization Act, and H.R. 692, the Default Prevention Act.\n  These bills are important steps forward on two issues of great \nimportance to Americans: education and fiscal issues.\n  H.R. 10, the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Reauthorization \nAct, also known as the SOAR Reauthorization Act, would continue \nimportant funding provided to help young students here in Washington, \nD.C., reach their full potential. This legislation would provide $60 \nmillion annually for 5 years, split equally among the District's public \nschools, charter schools, and the District of Columbia Opportunity \nScholarship Program, which enables low-income students to attend a \nprivate school that would otherwise be out of their reach.\n  Two amendments to the bill have been made in order for consideration, \none by a Republican and another by a Democrat.\n  I have great confidence that the SOAR Reauthorization Act is a \npositive step for students in the District of Columbia and that, \nthrough its example, it will provide a model for success that could be \nadopted by States across the country.\n  The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 692, the Default \nPrevention Act. As my colleagues are all aware, the Treasury Department \nhas asserted that its ability to use extraordinary measures to avoid \nreaching the statutory debt limit will be exhausted in coming days, \npossibly by November 3.\n  The legislation before us is a vital step to take default off the \ntable, should extraordinary measures be exhausted, providing certainty \nto financial markets and hardworking Americans that we will pay our \ndebts and meet our obligations.\n  The Default Prevention Act would authorize the Secretary of the \nTreasury to issue debt obligations necessary to continue making \nprincipal and interest payments on our debt, and would also ensure \ncontinued access to the funds in the Social Security trust fund \nnecessary to pay Social Security benefits in full.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is simply common sense that we permanently close out \nthe possibility of default and give seniors and other Social Security \nbeneficiaries confidence that they will continue to receive the funds \nthey rely on.\n  We can protect the full faith and credit of the United States and \nensure that our credit ratings and economy are not impacted by policy \nbattles here in Congress over future spending policies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend this rule and both of the underlying bills to \nmy colleagues for their support.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina for yielding the \ncustomary 30 minutes to me for debate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule, which provides \nfor consideration of both H.R. 10, the Scholarships for Opportunity and \nResults Reauthorization Act, and H.R. 692, the Default Prevention Act. \nOnce again, we are playing grab bag rules, and I maintain that that is \nnot the process of regular order.\n  Each time I have the privilege of managing a rule which, with only \nfour\n\n[[Page H7042]]\n\nmembers of the minority on the committee, happens quite often, I find \nmyself in the same position: frustrated with my friends, the House \nRepublicans', complete disregard for regular order; their use of one \nrule to consider multiple unrelated pieces of legislation; and, most \nsignificantly, disillusioned that, in a time when so much can and must \nbe done for the American people, we continue to spend precious time \nwith partisan, dead-on-arrival measures.\n  H.R. 10 would reauthorize the Opportunity Scholarship Program through \nthe years 2021. OSP is the only federally created and funded elementary \nand secondary private school voucher program in the United States.\n  Last night, my friend from Utah came forward and spoke, as is his \nresponsibility. And I would just ask him, do they have the same program \nin Beaver, Utah, or Centerville, Utah, or Altamont?\n  I didn't know they had an Altamont. I come from Altamonte Springs, \nFlorida. They spell it without the E. But they don't have this voucher \nprogram that they are trying to foist on the District of Columbia.\n  The program, which awards need-based scholarships to children in the \nDistrict of Columbia to attend a participating private school of their \nchoice, was created in 2004 and last reauthorized in 2011.\n  I would like to note from the outset that the current school voucher \nprogram is authorized through September 2016. That is almost a full \nyear from now. Given the numerous pressing and time-sensitive matters \nfacing this body, I can't help but feel bewildered as to why we are \nrushing to reauthorize D.C. school vouchers, yet we continue to ignore \nour Nation's crumbling infrastructure, income inequality, the need for \njobs, immigration reform, the need for sensible gun control in the wake \nof mass shootings and countless other deaths at the instance of guns, \nparticularly children, and our lack of a long-term budget. I continue \nto await a straight answer from my Republican colleagues and hope that \nwe can get this question answered before today's debate concludes.\n  Now, I also want to make something clear. The members of the \nWashington, D.C. City Council have said that they do not want the D.C. \nvoucher program to be reauthorized.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  In a letter to the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform, the majority of the members of the D.C. Council \nexpressed their belief that ``Federal funds should be invested in the \nexisting public education system--both public schools and public \ncharter schools--rather than being diverted to private schools.''\n  They go on to describe past findings on vouchers, saying that ``the \nevidence is clear that the use of vouchers has had no statistically \nsignificant impact on overall student achievement in math or reading, \nor for students from schools in need of improvement.''\n  Despite this very clear letter, in what I can only describe as \n``typical Republican fashion,'' this body is going full steam ahead in \nits efforts to impose its political will regardless.\n  I remind those here today and watching at home that Washington, D.C., \nis a Federal district. Congress maintains the power to overturn laws \napproved by the D.C. Council, can vote to impose laws on D.C., and gets \nfinal approval of the D.C. Council's budget.\n  Washington, D.C.'s Delegate to the House of Representatives, my very \ngood friend and a mentor to all of us not only on this issue, but \ncountless others, Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton, who has served in this \nbody for 24 years, is not permitted to vote on final passage of any \nlegislation, let alone legislation directly intended to govern the \njurisdiction which she was elected to serve.\n  One might hope that Congress would consider the wishes of the \nrepresentatives of Washington, D.C., and the nearly 660,000 residents \nof the District who are taxpayers without representation. But, as we \nsee today, that simply isn't the case.\n  Mr. Speaker, the underlying legislation would make significant \nchanges to the way in which the program is evaluated, and that is a \nproblem.\n  In 2012, The Washington Post published an article titled ``Quality \nControls Lacking for D.C. Schools Accepting Federal Vouchers.'' The \npiece examined some of the schools receiving vouchers.\n  Among them were ``a nondenominational Christian school'' that \n``occupies a soot-stained storefront between a halal meat shop and an \nevening wear boutique.'' The school consists of two classrooms, and \n``students travel nearly 2 miles down Georgia Avenue to the city's \nEmery Recreation Center'' for gym class.\n  Another school ``follows a learning model known as `Suggestopedia,' a \nphilosophy of learning developed by a Bulgarian psychotherapist Georgi \nLozanov that stresses learning through music, stretching, and \nmeditation.''\n  A third is described as ``an accredited K-8 school supported by the \nNation of Islam,'' which ``occupies the second floor of a former \nresidence east of the Anacostia River.'' The classrooms are described \nas being former bedrooms, and the only bathroom in the school was \ndescribed as having ``a floor blackened with dirt and a sink coated in \ngrime. The bathtub was filled with paint cans and cleaning supplies \nconcealed by a curtain.''\n  With descriptions like this of schools just a few miles away from \nthis Chamber, I would like to think we would want more evaluations on \nthese schools, not less.\n  Moving on to H.R. 629, a very bogus bill that plans for the \nunprecedented default on the full faith and credit of the United \nStates, this measure is a debt prioritization bill and one that \nelevates the payments of debts to bondholders, including Switzerland, \nthe Cayman Islands, and China, and they would be paid over the \nobligations to America's troops, veterans, seniors, and students, as \nwell as Medicare recipients.\n  As Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee astutely \nput it: ``Under this legislation, the effect would be to pay China''--\nand Japan and others--``first, and some Americans not at all.''\n  We have been down this road before. Indeed, the debt limit standoff \nand government shutdown of 2013 cost an estimated 120,000 jobs and \ndisrupted public and private credit markets so profoundly that the \ntotal estimated borrowing costs for the Federal Government, businesses, \nand homeowners during that crisis totaled approximately $70 million. \nDefaulting on our debt is simply not an option, and H.R. 629 is, as \nTreasury Secretary Jack Lew put it, ``default by another name.''\n  We cannot play this game. We need to be about the business of \nhonoring our obligations. The last time we went down this road our debt \nrating was lowered, and I suggest it may happen again.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Utah \n(Mr. Stewart).\n  Mr. STEWART. I would like to thank the gentlewoman for yielding me \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, I come from a family of educators. My father taught me \nin fifth grade. My brother and sister are both teachers. My wife is a \nteacher. One of my sons recently spent 2 years doing Teach for America \nin an inner-city school before he started graduate school.\n\n  Every weekend, it seemed, while he was teaching, we would hear \nstories and personal experiences of children who desperately needed \nhelp to get the education that they needed so they had any chance, any \nhope, of being successful in life.\n  And, finally, I am also the father of six children. I understand in a \ndeeply personal way how important it is that we teach our children and \neducate our children.\n  This idea goes back to Jamestown, 1609, where literally for the first \ntime in the history of the world we made a commitment that we would \neducate all of our children, that every village, every town, every \ncommunity would educate all of our children. That is what the SOAR \nprogram is about: giving all of our children the opportunity to \nsucceed.\n  So let's look at the program and see what it has accomplished. Since \n2004, more than 6,000 children have had the opportunity to attend a \nprivate school of their choice. This has changed the trajectory of \ntheir lives. More than 90\n\n[[Page H7043]]\n\npercent of them now graduate from high school, compared with 58 percent \nthroughout the rest of Washington, D.C. Eighty-eight percent of them go \non to a 2- or a 4-year university. Eighty-five percent of their parents \nexpress satisfaction with this program.\n  Why in the world would you want to take that away? How could you not \nsupport this program? How could you not want to give these children the \nopportunity to succeed? Why in the world would you put the interests of \nunions and teachers above the interests of these children who \ndesperately need our help?\n  I would ask my colleagues to support this rule and to support the \nunderlying legislation. Give these kids an opportunity to succeed. That \nis all we are asking for.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, would the Chair be kind enough to tell me \nhow much time remains for both sides.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 20 minutes \nremaining. The gentlewoman from North Carolina has 25 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Let me respond to the gentleman from Utah who spoke of his family's \nbackground and education.\n  Firstly, my former wife, who is now deceased, taught school for 35 \nyears, first and second grade. My son, who has his Ph.D., as my \nfriend's son is about the business of getting his graduate degree, \nworked in education, taught sixth grade for a number of years, and then \nrecruited schoolteachers for Palm Beach County and Broward County in \nFlorida.\n  The question was why would we not want to educate every child, and \nthe gentleman referenced a period in 1609 when we certainly were not \neducating every child. I went to school for the first time in 1941 to a \nschool that was built by Julius Rosenwald, and I recommend a \ndocumentary that is in the movies throughout the country now. Mr. \nRosenwald, at the insistence of Booker T. Washington, built schools for \nBlack children, 642 of them, in the South, where there were none.\n  My mother didn't have an opportunity to go to that school. Other \npeople in my town never had an opportunity to get an education, and you \ncome here and you talk about why would we not want this education.\n  If it is so good, then why isn't it everywhere? And why are you \npicking on the District of Columbia? Perhaps someone who knows that \nvery well will be able to tell us more than myself with my passion.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), \nmy very good friend, a member of the Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform.\n  Ms. NORTON. I thank my good friend from Florida for yielding and for \nhis passion for our children.\n  Mr. Speaker, the short answer to the gentleman who wants to know why \nwould we want to take away vouchers from these children is that we \ndon't want to take vouchers away from these children. We want those who \nare currently in the program to maintain their voucher until they \ngraduate.\n  But I should caution Members on both sides about voting for $100 \nmillion for a private school voucher program for a District that didn't \nask for it while the Republican majority has pending a $2 billion cut \nfor K-12 education for kids in their own districts.\n  The irony is that, when Newt Gingrich was Speaker, he first proposed \nprivate school vouchers, but as conservative as he was, he worked with \nme on a home rule public charter school alternative. The D.C. Council \nhad voted for charter schools, but there were only two or three \nfledgling schools and charters weren't going anywhere.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, there are 115 public charter schools in the \nDistrict, and the reason is that, with my support, Speaker Gingrich \nplaced H.R. 3019 in the 1995-1996 omnibus legislation establishing the \nD.C. public charter school board.\n  Today almost half of D.C. students go to publicly accountable charter \nschools, and most of these schools have long waiting lists. That, my \nfriend, is what choice looks like.\n  Another speaker has now stepped forward with a private school voucher \nprogram to be authorized for the third time today, although the \nevaluation that Congress mandated definitively shows that the program \nfailed to meet its stated goal to help children improve.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Vouchers did not improve math or reading scores for the children from \nlow-income neighborhoods in this program, and that was the reason for \nthe bill in the first place.\n  In light of that failure, I offered a compromise, and the President \nsupports it. All of the students in the current voucher program would \nremain until graduation, but no new students would be funded. That \nwould mean years of private school vouchers, but only in the District \nof Columbia, because this Congress has just voted down similar private \nschool vouchers for the Nation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Ms. NORTON. That, my friends, is what compromise looks like: first, \nphenomenal growth of public charter schools, which are supported by \nboth Congressional Republicans and Democrats; second, allowing all \ncurrent students to remain in private voucher schools until graduation. \nIf more compromises like this were on the floor, the majority would not \nbe divided into multiple factions that have nothing to show for years \nof leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, it is a big surprise to see a member of the \nminority opposing the provision of additional education funding to low-\nincome students.\n  My colleague earlier mentioned that some members of the D.C. Council \noppose H.R. 10. I would like to bring it to the attention of the House \nthat D.C. Councilwoman Anita Bonds has asked that her name be removed \nfrom that letter, saying: ``I am hopeful that many more of our neediest \nfamilies have the opportunity to take advantage of the program.'' She \nknows that students in public, charter, and private schools all benefit \nequally from this legislation, and I welcome her support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I now yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. McClintock).\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I \nwant to thank the Rules Committee for reporting H.R. 692 to the floor.\n  This Nation now staggers under more than $18 trillion of debt, nearly \na $7.5 trillion run up by this administration alone. The interest on \nthat debt is one of the fastest growing components of the Federal \nbudget. If there is ever any doubt over the security and reliability of \nthe debt owed by this government, the interest rates that lenders \ncharge us would quickly rise and overwhelm us.\n  Now, the Democrats say, well, just raise the debt limit, and, of \ncourse, we realize in this era of chronic deficit spending--\nestablishing new records under this administration--that we have to do \nso. Congress alone has the power to incur debt, and the debt limit is \nthe method by which we discharge our responsibility; but when we do so, \nit is also Congress' responsibility to review and revise the policies \nthat are driving that debt.\n  The fundamental problem under both Democratic and Republican \nCongresses is that this process is fraught with controversy. The bigger \nthe debt, the bigger the controversy; and the bigger the controversy, \nthe more likely that credit markets are to demand higher interest \npayments to meet their greater risk. Given the size of our debt, that \ncould produce an interest tidal wave that could sink our budget and our \nNation along with it.\n  The Default Prevention Act simply provides that, if the debt limit is \nreached, the Treasury Secretary may continue to borrow above that limit \nfor the sole purpose of paying principal and interest that is due. It \nis an absolute guarantee that the debt of the United States will be \nhonored.\n  Most States have various laws to guarantee payment of their debts. In \nfact, a few years ago, Ben Bernanke praised these State provisions for \nmaintaining confidence in their bonds. It amazes me that we can't all \nagree on this simple principle: that we should guarantee the loans made \nto the Federal Government. That is all this bill does.\n\n[[Page H7044]]\n\n  Yet we have heard opposition from the other side, and they basically \nmake two charges. One is that this pays foreign governments first while \nshorting our troops. We just heard that from the gentleman from \nFlorida. Well, what xenophobic nonsense. The fact is most of our debt \nis held by Americans--often, in pension funds--so it protects Americans \nfar more than foreign governments.\n  But they miss the main point. It is the Nation's credit that makes it \npossible to meet all of our other obligations. When you are living off \nyour credit card, as our Nation is at the moment, you had better make \nyour minimum payment first or you won't be able to pay all of your \nother bills.\n  In the veto threat, the President leveled the other charges we heard \nfrom the gentleman from Florida, that it is just an excuse for not \npaying our other bills. Well, do they actually believe that these other \nStates that have guaranteed their sovereign debts for generations have \never used these guarantees as an excuse not to pay their other bills? \nOn the contrary, by providing clear and unambiguous mandates to protect \ntheir credit first, they actually support and maintain their ability to \npay for all of their other obligations.\n  So let me be crystal clear: delaying payment on any of our \nobligations would be unprecedented and dangerous. There is one thing, \nthough, that could do even more damage than delaying payment on our \nother bills, and that is the mere threat of a default on our sovereign \ndebt. This measure takes that threat off the table, and it ensures \ncredit markets that their investments in the United States are as \ncertain as anything can be in life.\n  A few years ago, Senator Barack Obama vigorously and forcefully \nopposed a debt limit sought by the Bush administration. He said it was \na failure of leadership. Well, I have never equated Senator Obama's \nopposition to the debt limit increase as anything other than a \nprincipled and well-placed concern over the proper management of our \nfinances. It is sad that he cannot give the opposition the same \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. Speaker, we may disagree over the appropriate role of Congress in \nadjusting the debt limit, but at least can't we all agree that during \nthese disputes the sovereign debt of the United States is never in \ndoubt? That is all that this bill says; that is all that this bill \ndoes. Mr. Speaker, let's pass this rule and proceed with consideration \nof the bill.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from California referred to my comments as \n``xenophobic nonsense.'' I firmly disagree. It kind of gives xenophobia \na new meaning. I merely pointed out that a large portion of our debt is \nheld by other countries and that the legislation that he supports \nproposes to pay them before 80 million obligations that the Treasury \nDepartment has.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress has only 8 legislative days left to protect the \nfull faith and credit of the United States. If we defeat the previous \nquestion, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule and bring up \nlegislation that would allow--and I would ask the gentleman from \nCalifornia if he would support this--a clean extension of the debt \nceiling.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 4 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch) to discuss our proposal. My \nfriend from Vermont is a distinguished gentleman and a former Member of \nthe Rules Committee.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. Raising the debt ceiling has absolutely \nnothing to do at all with increasing government spending. It only has \nto do with whether America will pay its bills for obligations already \nincurred.\n  Many of those obligations, by the way, are for expenditures that I \nvigorously opposed: trillions of dollars on the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, unpaid for, and trillions of dollars in tax cuts for the \nvery wealthy that are unpaid for.\n  But the United States of America, in good times and bad, through \nRepublican Presidents and Democratic Presidents, in Republican-led and \nDemocratic-led Congresses, has always paid its bills--always. We have \ndone it for two reasons.\n  First, it is the right thing to do. A promise made is a promise kept. \nAn obligation incurred is an obligation honored. Mr. Speaker, a \nconfident nation keeps its word. A confident nation pays its bills, not \nsome of them. It pays all of them.\n  Second, running from our creditors, stiffing them, picking and \nchoosing whom to pay among them is as fiscally reckless as it is \ndishonorable. This new theory that America can actually consider it \nfeasible as an option to default is extremely dangerous and very \ncostly.\n  Mr. Speaker, in 2011, when this tactic was first seriously considered \nand we came on the brink of default, it cost U.S. taxpayers $19 billion \nin unnecessary interest charges. That is $19 billion that could have \nbeen used to fix our highways or invest in scientific research, or it \nis $19 billion that your side might have preferred for tax cuts, or we \ncould have split it. But that would have been half for tax cuts and \nhalf for investment. Yet we squandered that at the expense of the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  The use of the debt ceiling as a tactic to get your way on another \nissue is playing financial Russian roulette with America's credibility, \nwith the well-being of the American taxpayer and the full faith and \ncredit of the United States of America to meet all its obligations. We \nhave maintained that bond with ourselves and our creditors for over 200 \nyears, and this bill asks us to abandon it now.\n  How can it be that the party of Ronald Reagan can propose this \nlegislation? It was Ronald Reagan who said that denigration of the full \nfaith and credit of the United States would have substantial effects on \nthe domestic financial markets and the value of the dollar. He is \nright.\n  How can it be the party of Paul Ryan? The chair of our Ways and Means \nCommittee said that just refusing to vote for the debt ceiling, I don't \nthink that is a strategy.\n  Will the debt ceiling be raised? Does it have to be raised? Yes. \nReagan was right then, and Paul Ryan is right now.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to point out something that the proponents of \nthis legislation would prefer to keep in the dark. The entire reason \nthe debt ceiling must be raised now is to accommodate the budget that \nthey passed over my strong objection on March 25, 2015. The Price \nbudget, supported by 228 Republicans and opposed by 182 Democrats, \nprojected an increase of our debt limit of nearly $2 trillion. Today \nthat bill has become due, and the folks who supported that budget are \nrunning for the hills on acting on the debt ceiling that is required to \naccommodate the budget that they passed.\n  Mr. Speaker, this House now, as a result of the will of the American \npeople, is led by a Republican majority. It is a majority that we in \nthe minority have an obligation to do our best to work with. However, \nit is a majority that is raising questions that have never been raised \nbefore.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, they are using debt default and government \nshutdown as a tactic to get their way on an issue of concern to some of \nthem. I admire Speaker Boehner that he put the country first and he put \nthe House first in not letting this government be shut down over a real \ndispute on Planned Parenthood funding. But we have got to get past \nthis, and the Republican majority has to make a decision whether it is \ngoing to govern or it is going to empower those who believe that \ndefault and shutdown are legitimate tactics to resolve legitimate \ndebates that we have among us.\n  Mr. Speaker, we cannot now--we cannot ever--default on our \nobligations and our commitment to the American taxpayer to be fiscally \nresponsible by paying our bills.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North \nCarolina (Mr. Meadows).\n\n[[Page H7045]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 10, but I \nwanted to clarify some of the debate that has been going on with my \nfriend opposite, the gentleman from Florida.\n  Many of the concerns that he has raised have been addressed in our \nOversight and Government Reform Committee. Specifically, I put forth an \namendment that required strong evaluations that would evaluate the \nscholarship program. Additionally, the committee passed an amendment to \nensure not only strong accreditation standards as well, but equally \nimportant is the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia. I have made \na personal commitment to her to work on making sure that we have proper \naccountability with regard to this scholarship program. None of us \nwants to be loose with the American taxpayer dollars.\n  I want to also stress that this program does not decrease funding for \nD.C. public schools or charter schools. Indeed it is an addition to \nthat appropriation. But it really comes down this, Mr. Speaker: it is \nthe students that have benefited from this particular program.\n  I was part of a hearing that was held at Archbishop Carroll High \nSchool. When you look into the faces of those students that were given \nan opportunity with a scholarship to not have to go to the school \nbecause of where they live but they got a scholarship to be able to go \nto a private school, you look into their faces and you hear the stories \nof just how it has affected their families and given them hope, Mr. \nSpeaker, it is one of those things that I think that we have to find a \nbipartisan solution to identify the problem areas, perhaps, that need \nto be addressed, but to also come alongside those parents, both fathers \nand mothers, who were there in the hearing who were applauding the \nsuccesses of their children.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  It is with great pride that I strongly support H.R. 10. I encourage \nmy colleagues opposite to do the same. I am committed to working \nthrough some of those issues that they have addressed.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop).\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for \nyielding.\n  I am pleased to support this rule because of the underlying bill that \nis there.\n  Normally, the 10th Amendment says that education is delegated to the \nStates. So I would be opposing anything this body does on education, \nexcept the Constitution also grants Congress the jurisdiction over the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  When there is a program that is a success--and this has been a \nsuccess--a study by the Department of Education concluded that this \nD.C. Opportunity Scholarship significantly improves students' chances \nof graduating from high school.\n  I spent 28 years as a high school teacher. In that time, I saw all \nsorts of wonder programs being mandated from the Federal level and the \nState level. The most common expression of all teachers is ``This too \nshall pass.''\n  But the one thing that was never mandated to us was the concept of \nfreedom, allowing teachers to teach their specialties, allowing parents \nthe ability of having a choice on where they sent their kids. Choice is \na powerful tool.\n  When I was in the State legislature, I had a bill that dealt with \ncompulsory attendance. I had a PTA mother that came up to me once and \nsaid, ``I hate you and I hate your bill because, when my 17-year-old \ndoesn't want to go to school in the morning, I want to be able to look \nat him and say, `You have to go to school. It is the law.' '' And I \nthought: Thanks a lot. That is the exact attitude I want to have from a \nhigh school junior in my class when he shows up.\n  You see, when kids are forced to be where they choose not to be, they \nare unsatisfied jerks. But kids, knowing they had a choice, they would \nnow attend in a positive attitude, even if it was the same school.\n  That is what this bill tries to do. We trust choice in all sorts of \nbehaviors. We give people choices in food, in our homes, in our energy, \nand all the necessities of life. So why do we limit freedom and choice \nin something as important as education?\n  Ronald Reagan once said: ``Our leaders must remember that education \ndoesn't begin with some isolated bureaucrat in Washington. It doesn't \neven begin with State or local officials. Education begins in the home, \nwhere it's a parental right and responsibility. Both our public and our \nprivate schools exist to aid our families in the instruction of our \nchildren, and it's time some people back in Washington stopped acting \nas if family wishes were only getting in the way.''\n  I applaud Speaker Boehner for this bill. Speaker Boehner, when it \ncomes to kids, clearly gets it, and he has been an advocate on their \nbehalf. Kids belong to the parents, not to an educator, not to a \nlegislator, not to a special interest group.\n  It is time we start trusting parents and individuals, which is why I \nurge support of this rule that will bring this bill, a good bill, to \nthe floor for us to support as well.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen).\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  I rise in support of the rule and urge specific passage of H.R. 10, \nthe Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Reauthorization Act.\n  Over 10 years ago Congress took action to give the children of the \nDistrict a hand-up through access to a quality education by creating \nthe D.C. Opportunity Scholarship program. I was heavily involved at \nthat time, as a Member of the House Appropriations Committee that \noversaw the District's budget, and our committee provided the initial \nfunds.\n  The program was the first and only initiative in America where the \nFederal Government provides low-income families with funds to send \ntheir children where they will have a chance to thrive--private or \nparochial schools--because, in some cases, some D.C. schools were not \nproviding that opportunity. That is not all schools, but some schools.\n  We all know the story of some District of Columbia public schools--\nlow graduation rates, high dropout rates, low math and reading scores--\nthat need to do better. We can all agree that all children in the \nDistrict deserve a first-class education and the lifelong benefits that \ncome from that education, whether it be public, private, parochial, or \ncharter.\n  The bill before us today will reauthorize the D.C. Opportunity \nScholarship program for 5 years. By the way, the program is a huge \nsuccess. Last year over 3,600 students submitted applications and the \nprogram enrolled nearly 1,500 students.\n  Through these scholarships, District children have flourished. In \n2014, 88 percent of high school graduates who were enrolled in the D.C. \nOpportunity Scholarship program enrolled in 2- or 4-year colleges, a \nvery high mark.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress should listen to the voices of parents, as we \ndid 10 years ago, who want their children to succeed, and we should \ncontinue to work to ensure that the program not only survives, but that \nit grows.\n  I commend Speaker Boehner for all his years of leadership on behalf \nof the children of Washington not only in terms of his support for this \nlegislation, but many things he does as a private citizen.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in support of the rule and this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We should be working together to ensure that all children have the \nopportunity to receive a quality education and taking action to \nguarantee that the United States pays all of its bills on time and in \nfull. Neither of these bills accomplish those vitally necessary goals \nfor this great country.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the previous question \nand vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  These are crucial bills. They make significant progress on two \nimportant issues: addressing our fiscal crisis in a\n\n[[Page H7046]]\n\nresponsible manner and the education of our next generation.\n  We cannot squander the incredible wealth this country has built over \ndecades of hard work by the American people. The full faith and credit \nof the United States is not ours here, as Members of Congress. It is \ntheirs, the American people. We are the reserve currency because \nindividuals across the world look to us for prudent fiscal choices and \nrock-steady resolve in our principles and integrity.\n\n  There are few debates more contentious in this body than those over \nspending levels or the leverage points that our system provides to \nexert control over those levels.\n  The Default Prevention Act would enable us to continue to fight tooth \nand nail over the right direction for our country's finances while \ngiving Americans and financial markets certainty that they can remain \nconfident in the Federal Government meeting its obligations.\n  We can and should stay up late at night and have passionate debates \nin this Chamber over how to address mandatory spending, but we \nshouldn't allow retired and disabled Americans to stay up late at night \nbecause they fear their Social Security checks won't arrive.\n  The Default Prevention Act is commonsense legislation to remove \ncatastrophe as a possibility by enabling the Secretary of the Treasury \nto issue debt necessary to make principal and interest payments on the \nnational debt and pay Social Security benefits in full. It is the right \nfirst step in beginning a conversation about how to constructively \naddress our immense fiscal challenges.\n  If we don't address those challenges, we will be unable to provide \nfor other important programs, such as the Scholarships for Opportunity \nand Results Reauthorization Act, or SOAR Reauthorization Act, which \nthis resolution provides for consideration of as well.\n  As any parent knows, the education of our children is one of our \nhighest priorities. For far too long children in Washington, D.C., have \nnot received the education they deserve, but have suffered from \nunacceptable achievement levels in graduation rates.\n  The SOAR Reauthorization Act continues a successful three-sector \napproach to improving the lives and educational outcomes of low-income \nstudents in the District. It provides $60 million in funding for \nstudents, split equally among D.C. public schools, charter schools, and \nscholarships for students to attend private schools that would \notherwise be out of reach.\n  Students receiving private school education have demonstrated higher \ntest scores and significantly higher graduation rates, showcasing the \nimportance of continuing students access to these institutions.\n  These programs are an important example of the need for innovation \nand experimentation in how to best reform our educational system to \nbenefit students, not entrenched interests.\n  It has been an honor for me to personally witness some of the \nstudents who have benefited from the programs included in the SOAR \nReauthorization Act. After seeing the hope for the future these \nstudents have in their eyes, I cannot fathom preventing other students \nfrom receiving their own second chances.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe both of these underlying bills are positive \nsteps forward on issues of great import to our Nation, and I commend \nthem and this rule providing for their consideration to all of my \ncolleagues for their support.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nRule and the underlying bill H.R. 10, the Scholarships for Opportunity \nand Results Reauthorization Act.\n  H.R. 10 would reauthorize the District of Columbia private school \nvoucher program, the Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP), for five \nyears through 2021.\n  In 2004, Congress established OSP, the first and only federally \ncreated or funded elementary and secondary private school voucher \nprogram in the United States.\n  In 2011, Congress reauthorized OSP through fiscal year 2016 in the \nScholarships for Opportunity and Results Act (SOAR Act).\n  Under the SOAR Act, DC households with incomes that do not exceed 185 \npercent of the poverty line may receive an annual maximum voucher \npayment per student of $8,000 for grades K-8 and $12,000 for grades 9-\n12.\n  In addition, H.R. 10 makes a significant change to the evaluation of \nOSP's effectiveness.\n  The bill prohibits a control study group in making evaluations of the \nOSP and requires a less rigorous ``quasi-experimental research design'' \nthan under the SOAR Act.\n  Since 2004, almost $190 million has been spent on DC voucher schools. \nThat is money that could have been spent on District public schools, \nwhich serve all students.\n  Instead of working on longer term solutions, such as reauthorizing \nESEA, or working on job creation, the Majority is pushing its own \neducation priorities on a local jurisdiction through this misguided \nlegislation.\n  This bill pursues the wrong course by doing the following:\n  The voucher program is the latest Republican attack on the District \nof Columbia's right to self-government.\n  The local District government did not request this reauthorization \nnor did its only member of Congress, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton.\n  If the District wants to establish a voucher program, it has the \nauthority to do so.\n  Republicans have already tried to overturn DC's gun, marijuana, \nabortion, needle exchange, and non-discrimination laws.\n  They have also threatened DC's mayor with jail time over the city's \nmarijuana law. Now they want to write education law in DC.\n  The bill would authorize the use of federal funds to pay for private \nschool tuition in the District of Columbia, despite overwhelming \nevidence that the program, first authorized in 2004, has failed to \nimprove student academic achievement, as measured by math and reading \nscores--including among the students the program was designed to most \nbenefit, those from low-performing public schools.\n  Despite having numerous states vote down efforts to implement private \nschool voucher programs; Republicans continue to use the District of \nColumbia as a testing ground for their own agenda.\n  The bill does not recognize that 44 percent of DC public school \nstudents attend charter schools, and 75 percent of DC public school \nstudents attend out-of-boundary public schools.\n  Unlike private schools, traditional public and charter schools are \npublicly accountable and subject to all civil rights laws.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this \nrule and the underlying bill.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:\n\n     An Amendment to H. Res. 480 Offered by Mr. Hastings of Florida\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     3737) to responsibly pay our Nation's bills on time by \n     temporarily extending the public debt limit, and for other \n     purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed \n     with. All points of order against consideration of the bill \n     are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and \n     shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by \n     the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     Ways and Means. After general debate the bill shall be \n     considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All \n     points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At \n     the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the \n     Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with \n     such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous \n     question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and \n     amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 3737.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the\n\n[[Page H7047]]\n\n     control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on \nthis question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7047-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7047-H7050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1937, NATIONAL STRATEGIC AND \n                CRITICAL MINERALS PRODUCTION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield \nthe customary 30 minutes to the good gentleman from Colorado (Mr. \nPolis), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Washington?\n  There was no objection.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, just yesterday, the Rules \nCommittee met and reported a rule for House Resolution 481, providing \nfor the consideration of an important piece of legislation--H.R. 1937, \nthe National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2015.\n  This rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 1937 under a \nstructured rule, with five amendments made in order, four of which, I \nmight point out, were offered by Democratic Members of this body. \nTherefore, this rule provides for a balanced, deliberative, and open \ndebate if we focus our remarks on the merits of the National Strategic \nand Critical Minerals Production Act and don't go off on unnecessary \ntangents.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support both House Resolution 481 and \nthe underlying bill, H.R. 1937. I would like to congratulate the \ngentleman from Nevada (Mr. Amodei) for sponsoring this legislation, and \nI would also like to thank the gentleman from Utah, Chairman Rob \nBishop, for his leadership on this important issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, this rule will allow us to consider the National \nStrategic and Critical Minerals Production Act, an important bill that \nwill streamline our country's mine permitting processes to remove \nunnecessary and burdensome bureaucratic hurdles, which can delay some \nmining activities and projects by up to a decade--10 years--which is an \noutrageous amount of time that is indicative of the problem we seek to \naddress here today.\n  The permitting system the Federal Government currently uses to \nprovide for the extraction of rare earth minerals in the U.S. is \noutdated, unproductive, and, more often than not, hinders our ability \nto extract these critical resources. This red tape has a devastating \nimpact on communities across the country and in the West, particularly, \nthat rely on the ability to obtain and develop these minerals for \neconomic growth and our Nation's security.\n  Our country is blessed with a myriad of rare earth minerals that are \nincreasingly used to manufacture high-tech equipment as well as many \nother everyday applications and products. Many countries around the \nworld are already working to improve their infrastructure, providing \nthe United States with an exceptional opportunity to play a major role \nin the growing minerals marketplace by supplying foreign countries and \nbusinesses, as well as domestic companies, with the resources necessary \nto remain competitive in the international economy. However, a lack of \ncommunication between local, State, and Federal permitting agencies \nexists, and it creates a bureaucratic backlog of applications that \ndelays mining activity by approximately, like I said, 7 to 10 years, \nwhich, if not addressed, will impede the ability of U.S. mineral \ncompanies to increase their share of the global marketplace.\n  Mr. Speaker, due to onerous government red tape, the frivolous \nlawsuits that result, and a burdensome permitting process, good-paying \njobs in the United States mining industry have moved overseas and have \nput domestic manufacturing jobs at the mercy of our foreign \ncompetitors. H.R. 1937 would fix\n\n[[Page H7048]]\n\nour outdated and uncertain bureaucratic permitting system, which \nnegatively impacts investment in our economy by discouraging domestic \ncompanies from extracting and developing these critical minerals.\n  This is especially unfortunate given that we have only begun to \nscratch the surface of what we can potentially develop from our \nabundant natural resources, which have played such a critical role in \nmaking the U.S. a leading world economy and industrial power. Our \nNation has vast energy potential from sources such as coal, oil shale, \nand natural gas, as well as numerous critical minerals that we should \nbe developing. Yet the development of our domestic minerals resources \nhas been obstructed time and time again under this administration, \nwhich, unfortunately, places the political goals of special interests \nover the welfare and well-being of hardworking Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, simply put, the Federal Government should promote \ninvestments in the U.S. and in American companies by creating a \nregulatory framework that encourages the safe development of domestic \nresources. If we are going to address the growing mineral trade \nimbalance--with more U.S. mining jobs moving overseas and higher energy \nand commodity prices here at home--we must first put a stop to the \nbureaucratic delays that are at the root of the problem.\n  This legislation does just that by telling Federal agencies to make a \ndecision about whether a project should move forward or not--a simple \n``yes'' or ``no''--and do it in a timely manner. Give people certainty. \nWe have streamlined and improved this process for other domestic \nindustries, and it is now time to do it for our rare earth minerals \nsector, which is responsible for some of the highest paying middle \nclass jobs across the country. It is illogical and irrational that red \ntape and delayed permit approvals can lead to 10 years of deliberation \nover whether or not to approve a mining permit or project. Actually, it \nborders on insanity.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule, allowing for the \nconsideration of an important piece of legislation that will provide \nthe U.S. with a unique opportunity to tap into the growing global \nmarketplace for rare earth minerals by supplying both foreign and \ndomestic companies with the resources they need to remain competitive.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support the rule's adoption, and I urge my colleagues \nto support both the rule and the underlying bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying \nbill--the so-called Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act.\n  My colleague from Washington mentioned what is not being discussed \nhere today. Again, to be clear, it feels like we are at Groundhog Day \nhere. We have 8 legislative days until we hit the debt limit and \ndefault on our Nation's debt. In 6 legislative days, the Federal \ntransportation authorization will expire. In 22 legislative days, we \nwill be on the brink of yet another government shutdown. To a certain \nextent, I feel like we are fiddling while Rome burns. Here we are, \ntalking about an issue which, I am sure, deserves its day in the Sun. I \nwill talk about some of the deficiencies in this bill, but we are \ntackling a recycled bill that in similar form has already passed this \nbody and that doesn't address any of these urgent deadline items that \nwe are actually facing.\n  In fact, as I travel across my district in Colorado, I don't hear a \nlot of my constituents crying out for access to sand and clay. I do \nhear them saying, ``Don't default on the national debt.'' ``Do \nsomething about the budget.'' ``Make sure that we prevent another \ngovernment shutdown.'' Yet all of those deadlines are looming while we \nare fiddling here with other bills that aren't going anywhere and \naren't becoming law and have already passed this body in similar form. \nSo, for the fourth time in three Congresses, we are going to consider a \nnearly identical measure that the Republicans have brought to the floor \ndespite the Senate's unwillingness to pick it up and the President's \nopposition.\n\n  The so-called Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act promotes \nindustry interests over the American people's health and welfare. The \nbiggest conceptual problem with it is the definition that it gives of \n``strategic and critical minerals.'' The bill not only expands the \nmining companies' ability to mine on public lands for minerals like \ngold and copper, but also materials that one would think, by no stretch \nof common sense, are rare, like sand and clay.\n  If we include sand from the beach or from my kids' sandbox as a \nmineral of critical development and if we include the gravel from my \ndriveway as a mineral of critical development, I am not sure what we \nare excluding. I think this applies to almost everything. In fact, I am \nnot even sure how we are even saying the term ``critical and \nstrategic'' can even apply here when we are talking about sand and \ngravel and some of the most common natural resources that we have.\n  This bill permits nearly all mining operations to circumvent the \nimportant public health and environmental review processes that are \nrequired under the National Environmental Policy Act.\n  Instead of maintaining a reasonable threshold to ensure that we focus \non resources and developing resources that are actually critical for \nour defense or for our economy, this bill expands our definition of \n``strategic and critical,'' effectively making it worthless. By \nincluding everything and by saying everything is strategic and \ncritical, you are effectively saying that nothing is strategic and \ncritical. That is what this bill does while we are 8 days from hitting \nthe debt limit, while we are 6 days from expiring on the Federal \ntransportation authorization.\n  By the way, I have to talk about how these ``days'' work because we \nare 8 days from the debt limit and 6 days from the transportation \nauthorization. Those aren't real days that Americans know. That is \nbecause the Republicans always send this Congress on vacation nearly \nevery week. So it might be 6 legislative days. I think it is, actually, \n15 or 20 days, but Congress isn't working for most of those. While \nthese deadlines tick, Members of Congress are actually at home most of \nthe time because the Republican leadership won't let us work. They \nwon't let us come here. They are adjourning the session. That is why, \nwhen something is 20 days off, we are sounding alarm bells, saying it \nis 6 days off--because they are only letting us work 6 of those 20 \ndays. I would be happy to show up for the other 14, Mr. Speaker, but \nyou wouldn't be here to gavel us into session.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, a point of parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. POLIS. What would happen if I showed up and you were not here to \ngavel us down into session?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will not respond to a hypothetical \nquestion.\n  Mr. POLIS. Maybe we will just have to try that sometime when we are 2 \nor 3 days from the expiration of our transportation funding or from \ndefaulting on our national debt. I will be happy to come here to an \nempty Chamber.\n  I recall one time, Mr. Speaker, when you and the Republican majority \naccidentally left the cameras on, and our Democratic whip, Steny Hoyer, \nwas on the floor, demanding why we couldn't bring up a bill. Maybe, if \nI am here and if you are not here, Mr. Speaker, we can get those C-SPAN \ncameras turned on when we are 2 or 3 days from a deadline so that the \nAmerican people understand this funny math, where somehow 20 days is \nonly 6 legislative days because you don't let us work the other 14, \nwhen hardworking Americans have to go to work every day to support \ntheir families.\n  This bill's impacts are far reaching. As drafted, it makes the term \n``critical and strategic'' meaningless. The legislation would increase \nthe pollution of our water resources for States dealing with extreme \ndrought conditions and deadly blazes. The last thing we need is to \njeopardize our already scarce sources of water. We can't afford to do \nany more harm to the quality of our limited water supplies and to risk \nthe jobs that are created across the West\n\n[[Page H7049]]\n\nthrough outdoor recreation, leisure, and agriculture.\n  Why the House Republicans see a need for legislation to further \npromote mining interests at the expense of public health continues to \nbe mystifying. The industry already has free rein to extract mineral \nresources. Under the antiquated 1872 mining law, Federal land managers \nare actually barred from denying hard rock mining proposals. The Bureau \nof Land Management and the Forest Service have almost never denied a \nlarge mining process. Why exempt them further from all environmental \nreview for sand and gravel, which aren't even rare elements?\n  This bill fails to update the antiquated legal framework. It fails to \naddress the reforms needed. It fails to protect our environment. It \ndoesn't change the fact that mining companies currently enjoy--guess \nwhat, Mr. Speaker. What do you think--a 3 percent royalty rate? What do \nthey pay--a 2 percent royalty rate? Do they pay a 1 percent royalty \nrate? No. They pay a zero percent royalty rate on Federal land. This \nbill fails to address that. It doesn't change the fact that mining \ncompanies have left an estimated half a million mines. That is nearly \none for every person in my district, Mr. Speaker. Half a million mines \nall across the country have been abandoned, most of which are in dire \nneed of cleanup or restoration, which this bill fails to address.\n  I had the opportunity to introduce a bill with Ranking Member \nGrijalva earlier this year that would have addressed many of these \nongoing failures in mining accountability, but it hasn't been brought \nup before the committee. Instead, legislation like this, the so-called \nStrategic and Critical Minerals Production Act, is rocketed to the \nfloor even though it has passed four times in the last three sessions.\n  Instead of confronting real challenges facing our economy, facing \nAmerican families, we continue to line the pockets of the mining \nindustry, which already has one of the fattest profit margins of any, \nwhile risking the health of the American people and exploiting our \nnatural resources without adequate return and royalties to the \ntaxpayers, who own our public lands.\n  I oppose the rule and the underlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I \nam prepared to close.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up legislation that would permanently \nauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The Land and Water \nConservation Fund supports the protection of public lands and waters, \nsuch as natural parks, forests, and recreation areas.\n  Many conservation organizations from my district and nationally have \nbeen in to meet with me on this important topic, and I know they have \nreached out to other Members on the Hill as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, the Strategic and Critical Minerals \nProduction Act--again, it is hard to say that name with a straight face \nwhen they are defining strategic and critical minerals in such a broad \nway that it involves basically the dirt under our feet, the sand under \nour feet, the gravel in our drive. When you define something like that \nand try to mean everything, you wind up meaning nothing.\n  Rather than actually doing something to protect minerals that are \ncritical for our defense, for our economy, this bill waters that down \nby expanding this access to sand and dirt and gravel, maximizing mining \ncompanies' profits at the expense of our health, our water, our land, \nand our natural resources.\n  Furthermore, the underlying bill would damage our economy by placing \nthe use of the mining industry above the many other important economic \nuses of our public lands. I will give you some examples. How about \nhunting? angling? hiking? biking? These are the economic drivers in my \ndistrict, Mr. Speaker.\n  If we didn't have an environmental review process and large gravel \npits and silver mines were put in place with wild abandon, we would \nlose jobs. We would lose most jobs in Eagle and Summit Counties which \nrelate to the tourism industry. The beautiful, pristine, outdoor public \nlands that attract visitors from across the country--probably from your \ndistrict, Mr. Speaker--Vail, Breckenridge, Winter Park, and Rocky \nMountain National Park, we would love to have you; but you better come \nquickly before this bill becomes law, because there won't be much to \nsee if it does.\n  When visiting my constituents in Colorado this summer, expanding \nmining access was not one of the issues that they brought up. In fact, \nthey asked me to ensure that mining companies are held accountable to \ngreater levels of accountability and transparency. They asked me to \ndevelop environmental safeguards to make sure that disasters and \ntragedies don't occur and that abandoned mines are cleaned up and that \nour extraction industry can be done in a thoughtful way, and to make \nsure it doesn't destroy jobs by conflicting with other higher and \nbetter economic uses of some parcels of public land.\n  Look, Members on both sides of the aisle support the development of \nrare earth and critical mineral policy. There is no disagreement about \nthat. I would be happy to work with my colleague, Mr. Speaker, from \nWashington State and others on putting together a commonsense bill that \ndefines rare earth and critical minerals in a commonsense way. Not the \ndirt beneath our feet, not the sand in my kid's sandbox, but in a \ncommonsense way where we look at the needs of industry, our supply, we \ndefine it, and we come up with a targeted access plan, including access \nto our public lands in appropriate ways, that is expedited for national \npriority items. That is not what this bill does.\n  We could work together, Mr. Speaker. And this body needs to work \ntogether, not just on this bill, but to avoid defaulting on our \nnational debt, to continue to fund our highways and infrastructure, in \nfact, to keep government open. We might only have 11 legislative days \nto try to keep government open.\n  By the way, I think that is 30-some actual days for most Americans, \nMr. Speaker. As we talked about, you won't be here, Mr. Speaker. If \nthere is a way that I can be here and advance an agenda of keeping \ngovernment open, I would be happy to, but I am afraid it requires a \nSpeaker to gavel us in.\n  Now, there are bills that seek to balance the challenges of mining \nwith its impact on surrounding communities, but, unfortunately, Mr. \nSpeaker, my colleagues weren't interested in discussing those. Instead \nwe are discussing a recycled bill for the fourth time that would \neliminate environmental review, allow for the unfettered mining of \npublic lands, define critical minerals in such a way that it means the \ndirt between your toes and the sand in your kid's sandbox. It would \nlikely not be brought up by the Senate and dead on arrival at the \nPresident's desk.\n  This is a job-destroying bill that the American people are not even \nasking Congress to take up. It takes a simple concept--preserving \naccess to critical resources, which would have strong bipartisan \nsupport--and contorts it into a divisive job-destroying, health-\ndestroying, commonsense-defying issue that doesn't appear anywhere on \nthe priority list of struggling families across the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the \nprevious question and to vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 481 is a fair rule allowing for \nbalanced, deliberative, and open debate, just as my colleague is \nasking, as well as numerous amendment opportunities from both parties.\n  It provides for the consideration of a bill that is critical to the \neconomic\n\n[[Page H7050]]\n\nwell-being of mining communities across the country, which are reeling \nfrom the continual impacts of Federal regulation and the bureaucratic \npermitting process we have in place.\n  This regulatory environment has led to lost jobs and wages in the \nmining industry, ultimately hurting the middle class families that many \nof these rules and regulations claim they are intended to protect.\n  H.R. 1937 streamlines our country's mine permitting process by \nremoving unnecessary and onerous hurdles, which can lead to decades-\nlong delays for mining activities and projects. The current Federal \npermitting system for the extraction of rare earth minerals is \noutdated, unproductive, and often impedes our ability to extract these \ncritical minerals.\n  You know, our country is blessed with a myriad of rare earth \nminerals, but this Federal red tape has had a devastating impact on the \nmining communities in our country whose livelihoods depend on the \nability to obtain and develop these resources.\n  We must stop punishing middle class Americans with these heavyhanded \nand poorly considered regulations that more often than not have \nunintended consequences and serious negative economic impacts.\n  Mr. Speaker, already many countries around the world are looking to \nimprove their infrastructure, which provides the U.S. with the unique \nopportunity to tap into this growing global market. Due to strong \ninternational demand for rare earth minerals, allowing for greater \ndevelopment of domestic resources also creates a unique opportunity to \nfurther American trade relationships and decrease our trade deficit.\n\n  Additionally, by increasing the available supply of these rare earth \nminerals, manufacturing companies will be able to more efficiently \nproduce their products, which could reduce consumer costs and open the \ndoor to greater innovation. Further, our outdated permitting system \nnegatively impacts investment in our economy that hinders our ability \nto take on this expanded role in the global marketplace for these \nmineral resources.\n  The Federal Government should be promoting investment in the U.S. by \ncreating a regulatory framework that encourages the safe development of \ndomestic resources. If we want to address the growing minerals trade \nimbalance, as we see more and more U.S. mining jobs moving overseas and \nhigher energy and commodity prices here at home, then we must fix these \ndelays which are at the root of the problem.\n  Mr. Speaker, this rule allows for consideration of an important piece \nof legislation that will address the burdensome permitting and \nregulatory hurdles that are harmful to this vital industry. Yet, while \nthis legislation allows for greater utilization of domestic resources, \nit also maintains important environmental safeguards designed to ensure \nthe health of our constituents and ecosystems, striking an important \nbalance that has been absent far too long.\n  While my colleague from Colorado and I may have a few differences of \nopinion, I firmly believe this rule and the underlying bill are strong \nmeasures that are critically important to our country's future, both \nfor my State as well as his and many, many others in this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support the rule's adoption, and I urge my colleague \nto support House Resolution 481, and the underlying bill.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n      An Amendment to H. Res. 481 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     1814) to permanently reauthorize the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on Natural Resources. After general debate the bill \n     shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. \n     All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 1814.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 480, \nI call up the bill (H.R. 692) to ensure the payment of interest and \nprincipal of the debt of the United States, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration in the House.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 480, the bill \nis considered read.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                H.R. 692\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Default Prevention Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON PUBLIC DEBT AND \n                   SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the event that the debt of the United \n     States Government, as defined in section 3101 of title 31, \n     United States Code, reaches the statutory limit, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury shall, in addition to any other \n     authority provided by law, issue obligations under chapter 31 \n     of title 31, United States Code, to pay with legal tender, \n     and solely for the purpose of paying, the principal and \n     interest on obligations of the United States described in \n     subsection (b) after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Obligations Described.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, obligations described in this subsection are \n     obligations which are--\n       (1) held by the public, or\n       (2) held by the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund \n     and Disability Insurance Trust Fund.\n       (c) Prohibition on Compensation for Members of Congress.--\n     None of the obligations issued under subsection (a) may be \n     used to pay compensation for Members of Congress.\n       (d) Obligations Exempt From Public Debt Limit.--Obligations \n     issued under subsection (a) shall not be taken into account \n     in applying the limitation in section 3101(b) of title 31, \n     United States Code, to the extent that such obligation would \n     otherwise cause the limitation in section 3101(b) of title \n     31, United States Code, to be exceeded.\n       (e) Report on Certain Actions.--\n       (1) In general.--If, after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury exercises his \n     authority under subsection (a), the Secretary shall \n     thereafter submit a report each week the authority is in use \n     providing an accounting relating to--\n       (A) the principal on mature obligations and interest that \n     is due or accrued of the United States, and\n\n[[Page H7054]]\n\n       (B) any obligations issued pursuant to subsection (a).\n       (2) Submission.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     be submitted to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House \n     of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the \n     Senate.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and \nthe gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 692, the Default \nPrevention Act, currently under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you want to guarantee that the United States will \nnever default, then you should vote for this bill. If you want to \nprotect working families from the consequences of default, then you \nshould vote for this bill. If you want to make sure that seniors get \nevery dime of their Social Security, then vote for this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill does not raise the debt limit, but it \neliminates the threat of default. The full faith and credit of our \ncountry is too important to put at risk. What this bill says is very \nsimple. It says that we will never fail to pay our debts. That is just \nit. That is all it does. It is just paying our debts.\n  We know the consequences of default. We know it would shake the \nworld's confidence in us. We know that it could freeze up credit across \nthis country. That is why with this bill, we are taking default off the \ntable. It is common sense.\n  I want to thank Mr. McClintock for developing this legislation, and I \nask my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield the remainder of my time to the \ngentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Jenkins) and ask unanimous consent that \nshe be able to control the time from here on.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me just say at the beginning what needs to be said \nat the end. This doesn't take default off the table. This is an effort \nto obscure the reality. It does not take default off in any meaningful \nway.\n  Default by any other name is default, and essentially what this bill \ndoes is to address part of the problem but leave the rest of it very \nmuch outstanding and very much there. This bill plays with fire. This \nbill essentially--essentially--attacks the credit of the United States \nof America.\n  The Republicans are at it once again. In 2011, they played with it, \nthey played with fire, and America was burned. The stock market \nplunged. The S downgraded for the first time in history the credit of \nthis country. It lowered private pension balances. It essentially \nincreased the cost of mortgages for people in this country. That wasn't \nenough. That in 2013 the Republicans played with fire and shut down the \ngovernment. We lost 120,000 jobs. We slowed GDP growth, and there was \nan increase of $70 million in terms of the cost of financing debt.\n  So what is this really all about? What it is about is paying China \nand other foreign governments first and essentially putting at risk \nmillions of Americans. So I just want to refer to who is at risk here. \nWho would be subject to default?\n  Payments and benefits to 1.4 million Active-Duty troops, their pay is \nat risk; benefits to almost 4 million disabled veterans; payment for \nhealth care for 5.9 million veterans; education assistance for over 1 \nmillion; and loan support for homes for over 500,000 or 600,000 \nveterans. And then payments to small businesses would be put at risk, \npayments to physicians under Medicare, payments to 30 million-plus kids \nin terms of their meals, and payments to hundreds of thousands of \ngrantees of NIH.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, that is really what this is all about. Nine percent \nof the expenditures of this country are going to be safeguarded, mostly \nfor foreign investors, and 30 percent in terms of Social Security \npayments. That means 60 percent would be at risk, 60 percent of the 80 \nto 100 million payments each month.\n  So, essentially, what the Republicans are doing is creating, here, a \ncamouflage. But the problem with it is that it is so transparent. It \nmight be as a purpose to try to find a few more votes on the Republican \nside, but when the camouflage is so obvious, I don't think it will \nwork.\n  The administration has stated its position. That position is very \nclear, and I want to read from this Statement of Administration Policy. \nI quote the last paragraph:\n\n       The President will not tolerate political gamesmanship, \n     which caused the Nation's credit rating to be downgraded in \n     2011 and proved harmful to both the United States and the \n     global economy. For this reason, if the President is \n     presented with legislation that would result in the Congress' \n     choosing to default on our obligations and imperil the full \n     faith and credit of the United States, he would veto it.\n\n  So this bill cannot become law. So why do it? Why not simply face up \nto the need to address the full faith and credit of the United States? \nI think the answer is this isn't policy, this is a ploy, and ploys \nshould not be used putting at risk the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States and payments at risk for millions and millions of \nAmericans. That is really what this is all about.\n  This is irresponsible. This is indefensible. The only possible reason \nfor passing a bill that can't go anywhere is maybe to pick up a few \nvotes here. That is irresponsible in terms of the full faith and credit \nof this beloved country of ours.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge strong opposition to this. When this \ncame up once before, I think every Democrat voted ``no''--every \nDemocrat. So we are supposed to be kind of in a new era talking about \nbipartisanship. We are supposed to be, once again, thinking maybe we \ncan act together. Instead, what we have here is a bill by Republicans \nessentially acting alone. It is a serious mistake.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 5 minutes \nto the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock), the author of the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill simply guarantees that the sovereign debt of \nthe United States will be paid in full and on time--period. How could \nthat possibly be controversial? Yet in today's political environment, \nit is.\n  The sovereign debt of the United States is what makes it possible for \nus to pay all of our other obligations in this era of chronic deficit \nspending that we are now in. This bill provides an absolute guarantee \nof that credit.\n  Although the Constitution explicitly commands that the public debt of \nthe United States is not to be questioned, it provides no practical \nmechanism to achieve this aim. This bill provides that mechanism. It \nsays that, whenever we reach the debt limit, the Treasury Secretary can \ncontinue to borrow to pay interest and principal on the debt.\n  It amazes me that many of our friends on the other side of the aisle \nsupport loan guarantees to foreign corporations and to special interest \ngroups, but they are unwilling to guarantee the loans to our own \ngovernment.\n  Mr. Speaker, the national debt is now larger than the entire economy. \nIt has doubled in the last decade. The interest on that debt is the \nfastest growing component of the Federal budget. It threatens to exceed \nour entire defense budget in just 8 years.\n  If there is ever any doubt over the security and reliability of the \ndebt owed by this government, the rates we pay to service our debt \nwould quickly rise and sink our country in a tidal wave of red ink.\n  Now, this is not a substitute for raising the debt limit. We all \nrecognize that in this era of chronic deficit spending under this \nadministration that is going to have to happen. We have a \nresponsibility to raise the debt limit, but we also have a \nresponsibility\n\n[[Page H7055]]\n\nto review the policies that are driving that debt.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  The Default Prevention Act says loudly and clearly to the world that, \nno matter how much we may differ and quarrel here in Washington, the \nsovereign debt of this Nation is guaranteed and that their loans to it \nare absolutely safe.\n  We hear the charge that this would pay debts owed to foreign \ngovernments before paying our own troops. Actually, more than half of \nour debt is held by Americans, often in American pension funds. China \nholds just 7 percent. But whether our loans come from China or from \nCharleston, without the Nation's credit, we cannot pay our troops or \nmeet all of our other obligations.\n  Opponents charge that this is an excuse not to pay our other debts. \nWell, what nonsense. This maintains the credit that is necessary to pay \nour other debts.\n  Most States guarantee that their sovereign debt will be secure and \nthey have done so for generations. Do our friends actually suggest that \nany of these States has ever used these guarantees as an excuse not to \npay their other bills? On the contrary, by protecting their credit \nfirst, they actually support and maintain their ability to pay for all \nof their other obligations.\n  The President contends that this is tantamount to a family saying it \nwould make its house payment, but not its car payment. I sure hope he \nis getting better economic advice than that.\n  But let's continue the analogy. If the family is living on its credit \ncards, as we are as a Nation, it had better make the minimum payment on \nits credit card first or it won't be able to pay all the rest of its \nbills.\n  And when that family has to increase its credit limit because it is \nnot spending within its means, it had better have a serious \nconversation about what is driving its debt and what to do about it.\n  Principled disputes over how the debt limit is addressed are going to \nhappen from time to time. Just a few years ago then-Senator Barack \nObama vigorously opposed an increase in the debt limit sought by the \nBush administration.\n  When these controversies erupt, as they inevitably do in a free \nsociety, it is imperative that credit markets are supremely confident \nthat their loans to the United States are secure.\n  Providing such a guarantee would prevent a future debt crisis and \ngive Congress the calm it needs to negotiate the changes that must be \nmade to bring our debt under control as we authorize still more debt.\n  The voices in opposition to this bill are the same voices that have \ncheered the most profligate spending and borrowing binge in the history \nof this Nation. It is time that we managed our affairs responsibly, and \nguaranteeing our debt is an important step in doing so.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  The gentleman says we are going to raise the debt limit. Raise it. \nGet a bill here that raises it. And then this political game will be \ntotally unnecessary. Raise it. Where is the bill?\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel).\n  (Mr. RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, my colleagues, the last few days in New \nYork people have been asking me: Do you really think Paul Ryan is going \nto become Speaker of the House? I said: No. They said: Why? Don't you \nbelieve he is intelligent, smart, dedicated? I said: That is just the \nproblem. I can't find anyone that I know and like that is more \nconservative than Paul Ryan. Paul Ryan, if he were to become Speaker, \nwould be saying to the Republicans: I cannot accept this responsibility \nunless you respect the integrity of the United States of America. They \nsaid: Well, Charlie, what does that mean? I said: Well, Paul Ryan \nwouldn't allow us to go into default. Paul Ryan would support \nincreasing the debt ceiling. Paul Ryan would recognize that we need our \ninfrastructure, we need our jobs, we need education. They said: Well, \nwhat is the difference with that? I said: If Paul Ryan were to get \nthese type of commitments from the Republican Party, Speaker Boehner \nnever would have left, McCarthy never would have left.\n  So what are we going through today? Well, Paul Ryan knows that this \nis not going to become law. Why? Because it doesn't make any sense.\n  It is almost like if you were in a corporation--since we are using \nanalogies--and they say: We promise you you are not going to go \nbankrupt. You say: Well, how are you going to do that, since the only \npeople that you have to pay are those you borrowed money from? Well, \nwhat about the cost of manufacturers? What about the salaries of the \nworkers? What about the health benefits? What about the other things \nthat make America great? Well, we didn't say that we are going to \nprotect you for that. But just for the principal and the interest that \nyou have to pay, you protect it.\n  This doesn't make any sense at all. But since it is going to be \nvetoed, this must mean something to those people that, when you say \ngovernment, they get angry, when you say Obama, they see red, when you \nfind cooperation with Democrats, they say that you are not faithful to \nthe Republic.\n  So I don't know who these people are. We don't see them. They don't \ntalk this way. But someone that can believe that just paying off debt, \nforeign and domestic, and not taking care of our veterans, not taking \ncare of our military, not taking care of our health concern--if you \nreally think that these things are just going to be forgotten, these \nare not the principles that Paul Ryan believes in.\n  So, if this passes, if it is vetoed, can't we try to believe that, if \nyou really want to have a Republican Speaker, take this garbage off the \ntable, say you are going to cooperate for our country? This is more \nimportant than Republicans and Democrats.\n  We are talking about the prestige, the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States of America. People don't ask whether you are Republican \nor Democrat. They just want to know are you going to pay your debts.\n  I thank you for this opportunity.\n  And, Paul, if they don't want you as Speaker, we will keep you as our \nchairman.\n  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, at this time, I yield 2 minutes \nto the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Rokita).\n  Mr. ROKITA. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.\n  I rise today in simple, but strong, support for H.R. 692, the Default \nPrevention Act.\n  This commonsense bill makes clear that the United States and those \nwho vote on the floor of this Chamber prioritize our debt and our \nSocial Security payments over our reckless government and otherwise \nirresponsible spending.\n  With this bill, we take the hysteria out of our spending debate and \ncodify the integrity of our Nation's full faith and credit. And I would \nsay, Madam Speaker, that those that appear to oppose this bill really \nand truly at the end of the day need the hysteria that surrounds this \nissue to not go away simply so political points around this issue can \ncontinue to be made.\n  Now, here is a real scary point, not political at all. Today, as we \nstand here, our national debt stands in excess of $18 trillion. Yet, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, government revenues \nwere $3.25 trillion for fiscal year 2015 alone.\n\n  With $3.25 trillion revenue coming in, ladies and gentlemen, we do \nnot have a revenue problem. But with $18 trillion in debt, we certainly \nhave a spending problem. We must get to the root of it, and this bill \nis a responsible step forward.\n  It is a responsible step forward because it truly takes the politics \nof this debt and this hysteria off the table so that we can see as \nAmerican people and as a Congress so that we can be exposed to the \nproblems so that we can face it and, ultimately, so that we can solve \nit.\n  That is what we came to Washington to do. I think a little bit all of \nus did. For me, it is the majority of why I came to Washington, so that \nour tough decisions can be faced, met, resolved, and we can ultimately \nreduce this debt so that our children and grandchildren in the here and \nnow and yet to come don't have to be the first and second generations \nin American history that are left worse off.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to\n\n[[Page H7056]]\n\nthe gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our Whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I have been here for some period of time, and I have heard a lot \nabout caucuses. But I would like to see us do what the gentleman from \nIndiana says, although I disagree with him on his conclusion.\n  I would like to see the formation of a responsibility caucus, a \ncaucus that is honest with the American people, that doesn't pretend \nthat this debt limit vote is a real vote.\n  It is a real vote when you cut revenues by hundreds of billions of \ndollars and don't pay for it. And if you think that that does not up \nthe debt and somehow pays for it, you haven't been around for the last \n35 years watching.\n  The responsibility caucus would say to the American people: If we \nbought it, we are going to pay for it. Whether it was Social Security, \nMedicare, an aircraft carrier, roads and bridges, whatever it was, we \nwill pay for it.\n  But one of the first things our Republican friends did was they \nnegated pay-for, and they certainly wouldn't have it apply to tax cuts. \nAlmost every responsible economist I have talked with says there is no \nway you can do this without effectively having default.\n  Because if you prioritize debt, by definition, what you are saying is \nthere are some debts we will not pay. As soon as you say that, you have \ndefaulted. You may not default to a bond owner, but you have defaulted \non an obligation of the most creditworthy nation on Earth, the United \nStates of America.\n  This is a game. It is an irresponsible game. It is a game unworthy of \nresponsible representatives. Of course we are going to pay our debts. \nWe are America. When we say of course we are going to pay our debts, it \nmeans that we will pay our debts.\n  In order to do that, you need to up the debt limit. If you don't want \nthe debt limit to go higher, stop buying things or pay for things or do \nboth.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this irresponsible charade that is a \npretense of fiscal responsibility, not a reality. This is not worthy of \nthis Congress or the American people. It is clear that this House has \nbeen a deeply divided House and a dysfunctional House for a number of \nmonths now, indeed, for a number of years.\n  I understand that there are some people who demand legislation like \nthis that won't go anywhere and really won't do anything, and it will \nput the credit of the United States at further risk. Let us reject this \ncharade.\n  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I come today to the House as a supporter of the Default Prevention \nAct. Right now our Nation stands at over $18 trillion in debt, a number \nsimply too large to comprehend.\n  As the House, we have an obligation to the American people to rein in \nout-of-control Federal spending and put our economy on a sustainable \npath forward.\n  However, while House Republicans will continue to act to reduce our \nnational debt and restore fiscal responsibility to the Federal \nGovernment, we cannot put the full faith and credit of the United \nStates Government at risk.\n  The Default Prevention Act ensures that we will continue to pay our \nexisting debt obligations providing the economic security and certainty \nthat our economy needs.\n  This legislation does not allow for an increase in the debt limit. It \nsimply allows us to satisfy our existing debt obligations and avoid \ndefault, even if we reach the debt ceiling.\n  This bill also protects Social Security beneficiaries and Americans \nwith disabilities by ensuring that their benefits will continue to be \npaid on time. Hardworking Americans deserve to have their benefits \nprotected, and this bill does just that. This legislation is a \ncommonsense measure that protects Americans' credit and integrity.\n  I urge all Members of the House to support it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Becerra), our caucus chair.\n  Mr. BECERRA. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for \nyielding.\n  1.4 million troops, 4 million disabled veterans, more than 30 million \nchildren who participate on a daily basis in school lunch programs, and \nsmall businesses all over the country are some of the Americans who \nwill pay the price if Republicans refuse to authorize our government to \npay all its bills.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  There are only 8 legislative days left for Congress to avoid \ndefaulting on paying America's financial bills. Yet, our House \nRepublican colleagues show no signs of putting serious business first \nand trying to work with their Democratic colleagues to pay our Nation's \nbills on time and in full. This bill isn't a solution. It is a sham.\n  First, it instructs our government to pay foreign creditors ahead of \npaying our troops or paying our veterans, who have honorably served our \ncountry and have earned their benefits.\n  Second, our Republican colleagues propose under this bill to borrow \nnew money to pay for previously borrowed money and to say that the \npreviously borrowed money won't count on the books. Borrowing money off \nthe books to cover debt sounds a lot like a Ponzi scheme.\n  This is simply default by another name, bringing our economy closer \nto the brink. Maybe some people in this Chamber have forgotten 2011. \nWhen the Republicans brought us to the brink of default in 2011, the \nstock market plunged and the S downgraded our credit rating for the \nfirst time in our Nation's history.\n  In 2013, our Republican colleagues proposed default threats, and the \ngovernment shutdown that followed cost us 120,000 jobs and $24 billion \nin slow GDP growth just as the economy was taking hold.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Lew, said in a letter last \nweek: ``There is no way to predict the irreparable damage that default \nwould have on global financial markets and the American people.''\n  Madam Speaker, you wouldn't constantly run your small business on the \nedge of default. So why would Republicans try to run the largest \neconomy in the world this way?\n  We need to move forward. We have 8 days. Let us defeat this bill and \nget our real work done.\n  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford).\n  Mr. SANFORD. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Madam Speaker, my colleague from Maryland made the comment just a \nmoment ago of the ``responsibility caucus,'' that he would like to see \nmore of that.\n  What I would submit to everybody in this Chamber is that, ultimately, \nwhat my colleague from California's bill is all about is, indeed, just \nthat because, if you think about it, we really are living in an age of \ndefault.\n  Laurence Kotlikoff, from Boston University, has said that, in a thing \ncalled generational accounting, the imputed cost of governing--the \nimputed cost for a child born in America today in terms of future costs \nall in--is about 80 percent.\n  Eighty percent is not all that far from a thing called slavery if you \nhave to be indentured to the Federal Government for the preponderance \nof your life and your life's work. What this is ultimately about is \ndefusing that bomb.\n  Erskine Bowles was the former Chief of Staff to President Clinton. He \nran a commission that looked at the way our Federal Government spent \nmoney. He said that what we have before us is the most predictable \nfinancial crisis in the history of man and that it is but 10 years \noff--roughly, 10 years off.\n  So, as we have a legitimate debate--and we will have a legitimate \ndebate between Republicans and Democrats and Independents and all of us \nas Americans in where we go next--what this does is defuse that bomb of \na train wreck with regard to international and national credit markets \nas we have that debate, and that is a very good thing.\n  This bill is about drawing a line as we have deadlines that come and \ngo with this debate. It is about a tug of war that is taking place, and \nit is about saying let's step back and not risk credit markets and what \nmight happen next on that front.\n\n[[Page H7057]]\n\n  Secondly, it is about simple priorities. In a family's budget, they \ndifferentiate between the mortgage budget and the movie budget. Not all \ngovernment expenditure is equal.\n  There is a whole host of programs in the Federal Government that make \na lot of sense and some, frankly, that don't, some that add a lot of \nvalue and some that add a little bit of value. For us to say, ``I will \ntell you what. As we go through those deliberations, let's back up and \nprotect the financial creditworthiness of the United States \nGovernment,'' it is, ultimately, a real step of responsibility.\n  I commend my colleague from California for offering this bill. I \nthank him for his work to defuse a ticking time bomb in the debate that \nwill take place--a ticking time bomb that will go on, nonetheless, with \nregard to what happens next with regard to the national debt.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Thompson), another distinguished member of our \ncommittee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, here we go again. We are only weeks from defaulting on \nour debt, and this bill does nothing to deal with that. The bill before \nus today is, essentially, a plan for defaulting on our obligations.\n  As my friend said, the Republican gentleman from Louisiana, all this \ndoes is prioritize our debt. If you are prioritizing your debt, by \ndefinition, you are defaulting. You are not paying your bills.\n  This would prioritize our repayment, putting our veterans, small \nbusinesses, and our first responders behind foreign governments in \nregard to receiving the payment that is due to them.\n  We have to pay our bills. We cannot go down this road again. We have \nseen this movie before, and it is not going to change. The last time we \ncame close to defaulting on our debt, the results were terrible. In 1 \nmonth, job growth dropped by more than 130,000 jobs. The S 500 tanked \nby nearly 20 percent, and our credit rating was downgraded for the \nfirst time in history.\n  No one knows for sure what the full extent of the damage to the \neconomy would be if we were to default on our debt. But, as Chairman \nRyan said earlier, we know that it would ``freeze up our economy''--\nhigher interest rates for mortgages on auto loans, student loans, and \ncredit cards; higher interest rates and less access to business loans \nneeded to finance payrolls, building inventories, or to invest in \nequipment and construction; families' retirement savings in 401(k)'s \ndropping as the stock market tanks; almost 4 million veterans not \nreceiving disability benefits; and doctors, medical providers, and \nhospitals not getting their pay.\n  The debt limit is not something to play around with. We simply need \nto pay our bills. Vote a resounding ``no'' on this bill, and let's pay \nour bills.\n  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our whip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I thank the gentlewoman from Kansas for yielding.\n  I want to thank my friend from California (Mr. McClintock) for \nbringing this bill forward.\n  Madam Speaker, the Default Prevention Act takes off the table the \nability for any President to use the debt ceiling as an opportunity to \nthreaten default on the credit of the United States of America.\n  If you think about this, we are talking about whether or not the \nUnited States is going to pay its bills. This should be something that \nthe President--any President--should understand as a basic \nresponsibility of his duty in office whether or not Congress can come \nto an agreement with the President on the debt ceiling, which, by the \nway, should be something the Speaker, the majority leader, and the \nPresident are directly engaged in.\n  The fact that the President walked away from talks on negotiations on \nthe debt ceiling tells you that he is not taking this in the serious \nway that he should. In fact, it also proves that the President wants to \nuse the debt ceiling to threaten the default of the United States. That \nis irresponsible of any President. No President should have the option \nof defaulting or of even threatening default, and this bill takes \ndefault off the table as an option.\n  Now, why would the President be opposed to that?\n  I think it answers itself, Madam Speaker, because the President wants \nto threaten default and have that as a political weapon to try to scare \nthe markets and to try to scare our seniors, who, by the way, are the \nlargest holders of debt. Seniors shouldn't have to worry about whether \nor not that debt would be paid. Any creditor shouldn't be worried.\n  If the United States is going to borrow money, we should first focus \non getting to a balanced budget, which this President is opposed to. \nOnce we get to a balanced budget, we should also be focused on making \nsure we are paying the debts that were incurred.\n  The fact that the President wants to threaten default as an option \nshouldn't be available. This bill takes default off the table, and it \nmakes the focus really clear that the United States is going to live \nwithin its means, uphold its obligations, and then go and focus on \nattacking the real root problems that got us into this debt in the \nfirst place.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this piece of legislation. \nLet's send it over to the Senate, where they should pass it on to the \nPresident.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. \nJackson Lee) for a unanimous consent request.\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nher remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the ranking member.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 692, for we should pay our \ndebts. This bill is called the Pay China First Act.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to speak on H.R. 692, the \nso-called 'Default Prevention Act of 2015,'' which would result in the \nCongress refusing to pay the financial obligations it has already \nincurred.\n  This bill, which ought to be called the ``Pay China First Act,'' is \nvirtually-identical to the one House Republicans brought to the floor \nin May 2013, which House Democrats unanimously opposed and which wasted \ntime and taxpayer money on its consideration before pushing the nation \nto the brink of default just a few months later.\n  American families do not get to choose which bills to pay and which \nones to ignore; neither can the United States Congress without putting \nthe nation into default for the first time in its history.\n  In 1789, Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first and greatest Treasury \nSecretary, understood that the path to American prosperity and \ngreatness lay in its creditworthiness which provided the affordable \naccess to capital needed to fund internal improvements and economic \ngrowth.\n  The nation's creditworthiness was one of its most important national \nassets and according to Hamilton: ``the proper funding of the present \ndebt, will render it a national blessing.''\n  But to maintain this blessing, or to ``render public credit \nimmortal,'' Hamilton understood that it was necessary that: ``the \ncreation of debt should always be accompanied with the means of \nextinguishment.''\n  In other words, to retain and enjoy the prosperity that flows from \ngood credit, it is necessary for a nation to pay its bills.\n  H.R. 692 threatens the full faith and credit of the United States, \ncosts American jobs, hurt businesses of all sizes, and does irreparable \ndamage to the economy.\n  It is important to note that under the economic stewardship of the \nObama Administration, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above \n17,000 for the first time ever, and unemployment has fallen to 5.1 \npercent, the lowest since the Clinton Administration.\n  Madam Speaker, obligations not guaranteed by H.R. 692, and therefore \nin danger of not being paid on a daily basis, include pay for active-\nduty military, veterans benefits, Medicare and Medicaid payments, and \npayments to small businesses.\n  In short, H.R. 692 is simply default by another name.\n  Americans want a clean debt limit increase, which Congress has been \ndone numerous times and was the normal process until 2011 when the \nHouse Republicans hijacked the process in a futile and quixotic effort \nto repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n  H.R. 692 reflects a House Republican governing philosophy that puts \nideology over progress and partisan showmanship over common-sense \nlegislating.\n  Madam Speaker, we cannot continue to hold our nation hostage, \npunishing the recipients of Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare who \ndepend upon their benefits for economic survival.\n  That is why I support a long-term increase in the debt limit that \nwould provide economic stability to consumers, businesses, and \nfinancial organizations and certainty to capital markets.\n\n[[Page H7058]]\n\n  In contrast, the bill before us, H.R. 692, is merely a short-term \nmeasure with unnecessary complications, needlessly perpetuating \nuncertainty in the nation's fiscal system, and favors the Chinese \ngovernment over Americans.\n  My colleagues want to buy time so that they can figure out how to \nsqueeze the American taxpayer even more by devising bone-crunching cuts \nand slashes to entitlement programs as opposed to sitting down and \nworking with Democrats to come up with reasonable budget reforms which \ndo not hurt seniors or the , disadvantaged.\n  Madam Speaker, Social Security is currently the only source of income \nfor nearly two-thirds of older American households receiving benefits, \nand roughly one-third of those households depend on Social Security for \nnearly all of their income.\n  Half of those 65 and older have annual incomes below $18,500, and \nmany older Americans have experienced recent and significant losses in \nretirement savings, pensions, and home values.\n  Today, every dollar of the average Social Security retirement benefit \nof about $14,800 is absolutely critical to the typical beneficiary.\n  Contrary to some claims, Social Security is not the cause of our \nnation's deficit problem.\n  Not only does the program operate independently, but it is prohibited \nfrom borrowing.\n  Social Security must pay all benefits from its own trust fund.\n  If there are insufficient funds to pay out full benefits, benefits \nare automatically reduced to the level supported by the program's own \nrevenues.\n  Instead of short-term management of self-inflicted fiscal crises, it \nis incumbent upon us on both sides of the aisle to find the common \nground needed to put the nation on a sounder fiscal path.\n  If President Obama has made clear that he remains willing to work \nwith both parties in Congress to budget responsibly and to achieve \nadditional deficit reduction consistent with the principles of balance, \nshared growth, and shared opportunity.\n  But, as of today Madam Speaker, Congress has only two options--raise \nthe debt ceiling to allow the Treasury to pay the nation's bills, or \nrefuse to do so and have the nation default for the first time in \nhistory.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against H.R. 692.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer), another very distinguished member of our \ncommittee.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you.\n  Madam Speaker, I am listening to my friend from Louisiana rewrite \nhistory.\n  It is not the President who is threatening to default on the national \ndebt. It is the Republican Congress that is refusing to do what was \ngranted to every President in the past--Republican or Democrat--which \nis to deal with raising the debt ceiling, which is, after all, money we \nhave already spent, money that they approved.\n  They have been in charge for the last 5 years. The notion that we can \nsomehow distinguish the semantics of this proposal, distinguishing \nbetween sovereign debt and the rest of the 80 million transactions that \nthe Treasury makes every day, is lunacy.\n  If you disagree with our protections to seniors, veterans, the \nmilitary, Medicare, Medicaid, the FBI, food safety, cut them, but you \ndon't. You nibble away at them. You have never offered a balanced \nbudget when you have been in charge. We had balanced budgets when \nPresident Clinton was President. Thank you very much. Unless you assure \neveryone, nobody is protected.\n  As for the notion somehow that the President walked away from the \nnegotiations with Simpson-Bowles, where was Paul Ryan? I like Paul \nRyan. Paul Ryan refused to embrace Simpson-Bowles' proposals. They \ncannot pass their vision. They want to blame the President and the \nAmerican people.\n  I would respectfully suggest that we ought to reject this fig leaf \nand get down to business: raise the debt ceiling as we have done \nrepeatedly in the past for Presidents, whether they are Republicans or \nDemocrats, get past the rhetoric, and then deal with structural issues \ngoing forward.\n  Let's rebuild and renew America. Let's raise the gas tax so we can \ndeal with our crumbling infrastructure, something that Ronald Reagan \ndid in 1982, when we faced a deficit in the highway trust fund then.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). The time of the gentleman \nhas expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. There are simple, commonsense solutions, by the way, \nthat are supported by the U.S. Chamber and the AFL-CIO, truckers and \nAAA, business, government, to be able to get the country moving again, \nto repair crumbling infrastructure, and not add to the deficit. One \nsimple, little step--something we could do--not deal with goofy \nlegislation like is offered today.\n  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, we are asked: Why don't you just raise \nthe debt limit?\n  Let me again make this very clear.\n  As long as we spend more than we take in, we have a responsibility to \nraise the debt limit. Republicans acknowledge that responsibility. \nDemocrats acknowledge that responsibility.\n  Yet, with that responsibility comes a concomitant duty to review the \npolicies that are driving that debt. The Republicans acknowledge this \nresponsibility. The Democrats do not. That is the fine point of the \nmatter.\n  That is a policy debate, and it is controversial, but that \ncontroversy should not roil credit markets and threaten to increase the \ncost of our borrowing.\n  Given the size of the debt that we are carrying--and this \nadministration has nearly doubled it by its policies--even a small \nincrease in interest rates could mean a catastrophic increase in \ninterest payments, and those increased interest payments in the tens--\npossibly, hundreds--of billions of dollars would come at the cost of \nevery other program that the Democrats cherish.\n  We keep hearing about the S downgrading our credit rating in 2011. \nLet me remind them that, for months prior to that downgrade, the S \ndemanded that we reduce our 10-year projected deficit by at least $4 \ntrillion or they would downgrade our sovereign debt. We ultimately only \nreduced it by $1.2 trillion because of the voices that we now hear \nraised against this bill, and the S followed through on that threat.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  My Democratic colleagues are right, a threat not to pay interest and \nprincipal on our debt is the biggest threat to our credit. That is \nprecisely the threat this bill takes off the table by guaranteeing our \nsovereign debt.\n  My friends are correct that failure to pay our other bills would be a \nvery bad thing, and it is much to be avoided. There is no dispute in \nthat.\n  As long as the debt limit has to be increased, there is going to be \ncontroversy; and that controversy, whether during Republican or \nDemocratic Congresses or Republican or Democratic administrations, must \nnot be allowed to provoke an increase in borrowing costs because we \nhave frightened credit markets.\n  This is not a threat to default. It is a promise not to default on \nthe sovereign debt that we use to fund everything else that we do. My \nfriends on the left make no distinction between sovereign debt and our \nother obligations. That may explain some of the reasons we are in the \nmess we are in.\n  The fact is our sovereign debt is what makes it possible to pay for \nour other obligations as long as we continue to spend beyond our means. \nThis measure guarantees the sovereign debt.\n  The policies advocated by the opponents of this motion are precisely \nthe policies that have caused our country to wander now through 7 years \ndown a dark road of debt, doubt, despair, and economic malaise.\n  It is time for a new morning in America, and that begins with \nguaranteeing the sovereign debt of this Nation. I ask for your support \nfor this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could I ask the Speaker how much time is remaining on both \nsides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 10 minutes \nremaining, and the gentlewoman from Kansas has 13\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Kind), another distinguished member of our committee.\n  Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, this unquestionably is one of the most \ndangerous bills that we will be considering in this session of Congress \nbecause this gives this body permission, for the very first time in our \nNation's history, to default on our financial obligations.\n\n[[Page H7059]]\n\n  They claim that they are splitting the baby here by paying \nbondholders only. One of the largest bondholders we have, of course, is \nChina, so this is a pay China first bill.\n  I have a feeling that the financial markets, the investors, and the \ncredit rating agencies will view this for what it is however: a default \nis a default is a default.\n  A great nation like the United States of America should pay our \nbills. We should pay our bills.\n  Now, no one can stand here or sit here today with complete certainty \nand tell us what the market reaction would be if we start defaulting on \nany financial obligations we have as a nation, and that is really the \npoint. Why would we even take that chance? Why would we take a chance \nof a downgrade to our credit, of an increase in interest rates which \nwould impact everyone, from small businesses to families to farmers? It \nwould drive up borrowing costs, which would act as a brake on economic \nactivity and the job growth we have right now because we have never \ndone this before. That is the danger that this legislation sets up.\n  If my friends on the other side are so concerned about debt and \noverspending, then perhaps they ought not have supported legislation \nthis year alone--bills that they have passed--that would increase our \nnational debt by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years because you \nrefused to pay for the tax cuts or the spending increases that were in \nthat legislation through offsets in the budget. That may come as news \nor surprise to the other side, but the Congressional Budget Office \nscore is $1.5 trillion of new debt over 10 years based on legislation \nyou supported: repealing SGR, $141 billion; permanent expensing, $380 \nbillion; get rid of the estate tax, another $180 billion, and others. \nIt adds up to 1.5.\n  So if there is so much concern about excess spending and debt and \nwhat it is doing to our economy, then maybe we ought to look at \nourselves first and the action that is being taken on this House floor.\n  We should not go down this path. We should stop creating the \nuncertainty and dysfunction coming out of Washington and give the \neconomy a chance to recover.\n  I encourage my colleagues to reject this legislation.\n  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Crowley), vice chair of our Caucus.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Pay \nChina First Act. We should call it, in my opinion, Put America Last Act \nbecause that is exactly what this does. This bill will codify into law \na new low. It will ensure U.S. taxpayers are forced to pay China and \nother regimes as well as foreign banks first. That means we will pay \nChina before we pay veterans, before we pay for Medicare to cover our \nseniors, and before we pay our enlisted troops bravely serving \noverseas. It means we are going to pay these guys before we pay these \nguys. We are going to pay these guys before we pay these guys.\n  Even Chairman Ryan, in a memo to House Republican colleagues, \nacknowledges that, in fact, China and other foreign debt holders will \nbe paid before Medicare, before our elderly receive their checks, and \nbefore our troops receive their salaries.\n  This whole bill is a sign of misplaced priorities. There are \ncountless issues that Americans have called on us to address that we \nneed to tackle to ensure this country remains healthy and strong, yet \nthis is a bill the Republicans have chosen to bring to the floor. This \nis a bill that you have chosen to bring to the floor.\n  At least now we know. We know this Congress is not serious about \npaying our Nation's bills because, under this bill, we resort to having \nthe U.S. file, in essence, a bankruptcy. Filing for bankruptcy and \nwalking away from debt obligations may work for Donald Trump, but it \ndoesn't work for middle class Americans. Average Americans who work \nhard to pay their bills and live up to their financial obligations--and \nthat includes American veterans and seniors--the Republicans would have \nwaiting in line for their VA benefits behind Chinese bankers.\n  I cannot support a measure that puts China above our veterans, above \nour seniors, and above our servicemembers.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from New \nYork.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, if you ask the American people, ``Who \nshould be paid first, these guys or these guys?'' I suggest they would \nagree with us. These guys should get paid first.\n  Oppose this Pay China First Act, and let's keep America first.\n  Let me also add this, Madam Speaker.\n  Have you ever heard of dine and ditch? This is the biggest dine and \nditch I have ever heard of. When I was a kid, some of my friends wanted \nto go to restaurants, eat as much as they could, and then run out \nbefore they paid their bill, and I would never let them do that. I felt \nit was immoral. That is exactly what we are suggesting we do today.\n  Who got stuck paying for that bill? The waitress. Who is the waitress \nin this case? The American people. The American people, they get stuck \nwhen you dine and ditch on them. Even suggesting for a moment that we \nmay not pay our debt and that we may default sends the wrong message to \nAmerica. It sends the wrong message to the world.\n  Defeat this measure.\n  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), another very distinguished member of our \ncommittee.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong \nopposition to the Pay China First Act. I am truly shocked that the \nRepublican leadership is advancing a bill that approves America \ndefaulting on its debt.\n  This is a dangerous action that jeopardizes the full faith and credit \nof our Nation. It also jeopardizes the well-being of millions of our \nmost vulnerable citizens.\n  I cannot support a bill that would tell my constituents that repaying \nour debt to foreign countries is more important than paying their \nsalaries for military service or paying their disability benefits or \nproviding them student loans.\n  How can I tell small businesses in Illinois that repaying our debt to \na foreign government is more important than paying them for providing \ngoods and services to our government? How can I tell Illinois doctors \nand hospitals that we can pay China for lending us money, but we cannot \npay them for taking care of our elderly?\n  The Council of Economic Advisers estimated that the 2013 debt limit \nstandoff and shutdown cost us 120,000 jobs, and the GAO estimated that \nit resulted in $70 million in increased borrowing cost on securities \nissued during the last crisis.\n\n  The 2013 debt limit fiasco already damaged our economic recovery, yet \nthe Republican leadership insists yet again on a path to harm our \nnational economy and well-being simply for political posturing.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this shameful bill that says that debt \nto foreign countries is more important than our citizens.\n  We should protect our economy. Pass a clean bill to raise our debt \nceiling.\n  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I know that this great Hall has become \na national gallery for hyperbole, but I think the opponents of this \nmeasure have taken it to a whole new level. Pay China first, what \nxenophobic nonsense.\n  China holds about 7 percent of our debt. Most of our debt is owed to \nAmericans, much of it in pension funds and debts to Social Security \npensioners.\n  If we don't maintain our credit, we can't meet any of our other \nobligations, including our troops in the field. And if there is even a \nsuggestion that our sovereign debt is not absolutely secure, we could \nsee a spike in interest costs that will take money away from the very \nprograms that the Democrats say they are trying to defend. That is the \nreality of it.\n  This is a question over whether we should guarantee the sovereign \ndebt of the United States, and I would ask\n\n[[Page H7060]]\n\nagain: Why is it and how is it that my friends on the Democratic side \nof the aisle can get wildly enthusiastic about taxpayers being forced \nto guarantee loans to foreign corporations, foreign governments, or \ndomestic special interests and yet not be willing to guarantee the full \nfaith and credit of the United States simply by allowing the Treasury \nSecretary to continue to borrow to meet our interest and principal \npayments if we should ever reach a point where the debt limit has been \nreached?\n  It is the debate over the debt limit that tends to roil markets. We \nare going to meet our debt obligations, but that debate that is \nrequired to review the policies that are driving our debt is what roils \nthose markets.\n  This calms that debate. This assures everyone who makes loans to the \nFederal Government that their loans are secure. This keeps our interest \ncosts down, and it guarantees the credit of the United States that is \nnecessary to meet all of our other obligations.\n  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, as I have no further speakers, \nand I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, this is an amazing debate. The gentleman from \nCalifornia talks about guaranteeing. So you guarantee payments to \nforeign debt holders. You won't guarantee payments to our veterans or \nto kids with school lunches. You won't guarantee payments to people who \nare doing medical research. You won't guarantee that.\n  So here is the problem: you are proceeding on a very partisan basis \non a bill that is going nowhere.\n  You say we need to raise the debt ceiling. We will, and we are going \nto do it long before there is any consideration of the details about \nwhich you speak.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  You talk about the need to control spending. We are going to pass a \ndebt ceiling. The disturbing thing is you come here on a partisan basis \nwhen there is a crying need for bipartisanship. The only way the debt \nceiling can be raised is bipartisan, and you come here today strictly \npartisan.\n  That is a bad omen because, in addition to the debt ceiling, there is \nthe continuing resolution. We have also the Medicare premium issue that \nlooms in a few days. We have a highway bill that looms in a few days. \nThe only way they are going to be resolved is on a bipartisan basis. \nYou come here with a bill that won't get, I think, a single Democratic \nvote, and you know it, and yet your leadership sanctions you to do \nthis.\n  What does that mean for the future? It is deeply troubling. This is \ndemagoguery. It is an effort maybe to gain a few more Republican votes, \nbut this is too important for that. It is not policy, as I said before. \nIt is a ploy. When it comes to issues like this, it should be beyond \nthat kind of gamesmanship.\n  In this sense, it is kind of sad you are doing this. It raises \nquestions as to where your leadership is going to take this institution \nin the future, when already on your side the public has such deep \ndisbelief in what you are doing. It is too late to ask you to pull \nback. I urged that to your leadership some time ago. I guess we are \ngoing to go forth. It is a frightful mistake to be doing it this way.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind Members that remarks \nin debate must be addressed to the Chair and not to others in the \nsecond person.\n  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Congress still has a great deal of work to do to rein in spending. \nWhile conversations to reduce Federal spending continue, we must also \ncontinue to pay down our existing debt. The Default Prevention Act \nbefore us today provides a responsible way to deal with our debt crisis \nand protect the full faith and credit of the United States.\n  As we all know, if the U.S. defaulted on a debt payment, it would do \nserious harm to the economy and to the hardworking Americans who make \nthis country great. This bill ensures that, even if the debt limit is \nreached, the U.S. Treasury would not default on our existing \nobligations to pay down the debt.\n  Again, this legislation does not increase the debt limit. Instead, it \nactually prevents Treasury from issuing new debt to pay for any new \nspending unless Congress passes a law to increase the debt limit, a \nconversation for another day.\n  This bill, guaranteeing our debt, makes it possible to pay all the \nbills that the minority claims to want paid. This bill takes the \nimportant step of ensuring that Social Security benefits are paid in \nfull and on time. This legislation is a commonsense measure that will \nprotect our Nation's credit and integrity.\n  Once again, I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I stand in opposition to H.R. 692, \nthe so-called Default Prevention Act.\n  Raising the national debt limit is a basic responsibility of \ngovernment which ensures America will be able to pay its bills. If we \ndo not raise the debt limit, our nation will default for the first time \nin its history. Americans' retirement savings will plunge, and interest \nrates for mortgages, student loans, credit cards, and car payments will \nskyrocket.\n  That is why the American people and the American economy need a clean \ndebt limit extension bill that meets all of our financial obligations, \nnot just a few of them. Sadly, the Majority party's Default Prevention \nAct does not meet this basic standard.\n  Their bill would guarantee payments above the debt limit to bond \nholders in China and other foreign countries, without consideration for \nmeeting our obligations to the American people, including troops, \nveterans, and small businesses. That is irresponsible and wrong.\n  Taking care of our veterans, troops, and small businesses should be \nour priority, not guaranteeing payments to China and our other bond \nholders. This legislation is the Majority's cynical attempt to pass a \ndebt limit bill and say the House is being responsible. The truth is it \nis not an honest attempt to address the debt limit. The Majority's bill \nis a sham. Our nation will be in default if we miss any payment for any \nreason. And the Majority knows the bill will not become law, because \nthe President will veto it if it reaches his desk.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this pointless Default Prevention Act, \nand-pass a clean debt limit extension bill that fulfills our \nobligations to the American, people, avoids economic catastrophe, and \ntruly honors the full faith and credit of the United States.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 480, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Michael McCaul,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This correspondence is regarding the \n     U.S. Census Bureau's compliance with the Federal Information \n     Security Management Act (FISMA) and the provisions of Senate \n     Amendment (S. Admt.) 2710 to H.R. 3116. The Census Bureau is \n     compliant at this time with the requirements of FISMA, and is \n     working with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security to provide information on the data security \n     procedures required by S. Admt. 2710.\n       We have implemented a formal risk management program in \n     accordance with the National Institute of Standards and \n     Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-37r1. All of the \n     FISMA reportable systems supporting the Census Bureau are \n     continually assessed per this guidance and all have a current \n     Authorization to Operate. In addition, the Census Bureau is \n     currently behind a Managed Trusted Internet Protocol Service \n     (MTIPS) provider and is protected by the Department of \n     Homeland Security (DHS) Einstein 1 and 2, which looks at \n     network flow information and network intrusion detection. The \n     Census Bureau is engaged with DHS and MTIPS provider to move \n     behind Einstein 3 Accelerated (E3A) as soon as the DHS and \n     our MTIPS say they are ready. This will give us the added \n     cybersecurity analysis, situational awareness and security \n     response capabilities for DHS to augment our efforts.\n       The Census Bureau also is actively engaged with the \n     Department of Commerce to implement Phase 2C of the \n     Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program by the \n     end of calendar year 2016. This will provide us the \n     capability to identify cybersecurity risks more efficiently \n     and prioritize the risks based on potential impacts. The \n     initial meeting with DHS and the service provider took place \n     on October 15. 2015. The Census Bureau reports regularly on \n     this and other aspects of its cybersecurity program to the \n     Department of Commerce, Office of Management and Budget, and \n     DHS.\n       Please know that the security of our respondents' \n     information is paramount at the Census Bureau. We take \n     seriously our responsibility to honor privacy and protect \n     confidentiality.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 10.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 480 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 10.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Holding) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1552\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 10) to reauthorize the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results \nAct, and for other purposes, with Mr. Holding in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the \nDistrict of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 10, the Scholarships \nfor Opportunity and Results, or SOAR, Reauthorization Act.\n  The SOAR Reauthorization Act continues the three-sector approach to \neducation within the District of Columbia. This approach gives equal \nfunding to D.C. Public Schools, D.C. Public Charter Schools, and the \nOpportunity Scholarship Program, often referred to as the OSP.\n  The OSP gives scholarships to children in low-income families to \nattend a private school so that those children can experience a quality \neducation. The average OSP family makes less than $22,000 per year. \nThese scholarships allow families to place their children in learning-\nrich environments.\n  District of Columbia Public Schools rank at the top in spending per \nstudent, but are near the bottom in academic performance. The \nOpportunity Scholarship Program gives these students the education they \ndeserve so they can pursue the American Dream.\n  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 10 works not only to provide scholarships to \nstudents who need them the most, but also to improve the current state \nof public school and public charter school education. This bill \nauthorizes equal funding for D.C. Public Schools and for D.C. Public \nCharter Schools in addition to the Opportunity scholarships.\n  My friends across the aisle claim that the SOAR Act takes money away \nfrom public education. However, that is quite the opposite. The SOAR \nAct increases funding for public education in the District of Columbia.\n  In fact, since the three-sector approach has been in effect, D.C. \nPublic Schools and D.C. Public Charter Schools have received a combined \n$435 million in Federal funding for school improvement.\n  Mr. Chairman, the District of Columbia schools would not have \nreceived these funds had it not been for the OSP and this three-sector \napproach. Now we are debating reauthorizing this approach and giving \n$20 million annually to each sector for 5 years, $300 million across 5 \nyears for D.C. education.\n  It is hard to imagine how anyone who advocates for public education \nwould oppose such an approach that has poured millions of dollars into \nthe D.C. public education system, particularly since the OSP is getting \na great return on its investment and is producing results. The OSP \nproduces $2.62 in benefits for every dollar spent on the program, \naccording to a study conducted by one of the program's evaluators.\n\n[[Page H7062]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, you would be hard pressed to find another government \nprogram that generates this sort of result and bang for your buck. We \nare talking about a 162 percent return on investment here, an \ninvestment that has not taken one dime from public education.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is good stuff. We talk about how to keep this \nprogram going because it is really affecting real people and real \nlives. We talk about the individual students and their families, but it \nis also borne out in the statistics.\n  The Opportunity Scholarship students are averaging a 90 percent \ngraduation rate--90 percent--compared to D.C. Public Schools, which was \nroughly less than a 60 percent graduation rate in 2013 and 2014.\n  Further, some 88 percent of the Opportunity Scholarship participants \nenroll in college. Not only are they graduating high school at record \nlevels above and beyond what is happening in public schools, but they \nare also going on to higher education.\n  These children, though, are more than a graduation statistic. Their \nindividual lives have been forever changed because of the OSP.\n  I want to remind our colleagues about Joseph Kelley's son, Rashawn \nWilliams. He had fallen behind in every single subject. His father had \nto get the courts involved to ensure that his school was following its \nrequirements pursuant to Rashawn's individual education plan. Mr. \nKelley was able to get Rashawn a scholarship through the Opportunity \nScholarship Program and has said: ``I truly shudder to think where my \nson would be today without it.''\n  Mr. Chairman, the OSP is changing outcomes for the least advantaged. \nThe program places kids in safer high-quality schools that allow them \nto receive a good education. It brings funding to all sectors of \neducation in D.C. to improve education opportunities for all.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is important to note that the bill requires all \nparticipating Opportunity Scholarship schools to be accredited. The \naccreditation standards give the taxpayer--and, more importantly, \nOpportunity Scholarship families--assurances that District students are \nreceiving the education they deserve.\n  The Opportunity Scholarship currently limits entrance based on a \ncontrol group for an evaluation study. H.R. 10 removes this arbitrary \nrequirement, instituting a new study to track the results of the \nOpportunity Scholarships. Removing this barrier to entry increases \naccess to the program and means more families can be afforded quality \neducation for their children.\n  Mr. Chairman, we had the opportunity to debate this bill in the \nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform, and I appreciate the \nperspectives heard from both sides. We had a good, productive field \nhearing.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner), the Speaker of \nthe House, our friend and colleague, for authoring this legislation. He \nhas poured his heart and soul out, trying to do what he can do to help \nthese young children. It has had a very positive effect on so many \nlives and in future generations. It is something we can all be proud \nabout.\n  He has worked tirelessly to bring opportunity to students within the \nDistrict of Columbia, and he will be remembered by this body for his \neffort to bring a quality education to all. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to give students in the District \nof Columbia the opportunity for a quality education by reauthorizing a \nprogram that actually works and produces results. It affects real \nlives. It is called the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act. I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I didn't really expect to be on the floor this \nafternoon managing this bill. Ironically, I was scheduled to host a \nbriefing today for Members and staff on the constitutionality of the \nDistrict of Columbia statehood bill, where I was going to show a 17-\nminute HBO ``Last Week Tonight'' clip from John Oliver that lampoons \nthe Congress for denying District residents their voting rights, budget \nand legislative autonomy, and statehood.\n  Instead, here I am on the floor in a virtual reality show not \nspeaking about the right to self-government, but fighting this latest \nattempt by the Republican Congress to impose its ideology on D.C. \nresidents.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  I ask to include the D.C. Council's letter opposing this bill in the \nRecord.\n\n                          Council of the District of Columbia,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 2015.\n     Hon. Jason Chaffetz,\n     Chairperson, Committee on Oversight & Government Reform, \n         House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Chairperson Chaffetz: We write as locally elected officials \n     to express our opposition to renewed efforts to expand a \n     federally funded school voucher program in the District of \n     Columbia. We appreciate your interest in providing support to \n     public education in the District. We strongly believe, \n     however, that federal funds should be invested in the \n     existing public education system--both public schools and \n     public charter schools--rather than being diverted to private \n     schools.\n       We support the decision by Congress and the President \n     several years ago to phase out the voucher program. Multiple \n     U.S. Department of Education reports indicate that the \n     program has not lived up to the promises made by proponents. \n     These studies along with two troubling Government \n     Accountability Office reports have also revealed that many of \n     the students participating in the voucher program attend \n     private schools with fewer resources and lower standards than \n     our public schools. The evidence is clear that the use of \n     vouchers has had no statistically significant impact on \n     overall student achievement in math or reading, or for \n     students from schools in need of improvement.\n       We have serious concerns about using government funds to \n     send our students to private schools that do not have to \n     adhere to the same standards and accountability as do public \n     and public charter schools. For example, private religious \n     schools, which 80% of students with vouchers attend, operate \n     outside the non-discrimination provisions of the D.C. Human \n     Rights Act. Moreover, the voucher proposal is inequitable: if \n     fully funded, the authorization would provide many more \n     dollars per student for vouchers than is allocated per \n     student in public schools and public charter schools.\n       Although we believe that students who are already receiving \n     a voucher should have the opportunity to maintain and use \n     that voucher through graduation from high school, we do not \n     support expansion of the program to new students. The \n     District devotes considerable funds to public education, and \n     our local policies promote choice for parents. Indeed, over \n     the past decade the quality of public education in D.C. has \n     increased, as a result of reforms and targeted investment. \n     Families can choose from an array of educational institutions \n     based on publicly available performance metrics, both within \n     the D.C. Public Schools system and among the myriad public \n     charter schools. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan has \n     called the progress of D.C. Public Schools ``remarkable'', \n     while the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools has \n     ranked the District's charter sector as the best in the \n     country.\n       Despite such ample evidence that the Congressionally \n     imposed voucher program is ineffective, while D.C. public \n     schools improve every year, some members of Congress continue \n     to see our city as their personal petri dish. It is insulting \n     to our constituents, who vote for us but not for any voting \n     member of Congress, that some of your colleagues push their \n     personal agendas on D.C. in a way they could never do in \n     their home states. Attacking D.C. home rule, including any \n     expansion of the voucher program, is irresponsible governing \n     on the part of Congress.\n       We call on you to respect the wishes of the District's \n     elected officials on the quintessentially local matter of \n     education as you consider this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n         David Grosso, DC Council, At-Large, Chairperson Committee \n           on Education; Charles Allen, DC Council, Ward 6, \n           Member, Committee on Education; LaRuby May, DC Council, \n           Ward 8; Elissa Silverman, DC Council, At-Large; Anita \n           Bonds, DC Council, At-Large, Member, Committee on \n           Education; Yvette Alexander, DC Council, Ward 7, \n           Member, Committee on Education; Brianne Nadeau, DC \n           Council, Ward 1; Jack Evans, DC Council, Ward 2.\n\n  Ms. NORTON. Yet, Mr. Chairman, I have sought a compromise that should \nbe acceptable to Republicans, as it is to President Obama.\n  We support, and I repeat, we support allowing our current D.C. \nvoucher students to remain in the program until graduation. That \nensures D.C. would have voucher students for many years to come.\n  That is the kind of sensible compromise that Congress must get back \nto or be content with the label ``least productive Congress,'' as it \nhas come to be known each year under this majority.\n\n[[Page H7063]]\n\n  This bill goes beyond the compromise, we have offered, by seeking to \nadmit new students as well. We are here so that Speaker John Boehner \nhas a capstone to his own political career. The D.C. voucher program is \nhis pet project, not D.C.'s. The Speaker has introduced only two bills \nthis Congress: a bill on the Iran nuclear agreement and this bill.\n  Even if Members do not respect D.C.'s right to self-government, they \nshould at least care whether the program improves achievement, which \nwas the stated reason for vouchers in the first place. Far from helping \nstudents, however, the program has demonstrably failed.\n  According to the congressionally mandated evaluation of the program's \neffectiveness, this program, these vouchers, have failed to improve \nacademic achievement, as measured by objective math and reading testing \nscores.\n  Most importantly, the program has not had significant impacts--that \nis also from the congressionally mandated evaluation--has not had \n``significant impacts'' on the achievement of students whom the program \nwas designed to most benefit: those who previously attended low-\nperforming public schools.\n  The majority cites improved high school graduation rates. However, \nthe evaluation did not examine dropout rates or the rigor of the \nschools' curriculum or graduation requirements.\n  The majority also cites high college attendance rates. However, the \nevaluation did not measure college attendance rates.\n  Even if the program were successful, Mr. Chairman, it would still not \nbe needed, at least in the District of Columbia, which has perhaps the \nmost robust public school choice program in the country. Almost 50 \npercent of our public school students attend charter schools, which the \nNational Alliance for Public Charter Schools ranked as the strongest in \nthe Nation. In addition, 75 percent of public school students in the \nDistrict attend out-of-boundary schools. What D.C. has developed \namounts to a model choice education program.\n  Moreover, the D.C. public schools have made some of the most \nimpressive improvements in the country, by any measure, spurred by \ncompetition from the rapidly growing D.C. charter schools, not from the \nsmall number of voucher schools. In fact, a 2013 assessment of D.C. \npublic schools indicated that the District had made the greatest \nimprovement of any urban school district in the Nation.\n  D.C. charter schools have even higher educational achievement and \nattainment than D.C. public schools. D.C. charter schools outperform \nD.C. public schools across traditionally disadvantaged groups, \nincluding African Americans and low-income students, and have a higher \npercentage of such students, precisely the students the voucher program \nwas ostensibly designed to serve.\n  Greater confidence in D.C.'s public schools is also clear. D.C. \npublic school enrollment has increased for 7 consecutive years, right \nalongside the very large number of charter schools.\n  If Congress wants to support D.C. students, we ask that you support \nour home rule public choice, not impose yours. Any new funding for \neducation in the District should reinforce the hard work of our city, \nour parents, and our residents, who have shown the Nation how to build \na fully accountable public school choice program. D.C. residents, not \nunaccountable Members of Congress, know best what our children need and \nhow to govern our own affairs.\n  During this debate, Mr. Chairman, we will consider an amendment I \nhave offered to restore the scientific integrity of the program's \nevaluation, one like the evaluation Congress has always mandated, and \nanother to crack down on so-called voucher mills.\n  Given that the Speaker's bill will surely pass, I want to work with \nMembers who support vouchers to ensure that our voucher students attend \nhigh-quality schools, like our accredited Catholic and other parochial \nschools, not fly-by-night, often storefront schools in low-income \nneighborhoods that were opened only after the voucher program was \ncreated to get access to unrestricted Federal funds.\n  I appreciate that the majority indicated in committee and on the \nfloor that they also want to prevent voucher mills. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with them as this bill moves forward to protect our \nfamilies from voucher mills.\n  Under the Home Rule Act of 1973, Congress gave the District authority \nto establish its own education system; and unlike some other local \njurisdictions, D.C. has never created a voucher program. Instead, like \nmany D.C. bills in Congress, this bill seeks to impose a program on the \nDistrict that does not have national support.\n  Just think of it. Only 3 months ago, both the House and Senate \ndefeated Republican national private voucher amendments on the floor. \nMembers reject private school vouchers for their own constituents but \nwant to impose them on mine. No wonder.\n  Since 1970, every single referendum to establish State-funded \nvouchers or tuition tax credits has failed, and by large margins. Now \nthe majority wants to do to the District what it would not dare do at \nhome. The recent vote to deny voucher funding on a national level shows \nwhere Republicans really stand.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).\n  Mr. WALBERG. I thank the chairman for this opportunity.\n  Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor today, after looking in the eyes of \nthe kids, students, their parents, eyes filled with hope and \nopportunity and success.\n  I come to the floor today to add my support for H.R. 10, the SOAR \nReauthorization Act, because it works. This legislation will ensure the \ncontinuation of the successful D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, \nwhich was established by Congress in 2004, to provide eligible low-\nincome families in the District of Columbia with the opportunity to \nattend the school of their choice.\n  Innovative programs like the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program are \nnecessary to fix our broken educational system and prepare our children \nfor the 21st century workforce, and I am confounded that any of my \ncolleagues would oppose a program that provides students with an \nopportunity for a better education, especially one that has been an \nunqualified success.\n  On average, students in the Opportunity Scholarship Program have a \ngraduation rate of 90 percent, well above the national average, as well \nas D.C.'s overall graduation rate of 58 percent. These students \ncontinue to succeed in their pursuit of higher education, with 88 \npercent of the graduates going on to attend a 2- or 4-year college or \nuniversity.\n  While the benefits to D.C. children are clear, the program also plays \nan important role in empowering parents to make the best choice for \ntheir kids and engaging them in their educational and academic \nprogress. A recent survey of parents found that 85 percent of parents \nare happy with their child's current Opportunity Scholarship Program \nschool.\n  H.R. 10 has garnered the support from a wide array of stakeholders. \nJust yesterday, in an op-ed entitled ``A Misguided Attack on D.C.'s \nNeedy Students,'' The Washington Post editorial board defended the SOAR \nAct and wrote in support of reauthorizing the D.C. Opportunity \nScholarship Program, noting that over 6,100 children have benefited \nfrom the program, while thousands more are on waiting lists.\n  The Washington Post also notes that nearly 75 percent of D.C. \nresidents support the program, which has provided more than $600 \nmillion in funding for traditional public schools, charter public \nschools, and the voucher program.\n  It is important to note, Mr. Chairman, that this bill does not take \nany funding away from D.C. public schools. In fact, the legislation \nauthorizes equal funding to public schools, charter schools, and \nscholarships.\n  With an average family income of less than $22,000 for participating \nfamilies, this program really is a lifeline for low-income D.C. \nfamilies, offering students up to $1,572 to pay for tuition, fees, and \ntransportation. Why, Mr. Chairman, would any of us want to prohibit \nthese students and families from opportunity and success?\n  This is a hand up to the American Dream. Ensuring our children have \naccess to the best possible education\n\n[[Page H7064]]\n\nshould not be a partisan issue, and receiving a quality education \nshould not be limited to people of means.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue supporting this program and pass \nH.R. 10. It is the right thing to do. Let's do it for the kids.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I simply want to say, once again, that no child currently enrolled in \nthe program under the compromise that I have offered would be stricken \nfrom the program and all current voucher students could stay until \ngraduation. It is new students that we object to, given the evaluation \nthat shows that the program had not met its goal, which was to improve \nreading and math scores. By contrast, we have had improvement in \nreading and math scores both in the D.C. public schools and the D.C. \ncharter schools.\n  Also, Mr. Chairman, there is no waiting list for vouchers in the \nDistrict of Columbia. However, there are long waiting lists for our \ncharter schools, and now, even for some public schools.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNew Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the gentlewoman from D.C.\n  Mr. Chair, it is extremely unfortunate that we are here yet again \ndebating legislation that would interfere with the ability of D.C. \nresidents to make decisions for themselves. So far this Congress, the \nHouse has attempted to block laws that would protect District women's \nreproductive rights and reform Washington's drug laws. And now we are \nasked to continue a failed private school voucher program, a program \nthat a majority of the D.C. Council opposes and on which they are not \neven consulted, a program that D.C.'s own longtime Congresswoman \nopposes.\n  I am shocked at the arrogance of this body to set aside the will of \nthe citizens of the District of Columbia so fleetingly. It is \ndisgraceful that in this building, a symbol of our democracy, we impose \nsuch policies on a city that does not even get a vote on these \ndecisions.\n  Additionally, I oppose this bill because it weakens D.C.'s public \nschool system. Instead of taking public dollars to outsource our \nchildren's education to private schools, we should be focusing on truly \nreauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We need an \nupdated ESEA that strengthens public schools for all our children and \nprepares students for the globally competitive world we live in.\n  Education should be the great equalizer, and every student should \nhave access to the best education, regardless of their ZIP Code or \ntheir socioeconomic status. There are public schools in this country \nthat are among the very best in the world. I am proud that several of \nthem are in my district.\n  Mr. Chair, we know that public schools can work when we properly \nsupport them; but, unfortunately, for certain communities, far too many \nschools continue to struggle due to lack of resources on one hand and \nrelentless attempts to undermine them on the other. Private vouchers \nonly further perpetuate these inequities by siphoning additional \nresources for few students while leaving the rest behind in underfunded \npublic schools.\n  In our global economy, it is more essential than ever that every \nchild receives a quality education. To do that, our public schools need \nadequate resources. Diverting public money to private and parochial \nschools only worsens the problem.\n  I support access to a world-class public education for all students; \nbut too often, the majority in this body undercut that goal, whether \nthrough the so-called Student Success Act that leaves students in a \nlurch or today's SOAR bill that sorely misses the point.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to the people of the District of \nColumbia and their elected representative, Ms. Norton. Most \nimportantly, listen to the teachers and the parents who oppose this \nbill, and reject this legislation.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer), the chairman of the Republican \nPolicy Committee.\n  Mr. MESSER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in support today of H.R. 10, the Scholarships for \nOpportunity and Results Reauthorization Act.\n  I want to commend Speaker Boehner for introducing this important \nlegislation and thank him for a lifetime of extraordinary leadership on \nthis issue. Throughout his speakership and under his leadership as a \nformer chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, \nSpeaker Boehner improved educational opportunities for all students. \nLiterally thousands of kids have access to the American Dream because \nof his dedication to the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. As \nchairman of the Congressional School Choice Caucus, I was honored to \nhave Speaker Boehner keynote a rally earlier this year with hundreds of \nOpportunity Scholarship recipients.\n  I have to tell you, I am amazed at some of the rhetoric that I have \nbeen hearing today, talking about it is disgraceful that this \nlegislation is before you.\n  I will tell you what is disgraceful. It is disgraceful that any child \nin America has to go to a terrible school, and it is disgraceful that \nanyone would say that we should do anything but make sure that every \none of these kids has an opportunity to go somewhere where they will \nhave a chance to succeed.\n  Every child deserves equal access to a great education. Lots of kids \nhave great public school options in America. Other families can afford \nto send their kids to private school if they don't have a great public \nschool option. This debate today is about what we do for those who \ndon't.\n  Unfortunately, too many kids in our country have their destiny \ndetermined by their ZIP Code. These children are stuck in poorly \nperforming schools, and their parents feel powerless to do anything \nabout it.\n  That is why education choice and the Opportunity Scholarship Program \nmatter. Programs like D.C. OSP allow parents to choose the best \neducational environment for their child. The freedom provided by school \nchoice levels the playing field and helps ensure all children have a \nchance to succeed.\n  This legislation will continue to bring greater educational \nopportunities to the most underprivileged students in the District of \nColumbia, and it takes zero--let me repeat that--zero dollars away from \nD.C. Public Schools. Because of this legislation, more than 6,000 \nstudents have had the opportunity to attend a great school. Even \nbetter, an incredible 90 percent of D.C. OSP students graduate from \nhigh school. The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program is clearly a \nsuccess and needs to continue.\n  Mr. Chair, I hope for a day when we will be talking about even bolder \nproposals on this floor, because the truth is we already have school \nchoice in America if you can afford it. The only real question is: What \nare we going to do for everybody else?\n  Our Founding Fathers wrote in the Declaration of Independence that \nall men are created equal and endowed with certain unalienable rights. \nIn modern America, the pursuit of happiness comes on the back of a \nquality education.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chair, I want to remind the gentleman that the $100 \nmillion doesn't come out of the air, that this majority is cutting $2 \nbillion from K-12. Most of our children are K-12. That money has to \ncome from somewhere. We know it comes from education funds.\n  I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nTakano).\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 10, legislation \nthat would reauthorize the D.C. private school voucher program.\n  This bill prioritizes an ideological agenda over the rights of D.C. \nresidents to self-govern and, more importantly, over the rights of all \nstudents to get a quality education.\n  In study after study, the voucher program has failed to show any \nmeaningful improvement in student achievement, safety, satisfaction, \nmotivation, or engagement; yet since 2003, it has received nearly $190 \nmillion while failing to adhere to basic accountability standards.\n  Its funding should be dedicated to improving our underfunded and \nunderresourced public school system, a school system that is required \nby law to serve all students.\n\n[[Page H7065]]\n\n  Unlike public schools, private schools receiving voucher students \nhave no requirement to serve all students. Specifically, they are able \nto--and do--reject students based on prior academic achievement, \nlanguage ability, socioeconomic background, and other discriminatory \nfactors.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Poe of Texas). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Ms. NORTON. I am pleased to yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Many do not offer the necessary services for students \nwith disabilities.\n  It is a mistake to continue funding a program that fails to serve all \nstudents, damages the public school system, and disregards the \nDistrict's right to choose its own education policy.\n  I thank the gentlewoman from D.C. for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time each \nside has.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Utah has 17 minutes remaining. \nThe gentlewoman from the District of Columbia has 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to \nthe gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I love America. America should be number \none, and America's capital should be number one.\n  I love to talk to immigrants who do so much of the work in our \nCapital City. They all know America is great. They gush about how \nanybody can work in America and realize the American Dream.\n  But when I ask about their kids and where they go to school, they \nalmost uniformly send their kids to Maryland or Virginia schools. Even \nimmigrants who can barely speak English and come from Afghanistan, \nPakistan, Eritrea, or Nigeria know that D.C. schools mean stay away. \nHow embarrassing for our country that new immigrants who barely speak \nEnglish view our Nation's Capital schools with contempt.\n  Finally, President Obama, we love you and Michelle for the love you \nshow your daughters. You show your love for your daughters by spending \nsome of your substantial salary to keep your daughters out of the D.C. \nPublic Schools. Please, President Obama, show a little love for the \nchildren who don't have such wealthy parents and sign the SOAR Act.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chair, I just want to tell the gentleman that the so-\ncalled immigrants that he speaks to who send their children to schools \nin Maryland and Virginia live in Maryland and Virginia. Eighty percent \nof the jobs in the District of Columbia go to people who live in the \nsuburbs.\n  As to the schools in the District of Columbia, as I have indicated, \nthere are waiting lines to get into almost all the charter schools, and \nthe D.C. public schools have improved so much that some of them also \nhave waiting lines.\n  I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. \nCummings), our very distinguished ranking member.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. I thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia \nfor yielding and for her leadership.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 10. We have been told \nthat the purpose of this bill is to help all D.C. children get a better \neducation. I strongly support that objective, but this bill does not do \nthat.\n  Let me be crystal clear: public funds should support public \neducation. But this bill proposes to spend more than $100 million over \n5 years to fund vouchers to send public school students in the District \nof Columbia to private schools while House Republicans are proposing to \ncut $2 billion from public K-12 education nationally.\n  Coming from the city of Baltimore, I understand firsthand the \ncomplexities of turning around struggling inner-city schools. Almost 10 \nyears ago, I became deeply involved in improving one of my own \nneighborhood schools--and I am still involved in that--the Maritime \nIndustries Academy High School.\n  It takes vision, commitment, accountability, and, yes, resources to \nbegin the process of turning troubled schools around. However, it is \nimpossible to turn around public schools if we divert public resources \nto private schools.\n  Put simply, H.R. 10 attempts to help a few students at the expense of \nthe vast majority of the District's children.\n  By dividing the funding it would provide among D.C.'s public schools, \npublic charter schools, and private school vouchers, H.R. 10 provides a \nthird of its total funding to a tiny fraction of the District's \nstudents. Specifically, the bill would fund vouchers to enable only \n1,442 students--a tiny fraction of the District's 47,548 students--to \nattend private schools.\n  The lack of equity is stunning. Our focus should be on maximizing the \nimpact of the Federal Government's limited resources to serve all of \nthe District's students.\n  Since this bill last passed in 2011 over my strong objection and \nalong party lines, studies of the program have demonstrated that the \nuse of a voucher had no effect on academic achievement, as measured by \nmath and reading scores, school safety, student satisfaction with their \nschool, or motivation and engagement.\n  Previous studies of this program show that 50 percent of the students \nfrom the first two cohorts of the D.C. voucher program eventually \ndropped out of the program. Students in the program are also less \nlikely to attend a school that offers support programs for those that \nare academically challenged or have learning difficulties.\n  In addition, this bill is a direct assault on D.C.'s home rule that \nwas rushed through our committee shortly after Speaker Boehner \nannounced his retirement, and the bill is not supported by D.C.'s \nelected representative in Congress or a majority of the D.C. City \nCouncil.\n  So all the rhetoric justifying massive cuts to education funding--all \nthe talk about budget constraints, about tightening our belts, and \nabout making sacrifices--all that goes out the window when Republicans \nwant to give $100 million in taxpayer funds to private schools.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  As a graduate of public schools and a longtime advocate of quality \npublic education, I believe our highest priority must be to use limited \ntaxpayer dollars to support programs that will truly meet the \neducational needs of all of our children. This bill does not do that. I \nurge our colleagues to reject H.R. 10.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I am pleased to yield 2 \nminutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline), the chairman of \nthe Committee on Education and the Workforce.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Chaffetz for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 10, the \nScholarships for Opportunity and Results Reauthorization Act. It is a \nbill to continue the popular and successful D.C. Opportunity \nScholarship Program.\n  This program is based on the simple notion that every child deserves \nan excellent education regardless of the family's background, income, \nor ZIP Code. The program provides scholarships to students in low-\nincome families so they can escape underperforming schools and receive \nthe quality education they need to excel both in the classroom and \nlater in life. Our investment in this effort is paying off.\n  Last year, 90 percent of 12th graders who received a D.C. Opportunity \nscholarship graduated from a high-quality school, and 88 percent went \non to pursue a college degree. What is more, when asked if they were \nsatisfied with the child's education, 85 percent of the parents \nresponded ``yes.'' It is no wonder every year the demand for \nscholarships far exceeds the number of scholarships available. These \npositive results also explain why this important program has long \nenjoyed bipartisan support.\n  Of course, there are some who don't believe these vulnerable families \ndeserve the opportunity to do what is best for their children's \neducation. At a time when this administration has spent billions of \ndollars pushing its own pet projects and priorities, it has routinely \nput this modest, successful program on the chopping block. Fortunately, \nMr. Chairman, a majority in Congress has continued to stand by these \nstudents and families by continuing to support the program, and Speaker \nJohn Boehner has always stood at the forefront of those efforts.\n\n[[Page H7066]]\n\n  Few have fought harder or longer for the educational opportunities of \nD.C. students than Speaker Boehner. In fact, throughout his more than \n20 years in public office, John Boehner has been a tireless champion \nfor families who simply want the opportunity--any opportunity--for \ntheir children to receive a quality education. The D.C. Opportunity \nScholarship Program began under his leadership. Thanks to his efforts, \nthis initiative has made a positive difference in the lives of \nthousands of students across the District. This act reflects his \ncontinued commitment to these families. More importantly, it reaffirms \na bipartisan commitment to the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program and \nthe D.C. schoolchildren it serves.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to help more low-income students \nand support this legislation.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, this morning, a Member said that a letter had come from \na member of the city council, Anita Bonds, asking that her name be \nremoved from the letter sent by the council, the majority of the \ncouncil, saying that they opposed reauthorization of this bill. That \nmember has since called me. She writes:\n\n       ``Dear Member of Congress,\n       ``Due to some confusion about my position on the District \n     of Columbia voucher bill (H.R. 10), I want to make my \n     position clear. I oppose this bill, and I intend to remain a \n     signatory of the letter previously acknowledged that seven of \n     my colleagues on the D.C. Council and I sent to Chairman \n     Jason Chaffetz dated October 8, 2015, in oppostion to the \n     bill.''\n       Signed, Councilmember At-large, Anita Bonds.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I submit her letter for the Record.\n\n                                                    Council of the\n\n\n                                         District of Columbia,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 21, 2015.\n       Dear Member of Congress, Due to some confusion about my \n     position on the District of Columbia school voucher bill \n     (H.R. 10), I want to make my position clear.

Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to \nthe gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker.)\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support today of H.R. 10, the \nScholarships for Opportunity and Results Reauthorization Act. In the 10 \nmonths that I have been here, one of the neat things that I have \nexperienced is when we participated in a site visit with the Oversight \nand Government Reform Committee under Chairman Chaffetz earlier this \nyear and had a firsthand opportunity to interact with the kids and \nfamilies about the success of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program.\n  I was recently reminded just a couple weeks ago when I was sitting in \nthe hearing seeing the families, seeing the moms who were just beaming \nwith pride about their children having this special opportunity. In the \n2013 and 2014 school year, the Opportunity Scholarship Program had a \ngraduation rate of 89 percent, which is astonishing compared to the \nD.C. Public Schools graduation rate of 58 percent.\n  As a former minister, I have taken groups in the heart of the inner \ncities, places like New York and Baltimore. Specifically, in Cleveland, \nthere is a school there called Sunbeam Elementary School. Thieves had \nstolen the copper off the weathervane, the school was filthy, and there \nwas a metal detector for an elementary school. We brought in a team of \n60 or 65 people and refurbished the school and did our best. But do you \nknow what? That was only a temporary fix. The SOAR Act is a fix that \nlasts for a lifetime. It gives scholarships to children in low-income \nD.C. families to attend a private school. This piece of legislation \nalso allows parents the opportunity to provide a quality education for \ntheir children.\n  I believe that education will only be successful if two foundational \ntruths are rediscovered: first, that parents know what is best for \ntheir child, and they should have the freedom to pursue the path that \nworks for them; secondly, and finally, States must stand up to the \nFederal Government to reclaim their freedom to educate their children.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, once again, let's get this straight. The control study \ndid not evaluate college attendance. It was not a part of the study. \nNow, it did evaluate graduation rates. Mr. Chairman, what it did not \nevaluate was dropout rates.\n  Private schools are notorious for sending back to the District of \nColumbia children who they think are not doing well or they are not \nacting as they think they should act. Unless we had those figures, we \nwould have no idea what the graduation rates were, because the \ngraduation rates are those who were left in the school and did not get \nsent back.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I am pleased to yield 1\\1/\n2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of \nH.R. 10.\n  Now, why would I rise in support of this? If you hear the rhetoric \nfrom the other side, you are saying this is not a program that works; \nbut if you compare the results, it does work. When you just hear that \nonly 55 percent of people in D.C. Public Schools graduate from high \nschool and yet if they have an opportunity to go to this other school, \n89 percent graduate, my goodness, what more do you need to understand?\n  Look, it is very evident about what is going on here. If you want our \nchildren to succeed, if you want our children to excel, and if you want \nAmerica to be able to compete worldwide, then education is the answer. \nThe true issue here is a moral issue and a civil rights issue.\n  I really believe that President Obama, in 2008, was on to something. \nThis is what the President said:\n\n       The single most important factor in determining student \n     achievement is not the color of their skin, it is not where \n     they come from, it is not their parents or how much money \n     their parents have. It is who their teacher is.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, if there is one thing that has made this country \nexceptional, it is that we have allowed everyone the opportunity to \nrise from whatever level they started at to whatever level they can \nachieve. It is only possible through education. This program works.\n  Mr. Chairman, $60 million is going to be equally divided between the \nD.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, D.C. Public Schools, and the D.C. \nPublic Charter Schools. When we give this money to the parents of these \nchildren, when they get a chance to see their children excel, when they \nget a chance to see their children grow, and when they see a chance for \ntheir children to have great success, how can we sit in America's House \nand debate about is this really what it is all about?\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, Members can keep repeating all they want to figures \nthat have come from the air. The only thing evaluated by the \ncongressionally mandated evaluation was the test scores. Our public \nschool students and our charter school students have to take these \ntests. These children took these tests.\n  Our public school students are doing better--not nearly as good as \nthey should--and so are our charter schools. In fact, our charter \nschools are doing even better than our public school students, and \nthese students didn't move at all. That is what the congressionally \nmandated study showed.\n  As to civil rights, these schools are exempted from many of the civil \nrights laws, and for that reason, the Leadership Conference on Civil \nand Human Rights, the NAACP, and a number of organizations wrote \nopposing reauthorization of this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford.)\n  Mr. SANFORD. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I think that there is one fundamental question in this \ndebate, and that is: Should a child be trapped in a school that traps \nthem? Should a child be trapped in a school\n\n[[Page H7067]]\n\nthat, for whatever reason, isn't working for them but would forever \nlimit their capacity and their potential in life? To me, that is what \nH.R. 10 is all about.\n  I think it is important to remember that 98 percent of the kids that \nhave entered this program have come from schools that were not \nperforming; and in that regard, this is simply a way out, it is a hand \nup. I think it fundamentally recognizes that dignity and worth that \ncomes with giving somebody a choice.\n  I think it is something that every human being wants, which is simply \na choice. I think it is a recognition of the fact that one size never \nfits all, that God makes us all different, and therefore a plethora of \ndifferent choices is vital in the marketplace.\n  Finally, it is recognition of the fact that the marketplace has the \nability to create choices that might take forever in other systems, \ntime that these kids do not have. I would ask that we refocus on the \nkids.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I don't know about other Members' districts, but I \nchallenge Members to meet what the District of Columbia has done to \nkeep students from being trapped in bad schools.\n  In your districts, can 75 percent of the children choose to go to a \nbetter performing district? They can in mine.\n  In your district, are there 110 publicly accountable charter schools \nas an alternative to your own traditional public schools? There are in \nmine.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Rokita).\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his leadership in \nbringing this excellent bill to the floor. This bill--of which, in full \ndisclosure, I am an original cosponsor of--will continue to promote \nschool choice and provide Opportunity scholarships to D.C. students \nthat are most in need, while also expanding D.C. Public Charter \nSchools, therefore providing more opportunities for Washington students \nto excel and set themselves up for productive and successful lives.\n  Now, to date, the Opportunity Scholarship Program has been an \neducational lifeline for more than 6,000 children from very low-income \nD.C. families, and more than 16,000 have applied to participate since \nthe 2004-05 school year. Quite simply put, this program works.\n  It is no secret I am a big proponent of school choice. As chairman of \nthe Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education Subcommittee, \nI have heard about the challenges many students in schools are facing, \nand I firmly believe that when parents have a choice, kids have a \nchance. This program, which has helped pave the way for others like it \nacross the country, gives that chance, and it creates a healthy \ncompetition that causes all schools to improve, therefore helping all \nstudents, even those who aren't in the program.\n  As I have seen in my home State of Indiana and across this great \ncountry touring schools and visiting classrooms, Opportunity \nscholarships provide students a hand up in improving their lives, their \nfamily's lives, and their communities. That is why we have a moral \nobligation to pass this legislation and why I urge my colleagues to \njoin me and join the others here on the floor in reauthorizing the D.C. \nOpportunity Scholarship Program.\n  Mr. Chairman, a great education is a great equalizer. It opens doors \nto unlimited possibilities and provides students the tools that they \nneed to succeed in life.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I am pleased to yield 1 \nminute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the Scholarships for \nOpportunity and Results Reauthorization Act.\n  Speaker Boehner led the Nation over 10 years ago when he provided \nflexibility to Washington, D.C., children and their parents through \nSchool Choice. I believe that School Choice is paramount to increasing \neducational gains for all children, but especially our Nation's \nstudents who are most in need.\n  The SOAR Act gives scholarships to low-income students to attend a \nprivate school, providing them an opportunity to access a quality \neducation that would otherwise be out of reach.\n  School Choice has proven to be successful in Washington, D.C., as \nstudents using their scholarships have a 90 percent graduation rate \ncompared to the 58 percent graduation rate for D.C. public schools in \n2013 and 2014.\n  We heard today that these statistics have been questioned, and we \nhope that the public schools are improving. But with this act would \nthey actually be improving?\n  I encourage my colleagues to stand up for School Choice by supporting \nthe SOAR Act.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I would draw our Members' attention to the editorial board comments \nfrom yesterday. This is from the Washington Post: A misguided attack on \nD.C.'s needy students.\n  I want to remind people, as they did in this document here in this \neditorial, that eight council members seem unaware that the program was \nestablished in 2004 at the initiation of the then-D.C. Mayor Anthony \nWilliams, who was also supported by the chairman of the Council's \nEducation Committee, and it has produced results.\n  The graduation rates are amazingly good, at roughly 90 percent, \ncompared to D.C. public schools that are less than 60 percent. I think \nthat is strong evidence that it is a winner, that it does provide a \ngood opportunity for people, and that it should be reauthorized.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time each \nside has remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Utah has 6 minutes remaining. \nThe gentlewoman from the District of Columbia has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I am pleased to yield 1 \nminute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner), the author of this \npiece of legislation and the distinguished Speaker of the House.\n  Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Chairman, let me thank my colleague for yielding, \nand thank all my colleagues who are supporting this legislation today.\n  Many of us remember the story of ``The Little Engine That Could.'' \nWhat happened was that the train full of toys wanted to get over the \nmountain to get to the kids on the other side. The big engine said: No, \nI cannot. The rusty old engine said: No, I cannot. But the little \nengine says: I'm not very big, but I think I can. I think I can.\n  Well, from the beginning, the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program \nhas been the little engine that could. We started this back in 2003 \nwith the help of D.C.'s Mayor at the time, Anthony Williams, and D.C. \ncouncilman Kevin Chavous.\n  For years the government was promising the Moon to D.C. families and \nspending the Moon, essentially, but nothing changed. So we said: If we \nare going to support public schools and charter schools, let's also \ngive low-income families the chance to apply for scholarships to attend \nthe school of their choice. Let's give them that power.\n  Because if you have got the resources, you already have school \nchoice. You can send your kids to whatever school you want to send them \nto. You can move from the neighborhood you are in to where they have \ngot a better school. But if you are poor and you are stuck in a bad \nneighborhood and your child doesn't have that chance or, frankly, any \nchance, they are just dead in the water.\n  Well, the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program has been that little \nlifeline that could. All told, 6,100 students have escaped \nunderperforming schools. In that time, the program has received some \n16,000 applications. Last spring 90 percent of 12th graders using the \nOpportunity scholarships graduated and\n\n[[Page H7068]]\n\n88 percent enrolled in a 2- or 4-year college. Of the 1,400 students in \nthe program this year, 87.4 percent would have been in a school that \nthe government has identified as in need of improvement.\n  These are the kind of results parents dream of for their kids. And \nwhile it is my name on the bill, the best champions of this program are \nsome of the most fearless kids you will ever see.\n  Not only did they have to overcome the doubts of the education \nestablishment, they also had to withstand efforts by some of the most \npowerful people in this city to kill this program.\n  So today I am asking each of you to support H.R. 10, which \nreauthorizes this program for another 5 years. Here is why. Yes, this \nissue is personal to me and has been for a long time. But, frankly, it \nought to be personal to every single Member of this body.\n  Those of us who work here, who make a good living here, owe something \nto the kids in this town. We owe these kids a fighting chance at \nsuccess.\n  So what I am asking you to do today is help these kids get over the \nmountain. Help us keep building the movement that could. Vote for H.R. \n10.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The Speaker has said that, without this program, these children would \nhave been in bad neighborhood schools. Well, I think it must be noted \nthat the District of Columbia has done more to make sure that those \nchildren are not trapped in such schools than any district I have yet \nread about or heard of.\n  I have noted that 75 percent--that means the overwhelming number--of \nchildren stuck in neighborhood schools that they believe are not good \nschools go to the other side of town, if necessary, to a better school. \nFar from being trapped, they are encouraged to choose a better school. \nAnd I have also cited the 110 charter schools that increase their \nchoices.\n  And, Mr. Chairman, I want you to know that many of the voucher \nparents whom I have met with--after all, they are my constituents--have \nsaid to me that they tried to get into one of our charter schools, but \nthe waiting lists were too long, which is why they went to the voucher \nschools.\n  Now, isn't it interesting that the voucher schools have no waiting \nlist, but the D.C. charter schools and many of our public schools have \nwaiting lists, so much so that D.C. has had to combine the public \nschools and the charter schools on one list in a lottery so that \nfamilies can choose which school to go to.\n  How many Members on that side of the aisle have a lottery that lets \nthe children, the parents, choose the best school for them to go to? Do \nnot dare tell me that the District of Columbia leaves children trapped \nin failing schools. It has gone out of its way to do just the opposite.\n  And what does it get for it? The imposition by this body of yet \nanother alternative. It is true that, a former mayor, who himself went \nto Catholic schools, said he was for vouchers. Well, Mr. Chairman, I \nask you, then, since the District of Columbia has control of its own \neducation apparatus, why hasn't the District of Columbia set up its own \nvoucher schools? Some other districts have done that. Because the \nmajority, they don't prefer vouchers, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from the District of Columbia has 2 \nminutes remaining.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, there are many reasons why I oppose this \nbill. First, it has failed the goal that the Congress gave it. Bring \nthese children's test scores up. The public schools have brought their \ntest scores up. The public charter schools have done even better in \nbringing their test scores up. These children's test scores have not \nrisen.\n  Moreover, I can't fail to note how recently the majority has cut K-12 \nby $2 billion while taking $100 million out of, obviously, education \nfunds to fund a private school voucher bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, not everybody on my side of the aisle is for public \ncharter schools, but I have supported public charter schools because my \nown constituents wanted and needed a way out of neighborhood schools \nvery often.\n  Yet, even though I come to this floor with home rule choices, this \nbody is insisting on its choices, knowing full well that nobody in the \nDistrict of Columbia can vote against their choices.\n  And it says to the District of Columbia residents: No matter what you \ndo, people, no matter how good your choices are, no matter how much you \nmeet the standards we often talk about when it comes to choice, you, \nwho have no vote on this floor, who will not vote on this bill when the \nbell rings in a few minutes, must do what we say.\n  That, my good friends, is not a chapter in democracy. It shows once \nagain that Republican do whatever they care to do to the District of \nColumbia, even when they reject the same choice for their own \nconstituents, and vote down for their constituents what they now impose \non mine. Just a few months ago, the House and Senate voted down \nvouchers, but today--today--they will vote to impose these same \nvouchers on the District of Columbia.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I want to correct the record there. I think, obviously, somebody \nmisspoke. The House did not vote on vouchers in this Congress. That is \nnot what has happened.\n  Mr. Chairman, I insert into the Record the letter we got from 500 \nfamilies, D.C. residents, urging us in the adoption of this.\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 2015.\n       Dear Representatives: We are a large and diverse number of \n     parents of children attending various schools within the \n     District of Columbia. We write to urge your support of the \n     Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Reauthorization Act \n     (SOAR) (H.R. 10).\n       The SOAR Act is bipartisan legislation which ensures our \n     rights as parents to choose the best public, charter or \n     private school for our children. It not only provides up to \n     $20 million for Opportunity Scholarships for low-income \n     families to attend private schools, but also authorizes an \n     additional $40 million per year for public and charter \n     schools in the District of Columbia. This three-sector \n     initiative provides opportunities for all our children to \n     succeed!\n       Nearly 6,200 children from very low-income families in the \n     city have attended private schools through the Opportunity \n     Scholarship Program over the past eleven years--88% coming \n     from areas zoned for schools in need of improvement and 97% \n     African-American or Hispanic. These students graduate at \n     rates 30 points higher than the city's public schools and \n     have a near 90 percent college enrollment rate. These are \n     proven results!\n       The SOAR Act is an example of what works in education. When \n     we can choose the best public, charter, or private school for \n     our children, there are not only more opportunities to engage \n     in their education, but also for them to achieve greater \n     academic excellence. These outcomes strengthen the city's \n     education system as a whole.\n       We believe that maintaining and fully funding all \n     educational options are critically important for the city's \n     families, especially low-income families served by the \n     Opportunity Scholarship Program. No child should be denied a \n     safe, quality education because of their family income or zip \n     code.\n       We therefore urge you to support the swift passage of the \n     SOAR Act.\n           Sincerely,\n       Ms. Nichelle Cluff, Mrs. Ifeyinwa Ikoli, Ms. Stephanie \n     Montgomery, Ms. Mary Montgomery, Ms. Nina Harris, Ms. Eboni \n     Purvis, Ms. Juliette Randolph, Ms. Ashley Adams, Ms. Naa \n     Borle Sakeyfio, Mrs. Mariama Bah, Ms. Mia Wilson, Mrs. Sherri \n     Calhoun, Ms. Lamonica Jeffrey, Mr. Darrell Cousar, Mr. James \n     Calhoun, Mr. Andrew Cyr, Ms. Kayann McCalla, Mrs. Aldrina \n     Cabrera, Ms. Kiana Wright, Ms. Albertine Cole.\n       Ms. Dianna Coley, Ms. Tonya Carter, Ms. Giovanna Grayson, \n     Ms. Luciana Udeozor, Ms. Andrea Davis, Mrs. Obiagel nuel-\n     Ejiofor, Mr. Emmanuel Ejiofor, Mr. Rogers Ferguson, Mr. Girma \n     Mihretu, Ms. Molita Gaskins, Ms. Latoya Myers, Ms. Djenane \n     Jeanty, Ms. Keona Lewis, Mrs. Nicole Knott, Mr. Rudy Knott, \n     Mr. Hanna Boku, Mr. Rashawn McCain, Ms. Ann Mmayie, Ms. Rita \n     Pineda, Mr. Okechukwu Mbarah.\n       Mr. Carlings McPhail, Ms. Ann Meruh, Ms. Shantel Powell-\n     Morgan, Mrs. Marguerita Ramos, Mrs. Muanza Sangamay, Ms. \n     Felicia Thomas, Ms. Sydney Williams, Ms. Caren Kirkland, Mrs. \n     Temitope Tayo, Mr. Anthony Ugorji, Ms. Natasha Tutt, Ms. Dina \n     Bayou, Ms. Natasha Tutt, Mr. Calvin Wright, Mrs. Julia \n     Ugorji, Mrs. Chinwe Mbarah, Mr. Souleymane Bah, Julie \n     McLaughlin, Sheila Martinez, Susan Morais.\n       Joan Sapienza, Eddie Donahue, Jeseph Yohe, Carter \n     Jefferson, Vincent Browning, Jonathan Bender, Peter Frantz, \n     Ellen Graper, Elizabeth LeBras, Kiandra Willis, Robert \n     McKeon, Marcela Price Souaya, Stephen Lennon, Aleasa Chiles-\n     Feggins, Sally Leakamariam, Juleanna Glover, Christopher \n     Reiter, Cristina Khalaf, Tom Shea, Sean Vincent.\n       Karen Brennan, Ceci Smith, Adrienne Vincent, Pedro Smith, \n     Donna Gibson, Colleen Cavanagh, Chris Long, Aleasa Chiles-\n     Feggins, Mariela Alardon-Yohe, Jennifer Browning, Philippa \n     Bender, Melanie Jefferson, Veronica Nyhan Jones, Michael\n\n[[Page H7069]]\n\n     Truscott, Eavan O'Halloran, Sakinah Dupree, Morris Redd, Ron \n     Josey, Susana Ramos-Izquierdo, Aimee Donahue.\n       Marisse Rovira, Linda Girardi, Sharlene Mentor, Lisa \n     Richa, James McLaughlin, Glenda Morales, Samuel Parker \n     III, Clarence Jones, Leyla Y.

Mr. Chairman, I also introduce into the Record The \nWashington Post editorial from yesterday, ``A Misguided Attack on \nD.C.'s Needy Students,'' actually supporting this.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 20, 2015]\n\n              A Misguided Attack on D.C.'s Needy Students\n\n                          (By Editorial Board)\n\n       Is the federally funded scholarship program for poor D.C. \n     families being forced on an unwilling city? It is safe to say \n     that thousands of D.C. parents whose children are on the \n     waiting list for a scholarship do not think so. Nor, we would \n     venture, do the 6,100 children, predominantly minorities, who \n     have used the scholarships to attend private schools. For \n     that matter, students in the city's public schools who have \n     benefited from the infusion of federal dollars that has \n     accompanied the voucher program probably would not embrace \n     the argument either.\n       So whom do members of the D.C. Council think they are \n     helping as they urge Congress to kill this program?\n       Fortunately, it does not appear that the council members \n     will succeed in inflicting this wound on their city. Congress \n     appears poised to reauthorize the D.C. Opportunity \n     Scholarship Program, which provides needy students with up to \n     $12,572 to pay for tuition, fees and transportation to a \n     school of their choice. The average family income for \n     participating families is less than $22,000. A bill extending \n     the program for five years and championed by outgoing House \n     Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) is set for a floor vote \n     Wednesday, while a bipartisan group of senators has filed a \n     companion bill that would continue the program through 2025.\n       Seeking to derail those efforts, a misguided majority of \n     the D.C. Council, undoubtedly egged on by Del. Eleanor Holmes \n     Norton (D-D.C.) and other voucher critics, wrote a letter to \n     Congress objecting to what they portrayed as an intrusion \n     into local affairs. These eight council members seemed \n     unaware that the program was established in 2004 at the \n     initiation of Anthony Williams (D), then D.C.'s mayor, and \n     with the strong support of Kevin Chavous (D), then chair of \n     the council's Education Committee. Likewise, they were \n     unmoved by polling that has shown 74 percent of D.C. \n     residents support\n\n[[Page H7070]]\n\n     the voucher program, which, despite the specious claims of \n     critics, has improved outcomes for its students without \n     taking a dime from regular public schools.\n       Indeed, the three-sector federal approach has brought more \n     than $600 million to D.C. schools, with traditional public \n     schools receiving $239 million, charter public schools $195 \n     million and the voucher program $183 million. At stake for \n     fiscal 2016 is an additional $45 million. It is fantasy to \n     think there would be additional monies absent vouchers.\n       School reform has brought improvement throughout the \n     system. Yet, many parents still lack the choices and the \n     access to high-quality education that city politicians take \n     for granted for their own families. We credit D.C. Council \n     Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) and council members Vincent B. \n     Orange (D-At Large), Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3), Brandon T. Todd \n     (D-Ward 4) and Kenyan R. McDuffie (D-Ward 5) for not seeking \n     to deprive those parents of choice, and we hope their eight \n     colleagues will rethink their position and put constituents' \n     welfare over misguided ideology.\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, the bottom line is this program produces \nresults. I like the variety of choices. And the Delegate has been a \nreal champion for charter schools, and I applaud her for that, I \nsupport her in that. But the reality is the scholarships that we are \ntalking about here, the Opportunity scholarships, have yielded the best \nresults with nearly 90 percent graduation rates and roughly 88 percent \nof the people then going on to college. Those are amazing statistics.\n  But I have heard a lot of derogatory comments. I have heard \neverything from misguided, idiotic, disgraceful, weakens, underfunded. \nUnderfunded? Underfunded? That is offensive to us from Utah. We happen \nto have the lowest per pupil funding in the entire United States. We \nare not proud of that fact. But the reality is we get roughly $6,500 \nper student, where in Washington, D.C. you get about $19,500 per \nstudent. It is not even close. And yet here we are championing and \ntrying to help give more money, more resources, to what are \nunderperforming students and giving them more choices.\n  I guess one of the things you should consider is if the Congress does \nsupport this bill, does pass this bill, it is appropriated, would \nanybody on the Democratic side of the aisle actually recommend that the \ncity not take the money?\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  If it is so idiotic, if it is so awful, if it is so derogatory, if it \nis so negative, then why not cut it off right now? See, they want to \ncontinue to allow it to happen for those who have scholarships now \nbecause they know it is working, and they could never look those \nparents in the eye and take it away; but they are going to deny that \nchoice to future generations where we know there has been demonstrable \nsuccess.\n  So I am proud of Speaker Boehner and what he has done to champion \nthis bill. I think it is a good bill. With that, I urge the adoption of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, today, I will vote against H.R. 10, which \nwould continue a flawed program that pursues a partisan ideology at the \nexpense of a child's quality education.\n  This bill would reauthorize Washington, D.C.'s private school voucher \nprogram, the only program in the country using federal money to send \nchildren to private and religious schools. The SOAR voucher program was \na five year pilot set to expire in 2008. Despite four studies by the \nDepartment of Education and two General Accountability Office (GAO) \nreports concluding that the program wasn't working, Republicans in \nCongress are doubling down by allowing taxpayer dollars to prop up \nunaccredited, and even unsafe, schools. The last thing we need, as our \nstudents fall further behind their international peers, are voucher \nschools operating in relative isolation, free of oversight for \ncurriculum, quality or management.\n  SOAR is the only program of its kind for a reason--there's no way our \nstates would tolerate such nonsense. Sadly, because D.C. has not been \nfreed from the partisan grips of Congress, it has become commonplace to \nsee House Republicans impose their politics on D.C., despite widespread \ncitizen and local government objection, from women's health care to \nmarijuana reform to street design. There's justification for a program \nthat funnels millions of dollars into a program shown to be ineffective \nand strongly opposed by the people that should matter--the parents, the \neducators, and taxpayers who support the system.\n  Worse, the SOAR Act strips students of constitutional protections of \ncivil rights: federal funds can flow to schools that do not meet the \nfederal standards to prevent discrimination against disabled persons, \npersons of color, persons of a religious group, women, or any other \nprotected class. The SOAR Act is a sad step backward for education \npolicy, civil rights, and good governance, and I strongly oppose it.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in opposition to H.R. 10, \nthe Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Reauthorization Act.\n  H.R. 10 would reauthorize the District of Columbia private school \nvoucher program, the Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP), for five \nyears through 2021.\n  H.R. 10 would reauthorize the Scholarships for Opportunity and \nResults Act, which provides Federal support for improving traditional \npublic schools in the District of Columbia (D.C.), expanding and \nimproving high-quality D.C. public charter schools, and offering \nprivate school vouchers to a limited number of students.\n  The Obama Administration continues to strongly oppose the private \nschool vouchers program within this legislation, known as the D.C. \nOpportunity Scholarship Program.\n  Members of the House should respect the self determination of the \nresidents of DC by not forcing education policy onto children or their \nfamilies at taxpayer expense.\n  Rigorous evaluation over several years demonstrates that D.C. \nvouchers have not yielded statistically significant improvements in \nstudent achievement by scholarship recipients compared to other \nstudents not receiving vouchers.\n  In addition, H.R. 10 would extend this voucher program to a new \npopulation of students previously attending private schools.\n  Instead of using Federal resources to support a handful of students \nin private schools, the Federal Government should focus its attention \nand available resources on improving the quality of public schools for \nall students.\n  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this \nbill.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  The amendments recommended by the Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform printed in the bill are adopted and the bill, as \namended, shall be considered as read.\n  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:\n\n                                H.R. 10\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES IN ACT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the \n     ``Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Reauthorization \n     Act'' or the ``SOAR Reauthorization Act''.\n       (b) References in Act.--Whenever in this Act an amendment \n     is expressed in terms of an amendment to or repeal of a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to that section or other provision of the \n     Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act (division C of \n     Public Law 112-10; sec. 38-1853.01 et seq., D.C. Official \n     Code).\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Parents are best equipped to make decisions for their \n     children, including the educational setting that will best \n     serve the interests and educational needs of their children.\n       (2) In 1995, Congress passed the DC School Reform Act, \n     which granted the District of Columbia the authority to \n     create public charter schools and gave parents greater \n     educational options for their children.\n       (3) In 2003, in partnership with the Mayor of the District \n     of Columbia, the chairman of the DC Council Education \n     Committee, and community activists, Congress passed the DC \n     School Choice Incentive Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-199; 118 \n     Stat. 126), to provide opportunity scholarships to parents of \n     students in the District of Columbia to enable them to pursue \n     a high-quality education at a private elementary or secondary \n     school of their choice.\n       (4) The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program (DC OSP) was \n     part of a comprehensive three-part funding arrangement that \n     provided additional funds for both the District of Columbia \n     public schools and public charter schools of the District of \n     Columbia. The intent behind the additional resources was to \n     ensure both District of Columbia public and charter schools \n     continued to improve.\n       (5) In 2011, Congress enacted the three-part funding \n     arrangement when it reauthorized the DC OSP and passed the \n     Scholarships for Opportunity and Results (SOAR) Act (division \n     C of Public Law 112-10) with bipartisan support.\n       (6) While the National Center for Education Statistics \n     indicates that per pupil expenditure for public schools in \n     the District of Columbia is the highest in the United States, \n     performance on the National Assessment of Educational \n     Progress (NAEP) continues to be near the bottom of the \n     country when examining scores in mathematics and reading\n\n[[Page H7071]]\n\n     for fourth and eighth grades. When Congress passed the DC \n     School Choice Incentive Act of 2003, students in the District \n     of Columbia ranked 52 out of 52 States (including the \n     Department of Defense schools). Since that time, the District \n     of Columbia has made significant gains in mathematics and \n     reading. However, students in the District of Columbia still \n     rank in the bottom three States out of 52 States. According \n     to the 2013 fourth grade math NAEP results, 34 percent of \n     students are below basic, 38 percent are at basic, and 28 \n     percent are at proficient or advanced. The 2013 fourth grade \n     reading results found that 50 percent of fourth grade \n     students in the District of Columbia are at or below basic, \n     27 percent are at basic, and 23 percent are proficient or \n     advanced.\n       (7) Since the inception of the DC OSP, there has been \n     strong demand for the program by parents and the citizens of \n     the District of Columbia. In fact, 74 percent of District of \n     Columbia residents support continuing the program (based on \n     the Lester & Associates February 2011 Poll).\n       (8) Since the program's inception, parental satisfaction \n     has remained high. The program has also been found to result \n     in significantly higher graduation rates for those students \n     who have received and used their opportunity scholarships.\n       (9) The DC OSP offers low-income families in the District \n     of Columbia important educational alternatives while public \n     schools are improved.

Mr. Chairman, the manager's amendment that I am \noffering makes small technical changes to the bill.\n  First, the amendment substitutes the term ``low achieving schools'' \nfor ``lowest performing schools,'' which corresponds to the language \nused by the District of Columbia on this topic.\n  Second, the amendment makes clear that the Secretary of Education and \nthe Mayor of the District of Columbia will monitor and report on the \nuse of funds authorized by this bill.\n  Third, the amendment clarifies reporting requirements in the bill to \nprotect students against arbitrary exclusion from the program.\n  Finally, the amendment requires the Secretary of Education to direct \nfunding for public charter schools to the District's Office of the \nState Superintendent of Education.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a good amendment that reflects the ongoing \nconversations with the District of Columbia regarding this bill. I urge \nits adoption.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment, although I am not opposed to it.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Graves of Louisiana). Without objection, the \ngentlewoman from the District of Columbia is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I actually agree with the chairman, and the \nchairman has consulted with us on these changes, which are technical in \nnature.\n  I do not oppose this amendment. Indeed, I want to thank our chairman \nfor working with us before this committee markup on this bill on some \nadditional technical changes.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate working with the Delegate. \nIt is a good working relationship. We have our opposition from time to \ntime, but she did work with us in this way, and I appreciate her \nsupport of this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Ms. Norton\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in House Report 114-300.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add at the end of section 6 the following new subsection:\n       (f) Limit on Percentage of Total Student Population of \n     School Who Receive Opportunity Scholarships.--Section 3007(a) \n     (sec. 38-1853.07(a), D.C.

Pursuant to House Resolution 480, the gentlewoman \nfrom the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) and a Member opposed each \nwill control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The Speaker's voucher bill is sure to pass, and I am sure it is \noffered with the best of intentions. Therefore, I want to work with him \nand with Members and with those in the Senate who support vouchers to \nprovide much-needed oversight for the millions in\n\n[[Page H7074]]\n\nFederal dollars in this bill. It is in that spirit that I offer a two-\npart amendment, and both parts are entirely consistent with the \nunderlying bill.\n  The Government Accountability Office, the GAO, said in 2007 and again \nin 2013 that the voucher program lacks quality control, transparency, \nand information.\n  In response, the first part of my amendment restores the scientific \nintegrity of the program's evaluation, copied from prior authorizations \nof this bill, and the second prohibits voucher mills, not our \naccredited Catholic schools, which are attended by most of our \nchildren, but their competition for vouchers--a small, but significant, \nnumber of private schools that would not exist but for this Federal \nfunding.\n  First, my amendment restores the evaluation of the program's \neffectiveness that Congress has required since the program was created \nin 2004--and I am quoting from Congress--``to be conducted using the \nstrongest possible research design.''\n  In contrast, this bill requires the evaluation to be conducted using \n``an acceptable quasi-experimental research design that actually \nprohibits the more scientific randomized controlled trial Congress \nmandated in prior authorizations.''\n  Yet the congressionally mandated evaluation said that randomized \ncontrolled trials ``are especially important in the context of School \nChoice because families wanting to apply for a Choice program may have \neducational goals and aspirations that differ from the average \nfamily's.''\n  I appreciate that this bill requires for the first time that schools \nbe accredited, but it gives unaccredited schools 5 years, along with \nthe grace period of a year, to become accredited.\n  This time frame is so long that it would allow existing and new \nunaccredited schools to accept voucher students well into the decade. \nThe 50 percent cap that my amendment proposes at least would ensure \nthat voucher schools would ultimately be eliminated.\n  For example, the GAO found that six participating voucher schools had \nmore than 80 percent of their enrollment from voucher students. A \nWashington Post investigation found one school where voucher students \ncomprised 93 percent of the total.\n  The majority concedes that there is a need for the ongoing evaluation \nof the program's effectiveness by requiring a study of this bill, but \nafter the mandated study showed that vouchers did not improve student \nachievement, the majority took care of that by watering down the \nmandated evaluation.\n  The second part of my amendment prohibits fly-by-night, often \nstorefront school voucher bills by eliminating the percentage of \nvoucher students in the school to 50 percent of the school's total \nenrollment. No current voucher student or sibling would be affected by \nthe cap.\n  My amendment would disqualify so-called voucher mills, a small, but \nsignificant, number of schools that cannot survive without government \nfunding, most of which sprang up in low-income neighborhoods after the \nprogram was created to get unrestricted Federal funds.\n  Why should the major recipients of voucher funds--our fully \naccredited Catholic schools or other parochial and private schools--\nhave to share the available funding with voucher mills of low quality? \nThe way to eliminate these unaccredited schools, which are unworthy of \nour students, is to require that their enrollment not consist primarily \nof voucher students.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask that the Post's investigation, entitled, \n``Quality controls lacking for D.C. schools accepting Federal \nvouchers,'' be included in the Record.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 17, 2012]\n\n  Quality Controls Lacking for D.C. Schools Accepting Federal Vouchers\n\n                   (By Lyndsey Layton and Emma Brown)\n\n       Congress created the nation's only federally funded school \n     voucher program in the District to give the city's poorest \n     children a chance at a better education than their \n     neighborhood schools offer.\n       But a Washington Post review found that hundreds of \n     students use their voucher dollars to attend schools that are \n     unaccredited or are in unconventional settings, such as a \n     family-run K-12 school operating out of a storefront, a \n     Nation of Islam school based in a converted Deanwood \n     residence, and a school built around the philosophy of a \n     Bulgarian psychotherapist.\n       At a time when public schools face increasing demands for \n     accountability and transparency, the 52 D.C. private schools \n     that receive millions of federal voucher dollars are subject \n     to few quality controls and offer widely disparate \n     experiences, the Post found.\n       Some of these schools are heavily dependent on tax dollars, \n     with more than 90 percent of their students paying with \n     federal vouchers.\n       Yet the government has no say over curriculum, quality or \n     management. And parents trying to select a school have little \n     independent information, relying mostly on marketing from the \n     schools.\n       The director of the nonprofit organization that manages the \n     D.C. vouchers on behalf of the federal government calls \n     quality control ``a blind spot.''\n       ``We've raised the question of quality oversight of the \n     program as sort of a dead zone, a blind spot,'' said Ed \n     Davies, interim executive director of the D.C. Children and \n     Youth Investment Trust Corp. ``Currently, we don't have that \n     authority. It doesn't exist.''\n       Republicans in Congress established the D.C. voucher \n     program eight years ago to demonstrate the school-choice \n     concepts that the party has been espousing since the 1950s. \n     Vouchers were once thought to be moribund, but came roaring \n     to life in 2010 in states where Republicans took control. \n     Fourteen states have created voucher programs or expanded \n     existing ones in recent years.\n       Some states, such as Wisconsin, now include middle-class \n     families in their voucher programs. Other states, including \n     Virginia, have begun indirectly steering public dollars to \n     private schools by offering tax credits to those who donate \n     to scholarship funds.\n       In some cases, the public has pushed back against the idea \n     of routing state dollars from public to private schools. \n     Legal challenges are pending in Colorado and Indiana. In the \n     November elections, Florida voters rejected a ballot \n     amendment that would have permitted tax dollars to flow to \n     religious institutions, including parochial schools. That \n     would have enabled the state to revive a voucher program that \n     had been declared unconstitutional in 2006 by its highest \n     court. Yet Florida continues to offer vouchers for disabled \n     students who want to attend private schools and awards tax \n     credits to corporations that donate to private-school \n     scholarship programs.\n       In the District, it's clear that vouchers have provided \n     many children with an education at well-established private \n     schools that otherwise would have been out of reach, and \n     their parents rave about the opportunity. Of the 1,584 \n     District students now receiving vouchers, more than half \n     attend Catholic schools and a handful are enrolled at \n     prestigious independent schools such as Sidwell Friends, \n     where President Obama sends his daughters.\n       But the most comprehensive study of the D.C. program found \n     ``no conclusive evidence'' that the vouchers improved math \n     and reading test scores for those students who left their \n     public schools.\n       The study, released by the U.S. Department of Education in \n     2010, found that voucher students were more likely to \n     graduate than peers without vouchers, based on data collected \n     from families. And parents reported that their children were \n     safer attending the private schools, though the students \n     themselves perceived no difference.\n       Congress set aside $20 million for the D.C. voucher program \n     this year. Since 2004, the federal government has \n     appropriated $133 million for the program.\n       Private schools that participate in the D.C. program don't \n     have to disclose the number of voucher students they enroll \n     or how much public money they receive, and many declined to \n     release such information to The Post.\n       While public schools must report test scores and take \n     action when they don't meet goals, private schools \n     participating in the D.C. voucher program are insulated from \n     such interference.\n       The schools must administer a single standardized test, but \n     can choose the type. Those scores are not made public, and \n     schools can stay in the voucher program no matter how their \n     students fare.\n       Schools that accept vouchers are required to hold a \n     certificate of occupancy and employ teachers who are college \n     graduates, but they do not have to be accredited. The Post \n     found that at least eight of the 52 schools are not \n     accredited.\n       Parents, not the government, should determine a school's \n     quality, according to Kevin Smith, a spokesman for House \n     Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), a proud product of Catholic \n     schools who designed the voucher program. ``Our belief is \n     that parents--when provided appropriate information--will \n     select the best learning environment for their children,'' he \n     wrote in an e-mail.\n       At Archbishop Carroll High School, where 40 percent of \n     students receive vouchers, principal Mary Elizabeth Blaufuss \n     agrees. ``The question is, to what extent do we trust parents \n     to make educational decisions for their kids?'' she said.\n       Santa Carballo knew little about the Academia de la Recta \n     Porta before enrolling her daughter, Emma, through the \n     voucher program. She chose it because it was across the \n     street from the Catholic school for boys that her son \n     attends, also with a voucher, and it seemed better than a \n     neighborhood public school that has failed for years to meet \n     achievement targets.\n       ``This is private, it's good,'' said Carballo, an immigrant \n     from El Salvador who works\n\n[[Page H7075]]\n\n     as a waitress and struggles with English. ``It's more \n     intelligent. And it's religious, it's good. I'm so happy.''\n       A nondenominational Christian school, the Academia charges \n     $7,100 a year and occupies a soot-stained storefront between \n     a halal meat shop and an evening wear boutique on a busy \n     stretch of Georgia Avenue NW near the Maryland line.\n       The K-12 school consists of two classrooms. A drum set and \n     keyboard are stowed in a corner for music class; for gym, \n     students travel nearly two miles down Georgia Avenue to the \n     city's Emery Recreation Center.\n       Annette and Reginald Miles founded the unaccredited school \n     13 years ago. He is the pastor of the associated church, she \n     is the school director, their daughter is a teacher and their \n     grandson is a student.\n       Annette Miles declined to say how many of her 70 students \n     receive vouchers. If the program were to end, the Academia \n     would ``have to stretch with fundraising'' to continue \n     operating, she said.\n       To be eligible for a voucher, families must qualify for \n     food stamps or meet other income requirements.\n       Through the D.C. program, the federal government pays about \n     $8,000 a year for each elementary school student and $12,000 \n     for high schoolers. That's less than the $18,000 a year it \n     costs to educate one child in the D.C. Public Schools. Many \n     of the participating private schools do not offer costly \n     services for children with disabilities, who make up about 18 \n     percent of the DCPS school population.\n       The voucher payments are enough to cover tuition at most \n     Catholic schools, which enroll about 52 percent of D.C. \n     voucher students. But they pay only a fraction of costs at \n     elite institutions such as the Sheridan School in Northwest \n     D.C., where charges can reach about $30,000 a year.\n       Tiblez Berhane has a daughter in eighth grade who is \n     attending Sheridan with a voucher and financial aid from the \n     school. ``It's wonderful,'' said Berhane, an immigrant from \n     Eritrea who works in a day-care center. ``We could never \n     afford this.''\n       While Sheridan, Sidwell Friends and the Washington \n     International School each have one voucher student, the \n     Academy for Ideal Education depends almost entirely on the \n     federal program.\n       Founder Paulette Jones-Imaan created the school more than \n     two decades ago, aiming to provide a nurturing environment \n     with small classes and a learning model known as \n     ``Suggestopedia,'' a philosophy of learning developed by \n     Bulgarian psychotherapist Georgi Lozanov that stresses \n     learning through music, stretching and meditation. Jones-\n     Imaan melds that philosophy with an African-flavored approach \n     that includes students addressing teachers as ``Mama'' and \n     ``Baba,'' honorifics meaning mother and father.\n       Jones-Imaan also founded a K-12 public charter school, \n     Ideal Academy, based on the same educational philosophy, in \n     1999. She served on the board for more than a decade.\n       But the charter school ran into trouble. Last year, the \n     D.C. Public Charter School Board threatened to close it \n     because of chronic poor performance. Ideal Academy agreed to \n     shutter its high school, which had a particularly poor \n     record, in order to keep its lower grades open. The \n     preschool-8th grade Ideal Academy was classified as \n     ``inadequate'' this year by the city's charter officials, \n     which means it could be closed if it doesn't improve.\n       Meanwhile, the private Academy for Ideal Education \n     continues on. More than 90 percent of its approximately 60 \n     students are paying the $11,400 tuition with vouchers, Jones-\n     Imaan said. ``If this program were to end, this school would \n     end,'' she said.\n       While some schools have libraries, art studios and athletic \n     fields, the Muhammad University of Islam occupies the second \n     floor of a former residence east of the Anacostia River. The \n     unaccredited K-8 school is supported by the Nation of Islam, \n     according to director Stephanie Muhammad.\n       Parents choose the school because of its small classes, \n     safety and strict discipline, she said.\n       About one-third of the 55 students hold vouchers. Few of \n     the others can afford the $5,335 annual tuition, Muhammad \n     said. They are asked to help defray tuition by raising funds. \n     Last month, they sold pizzas. This month, it's coffee and \n     tea.\n       The classrooms are small, located in what were perhaps once \n     bedrooms. On the walls are posters of Louis Farrakhan, the \n     controversial leader of the Nation of Islam.\n       On a recent visit, the only bathroom in the school had a \n     floor blackened with dirt and a sink coated in grime. The \n     bathtub was filled with paint cans and cleaning supplies \n     concealed by a curtain.\n       Muhammad said in a subsequent interview that the bathroom \n     is used only in emergencies, and students typically use a \n     restroom on the floor below in a day-care center that she had \n     previously described as unrelated to the school.\n       Kevin P. Chavous, a former D.C. Council member and now a \n     senior adviser to American Federation for Children, which \n     lobbies for voucher programs nationwide, said schools \n     receiving public funds should meet quality standards. But \n     supporters of the D.C. program have been focused on \n     overcoming political challenges, he said.\n       ``There should be some accountability measures in all these \n     programs,'' Chavous said. ``Our biggest challenge has been \n     the constant threats to shut this down before we can even \n     measure the schools.''\n       Since Congress created the voucher program in 2004, Boehner \n     and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.) have regularly \n     wrestled with Democrats over its fate. Republicans and \n     Lieberman want to expand the program; Democrats want to phase \n     it out.\n       ``Our goal is to provide a quality education to all \n     children--not just a few--which is why the Obama \n     administration does not believe vouchers are the answer to \n     America's educational challenges,'' said Justin Hamilton, a \n     spokesman for Education Secretary Arne Duncan.\n       Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) and D.C. Mayor Vincent C. \n     Gray (D) also are opposed to the voucher program, saying \n     public dollars should go toward improving public schools \n     where they can help the most students.\n       Still, the program has offered some children a crucial path \n     out of troubled city schools.\n       Ophelia Johnson and her daughters were homeless when she \n     learned about the voucher program. She obtained vouchers for \n     both her daughters and enrolled them at the Calvary Christian \n     Academy, which she credits with providing her children a \n     secure, caring and consistent environment as she pulled her \n     life together.\n       ``It's wonderful,'' Johnson said about the voucher program \n     that allowed her daughters to attend the academy. ``The \n     atmosphere, the education, and it's also a Christian school. \n     They taught my girls.''\n       Now, Johnson is employed, newly remarried and living with \n     her daughters in a condominium on Capitol Hill. Her older \n     daughter, Tabitha, is applying to colleges.\n       ``She'll be the first to go in the family,'' Johnson said, \n     pride in her voice.\n\n  Ms. NORTON. The Federal vouchers give these schools the Federal \nGovernment's seal of approval. Considering that the purpose of the \nvoucher program is to improve student achievement, voucher bills are \ninconsistent with the congressional intent and should not be enabled \nwith Federal funds or get the Federal imprimatur.\n  I appreciate that the majority indicated in committee and also on \nthis floor that they, too, oppose voucher mills and are willing to work \nwith me on this issue. I hope to continue to work with the majority as \nthe bill moves forward in order to eliminate voucher bills, which \nsurely no Member supports.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentlewoman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, this is the same amendment that Delegate \nNorton offered to the bill during markup, but it was rejected by the \nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n  The amendment would cap the enrollment of OSP students, the \nOpportunity Scholarship Program, at 50 percent of the school's \npopulation without affecting current voucher students or siblings. The \namendment would also restore the randomized controlled study \nrequirement.\n  Mr. Chairman, this program is about opportunity and choice. Parents \nshould be able to choose the best schools for their children, and \nprivate schools should have the flexibility to determine whether or not \nto enroll OSP students.\n  I understand the Delegate's concern that students maintain quality \nstandards. In fact, I share it. That is why H.R. 10 requires \nparticipating OSP schools to achieve accreditation no later than 5 \nyears after the passage of the act. This is a more effective way to \nensure the quality than by arbitrarily excluding students from the \nprogram.\n  Mr. Chairman, the accreditation process required by H.R. 10 will \nensure education and administrative quality control. The process will \nhelp weed out poor performers from this program without setting a cap \non OSP student enrollment.\n  As for the return to the control group evaluation, this is \nunnecessary for the OSP. The OSP has been rigorously evaluated using \nthe Gold Standard since 2003, and it has demonstrated positive results. \nThe Gold Standard Evaluation, using a randomized controlled evaluation, \ndeliberately limits participation in the program.\n  Under this evaluation method, some student applicants received \nscholarships while other student applicants were placed in a control \ngroup that did not receive scholarships. Given the OSP's proven success \nunder this standard, it is time to allow as many students to receive \nscholarships as funding permits.\n\n[[Page H7076]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, it is important to note that the bill does not forsake \nevaluation. Instead, the bill requires the OSP students' performance \nbase to be compared to that of students of similar backgrounds of the \nD.C. public schools. The evaluation method means no more students will \nbe barred from a good education through OSP for the sake of the \nexperiment.\n  Mr. Chairman, on average, 2.5 students apply for each scholarship \nthat is ultimately awarded. We should be focused on meeting the demand \nfor access to a good education rather than arbitrarily limiting \nstudents' ability to succeed.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, which would \nunnecessarily exclude children from the educational opportunities they \ndesire and deserve.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Allen). The question is on the amendment \noffered by the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under the rule, \nthe Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nGraves of Louisiana) having assumed the chair, Mr. Allen, Acting Chair \nof the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported \nthat that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 10) \nto reauthorize the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act, and \nfor other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 480, he reported \nthe bill, as amended by that resolution, back to the House with a \nfurther amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  The question is on the amendment.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at \nthe desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I am opposed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Scott of Virginia moves to recommit the bill H.R. 10 to \n     the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform with \n     instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith \n     with the following amendment:\n       Add at the end of section 6 the following new subsection:\n       (f) Requiring Protection of Students and Applicants Under \n     Civil Rights Laws.--Section 3008 (sec. 38-1853.08, D.C. \n     Official Code) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(i) Requiring Protection of Students and Applicants Under \n     Civil Rights Laws.--In addition to meeting the requirements \n     of subsection (a), an eligible entity or a school may not \n     participate in the opportunity scholarship program under this \n     Act unless the eligible entity or school certifies to the \n     Secretary that the eligible entity or school will provide \n     each student who applies for or receives an opportunity \n     scholarship under this Act with all of the applicable \n     protections available under each of the following laws:\n       ``(1) Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \n     2000c et seq.).\n       ``(2) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \n     2000d et seq.).\n       ``(3) Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (20 \n     U.S.C. 1681 et seq.).\n       ``(4) The Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 (20 \n     U.S.C. 1701 et seq.).\n       ``(5) The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (20 \n     U.S.C. 1400 et seq.).\n       ``(6) The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 701 et \n     seq.).\n       ``(7) The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 et \n     seq.).\n       ``(8) The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 \n     U.S.C. 12101 et seq.).''.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous \nconsent to dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I object.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Clerk will continue to read.\n  The Clerk continued to read.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to \nthe bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If \nadopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.\n  I rise to speak in support of the Democratic motion to recommit that \nwould protect the civil rights of students at schools that receive \nvouchers by requiring the schools to certify that they provide each \nstudent with all applicable civil rights protections.\n  The D.C. voucher program calls into question multiple Federal civil \nrights protections and turns a blind eye to the government-funded \ndiscrimination. For example, religious schools that accept vouchers are \npermitted to discriminate on the basis of religion in hiring, a \nviolation of traditional principles prohibiting discrimination based on \nreligion when using Federal money.\n  The fact is that most religious schools are part of a ministry of the \nsponsoring church, and these schools either cannot or will not separate \nthe religious content from their academic programs. So it is impossible \nto prevent a publicly funded voucher program for paying for these \ninstitutions' religious activities and education.\n  Furthermore, schools that accept vouchers are allowed to discriminate \nbased on gender in admissions, a violation of the principles of title \nIX.\n  In addition to the discrimination based on religion or sex, the D.C. \nvoucher program also raises serious concerns about the civil rights of \nstudents with disabilities. IDEA requires that schools that receive \nFederal IDEA funds provide appropriate education to all students with \ndisabilities, but at least one study found that the schools that accept \nD.C. vouchers serve students with disabilities at a much lower rate \nthan public schools.\n  Failing to meet the needs of students with disabilities is just one \nof the shortcomings of the D.C. voucher program, but another issue is \nthe performance of the school. A 2010 Department of Education report \nconcluded that the use of a voucher had no statistically significant \nimpact on overall student achievement in math or reading.\n  Additional studies found that students from schools in need of \nimprovement have shown no improvement in math or reading due to the \nvoucher program. Furthermore, participating in the voucher program had \nno impact on student safety, satisfaction, motivation, or engagement.\n  Mr. Speaker, many of those who actually won a voucher cannot use them \nbecause the voucher does not cover the full cost of attending a private \nor religious school. As a result, many who win a voucher find that they \ncannot use it because they can't afford the remaining cost of the \neducation. So studies have confirmed that fewer than 25 percent of the \nstudents who use the vouchers are from schools that were ``in need of \nimprovement.''\n  The D.C. voucher program fails on all counts. It violates principles \nof traditional civil rights laws, it makes no improvement on student \nachievement, and it fails to reach the very children it was designed to \nhelp.\n  Our public schools need more funding, not less. Rather than funnel \ntaxpayer funding to private or religious schools that lack civil rights \nprotections and fail to meet the goals of helping the right students, \nwe should focus our efforts on initiatives that will result in overall \nimprovement of the educational system for all of our students.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support our children by \nsupporting this motion to recommit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, as I said before, Mr. Scott of Virginia is \none of my favorite people in this body. I have the greatest respect. \nHis perspective is one that I often share.\n  I would just highlight for this body here, because I do urge a ``no'' \nvote on this motion to recommit, that we had a field hearing in May. We \nhave had good debate. We had a good markup.\n\n[[Page H7077]]\n\nWe had always projected to move this bill in the fall. I think it is \ntime to bring up this bill. So we have never had this issue ever \nbrought to my attention as chairman of the committee.\n  I would also highlight that section 3008, Nondiscrimination and Other \nRequirements for Participating Schools--I will read just point A.\n  ``In General.--An eligible entity or school participating in any \nprogram under this division shall not discriminate against program \nparticipants or applicants on the basis of race, color, national \norigin, religion, or sex.''\n  I do look forward to working with the gentleman and anybody else on \nthese issues moving forward, but I would urge a ``no'' vote on the \nmotion to recommit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and \nnays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on S. 1362 currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support for S. 1362, the PACE \nInnovation Act of 2015.\n  The companion bill in the House, H.R. 3243, was introduced by my \nlongtime colleague and a real champion for the elderly and the frail, \nChris Smith of New Jersey.\n  This legislation is a commonsense, bipartisan approach to increasing \nflexibility in our healthcare system.\n  PACE, or the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, is an \nintegrated care program that provides hands-on, long-term care and \nsupport to beneficiaries who need an institutional level of care but \ncontinue to live at home. Many of these beneficiaries are dual \neligible, or eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Hardworking Americans who care for these beneficiaries and want to \nkeep their loved ones at home have relied on this program for well over \na decade, as the program has now expanded to 32 States.\n  There are two programs currently operating back in Texas, and I am \nlooking forward to monitoring the program's continued success back \nhome.\n  However, currently, the PACE model is limited to seniors who meet a \nspecific list of criteria, Federal and State, for needing a nursing \nhome level of care. The PACE Innovation Act would allow Medicare to \ntest the PACE benefit on other vulnerable populations.\n  With the popularity and success of the PACE program, it is clear \nthat, to live up to its full potential nationally, other populations \nshould be targeted to benefit from comprehensive PACE models.\n  These beneficiaries are some of our Nation's most vulnerable, who, \nalong with their families, have chosen not to enter into full-time \nnursing home care at a facility.\n  Studies have shown that people receiving care from PACE organizations \nhave better outcomes and less hospitalizations and, more importantly, \nhave more time to spend with their families in their own homes--and \nthat is key.\n  The PACE Innovation Act is revenue-neutral and widely supported.\n  I would like to thank fellow Ways and Means Committee members Charles \nBoustany, Mike Kelly, Lynn Jenkins, Earl Blumenauer, Bill Pascrell, \nBill McDermott, and Richard Neal for their strong support of this \neffort and encourage that the whole House vote to pass S. 1362 under \nsuspension of the rules and send it to the President's desk.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments from my friend from Texas. Mr. \nSpeaker, there is occasionally a little bit of controversy around the \nHouse, a modest amount of disagreement, and, of course, that is just in \nthe Republican conference. There are lots of things that get the \nspotlight.\n  But I appreciate the leadership of my friend with our Health \nSubcommittee on Ways and Means for there are things below the radar \nscreen where we have been working in a thoughtful and bipartisan way to \ntry and see if we can thread the needle on a number of these things \nthat don't have to cost a lot of money, and they enable us to be able \nto refine healthcare opportunities.\n  One of the biggest accomplishments of the session was getting the SGR \nmonkey off our back to deal with the sustainable growth rate in a \nbipartisan fashion, and there have been, I want to say, about 12 bills \nthat have moved out of our Health Subcommittee that deal with \ninitiatives going forward.\n  What my friend from Texas said about the PACE Act is absolutely true. \nThis is an opportunity for us to take a proven set of techniques to \nhelp seniors who want to stay at home, who do not want to be in nursing \nfacilities, being able to give them the flexible needs in terms of \nservices, and it works.\n  I represent a program in Portland, Oregon, Providence ElderPlace. It \nserves over 1,000 Oregonians. It has got a solid track record. It has \ncosts that are lower than average if they were Medicaid beneficiaries. \nIn some States, these savings can be nearly 30 percent.\n\n[[Page H7080]]\n\n  There are opportunities here to be able to give better ongoing \nservice. The hospital readmission rate, for example, the program I \nmentioned in Oregon, is far under the national average of 15.2 percent. \nIt is about half that rate.\n  This simply extends this opportunity to a broader range of \nbeneficiaries, people who have complex health conditions, but who are \nyounger, for instance. They are no less deserving of this opportunity. \nI am absolutely convinced that the results will be every bit as strong.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate having this bill move forward, and I \nappreciate the advocacy of my friend, Mr. Smith from New Jersey. We \nseem to find a variety of things to work on together in this Congress, \nand there is nothing that I think is more important and is going to \nhave more long-term impact for people who are quite vulnerable. It is \ngoing to save the Federal Government money while it provides better \noutcomes for patients and for their families.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time urging \nstrong support from my colleagues.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am really proud to yield 4 minutes \nto the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), a real champion for the \nelderly and the fragile who has really been a leader for so many years \non this key issue.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank \nKevin Brady, the chairman, for his extraordinary leadership on this and \nso many other issues, and Mr. Blumenauer, with whom we have worked \ntogether to build a strong bipartisan push for this piece of \nlegislation.\n  I do rise in strong support for passage of S. 1362, the PACE \nInnovation Act. Identical to the companion bill that I introduced along \nwith Mr. Blumenauer, this bill will provide PACE programs with \nflexibility to bring a proven model of care to new populations. The \nprogram for all-inclusive care for the elderly, or PACE, is a widely \npopular program serving over 30,000 seniors around the country.\n  For those unfamiliar with PACE, the program delivers the entire range \nof medical and long-term services, including medical care and \nprescription drug services, physical or occupational therapy, day or \nrespite care, and medical specialties such as dentistry, optometry, and \npodiatry.\n  Currently, eligibility for PACE is limited to those aged 55 and over \nwho meet State-specified criteria for needing nursing home-level care. \nThis program will provide wellness and keeps people in their homes. It \nis already doing it. Now more people will benefit from it. It improves \noutcomes. And this is all for people who otherwise would be paying \ncatastrophic costs for nursing home care.\n  Mr. Speaker, PACE has seen a significant growth in recent years, \nincluding a 30 percent increase in the number of people receiving \nservices over the last 3 years alone.\n  PACE has a proven track record in my own State of New Jersey where \nprograms currently serve roughly 900 seniors throughout the State.\n  Just last week, Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to attend the \ngrand opening and ribbon cutting of a new PACE program in Monmouth \nCounty, and it is New Jersey's fifth program.\n  When I first heard about PACE, I worked hard to bring this valuable \nprogram to my State back in 2009. Even though it was around before \nthat, it was one of the best kept secrets around.\n  They then formed the first PACE program called LIFE, Living \nIndependently for Elderly, at St. Francis Medical Center in the Trenton \nand Hamilton area. I have visited St. Francis LIFE often since and on \nits fifth anniversary was overwhelmed by the appreciation of seniors \nand their families for the program's ability to raise or maintain their \nquality of life.\n  The limits, however, and operational restrictions placed on PACE do \nnot allow these programs to serve many others in need. Chronological \nage should not be the determinant.\n  If somebody is disabled and could use and should use a nursing home \nand is eligible, this gives another option to the family to keep them \nat home. The legislation will allow CMS to establish pilot programs and \nwaive restrictions and test how to best deliver results for new \npopulations.\n  As Tim Clontz, the chairman of the National PACE Association's Public \nPolicy Committee, testified before the Health Subcommittee on the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee, he told stories about a man named Jim \nG., a 54-year-old man with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.\n  He was hospitalized for a lung infection and, as a result, stayed \nhome alone during the day, where he was isolated and struggled with \nactivities of daily living, such as personal grooming, household \nchores, and child care.\n  His wife quit her job to care for him full time, but his needs were \nmore than she could handle. He was permanently placed in a memory care \nunit, and since PACE was not an option for Jim--remember, he is 54 \nyears old--his wife is crowd-sourcing to try to pay his medical care. \nThis heartbreaking story could have been eliminated.\n  I also chair the Alzheimer's Caucus, Mr. Speaker, here in the House, \nand I can tell you there are many patients with early onset who could \nbenefit and benefit in a very, very significant way with this change in \nlaw.\n  I look forward to the President's signature. Again, I want to thank \nyou, Kevin, for your leadership and your very distinguished staff.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume to close just by saying, again, I express my appreciation to \nthe chairman and to Mr. Smith for moving this forward.\n  We find that the evaluations of the PACE program have proven that \nparticipants experience better health outcomes, fewer unmet needs, less \npain, less likelihood of depression, and fewer hospitalizations and \nnursing home admissions.\n  There are people out there now, if we make this change, that are \nready to extend this higher quality of care for very deserving, needy, \nand vulnerable people who are younger than the threshold 55 years of \nage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge we vote tonight, enact it into law, and let these \npeople get to work serving these people in a new and profoundly \nimproved way.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume to close.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank again these champions, Mr. Smith and Mr. \nBlumenauer, for coming together on a very important program that makes \nso much sense.\n  This is our mom or our dad, our loved one who wants to get care, but \ndoesn't want to be in that nursing home. It is good for them, it is \ngreat for the family, and it is good for the taxpayers.\n  It just makes common sense. Having this strong, bipartisan support \nfor this bill I think is every reason for it to pass through this \nHouse, to be signed by the President, and be expanded all across \nAmerica.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support for the PACE Innovation \nAct and urge its passage. With that, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Costello). The question is on the motion \noffered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) that the House suspend \nthe rules and pass the bill, S. 1362.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7080-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7080-H7081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE SITUATION IN \n OR IN RELATION TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO--MESSAGE FROM \n        THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H.

Yet, tomorrow, they are set to spend 8 hours \ngrilling one woman.\n  Nothing about the tragedy in Benghazi has been revealed by this \ncommittee, and nothing will be revealed tomorrow.

Mr. Speaker, there are just 9 more legislative days \nto act fully to protect the full faith and credit of the United States \nbefore November 3 in order to prevent the risk of a first ever U.S. \ndefault.\n  We know that a default is not what the American people want. It could \nshatter retirement savings and send interest rates for mortgages, \nstudent loans, credit cards, and car payments soaring. We know that \neven a threat of default has serious consequences.\n  We have experienced a downgrading in our credit before because our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle--Republicans--took us to the \ncatastrophic brink. And then, of course, we realized that what we did \ntoday, Pay China First Act, does not help the American people.\n  If we continue on this pathway, we will impact 1.4 million Active-\nDuty troops by not paying our debt, 4.1 million disabled veterans who \nserved their country with honor by not paying our debt, 2.3 million \nveterans who receive home purchasing assistance by not paying our debt, \nAmerican small businesses that sell goods and services to the \ngovernment and most doctors and hospitals that treat the 53.8 million \nMedicare patients around the country by not paying our debt.\n  We cannot hold the United States hostage or our credit hostage. It is \ntime to address in a fair and reasonable manner the debt of the United \nStates, which is the people of the United States. Get rid of sequester, \nfollow our responsibilities, and pay our bills so that we can help \nthose veterans who need help.\n  Mr. Speaker, once again House Republicans are putting the narrow \npartisan interests of their right-wing base ahead of addressing the \nreal challenges and problems facing the American people.\n  Congress has only 10 legislative days to act to fully protect the \nfull faith and credit of the United States before November 3, in order \nto prevent the risk of a first-ever U.S. default.\n  A default would shatter retirement savings and send interest rates \nfor mortgages, student loans, credit cards and car payments soaring.\n  We know that even the threat of default has serious consequences: \nplummeting consumer confidence, and drastic slowdowns in job creation \nand economic growth.\n  Instead of taking the threat of catastrophic default off the table, \nthis week, Republicans are bringing forward a bill that would give \npriority to bondholders from China and other foreign nations would be \npaid first.\n  This bill, more accurately described as the ``Pay China First Act,'' \nputs payments to Americans at risk, including those to: 1. 1.4 million \nactive duty troops; 2. 4.1 million disabled veterans who served their \ncountry with honor; 3. 2.3 million veterans who receive home purchasing \nassistance; 4. American small businesses that sell goods and services \nto the government; 5. Doctors and hospitals that treat the 53.8 million \nMedicare patients around the country.\n  The credit rating of the United States is not a hostage to serve \nRepublicans' toxic special interest ideology.\n  Republicans should bring forward a clean bill to honor the full faith \nand credit of the United States immediately.\n  Mr. Speaker, House Republicans have wasted enormous amount of time on \nirresponsible, futile, and reckless diversions such as trying to repeal \nthe Affordable Care Act, defund Planned Parenthood, and use the \nBenghazi Select Committee as an adjunct of the Republican National \nCommittee to engage in partisan attacks on the leading candidate for \nthe 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.\n  Because so much time has been wasted on these frivolous issues, we \nnow have the following critical deadlines staring us in the face:\n  1. October 29: Highway & Transit Trust Fund expires, endangering good \npaying jobs and critical construction projects throughout America;\n  2. November 3: Deadline to raise debt ceiling to protect full faith \nand credit of the United States.\n  3. December 11: Deadline to pass a funding bill that keeps the \ngovernment open.\n  Americans are already paying a heavy price for House Republicans' \nlegislative mismanagement.\n  Earlier this summer, Republicans shut down the Export-Import Bank for \nthe first time in its 81-year history.\n\n[[Page H7082]]\n\n  The Bank provides critical financing assistance--at no cost to \ntaxpayers--to small, medium, and large-sized U.S. businesses that helps \nthem create jobs here at home and sell their products overseas.\n  Just two months after the Bank shut down, companies across the \ncountry are already feeling negative impacts on their ability to \ncompete in the global marketplace.\n  House Republicans also let the Land and Water Conservation Fund \n(LWCF) expire on September 30.\n  Created in 1965, it is one of the nation's most successful \nconservation programs.\n  The LWCF uses a small percentage of revenue from offshore oil and gas \ndrilling to invest in public lands and local recreation projects, and \nhelps to support more than 6 million U.S. jobs connected with outdoor \nrecreation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I renew my call that all Members of the House and Senate \nwork together and address the real problems and challenges facing the \nAmerican people and to work with the President to reach agreement on an \nappropriate budget framework that ends sequestration but does not harm \nour economy or require draconian cuts to middle-class priorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7082-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7082-H7087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING THE LIFE OF DON EDWARDS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the California \nDemocratic congressional delegation to honor the life of Don Edwards, \nwho passed away earlier this month at the age of 100 in his home in \nCarmel.\n  Congressman Don Edwards was someone I was proud to know for many \nyears. He was born in San Jose, California, in 1915, growing up on \nSouth 13th Street. Living in San Jose at an idyllic time, he took the \ntrolley to play golf as a young man, attended public schools in San \nJose, received his bachelor's degree from Stanford University, where he \nlater studied law, and was admitted to the Bar Association of \nCalifornia in 1940.\n  He became an FBI agent during the Depression. He used to talk about \nhis service as an FBI agent, which he jokingly referred to as ``long \nhours looking for auto thieves in Indianapolis.'' But, in fact, he \nserved with great distinction in the FBI, and he went on to serve in \nthe United States Navy as an intelligence officer and a gunnery officer \nin World War II.\n  He was first elected to represent what was then California's Ninth \nCongressional District in 1962, and he served for 32 years, until \nJanuary 3, 1995.\n  I remember the first time I saw Congressman Don Edwards. It was \nbefore he was a Congressman. He was giving a speech in Mitchell Park in \nPalo Alto, California. I was just out of elementary school, and I \nremember how impressed I was and inspired I was by his words. He, in \nturn, had been inspired by President Kennedy to run for Congress, and \nhe was successfully elected that year.\n  Over the years, he represented such communities as San Jose, Gilroy, \nMorgan Hill, parts of Milpitas, Fremont, and Union City. He served on \nthe Judiciary Committee and served as chairman of the House \nSubcommittee on Civil Liberties and Civil Rights for 23 years. He also \nsat on the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  Now, Congressman Don Edwards was one of the foremost defenders of \ncivil liberties in Congress. In the 1970s, along with Senator Frank \nChurch and his committee, they exposed the pervasive abuses of civil \nliberties in J. Edgar Hoover's COINTELPRO, which monitored, \ninfiltrated, and disrupted entirely lawful civil rights and antiwar \norganizations; and his stature as a former FBI agent really allowed him \nto be effective in this role.\n  In his first year in the House, he voted to abolish the House Un-\nAmerican Activities Committee, and he was involved every year. In fact, \nI helped him in the early seventies in trying to abolish HUAC. He \nfinally succeeded in 1975. He was involved in the passage of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He was a \ndignified and important member of the House Judiciary Committee during \nthe consideration of the impeachment of Richard Nixon. And he was known \nthroughout the country as somebody who stood up for the Constitution.\n  Earlier today, former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman came on the \nfloor, and we were talking about former Members' right to be present on \nthe floor, but they do not have the right to address the Congress as a \nformer Member. She wanted everyone to know that she was so proud that \nshe was able to serve with Congressman Edwards on the Judiciary \nCommittee, and she is not alone where people were able to serve with \nhim.\n  His contributions will live on for many generations, as demonstrated \nby the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildfire Refuge, which \nwas the first urban wildfire refuge in the United States. I remember he \nused to call the chairman of the committee in the seventies every \nsingle morning, saying, ``Where is my wildfire refuge?'' because such \nendangered species as the California Clapper Rail and the salt marsh \nharvest mouse were on the verge of extinction, and now they are not \nbecause of his work.\n  As I said, he was a stalwart defender of the Constitution, a tireless \nadvocate for the rights of women, and was known as the ``Father of the \nEqual Rights Amendment,'' which he introduced every year.\n  Congressman Edwards was also known as a champion of civil rights. \nAfter becoming chairman of the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional \nRights, then known as Subcommittee Number 4, he managed the Equal \nRights Amendment on the House floor in 1971, the extension of the \nVoting Rights Act in 1982, and all other civil rights bills of the era.\n  Now, outside of Congress, he took part in civil rights marches in the \nSouth. His son Len was a Freedom Rider, and he joined Len Edwards \nduring the Mississippi Summer. He visited Dr. Martin Luther King when \nDr. King was imprisoned in the Birmingham, Alabama, jail. And Don \nEdwards spoke out against apartheid while visiting South Africa.\n  Congressman Don Edwards had a long, fulfilling life, and part of that \nfulfillment was his marriage to Edie Wilkie Edwards until her death in \nApril of 2011. She and he were very involved in a group that no longer \nis active in the House called Members of Congress for Peace Through Law \nbecause they were people who believed that we could have a peaceful \nworld, and the route to peace was the rule of law.\n  Congressman Edwards is survived by four sons, Len Edwards, Samuel, \nBruce, and Thomas, as well as four grandchildren and five great-\ngrandchildren. He died peacefully and with a great deal of grace. \nAccording to his son Len Edwards: ``He died as he lived, an elegant \nman.''\n  He leaves a legacy of supporting civil rights, advocating for those \nless fortunate in our society, and as being a strong defender of our \nConstitution. In fact, in his district, they used to call him not the \nCongressman from the Tenth Congressional District, but the Congressman \nfrom the Constitution.\n\n  I am fortunate that when I graduated from college in 1970 and I came \nto Washington without a job, I walked into his office and he hired me. \nI worked for him for nearly 9 years, both here in Washington and in his \ndistrict in San Jose. He helped me enormously by giving me time off to \ntake exams while I was taking my law school classes. He helped me and \nmentored me, and I feel a great debt of gratitude to him personally for \nall he did to help me, but mainly to inspire me and a whole generation \nof Americans to believe in their country and to believe in their \nConstitution and to believe in the rule of law and civil rights.\n  With that, I yield to the gentleman from California, (Mr. Farr), my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Lofgren for yielding, the chair of \nour wonderful California delegation, the largest Democratic delegation \nin Congress.\n  When I arrived in Congress in a special election in 1993, Don Edwards \nwas\n\n[[Page H7083]]\n\nthe dean, the chair of the Democratic delegation, the same delegation \nthat his former employee, Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, now holds. He was \nthe father figure for all of us from California, and I think of this \nentire Congress when you look at his remarkable record.\n  It is ironic that Don Edwards grew up in a Republican family in the \nStanford area in Santa Clara Valley, attended Stanford University, was \ncaptain of the golf team, did very well in golf, and so much so that \nthe district that I represent every year hosts what was formerly known \nas the Bing Crosby Clambake, now the AT Pro-Am Golf Tournament. And \nDon Edwards told me that he carried his pro, he got a better score than \nhis pro, and they won the tournament the first Clambake at Pebble \nBeach.\n  He soon became president of the Young Republicans. He quickly \nthereafter left the Young Republicans and became a very, very liberal \nDemocrat. I asked him once as he retired, as Congresswoman Lofgren \nsaid, to Carmel, California--he retired to a home right next to the \nhome that I grew up in and my sister still lives in, so we had many, \nmany nights with him and Edie discussing politics, and I once asked \nhim: What made you become a Democrat? He said: Well, you know, Sam, \nafter I got out of Stanford, I was in the FBI right after law school, \nand after I knew what the government could do to you through the FBI, I \ndecided that I better be on the other side to protect the rights of \nindividuals.\n  He then became a Navy intelligence officer. One of the things that \nhappened when he left the FBI--he was no fan of the head of the FBI, J. \nEdgar Hoover--he asked Congress to audit the FBI. Well, the FBI had \nnever been audited. All of the seizure of the equipment and goods and \nthings that they had taken in the arrest were used to support them \ninternally, and people thought that there might be some foul play \nthere. Because he asked for that audit, he was on their blacklist. A \nformer FBI agent knew a little bit too much about what was going on \ninside the FBI and with J. Edgar Hoover.\n  As a Member of Congress--it is really interesting. He got elected \nwhen John F. Kennedy was President, and he left Congress when Bill \nClinton was President, so all of those President's between Kennedy and \nClinton, Don Edwards had served with. If anybody, he was probably the \nmost dapper, best dressed, politest, nicest human being on this floor.\n  He had great friends on the Republican side of the aisle, even though \nhe was such a liberal Member of the Democratic Party. One of his \nfriends was Hamilton Fish from New York. They worked together on many \nof these remarkable acts: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the rogue \nVoting Rights Act of 1965. He became chair of the Subcommittee on Civil \nand Constitutional Rights, and he managed the equal rights amendment on \nthe House floor. He was a constitutional civil rights-human rights \nexpert and passionate about his feelings of the law to protect people.\n  When Don and Edie retired to Carmel, California, they brought with \nthem a lot of their friends from Washington, and in his home State of \nCalifornia, we used to have wonderful dinner parties together. He was \nstill a member of Cypress Point Golf Club, a very exclusive golf club. \nIn fact, he was the longest surviving member of that club.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Unfortunately, Edie predeceased him--his wonderful wife for many \nyears, whom we all loved--and we were saddened about her development of \nlung cancer, and she died.\n  Don wanted to have a memorial service for her at a local church and \nthen the reception at the Cypress Point Country Club, one of the most \nconservative golf clubs in the United States. Don was very proud after \nthe church service to have invited everybody, and he proudly stated \nthat this was the largest collection of Democrats that had ever been at \nthe Cypress Point Country Club.\n  He had a great sense of humor, lots of friends. He was a remarkable \nhuman being who was able to work across the aisle, something we miss \ntoday. With that, he was able to accomplish some of the greatest laws \nof this country in the modern era.\n  He was a good friend of Republicans and Democrats, but, most of all, \nhe was the friend of the animals and of the people who could not speak \nfor themselves. We will sorely miss this great man, who served this \ngreat institution for a long, long time.\n  My wife sends all her best. She was at his bedside when he died, and \nshe was part of his caretaking team. We will have services for him in \nCarmel this Sunday, and there will be services in the San Jose area and \nfuture services here in Washington.\n  So I just stand tonight to give you my thoughts on my relationship \nwith a great man, Don Edwards, who championed civil rights and died at \nthe age of 100.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Thank you, Sam Farr.\n  I now yield to the gentlewoman from San Francisco, California (Ms. \nPelosi).\n  Ms. PELOSI. Thank you very much, Congressman Zoe Lofgren, the chair \nof the House Democrats of California, for calling us together in a \nSpecial Order to honor a truly great man.\n  I want to associate myself with the remarks that have gone before and \nto say to Sam Farr: Thank you to you and to Shary for the love and \naffection and care that you gave not only to Don Edwards, but to Edie \nWilkie, for such a long time. We all talked about how much we loved \nthem. You were there for them all the time, and we are completely, \nentirely, in your debt. Thank you for the love that you gave them.\n  Thank you again, Zoe Lofgren and the entire California delegation, \nfor orchestrating this Special Order hour.\n  Tonight, Mr. Speaker, we honor an august statesman who labored with \ndignity, led with integrity, and lived with courage, William Donlon--\notherwise known as ``Don Edwards''--who passed away last month at the \nage of 100.\n  His life was a gift to the Nation.\n  He protected our communities through his service as an FBI agent. He \nprotected our country through his service in the U.S. Navy during World \nWar II. He moved our country forward through his service as a U.S. \nCongressman.\n  Service. Leadership. Patriotism. Don Edwards.\n  Don reminded us that how we live our values matters; so he fought for \nfair pay, becoming the ``Father of the Equal Rights Amendment.'' He \nstood with the Freedom Riders at a time when they were written off as \ntroublemakers and agitators. He championed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \nand fought to protect freedom of speech. He spoke up for workers, for \nour environment, for the resources needed to improve our country, and \nfor future generations.\n  As chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and \nConstitutional Rights for more than 20 years, Don became the \n``conscience of the Congress'' and strived to ensure that all Americans \nenjoyed equality of opportunity.\n  He took great pride in the fact that he was the floor leader for the \nEqual Rights Amendment, that he managed that bill. During his 32 years \nin the House, Congressman Edwards helped change the course of history. \nSo significant was his leadership.\n  Oddly enough, Don won his first election to any office in 1950 when \nhe was elected president of the California Young Republicans. \nThroughout his life, Don's ability to respect all viewpoints made him a \nremarkable leader who was respected by Members on both sides of the \naisle. When he was 88 years old, Don reminded us that the world works \nbetter when we get along, and that is what we owe everybody.\n  In California, we hold a special place of honor for Congressman \nEdwards, the long-time dean of the California Democratic delegation. \nThe beautiful, pristine Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife \nRefuge serves as a tribute to his efforts to preserve our environment \nand our ideals for future generations.\n  In fact, he, as a modern-day man and as a Member of Congress, with \nhis love of nature and all living things, was probably as close to a \nmodel of St. Francis of Assisi as we have ever seen--Don Edwards, a \ngentle, beautiful man.\n  Don Edwards never stopped serving our country, and his achievements \nwill stand forever as a living monument to his determined vision and \nlegendary ability. But it wasn't just about that. It is how he \nencouraged others.\n  I can tell you, when I came to Congress 28 years ago, there were only \n23\n\n[[Page H7084]]\n\nwomen in the House out of 435--12 Democrats, 11 Republicans. To say \nthat we weren't always paid full attention to sounds almost like \ncomplaining, but it was a fact. Nobody ever asked, ``What do you \nthink?'' to any of the women Members. I mean, we made our voices heard, \nof course, but nobody ever asked, ``What do you think?'' except Don \nEdwards.\n  Don Edwards would ask, ``What do you think of this?'' to each of us, \nespecially when he was dealing with issues that related directly to us. \nBut even well beyond that, whether we were talking about national \nsecurity, economic growth--whatever the subject--Don would always ask \nus, ``What do you think?''\n  I can remember hearing him ask, ``Nancy, what do you think?''\n  And I said, ``Don, do you know how unusual that is, to hear you say \nthat?''\n  And he would ask, ``Why do you say that?''\n  And I said, ``Because not many people around here, of the four \nhundred and something versus the 23, come up and ask the few women who \nare here what we think.''\n  But he was always about encouraging people to reach their fulfillment \nand to see what their contribution could do for the common good.\n  Sadly, we lost Edie Wilkie a few years ago. As Sam Farr mentioned, \nshe predeceased Don by a number of years. He worshiped Edie, and they \nwere a real team for equality, for peace, for disarmament, for \nprotecting the environment, for promoting opportunity and fairness. \nThey were such a team.\n  So I hope it is a comfort now to his children and to his \ngrandchildren--to all he loved--that so many people throughout the \nworld and, certainly, in our country mourn the loss of a consummate \npublic servant, a proud Californian, and a proud American.\n  May his legacy long endure in this House, and may it challenge all of \nus to do more and to do better on behalf of America's working families.\n  Thank you again, Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, for bringing us together.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Thank you, Madam Leader.\n  It is wonderful for those who served with Don Edwards, for those who \nknew him by reputation, and for those who worked for him to--\n  Ms. PELOSI. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. LOFGREN. I yield to the gentlewoman.\n  Ms. PELOSI. I would like to say how proud he was and thrilled he was \nthat Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren was going to succeed him in the \nCongress. He made that well known to all of us. So his service \ncontinues his leadership in your excellent service and leadership in \nthe Congress.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Thank you, Madam Leader.\n  Now I turn to my colleague from California who was able to serve with \nCongressman Edwards for the first 2 years of her service here in the \nCongress, Congresswoman Anna Eshoo.\n  Ms. ESHOO. I thank the gentlewoman from California, the chair of the \nCalifornia Democratic delegation, and my dear friend and colleague.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is really, I think, bittersweet this evening because \nwe loved Congressman Don Edwards so much, and it is hard to imagine the \nworld without him.\n  He was the kind of human being that you wanted to have live forever. \nInstead, his contributions to our Nation, to the State of California, \nto his community are a record that will be revered for generations and \ngenerations and generations to come.\n  There is a lot that has already been said about Don, beautiful things \nthat have been said about Don, how he graduated from Stanford \nUniversity and Stanford Law School, how he began his professional \ncareer as an FBI agent, and how he joined the Navy as an intelligence \nofficer.\n  So he served our country in many different roles, and, of course, the \ncrown of his public service career was right here in the House of the \npeople, the House of Representatives. He was a small-business man in a \nbusiness that his father owned and that he became a part of during the \n1950s, and then, of course, he was elected as a Democrat.\n  In fact, I still have in my office an invitation that Don had sent \nout. I think it must have been for some fundraiser that he had had, but \nthe cover of that invitation has Don Edwards standing next to a very \nyoung President of the United States, John F. Kennedy.\n  Young children and those who helped elect John F. Kennedy and anyone \nelse who comes through my office very often remark about the picture. \nIt is something that I cherish, that my staff cherishes, and my \nconstituents do.\n  It has been said that he was elected to be the president of the \nCalifornia Young Republicans. That is a very prestigious organization, \nand I can just see Don, elegant in every way.\n  He dressed magnificently. He had the most beautiful posture. The way \nhe carried himself, he almost kind of glided down the hall.\n  But he had a deep sense of humility about him. We talk about his \ngreatness and his goodness, and he was never one to want to be served. \nHis joy was in serving. And so he had more than a healthy dose of \nhumility about him.\n  Don Edwards had an eloquence about him that ran as deep as his \nbeliefs. In my lifetime, he had two great love affairs. One was Edie, \nand the other was the Constitution. He loved the flag.\n  He understood that that was a symbol of our country, but he knew that \nthe Constitution, our Constitution, was the soul of our Nation, and \nthat is where he embedded himself--in the Constitution and in the \nsubcommittee that did its work to always reinforce and establish the \nconstitutionality and make the Constitution live for people who it had \nnot touched yet.\n  If there is anything that would be noble, I think that that is, and \nthe record that he built was one where he was the foremost champion of \ncivil rights, having drafted every civil rights bill in the House of \nRepresentatives for two decades. What a record. What a magnificent \nrecord.\n  He loved his community. I remember when he announced that he was \nretiring. He thanked his constituents for the patience that they had \nextended to him because, I think, many times in the debate about what \nis constitutional and how to extend rights to people, it is not always \nvery popular in the beginning.\n  We love our history once it has been made, but we struggle very hard \nand don't always recognize the opportunity at hand in that history is \nbeing made. In his gentle, elegant way, he thanked his constituents for \nthe patience that they had had with him in that they had stayed with \nhim so that he could do the work that he did on their behalf.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  He famously said, in the 1982 extension of the Voting Rights Act: \n``If you can't vote, you are not a real citizen.'' So he understood \nwhere the nub of the dignity of citizenship rested: voting. I don't \nthink he could really comprehend why the Voting Rights Act is not being \nbrought up today so that we can all vote on it and improve what is so \nessential in the life of the citizens of our country.\n  I think, Mr. Speaker, that Congressman Edwards would be very proud of \nhis colleagues in the California Democratic delegation today, starting \nwith our chair, Zoe Lofgren, who not only worked side by side with him, \nbut now chairs our delegation.\n  The values that he carried, the values that he loved and that he made \nso real and shared with everyone in the House, whether colleagues \nagreed or disagreed with him, they drew a great sense of joy from him \nbecause they knew the love of our Constitution and of our country that \nhe carried, and so they respected him. What he carried and did here, I \nthink he would be very proud of his fellow Californians for carrying \nthose traditions on.\n  I want to pay tribute especially to Shary Farr, Congressman Sam \nFarr's wife. As I said to Shary, because she was there when Don took \nhis last breath, I feel that we were all there with him because she \nwas. She did so much in seeing to the great care that was given to him \nuntil he took his last breath.\n  There is a poet that wrote: And so he passed on, and all the trumpets \nsounded on the other side.\n  God bless you, Don Edwards, for what you gave and created for our \ncountry. We bless your name, and we thank you for your service. It is \nan honor to honor you. We love the Edwards family, and we always will.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Thank you, Congresswoman Eshoo.\n\n[[Page H7085]]\n\n  You know, it is a small community that we have in Santa Clara County, \neven though we have millions of people who live in the region.\n  After Don Edwards was elected, there was a young mayor called Norm \nMineta who wanted to run for Congress. We went to the max trying to \nhelp Norm Mineta trying be elected to Congress, and he ultimately was.\n  Later, Norm Mineta helped a young fellow to the max get elected, and \nwe were so proud that that young legislator was also successful in \nbeing elected to Congress, actually in the seat that overlapped that \nwas formerly Norm Mineta's seat.\n  I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Honda), my colleague in \nSanta Clara County and also southern Alameda County.\n  Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren. I just \nwant to thank her for putting this event together this evening.\n  Tonight, we heard many words described by folks who have known Don \nEdwards personally in work and part of his life. We are here tonight to \nhonor my friend Congressman Don Edwards.\n  Also, a native San Jose, Don was really a true statesman, the likes \nof which you don't find often these days. Today, we work to further the \nmodern progressive agenda that he believed in. Our work would not be \npossible without standing on the shoulders of giants such as Don \nEdwards who came before us. Don was one of those people that I stood \nupon his shoulders.\n  When I first ran for Congress, I went to him and I asked for his \nadvice, because I never had the opportunity to work him. I did work \nwith his sons, and one especially, Len Edwards, who was a judge.\n  As a school person, I could see the kind of impact that Don has had \non his son, Len Edwards, who was a judge. Len was the kind of guy that \nextended himself, also, as did his dad. He used to run truancy court in \nthe school site that I was a principal of, which is really unique. And \nthis is the kind of legacy that Don Edwards has left behind, a \nuniqueness of the kind of person that he was.\n  Don was never afraid to take a stand if he knew it to be right. At \nevery turn, he stood up for what he believed in.\n  When I ran for Congress, I asked him for his advice, and he just very \ncomfortably looked at me and said: Just do the right thing.\n  I think that, here in Congress, we often are challenged to do the \nright thing and not the political thing. Sometimes to do the right \nthing means to stand in the face of popular winds, knowing that you are \ndoing the right thing in spite of the fact that other folks, other \ndynamics are trying to move the ship in another direction.\n  He was the kind of person that was really a stalwart, a true champion \nof civil and constitutional rights in his nearly three decades in \nCongress. In 1963, in his first year in Congress, he voted to abolish \nthe House Committee on Un-American Activities. He went on to be the \nchampion of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of \n1965. And as early as 1972, he was effectively working to protect our \nenvironment, authoring a bill to establish the National Wildlife Refuge \nin San Francisco Bay.\n  Although he was a self-described liberal Democrat, Congressman \nEdwards consistently worked across the aisle, including the passage of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990 and the Civil Rights Act of \n1991, which bolstered employees' rights.\n  Because of his fearlessness, today we are able to work for more \nprogressive change. Because of his leadership and his modeling, I have \nbeen able to use him as my compass in making the right decisions and \nunderstanding, to do the right thing. We have to stand up to fear-\nmongering and seek to ensure that all people are free of fear from \nbullying, persecution, racism, and sexism. We talk today about equality \nfor women and the need for equal pay for equal work.\n  As an educator myself and a principal for over 30 years, I am really \ngrateful for the legacy that Don left in the field of education. \nHimself a product of California public schools, he started the \nconversation that I now proudly bring my voice to, and that is the need \nto preserve the civil and constitutional rights for all people.\n  I know that he agreed that education is also a civil right, and we \nmust find a path to a quality education that is equitable for each and \nevery child.\n  I thank my friend and colleague, Congresswoman Lofgren, for hosting \nthis Special Order. It has been said that her experiences and her life \nexperiences are entwined with Congressman Don Edwards. She knew Don \nbetter than most of us. Not only was she one of his staffers, but she \nwent on to hold his seat in Congress, as it was said before.\n  I think that Don would look upon her work and her leadership and her \nstalwartness and say she is doing the right thing, she is doing it the \nright way, and she is a person of conscience. I think that would make \nhim very proud.\n  Not long ago, I was incredibly honored to have someone tell me that I \ncome from a place of fairness and equality. That is our area. That is \nthe area that all of us represent: Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, Zoe \nLofgren, Leader Pelosi, myself, and others.\n  Congresswoman Lofgren has said once that Congressman Edwards had a \ntremendous sense of fair play, and it is my hope that, together, my \ncolleagues and I can honor his legacy not just tonight, but as we \napproach our work. When we stand up for religious liberties, true \nequality for women, for American workers, I think Don might look down \nand smile upon the kind of work that we are attempting to do.\n  I learned one thing also from Don Edwards: the importance of giving \nvoice to those who don't have one.\n  It was mentioned that Norm Mineta was one of the folks that Don \nEdwards has maxed out for. When Norm Mineta was leading the effort to \npass the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, Don Edwards was right there with \nhim to make sure that the mistake that this country had foisted upon \nAmericans of Japanese descent in 1942 was recognized. Because of his \nwork and his leadership, along with Norm Mineta, they were able to be \nsuccessful in the 100th Congress passing H.R. 442, which was signed \ninto law by President Reagan.\n  That was done because there was an intense understanding of the \nConstitution and the violation of the Constitution back in 1942 that \nour government had consciously foisted upon 120,000 members of its own \ncountry. That effort took over 10 years here in Congress. So it is \npersistence and an understanding that to do the right thing, sometimes \nit takes persistence and educating other people who would not otherwise \nhave thought about what happened in 1942.\n  So I am here because of that work. I am here because of that \ntremendous effort to make sure that people of different backgrounds, \nalthough they may look different, have different religions, different \nupbringing, different language, different culture, different foods, \nthat they also are accepted as Americans. He gave a voice to us, and \nthat voice allowed us to be able to become participating Members of \nthis Congress.\n  So, in that modeling, when folks in my own district come up to me and \nsay, we know that you didn't have a voice and someone gave you a voice \nafterwards, we need a voice in Congress also, that sort of led me to \nunderstand and to move in the same direction that Don Edwards would \nwant us to and to be a voice for those who don't have a voice.\n  For the Ethiopian community, we became a voice. For the Sikh \ncommunity, we became a voice. For the Muslim community, we became a \nvoice. For those who have been bullied day in and day out because of \nwho they are, we became a voice. This is the legacy that Don Edwards \nhas left with us, and it is an unfinished business that we need to \ncontinue to move forward on. It was because of his consciousness, his \nleadership, his firm belief in doing the right thing in every instance, \nin spite of the fact that it may not be popular at the moment but it is \nconstitutional, that we continue to move forward.\n  So I just want to end with thanking my friend, Congresswoman Lofgren, \nfor hosting this hour. I am truly honored and privileged to stand here \ntoday and pay tribute to the long legacy of our friend, Don Edwards.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Honda for that \nstatement and for his leadership in following the example of Don \nEdwards.\n  You know, when Don Edwards announced he was going to retire after 32 \nyears in Congress, I called him--actually, I heard a rumor--and I \nbegged\n\n[[Page H7086]]\n\nhim not to do it, that we needed him in Congress.\n  He said, there are some new guys on the Judiciary Committee. You \ndon't have to worry about civil rights and civil liberties because they \nare in good hands, and one of those people was Bobby Scott.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for \ngiving me the opportunity to speak in honor of the recently departed \nCongressman William Donlon ``Don'' Edwards, a civil rights champion, \nsupporter of the Equal Rights Amendment, defender of the Constitution.\n  I am proud to say that, as a freshman in Congress, I had the honor to \nserve with Congressman Edwards on the Committee on the Judiciary. I \nwould just like to say a few words about his work on that committee.\n  Congressman Edwards was the living embodiment of the phrase ``Equal \nJustice Under Law,'' the words etched above the main entrance of the \nUnited States Supreme Court Building. When he arrived to Congress in \n1963, he noted: ``11 States in the Old South practiced apartheid. There \nwas a House Un-American Activities Committee. And the FBI was out of \ncontrol threatening individual liberties.''\n  As a freshman, he wasted no time adapting to his new role in Congress \nbecause he recalled that, when he arrived on Capitol Hill, ``Black \npeople couldn't vote in large parts of the country, and if they did, \nthey'd get hanged.''\n  After visiting the American South where his son Leonard worked to \nregister African Americans to vote, he wrote a letter to Dr. Martin \nLuther King, telling him that he understood ``the absolute necessity \nfor the immediate passage'' of the Civil Rights Act, and he told Dr. \nKing that ``we stand ready to support your efforts here in \nWashington.'' With that, he proceeded to work to secure the passage of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  He rose quickly to the rank of chairman of the House Subcommittee on \nCivil and Constitutional Rights in 1971. In that capacity, he took on \nmajor issues, such as the Equal Rights Amendment, which fell just three \nStates short of ratification.\n  Congressman Edwards said, ``It is the irresistible impulse of \ngovernment to assume more power. My role has been to say no.'' That \nstatement perfectly captures his drive to eliminate the House Un-\nAmerican Activities Committee in 1975 and his disapproval of President \nNixon's unauthorized use of government agencies to harass political \nopponents.\n  Congressman Edwards worked tirelessly to gain the passage of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act in 1990, the Fair Housing Amendments \nAct, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991.\n  He successfully fought to extend the Voting Rights Act in 1982 over \nthe objections of President Reagan, who wanted to end the Justice \nDepartment's preclearance power. At the time, Congressman Edwards said \nsimply, ``If you can't vote, you are not a real citizen.''\n  Unfortunately, in 2013, the Supreme Court essentially struck down the \nJustice Department's preclearance powers under the Voting Rights Act in \nthe Shelby County v. Holder decision.\n  When Congressman Edwards retired in 1994, the late Republican \nCongressman and former chair of the House Committee on the Judiciary, \nHenry Hyde, said this of Congressman Edwards: ``He is relentlessly \nliberal, but that's not a vice. The battle for the fullest expression \nof civil liberties is losing a general, not a foot soldier.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I was honored to serve, although briefly, with this \ngreat general who battled for equal justice and equal rights.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Scott for those \nwonderful words.\n  We have quite a number of California Members as well as others who \nhave asked for their statements to be put in the Record, as our time is \nexpiring at this point, but I just would like to make a couple of final \ncomments.\n  We have talked about Don Edwards' legislative record, but it really \nwas rooted in his values. He was someone who cared about people who \ndidn't have enough, and when he rewrote the Bankruptcy Act, he was \nthinking about working people who couldn't actually make ends meet.\n  When the service workers in the House were laid off every time the \nHouse recessed and without any ability to actually have a paycheck, the \none person they sought for help was Congressman Don Edwards.\n  I remember lobbyists came in to lobby in favor of discrimination \nagainst women, and I was on his staff. He said, ``Well, let me call in \nthe young lawyer I rely on for this.'' When I walked in, that was sort \nof the end of the conversation.\n  He lived a long time. He changed this world for the better. We loved \nhim greatly. The fact that so many people went out to California to \nhelp him--former staffers, people like Jim Copeland and Debbie \nMcFarland, who actually went out to make sure he had what he needed--\nwas a tribute to the kind of person he was.\n  As has been mentioned, he was very liberal, but he got along with \npeople who were very conservative. I remember he and Henry Hyde, as \nranking member, got along quite well and had a great deal of respect \nfor each other.\n  At this point, I would just like to say that we miss Don Edwards. We \nhonor his life and contributions. We know that we cannot mourn him. For \nhis 100 years, he made a difference, he made our country better, and we \nlove him for it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of \nCongressman Don Edwards, a champion for civil rights, a defender of \ncivil liberties, and a tireless advocate for the residents of \nCalifornia.\n  Congressman Edwards dedicated his life to public service, from \nserving as a naval officer during World War II, to his time at the FBI, \nto his decades of work in the House of Representatives on behalf of his \nconstituents.\n  Through all of the phases of his life he remained true to his \nprinciples, fighting for underserved and underrepresented communities \nno matter what the cost.\n  A San Jose native and graduate of Stanford University, Congressman \nEdwards entered the House of Representatives in 1962, ultimately \nparticipating in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965.\n  In the following decades, the Congressman diligently defended, and \nled efforts to preserve, this critical legislation so that all \nAmericans can today better exercise their Constitutional rights. As \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights in the \nHouse Judiciary Committee he was dedicated to increasing legal \nprotections for women and minorities. His work to level the playing \nfield continued with his leadership in the House Judiciary Committee on \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which ensured that \ncitizens with disabilities have access to the same opportunities as all \nAmericans.\n  Congressman Don Edwards was also instrumental in preserving some of \nour greatest national treasures in California. In the early 1970s, \nCongressman Edwards was one of the key leaders in the creation of the \nSan Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, which was later named in \nhis honor in 1995. His dedication to environmental protection, \nspecifically preserving urban wetlands, will ensure that generations to \ncome will enjoy California's beautiful landscape.\n  During his 32 years in the House of Representatives and as the dean \nof the California Democratic delegation, Congressman Edwards was always \nguided by a sense of justice and fairness; earning the respect of his \ncolleagues and working with both parties to get things done for the \npeople of California and the citizens of our great nation. His legacy \nwill continue to serve as an example for us all in Congress and he will \nbe greatly missed.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of former \nCongressman Don Edwards, a man this body remembers as a champion for \ncivil rights and American workers, and I remember as a kind and \ncompassionate mentor.\n  With civility and dignity, Congressman Edwards fought the most \nimportant civil rights battles of our generation. He challenged \ndiscrimination against African-Americans, women, people with \ndisabilities, and others seeking equal protection under the law.\n  He was also a strong defender of free speech and a fierce advocate \nfor the environment, well before protecting the environment was a \ncommon or popular cause.\n  Congressman Edwards fought for the little guy and everyone knew it. \nIn fact, when Congress would routinely fire all the food service \nworkers on Capitol Hill as a quick fix to budget issues, the workers \nwould appeal to the Congressman from California to stand up for\n\n[[Page H7087]]\n\nthem--even though he wasn't on the committee that made the decision.\n  He truly was the conscience of the Congress.\n  My most vivid memory of Congressman Edwards was in 1992, when I \nnarrowly lost my first race for the House. He was the dean of the \nCalifornia delegation at the time, and I was attending the orientation \nfor new Members of Congress, not knowing whether I would ultimately be \nelected.\n  In those moments of great anxiety, he showed me great kindness. He \nwalked with me, distracted me from the election news and demonstrated \nthe class and sincerity that he was known for.\n  Congressman Edwards had a tremendous impact on me and many other \npeople across the country. His legacy is a reminder of Congress' \ncapacity to do great things.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/house-section/article/H7087-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3762, \n  RESTORING AMERICANS' HEALTHCARE FREEDOM RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2015; \n   WAIVING A REQUIREMENT OF CLAUSE 6(A) OF RULE XIII WITH RESPECT TO \n  CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS REPORTED FROM THE COMMITTEE ON \n RULES; AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES\n\n  Mr. WOODALL, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged \nreport (Rept.
