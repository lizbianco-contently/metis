Mr. Speaker, I rise today for a very special occasion, to \nwish my grandmother, Edna Yoder, a happy 104th birthday. That is right. \nShe is 104 years of age. The Lord has blessed my grandmother with great \nhealth and longevity, and I cannot be more thankful for her or proud of \nmy grandmother on her birthday this upcoming Sunday.\n  She is a true example of what has made America such a strong and \nvibrant nation. Born in 1911 and one of 14 children, she worked \ntirelessly on the farm, milking cows at dawn and bringing in the wheat \nharvest in the hot Kansas sun.\n  She has seen hard times, and she has seen good times over the past \n104 years with a front seat to the great American century, but through \nit all, her faith in God and love of family define her life. She is a \nsweet, caring, and loving woman who continues to inspire me each and \nevery day in so many ways.\n  Today, Grandma, on behalf of the United States House of \nRepresentatives, I wish you a very happy 104th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4655-8", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4655-H4656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND\n\n  (Ms. TSONGAS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund, which is set to expire in less than 100 days, \nunless Congress takes action.\n  We have a generational responsibility to protect our Nation's \nremaining natural wilderness areas for our children and grandchildren. \nFor over 50 years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has been an \ninstrumental tool in this effort, and it has been used in almost every \nsingle county in the United States.\n  LWCF protects and expands access to recreational areas and preserves \nour treasured natural and historic landscapes. It does not cost \ntaxpayer\n\n[[Page H4656]]\n\nmoney or contribute to the Federal deficit. In fact, according to a \nrecent economic analysis, every dollar invested in the conservation of \npublic lands through the LWCF leads to $4 in economic activity to local \ncommunities.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the permanent \nreauthorization of the LWCF, ensuring that it remains one of our \nNation's most successful conservation tools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4656-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               BRINGING HEALTH CARE INTO THE 21ST CENTURY\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, it is time to personalize and modernize our \nhealthcare system and bring it into the 21st century.\n  We have an opportunity through the 21st Century Cures Act to pass \nbipartisan reforms that will accelerate the discovery, development, \ndeployment, and delivery of lifesaving and life-improving techniques \nand cures.\n  The 21st Century Cures Act is the result of bipartisan work to ensure \nthat our regulatory system keeps pace with the advances we are seeing \nin our science and technology fields. 21st Century Cures will make a \ndifference in people's lives.\n  For the 10,000 known diseases, there are only 500 FDA-approved \ntreatments. By removing barriers to research and development, by \nmodernizing clinical trials, and by incorporating more patient \nperspectives, we can more effectively develop treatments and cures to \nfight cancer, Alzheimer's, and other diseases that affect millions of \nAmericans.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the coming weeks, we will have the opportunity to \nhelp bring the newest, cutting-edge medical technology to the people \nwho need it the most.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4656-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REAUTHORIZE THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I am standing here today because the \nclock is ticking.

This year alone, more than half a million \ndollars has been financed for businesses in the 14th District. All of \nthis was done at no cost to our taxpayers.\n  To reduce the deficit, to create more jobs, to remain globally \ncompetitive, we must reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4656-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ELSON FLOYD\n\n  (Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and in \nmemory of Washington State University president, Dr. Elson Floyd, who \npassed away on June 20, after a courageous battle against cancer.\n  Dr. Floyd was a giant for eastern Washington. He embodied the values \nwe seek in our leaders. He was visionary. He was kindhearted. He was a \nfearless and passionate advocate for higher education, our region, and \nour State. He had the gift of making our dreams seem possible and of \nturning our aspirations into a reality.\n  It has been my privilege to know him and call him friend. During this \ndifficult time, my prayers continue to be with his wife, his children, \nand the whole WSU family. Together, Washingtonians are inspired and \nwill carry on his legacy.\n  Thank you, Dr. Floyd, for your tireless work.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my many colleagues in \nhighlighting the urgency of reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank.\n  On Monday, I visited a steel company in New Castle, Delaware, called \nV Delaware Galvanizing. This small business employees 60 hard-working \nDelawareans. Their jobs depend on the financing provided by the Export-\nImport Bank. The failure to authorize the Bank would be a failure to \nsupport and protect these and many other jobs in Delaware.\n  If we are serious about making things here in America, if we are \nserious about providing good middle class jobs to people who need them, \nif we are serious about creating an economy that is built to last, we \nwill reauthorize the Export-Import Bank before it expires next week.\n  The Ex-Im Bank creates jobs across the country. It sustains those \njobs, and it also reduces the deficit. Last year alone, the Bank \nreturned $700 million to the United States Treasury, and it supports \n160,000 U.S. jobs.\n  This shouldn't be a partisan issue, and it never has been in the \npast. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to come together and take \naction today to ensure that the Export-Import Bank can continue to grow \nour economy and create jobs across our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4656-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NEGOTIATIONS WITH IRAN\n\n  (Mr. GIBBS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, in less than a week, the deadline for the \nadministration's negotiations with Iran will pass. Many people, \nincluding myself, have serious concerns about the status and the \noutcome of these negotiations.\n  Iran's nuclear ambitions are a threat to the Middle East, especially \nto our closest ally, Israel. I remain skeptical of Iran's commitment to \ndisarmament and transparency.\n  I believe there are five key issues that must be addressed for this \nto be a good deal for America and Israel.\n  One, unrestricted access to inspection locations on short notice--\ninspectors must be given complete access at any time and at any place \nfor verification inspections.\n  Two, Iran must disclose the entirety of its previous activities and \nefforts towards a nuclear weapon.\n  Three, sanctions must remain in place until Iran complies and proves \nits compliance, and we must show commitment to a robust response to any \nviolation.\n  Four, any deal must be long term, and it must not include the \ndevelopment of and access to nuclear weapons.\n  Finally, any negotiations must include provisions that require Iran \nto dismantle its program completely with no path to a weapon in the \nfuture.\n  I believe that only if these conditions are met should Congress and \nthe American people even consider a deal with Iran.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4656-6", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4656-H4657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPORTING MARRIAGE EQUALITY\n\n  (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues today in supporting \nequality and dignity for every American regardless of whom one loves.\n  Very soon, the Supreme Court will make an historic decision about the \nrights of LGBT couples and families, and it is my hope they will \nrespect that each of us deserves as an American citizen the ability to \nhave a family and to love whom one loves.\n  The economic downturn illustrated how important it is for all \nfamilies to access the protections of civil marriage so they can live \nwith more certainty and dignity even in challenging times.\n  No matter what the Court decides, we will keep pushing so people in \nloving, committed relationships throughout this Nation can say two \nsimple words with extraordinary meaning: ``I do.'' We will keep \nfighting to ensure that people don't face discrimination based on whom \nthey love.\n  Let me close with the words of President Kennedy, who said: ``In \ngiving rights to others which belong to them, we give rights to \nourselves and to our country.''\n\n[[Page H4657]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4657-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 ALZHEIMER'S AND BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. JOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to add my voice in support of \nAlzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month.\n  Today, 5.3 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's, including \n200,000 who are younger than 65. When you include dementia and other \nbrain diseases with Alzheimer's, the number of diagnoses is nearly on \npar with cancer diagnoses.\n  In fact, Alzheimer's, itself, is the sixth leading cause of death in \nthe United States, and of the top 10 causes of death, Alzheimer's is \nthe only one that today cannot be prevented, cannot be cured, and \ncannot be slowed.\n  This week, Congress is taking action. Yesterday, the House \nAppropriations Committee approved an initial funding bill for the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services that provides a $300 million \nincrease over last year's level for Alzheimer's research at the \nNational Institute on Aging.\n  Additionally, the committee continues its support for the Peer \nReviewed Alzheimer's Research Program at the Department of Defense.\n  These programs, coupled with several bills pending in the House, \nincluding the HOPE for Alzheimer's Act, are a testament to the strong \nadvocacy that we have been witnessing on Capitol Hill and throughout \nthe country, but we must continue to do more.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in this fight and join me in \nraising awareness of this most critical national health concern.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4657-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  0915\n RETURNING TO THE SENATE H.R. 1735, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT \n                          FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016\n\n  Mr. BOUSTANY.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise this morning in support of a rule which would allow for an up-\nor-down vote in the House on the Senate amendment to H.R. 1295, the \nTrade Preferences Extension Act, so that it can be considered by the \nfull House; and, if the bill passes, it will head to the President's \ndesk along with the trade promotion authority for the President's \nsignature.\n  This bill that would be considered after passage of this rule renews \nthe Generalized System of Preferences program, extending the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act, and reauthorizes Trade Adjustment \nAssistance, known as TAA.\n  The activity on the floor of the House today represents a promise to \nCongress made by Speaker Boehner and Senate Majority Leader McConnell. \nAfter House Democrats voted down TAA last week, the House considered \nand passed TPA, with a bipartisan majority, and sent it to the Senate. \nIn the meantime, the Speaker and the Senate majority leader promised \nthat they would ensure that both TPA and TAA receive votes in the House \nand the Senate.\n  As promised, here we are today. The Senate yesterday delivered it, \nwhen it passed TPA 60-38, which is now headed to the President's desk \nfor his signature. The Senate also passed the Senate amendment to H.R. \n1295, which will be considered today under the rule which we are \nspeaking about. The final legislative step is for the House to consider \nthe Trade Preferences Extension Act, and that is exactly what the rule \nwill do.\n  This rule and the underlying bill represents the end of a long \nprocess to deliver trade promotion authority on behalf of the American \npeople. Mr. Speaker, it is a Republican agenda about jobs. By passing \nTPA, the House and the Senate proved to the world that America is \nwilling to lead and to stand for jobs and interaction between great \ncountries to help lead in the 21st century. We believe in the rule of \nlaw, we believe in intellectual property, and we believe in an \nopportunity for consumers to have the best products, wherever they are \naround the world, at a great price.\n  The world has responded, and our partner nations have indicated that \nthey are now ready to begin the negotiation to bring their best deals \nto the table. As these negotiations heat up, it is vital that the \nadministration follow the requirements of TPA, some 160 separate, \nspecific items which this House and the legislation very clearly talks \nabout. It will lead negotiation to a deal that is good for the American \npeople. If the administration violates that promise, the House can turn \noff TPA and stop the process.\n  Once a trade agreement is completed, the President is required to \nmake public the text of an agreement for 60 days before the President \nseeks approval to it. The President must then submit the final text of \nany trade agreement to Congress 30 days before it gets a vote. Because \nof this important transparency feature of TPA, the American people have \nseen a better process than\n\n[[Page H4658]]\n\nwhat existed today. We will have months to read the text of any deal \nbefore Congress votes on it.\n  Most importantly, though, Congress retains its right to vote up or \ndown on any agreement. So if the President brings us a bad trade deal, \nwe can and we would vote that down. This ensures that Congress, and \nonly the U.S. Congress, can change and agree to any law or agreement \nthat is made that becomes U.S. law.\n  We have also proved that Washington has learned from some States, \nlike my home State of Texas, which benefit greatly from trade. Trade \nsupports over 3 million jobs in Texas, and last year Texas exported \n$289 billion worth of goods and services to trading partners around the \nglobe. Because of the process Congress has gone through the past few \nweeks, we can ensure that the growth, the availability of better jobs, \nand high-paying opportunities lie ahead for the American people.\n  At a time when it has become very difficult to create jobs in this \ncountry, we will, through trade promotion authority and these trade \ndeals, offer new and great opportunities for more jobs and to build \nmore American products and to sell more products around the globe.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, and I thank the gentleman very much for yielding me the time, \nbut the procedural jockeying that has unfolded before us does a \ndisservice to our Chamber, to our economy, and to our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, without opportunity for Members to offer amendments, \nwithout clear consideration, and without, certainly, robust debate, the \nbills have bounced from one Chamber to another, jumped back and forth \nbetween in every iteration that can be cooked up.\n  The procedural machinations do deep disservice not only to the bills, \nbut to the people it will impact, and I think even to the House of \nRepresentatives. Thomas Jefferson, who authored the legislative manual \nthat guides our procedure, would be pained to see the path by which \nthese trade packages have come to the floor.\n  From beginning to end, Members of this body have been shut out, shut \nout from reading the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership that has now \nbeen fast-tracked, and we are not being able to discuss it with our \nconstituents.\n  It is not just the American Representatives that have been silenced, \neither. The trade deal is upending legislative bodies across the world, \nand particularly in another great democracy involved in this \nagreement--Australia. The people's representatives in Australia could \nnot look at this bill, even though they had great concern that PhRMA \nwas going to do great harm to their own health system in Australia as \nwell as in New Zealand. They couldn't even go to see about that unless \nthey signed a paper that they would not discuss it for 4 years. So, two \nof the great democracies on the planet working on this trade bill, the \nUnited States and Australia, basically shut out the people's \nrepresentatives from knowing what it is that we are even talking about \ntoday.\n  Mr. Speaker, I insert for the Record the text of an article about the \nAustralians, an article from The Guardian from June 11, titled, \n``Leaked Trade Deal Terms Prompt Fears for Pharmaceutical Benefits \nScheme.''\n\n                   [From the Guardian, June 11, 2015]\n\n                            (Gabrielle Chan)\n\n       The leak of new information on the Trans-Pacific \n     Partnership agreement (TPP) shows the mega-trade deal could \n     provide more ways for multinational corporations to influence \n     Australia's control of its pharmaceutical regulations.\n       Revealed via Wikileaks, the annexe on ``transparency and \n     procedural fairness for pharmaceutical products and medical \n     devices'' uncovered the draft agreements regarding medicines \n     between the 12 TPPA member countries.\n       The leak comes as US Republican leaders announced a vote on \n     Friday that may provide Barack Obama a fast-track authority \n     to complete the agreement with Australia, Brunei, Canada, \n     Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore \n     and Vietnam. The countries represent 40% of the world's \n     economy.\n       The leaked text, dated December 2014, laid out the draft \n     rules for member countries regarding medicines under national \n     health care programs, in Australia's case, the Pharmaceutical \n     Benefits Scheme (PBS). The TPP has yet to be signed off.\n       The Abbott government has argued the trade deal will \n     provide access for Australian products to other markets. But \n     it requires Australia to trade off regulations that stop \n     access by other countries and particularly multinational \n     companies to the Australian market.\n       Critics have suggested the deal, which is likely to include \n     Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) clauses, will allow \n     big corporations to sue Australian governments. Philip Morris \n     International is currently challenging the former Labor \n     government's tobacco plain packaging laws under a Hong Kong \n     trade treaty ISDS.\n       Trade experts leaped on the rare information release \n     regarding the secret but wide-ranging trade deal. Deborah \n     Gleeson, a lecturer at the school of psychology and public \n     health at La Trobe University, said the inclusion of an \n     annexe on health ``serves no useful public interest \n     purpose''.\n       ``It sets a terrible precedent for using regional trade \n     deals to tamper with other countries' health systems and \n     could circumscribe the options available to developing \n     countries seeking to introduce pharmaceutical coverage \n     programs in future,'' Gleeson said.\n       Jane Kelsey of the faculty of law of the University of \n     Auckland described the annexe as one of the most \n     controversial parts of the TPP in her analysis. She said the \n     US pharmaceutical industry was using the trade agreement to \n     target New Zealand's Pharmaceutical Management Agency \n     (Pharmac), equivalent to the PBS.\n       ``This `transparency' annexe seeks to erode the processes \n     and decisions of agencies that decide which medicines and \n     medical devices to subsidise the public money and by how \n     much,'' Kelsey said.\n       ``This leaked text shows the TPP will severely erode \n     Pharmac's ability to continue to deliver affordable medicines \n     and medical devices as it has for the past two decades.\n       ``That will mean fewer medicines are subsidised, or people \n     will pay more as co-payments or more of the health budget \n     will go to pay for medicines instead of other activities or \n     the health budget will have to expand beyond the cap.\n       ``Whatever the outcome, the big global pharmaceutical \n     companies will win and the poorest and most vulnerable New \n     Zealanders will lose.''\n       AMA president Brian Owler said while doctors were very \n     concerned at the possible effects on Australia's healthcare \n     systems, they were constantly dismissed by the trade minister \n     Andrew Robb.\n       ``When we have raised concerns about the effects on health, \n     the only response is `we are not going to undermine the \n     Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme','' said Owler.\n       ``We are worried about the Investor State Dispute \n     Settlement (ISDS) mechanism and there are issues in terms of \n     patents that would affect pharmaceutical prices.\n       ``The problem is our concerns have been dismissed by the \n     trade minister but we do not know what is in the text.''\n       However, Robb said on Thursday that the government would \n     not accept anything that would adversely affect the PBS, the \n     health system more generally, or increase the price of \n     medicines for Australians.\n       ``It's perhaps time to look at the enormous benefits that \n     will flow from a more seamless trade and investment \n     environment across 12 countries representing 40 percent of \n     global GDP,'' Robb said.\n       ``New levels of market access and common sets of trading \n     rules will help support growth, create new jobs and result in \n     higher living standards.''\n       Parliamentarians were offered the chance to see the TPP \n     draft by Robb if they agreed to a four year non-disclosure \n     agreement.\n       A cross-party parliamentary working group has formed, \n     including Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, Labor MP Melissa \n     Parke and independent senator Nick Xenophon.\n       Whish-Wilson, who has not seen the draft as he refused to \n     agree to the terms of the agreement, said the latest leak \n     suggested the Australian PBS could be undermined.\n       ``These negotiations are happening behind closed doors, \n     without the scrutiny of the parliament,'' he said.\n       ``At the very least, the Australian people deserve to be \n     reassured that the government won't allow any deal which \n     drives up the public health costs for Australian taxpayers \n     such as further subsidising important new medicines including \n     biologics.''\n       During the most recent senate estimates in the past \n     fortnight, Whish-Wilson questioned officials from the \n     department of foreign affairs and trade about the strategic \n     importance of the TPP to the United States.\n       The secretary of Dfat, Peter Varghese, said the whole \n     purpose was to indicate a ``ramped up US presence in Asia''.\n       ``The conclusion of the TPP is important to the United \n     States in terms of its rebalance, because it is an important \n     step in relation to the economic engagement of the United \n     States with the region, and the whole purpose of the re-\n     balance was to indicate a ramped up US presence in Asia, and \n     a recognition of the importance of Asia in broader US \n     geostrategic thinking,'' Varghese said.\n       ``We in Australia have never seen the TPP as an instrument \n     for locking anybody out--in fact, quite the contrary.''\n       The trade minister's office was contacted for comment.\n\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. So the two great democracies are now being cut out, \nand\n\n[[Page H4659]]\n\nthe 750,000 people that I represent in western New York have been \nsilenced because I don't go see a trade bill if I can't discuss it with \nthem.\n  There has been no regular order and absolutely no Member input, with \nthe exception of the Committee on Ways and Means. Now, the Senate had \nplenty of opportunity for amendments, and they were plentiful. Many of \nthem were accepted. They also had robust debate, but not the House of \nRepresentatives. The opportunity in the Committee on Ways and Means to \noffer amendments did not result in acceptance of any Democratic \namendments.\n  Over the last 3 weeks, the Democrats and Republicans, alike, came to \nthe Committee on Rules with ideas to try to make the trade package \nbetter. They ranged from currency manipulation to labor standards to \nenvironmental fixes to the investor-state dispute settlement, but one \nby one they were shut out.\n  Perhaps one of the most critical is the investor-state dispute \nsettlement, where three lawyers will be allowed to adjudicate all cases \nbrought against any of the participating countries, in many cases \nresulting against change in their laws. I should note that the House of \nRepresentatives, in fear of all this, has already voted to do away with \ncountry of origin labeling.\n  What is more, on the third rule that we have had in so many weeks on \ntrade, we are being asked to vote on two separate bills packaged into \none vote. On one hand, we have Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA; on \nthe other hand, we have the African Growth and Opportunity Act, or \nAGOA, which most of us have supported. The other part of this is a bill \nthat was trounced in the House of Representatives. We find ourselves in \nthe position of supporting the African Growth and Opportunity Act at \nthe same time of a vote that most of us have voted against, the TAA.\n  Linking these two bills together is untenable and goes again the \nmores of the Chamber. And as we see, when the process is strained, the \nbills suffer, but most of all, the people we represent suffer.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman brings up a lot of good issues. We have \nbeen on the floor talking about this bill for a long, long time: hours \nof debate up in the Committee on Rules; hours of debate not only in the \nCommittee on Ways and Means, but also watching the United States Senate \nfor weeks work through this issue.\n  I think the gentlewoman knows and understands that any final trade \ndeal will result in our ability to see in writing--and the public--this \ndocument; and the gentlewoman knows and understands it is simply not \ntrue if we try and say that we can't see what is in the bill, we don't \nknow what is in the bill. Plenty of time, plenty of time to do that. It \nis just not available yet.\n  So why would you put out something that has not yet been negotiated? \nI wouldn't do that. And whether the administration has handled this \nentire process well or not may be up for speculation, but I find it \nhard to criticize. Any Member of Congress was given an opportunity to \ncome and read what exists today. This is not the final deal. Members of \nCongress have not seen the final deal because it has not been \nnegotiated. When it is negotiated, when whoever the President is brings \na trade deal back to the United States, to the United States Congress, \nwe will be able to see it.\n  Secondly, very specifically, Chairman Paul Ryan of the Committee on \nWays and Means put in the law that any Member of Congress may take part \nin any of the trade talks as they evolve around the country. Members of \nCongress are allowed to do this, and I think that it is a real \nadvantage to have more authority for Members of Congress of rules and \nregulations, putting us into the process to where we are a part of \nunderstanding not only what we would be voting on, but the importance \nof us being involved throughout the process.\n  Lastly, the gentlewoman is right. I do understand that the rules and \nregulations that have been added, not every Member of this House would \nlike them, but I felt like they were important. I would like to just go \nthrough some of those very quickly.\n  One of them is that we are not going to allow any part of a trade \ndeal to end up as an immigration deal. That is the wrong thing. This \nshould be about trade, not about immigration.\n  Secondly, it shouldn't be about climate change, and we specifically \nsaid it cannot be about climate change.\n  Lastly, we said that for our own authority--and I think the \nconstitutional bounds are there for us to say that--if there are any \nchanges in this document, those changes have to come through Congress \nfor us to approve them.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Of course, not every colleague that we have in the House would be for \nthose rules, but I believe that they are in the best interest of this \nbody.\n  I believe they are in the best interest of making sure that the way \nthe world sees us is that we work together from a democracy, a republic \nperspective; that we work back through the things that we agree to in \nlaw, in bilateral deals, would have to involve the United States \nCongress. It would have to involved the United States Senate and the \nPresident and us working together.\n  By the authority granted within this TPA, that is exactly what we \nwill do. I think it is well balanced. I think it is really a work of \nart that Chairman Ryan has crafted, along with our colleagues in the \nSenate, and I am proud of that.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  What the gentleman said sounds wonderful, and so we are all going to \nhave an opportunity to do it, but we have not been in on the \nnegotiation. All we know about it is what has come through WikiLeaks, \nthat it is being negotiated mainly by financial services and \npharmaceutical companies.\n  Once we pass fast trade and it has passed both Houses, once that is \ndone, the administration can do the trade bill itself in perfect \nsecrecy, and we will not know it until it comes to the House. At that \npoint, all we can do is vote up or down. It is my sincere hope that we \nvote it down.\n  I am now pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Lynch).\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  I want to begin this discussion by saying I have the utmost respect \nfor the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions). I have worked with him on \nother issues where we have agreed. That is not the case today.\n  I also know that there will be Members of the majority and Members of \nthe minority that have a different opinion than I do on this matter, \nand it does not mean I have less respect for them; it just means we \nhave a difference of agreement on this one bill.\n  Now, when I first met my wife, I was an ironworker. I worked as an \nironworker for 20 years. Then I went to law school and became an \nattorney. Then I ran for office and became a politician. My wife says \nit has been one disappointment after another.\n  When I was an ironworker, I had an opportunity to work at the General \nMotors facility, the auto plant in Framingham, Massachusetts. That was \njust before they made a decision to close that plant, close a couple in \nMichigan, and move them over the border to Mexico. I have seen the \neffect that that has had on local communities where that has happened.\n  I oppose this bill because I want a stronger America. That is why I \noppose this bill. Our trade agreements negotiated under fast track have \nhad a continual pattern of exporting American jobs overseas. That is \njust the fact of the matter.\n  Now, you might be surprised that a former union president, a \nDemocrat, an ironworker would oppose a bill. The object of this bill is \nto provide public assistance to workers after we send their jobs \noverseas. That is the object of this bill. When their jobs are \nexported, we will give them public assistance and some training for a \nnew job.\n  I oppose this bill; some people find that surprising, but I can only \ndraw on my own experience. I always felt that I would rather have my \nRepresentative fighting for my job than coming up with a public \nassistance program to support me after I lost my job.\n  That is why I am here on the floor today. I think American workers \nwant\n\n[[Page H4660]]\n\ntheir Representative in the fight. They want them in the fight to \nprotect their jobs, not to give them public assistance after they ship \ntheir jobs overseas. That is as simple as I can describe.\n  I think I understand the American people. I think I understand the \nAmerican worker. I have been there, and this does not do the job.\n  If you want to read this bill, you have to go to a secret location \nhere on the Capitol Grounds. I had to give up my cell phone and my \niPad. I had to give them my pen. I was not allowed to bring any paper. \nI can't take notes. They bring in a big box with the bill, and they sat \nit down in front of me, and they let me read it. They do not allow me \nto talk to the people who sent me here about what is in that bill.\n  That is not right. That is undemocratic. There is a reason they don't \nlet me talk about that bill to the people I represent and everybody \nelse in this Chamber--because they would not like it. They would tell \nyou: Do not pass this bill; it is going to cost our jobs and our kids' \njobs.\n  The people who are drafting this bill, though, as the gentlewoman \nfrom New York spoke, are industries like the chemical industry, the \npharmaceutical industry. They are all drafting sections of this bill; \nyet the people who represent American workers are kept out of the \nprocess.\n  Later on, we will be able to vote up or down, but we cannot fix this \nbill. Unlike every other bill that comes to this floor that we are \nallowed to amend, we cannot fix this bill. We have to vote it up or \ndown, and that is not right. That is not right. If we see a problem, we \nshould be able to fix it.\n  I was listening to a guy the other day talk about the fact that we \nshouldn't really worry about not having manufacturing jobs in America \nanymore, that we have a service economy. He described it as a Starbucks \neconomy.\n  Now, I love Starbucks as much as the next guy; I like my grande \nlatte, but the Starbucks economy does not work unless you have someone \nwho can walk into that store and pay $4 for a cup of coffee. This is \nnot good for America.\n  I was watching that Roosevelt show last night on PBS, and they talked \nabout, after the Second World War, the world called America ``the \narsenal of democracy'' because our industrial might, our manufacturing \ncapacity, allowed us to marshal resources and save the world.\n  We have continually exported millions and millions and millions of \nAmerican manufacturing jobs in the industrial capacity.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LYNCH. I am just getting wound up.\n  They referred to America after the Second World War as the arsenal of \ndemocracy because we did save the world. Today, when the world looks at \nus after we have exported millions of manufacturing jobs and industrial \ncapacity overseas, I think they look at America and say: You know, in \nAmerica, they can make us a good cup of coffee if you can pay $4 a cup.\n  This is not the direction we should be sending America. I have the \nutmost respect for my friends on the other side of aisle. Democrats on \nmy side of the aisle are going to support this. We have to get \nAmerica's Representatives, Members of Congress, back in this fight. We \nhave abnegated our responsibility.\n  We negotiate a lot of complicated bills on this floor and over in the \nSenate, nuclear regulatory issues, bankruptcy--very complicated \nissues--war and peace; yet we can't negotiate this trade deal. We have \ngot to leave it up to multinational corporations. That is flat wrong. \nAmerica wants their Representatives back in the fight on this issue.\n\n  Let's vote this bill down; let's get rid of TPA and let the American \nworkers have a voice on the floor of this House of Representatives on \nthis bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The gentleman, my friend from Massachusetts, is a great man and a \nvery dear friend, but I would respond and say to the gentleman that you \nare going to have an opportunity, and I can't wait to get you invited \nto every single round of these and have you find time to go do exactly \nwhat you think Members of Congress ought to be doing because, in fact, \nthat is the way the TPA is written.\n  Now, we haven't agreed to it yet because it has not been signed by--\nwell, that has--but this whole process. As soon as that takes place, \nthe gentleman will have all the opportunity he wants to go and take \npart in every round of the discussions.\n  I don't believe that is what we were elected for. I don't believe we \nwere elected to go and have to do all the work that is described that \nthe gentleman said to get back into the fight, to go offer the trade \ndeals, to go do the negotiating.\n  He will be given that chance. He will be given that chance every \nsingle day. As soon as it is signed by the President, he can go at it. \nHe can maybe even just tell the President he wants to do this for a \nfull-time job; I don't know, but he will have that opportunity.\n  Every Member of this body will have that same chance. He and every \nMember will have a chance to go and negotiate, be in the room, be a \npart of the discussion, and make sure all these big, multilateral \ncorporations that he talks about that will be in the room--which they \nwon't be because that would not be the right thing. There would be \nethics violations. I am sure the White House, the executive branch, can \nnotify him of that, but he will be allowed as a Member of Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, the things that are being talked about most as negative \npoints about this bill, there is already an answer to it. That is what \nRepublicans did.\n  This is a Republican bill. This is about the authority of the House \nof Representatives, the United States Congress, to make sure we are \ninvolved. That has never been allowed before.\n  Fast track is what we used to have. That is what we did have. We now \nhave a bill before us today which will help us complete the entire \nprocess, to make sure Members of Congress are involved, not just the \nUnited States negotiator; but all the world will know the piece parts \nabout how we are going to negotiate the trade deal. If it doesn't come \nback that way, we will vote it down.\n  Do we need to second-guess them now today? I don't think so, but if \nany Member wants to be involved in this, they can just get on their \nplane and go wherever they want and get it done. By law, they will be \nallowed that opportunity.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I have great admiration for Mr. Sessions. We truly are good friends, \nand I know that he is absolutely sincere when he says that every Member \nof Congress is going to have input now into this bill that has not even \nbegun.\n  If there is no bill, then why is everybody talking about going to \nread something? For goodness sake, when you passed the TPA, we have \npassed fast track. You can't say we are not operating under fast track.\n  I hear that all the time, and it really grates on me because fast \ntrack is what was passed here and in the Senate that gives to the \nadministration the ability to negotiate that.\n  It will come in here, and we may be reading all of it--if we have the \nability to do that--before we vote; I am not even clear about that. But \nI do know that they negotiate it; it is brought over here, and we get \nto vote ``yes'' or ``no.'' We don't amend it. There will be nothing \nthat we can say about it, and we are stuck with it.\n  Not only do we have fast track, but it is not just until the \nexpiration of President Obama's term; it is for years beyond, so a \nfuture President can do whatever they please because the Congress gave \nthat authority to the executive department. Why? I don't know.\n  It doesn't just apply to this one trade bill. I hope everybody \nunderstands that. When they passed TPA here the other day, they were \ndoing it for years to come.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Lynch).\n  Mr. LYNCH. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  I will try not to repeat the arguments that the gentlewoman has put \nforward, but I do have to say that there is about 8 pounds of bill over \nthere at a secure location, as I spoke of before,\n\n[[Page H4661]]\n\nthat I can't talk about it in public because I am precluded from doing \nthat. I would violate the rules of the House and the classified status \nthat has been accorded that material, so I can't really talk about it.\n  I can say that it is very complicated. Like I say, there is probably, \nI am guessing, about 8 pounds of document there that you have to read. \nIt is largely aspirational. In other words, I will paraphrase without \ndisclosing any classified information. It largely says the parties will \naspire or engage to do blah, blah, blah. It is largely unenforceable.\n  Here is another part of the problem. We are negotiating the biggest \nmultinational trade agreement in the history of the United States. You \nhave got some countries that I think are reliable partners and that we \nhave a history with.\n  Canada, even before free trade agreements, we had trade agreements \nwith Canada. They have the rule of law there. It is not a race to the \nbottom with Canada or with Australia or with New Zealand.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  I think we have rule of law established in those countries. But we \nalso, in the same agreement, are negotiating with Vietnam.\n  I went to Vietnam not long ago, and when we talked issues, I sat down \nacross the table from a bunch of Communist generals. They run the \ncountry. They have problems with prison labor. They have problems with \nchild labor. They have serious problems with environmental standards in \nthat country.\n  Malaysia, do you know what the minimum wage in Malaysia is? Zero. \nThey do that to try to attract companies.\n  The situation in Chile and Peru, we have organizers that have tried \nto work on behalf of workers who have been killed in those countries. \nThere is no rule of law established in those countries where we have \nhad success in enforcing our agreements. That has been a major problem.\n  So we are going to ask the American worker to compete with workers in \nVietnam, who get, I think it is 90 cents an hour, 97 cents an hour--I \ndon't want to sell them short--97 cents an hour in a country that has \nhad a history of major problems, as I have spoken about. Malaysia, the \nsame thing.\n  We can't enforce our agreements. And on the issue of who has drafted \nthis bill, it is my understanding that the chemical industry provisions \nin that TPP were drafted by the chemical industry. They like it. They \ngot exactly what they wanted. The same thing with these other \nindustries.\n  And again, why is it a national secret that I can't talk about a bill \nthat is going to affect every American citizen today? And not only \nthat, it is going to affect their sons and daughters.\n  There is a reason that our kids coming out of college can't get jobs. \nWe have got to wake up.\n  I told this story before. I went to Korea recently, with JPAC. It was \nabout the Korean war and recovering our sons and daughters who fought \nin that country and are still there. But while I was there, I looked \nfor American cars because we had passed a free trade agreement with \nKorea. We were there for days. I had two young Navy lieutenants with \nme. I said, Let's all look for American cars.\n  We saw two American cars in the time we were there in Korea. It is a \nbig industrial country. They have got plenty of traffic. We saw \nhundreds of thousands of cars. I saw two American cars: the one I was \ndriving in from the Embassy, and the one that the Navy lieutenants were \ndriving in behind me. They have shut us out.\n  You go to Japan, it is pretty much the same story. I said before, you \nneed to hire a detective to find an American car in Japan.\n  So we have had very little success in enforcing our trade agreements \noverseas. We have got a lousy deal.\n  So all I am asking is, look, I believe in--and you know what? I have \nto say, the EU did it right. The EU, when they negotiated with South \nKorea, they said: If you are going to sell cars into the EU from Korea, \nwe want 30 percent of the components in that car to be made in the EU. \nAnd they created a lot of work for their auto parts industry.\n  Think about it. We could do that. Congress could do that. We could \nmaintain that, if they are going to sell a foreign car here, we want 40 \npercent or 50 percent of the components to be manufactured here in the \nUnited States. We would create millions of jobs in the United States. \nThere is nothing wrong with that. It is a good thing. We would restore \nindustrial and manufacturing capacity in the United States if Congress \ngot back in the game.\n  I am not against free trade. I think free trade works when it is \nbalanced. I want somebody in there fighting for the American worker. We \ndon't have that now. We don't have that now. Congress has abdicated its \nresponsibility by agreeing to buy a pig in a poke because, when they \nbring that bill back on the floor here, we are going to have to vote up \nor down.\n  You won't have the ability to change the bill like you do on every \nother bill that is brought on the floor of Congress. You will not have \nthat ability. Congress will have abdicated its responsibility to \nrepresent the people that sent them here.\n  Free trade can work. Let's have a fair deal for the American worker. \nThat is all I am asking for.\n  If there were a fair deal for the American worker that I could read \nand talk to my constituents about--you know, I have got 727,514 bosses \nback in Massachusetts, and they sent me here to do my job, and I am \ntrying to do that on their behalf. I think that every other Member of \nCongress is trying to do their job as well. We can't do that if TPA \ngoes through. We need to give the American worker a voice, and we can \ndo that today.\n  Let's vote this stuff down. Let's talk to the President. He is a good \nman, wants to create American jobs. Let's have an open debate. It \nshould not be a secret. It should not be a national secret about these \nagreements we are having with multinational corporations. We should not \nbe afraid that the American people might find out what is going on \nhere.\n  We should be proud of what we are doing here. We should want it \nplastered all over the front pages of the newspapers in this country. \nWe should be proud of our work here.\n  I can't be proud of what is going on right now, and so I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it. Vote this down. Let's change this system \nto a transparent system that the American people can be assured that \ntheir Representatives in Congress are doing the right thing.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I really, once again, appreciate the \ngentleman for coming to the floor and speaking directly with you and \nall of his colleagues about the importance of this bill and, really, \nthe problems he has with it.\n  But I would also like to let you know, Mr. Speaker, that the number \none selling car in Korea is an American-made car. We signed a trade \nagreement in 2011 with Korea. The Toyota Camry from Georgetown, \nKentucky, the Toyota made in Georgetown, Kentucky, is the number one \nselling vehicle in Korea starting last year.\n\n  Now, there may not be a lot of them necessarily where the gentleman \nvisited in Korea, but that is a fact; and the gentleman from \nGeorgetown, Kentucky, Andy Barr, who is a Member of this Congress, has \ntalked about this for a long, long time.\n  The trade agreements, when the United States engages with them, we \nend up with surpluses, and it is better for the American worker. The \ntrade agreement jobs pay 30 percent more than the nontrade-associated \njobs in this country; and by virtue of what we are doing we are trying \nto get a trade deal now where Japan would be involved because we do \nwant Japan to open up their marketplaces. But where we have these \nagreements, that is what happens. The American worker wins.\n  So TPA is already the law of the land. The question we have today is \nwhether we are going to include in that package the last parts of this, \nwhich would be TAA, which do give, if there is a difference as a result \nof the trade deals where an industry, where a town, where a group of \npeople were ``harmed,'' then the law would be there for retraining.\n  I think that is the right vote. That is why Speaker Boehner is \nbringing this back, even though, by and large, this concept was turned \ndown by the Democratic Party, from the very top of their organization \nto the bottom. That is why Speaker Boehner understood the right and \nfair thing to do.\n\n[[Page H4662]]\n\n  Senate Majority Leader McConnell said the right thing to do is to \nbring it back; let's see if we can repackage it. Let's see if we can \ntake a little bit of time, measure three times, saw again, see if we \ncan get it right. That is what we are trying to do.\n  Trade Promotion Authority that the gentleman has been speaking of is \nalready the law of the land. The question is will this last piece be a \npart of it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, what we have heard this morning must certainly cause \ngreat confusion in the minds of America. Let me restate what has \nhappened here.\n  The Congress has passed fast-track authority, TPA, for 6 years. It \ngoes beyond this President's term and covers 4 years of another. Why \nthat happened, I am not really clear, but it certainly is something we \nhave given away our right to negotiate trade agreements, which, by the \nway, the Constitution gives us the ability to do.\n  Second, there will be no input. The Congress of the United States \nwill not be writing that trade bill. That is purely in the hands of the \nTrade Representative and the Executive Department of the United States.\n  Our next role, and the only one we have, is to vote up or down on \nwhatever they present us. What a sad day it is.\n  And I want to agree with Mr. Lynch. The very fact of passing this \nbill is an admission and knowing that we are going to lose jobs.\n  My part of the district in western New York is just now starting to \nregain its footing after NAFTA. You have heard me say it a million \ntimes. Eastman Kodak, one of the iconic companies in the country--in \nthe world, actually--went from 62,000 employees down to foreign \nbankruptcy. What we have got, also NAFTA has put us, the losses there, \nas the fifth city that is under the poverty line in the United States.\n  For heaven's sake, it breaks my heart to think that my constituents \nare going to have to be facing this again, because people who have \nvoted for all this don't seem to understand what it is that they have \ndone.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I \nappreciate my colleagues, the gentleman from Massachusetts, the \ngentlewoman from New York, for their engagement today.\n  Mr. Speaker, confirmed again, the number one car, the car of the year \nin Korea in 2013: Toyota Camry, made in Georgetown, Kentucky. I have \nhad 10 people text me trying to give me more information about what a \ngreat opportunity this is for American workers.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is what this bill is about. It is about the jobs \nopportunity and a fair proposal, not just by the administration, not \njust by the House and the Senate but, really, a Republican bill for \njobs. This is a jobs bill, a jobs bill that will allow the American \nworker to have new boundaries, new opportunities to go out in.\n  And let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, I don't travel very much. But I \nwill tell you that I know from the stories that come back, people want \nAmerican-made products. They want American-made, everything from jeans \nall the way to high-tech products. They want American products because \nof the reliability of the American workers, because of the stability of \nAmerica, and we have got a great opportunity with this final piece, \npart of this trade agreement to move it forward.\n  I think 5 years from now we are going to look back and say, Wow, what \ndid we do great? And you can mark it just like they do this year, 2 \nyears ago, looking back to the Toyota Camry, number one in the Korean \nmarket.\n  Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for, I think, just an up-or-down \nvote--it is really simple--to Senate amendment H.R. 1295, the Trade \nPreferences Extension Act. By passing this rule today, we can move on. \nThe House will have an opportunity to consider the bill, and it will \nhead to the President's desk, this package of bills to the President.\n  I urge adoption of the rule and look forward to the debate that will \nfollow on the real substance of the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the resolution.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4662-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4662-H4664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1000\n           RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I have a privileged \nresolution at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. ___\n\n       Whereas on December 20, 1860, South Carolina became the \n     first State to secede from the Union;\n       Whereas on January 9, 1861, Mississippi seceded from the \n     Union, stating in its ``Declaration of Immediate Causes'' \n     that ``[o]ur position is thoroughly identified with the \n     institution of slavery - the greatest material interest of \n     the world.'';\n       Whereas on February 9, 1861, the Confederate States of \n     America was formed with a group of 11 States as a purported \n     sovereign nation and with Jefferson Davis of Mississippi as \n     its president;\n       Whereas on March 11, 1861, the Confederate States of \n     America adopted its own constitution;\n       Whereas on April 12, 1861, the Confederate States of \n     America fired shots upon Fort Sumter in Charleston, South \n     Carolina, effectively beginning the Civil War;\n       Whereas the United States did not recognize the Confederate \n     States of America as a sovereign nation, but rather as a \n     rebel insurrection, and took to military battle to bring the \n     rogue states back into the Union;\n       Whereas on April 9, 1865, General Robert E. Lee surrendered \n     to General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House in \n     Virginia, effectively, ending the Civil War and preserving \n     the Union;\n       Whereas during the Civil War, the Confederate States of \n     America used the Navy Jack, Battle Flag, and other imagery as \n     a symbols of the Confederate armed forces;\n       Whereas since the end of the Civil War, the Navy Jack, \n     Confederate battle flag, and other imagery of the Confederacy \n     have been appropriated by groups as a symbols of hate, \n     terror, intolerance, and as supportive of the institution of \n     slavery;\n       Whereas groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and other white \n     supremacist groups utilize Confederate imagery to frighten, \n     terrorize, and cause harm to groups of people toward whom \n     they have hateful intent, including African Americans, \n     Hispanic Americans, and Jewish Americans;\n       Whereas many State and Federal political leaders, including \n     United States Senators Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker, along \n     with Mississippi House Speaker Philip Gunn and other State \n     leaders, have spoken out and advocated for the removal of the \n     imagery of the Confederacy on Mississippi's state flag;\n       Whereas many Members of Congress, including Speaker John \n     Boehner, support the removal of the Confederate flag from the \n     grounds of South Carolina's capitol;\n       Whereas Speaker John Boehner released a statement on the \n     issue saying, ``I commend Governor Nikki Haley and other \n     South Carolina leaders in their effort to remove the \n     Confederate flag from Statehouse grounds. In his second \n     inaugural address 150 years ago, and a month before his \n     assassination, President Abraham Lincoln ended his speech \n     with these powerful words, which are as meaningful today as \n     when they were spoken on the East Front of the Capitol on \n     March 4, 1865: `With malice toward none, with charity for \n     all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the \n     right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind \n     up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne \n     the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which \n     may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among \n     ourselves and with all nations.' '';\n       Whereas the House of Representatives has several State \n     flags with imagery of the Confederacy throughout its main \n     structures and House office buildings;\n       Whereas it is an uncontroverted fact that symbols of the \n     Confederacy offend and insult many members of the general \n     public who use the hallways of Congress each day;\n       Whereas Congress has never permanently recognized in its \n     hallways the symbols of sovereign nations with whom it has \n     gone to war or rogue entities such as the Confederate States \n     of America;\n       Whereas continuing to display a symbol of hatred, \n     oppression, and insurrection that nearly tore our Union apart \n     and that is known to offend many groups throughout the \n     country would irreparably damage the reputation of this \n     august institution and offend the very dignity of the House \n     of Representatives; and\n\n[[Page H4663]]\n\n       Whereas this impairment of the dignity of the House and its \n     Members constitutes a violation under rule IX of the Rules of \n     the House of Representatives of the One Hundred Fourteenth \n     Congress: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     shall remove any State flag containing any portion of the \n     Confederate battle flag, other than a flag displayed by the \n     office of a Member of the House, from any area within the \n     House wing of the Capitol or any House office building, and \n     shall donate any such flag to the Library of Congress.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The resolution presents a question of \nprivilege.\n\n\n                            Motion to Refer\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER. The Clerk will report the motion.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. McCarthy moves that the resolution be referred to the \n     Committee on House Administration.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California is recognized \nfor 1 hour.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, all time yielded is for the purpose of \ndebate only.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for bringing this resolution to \nthe attention of the House.\n  As I have said many times before, I am a big believer in the \ncommittee process to discuss all issues that come before the floor, \nespecially one of this importance. I think this resolution should be \nreferred to the Committee on House Administration to give other Members \nan opportunity to weigh in.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) \nfor the purpose of debate only.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman \nyielding the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, to someone who has lived his entire life in the State of \nMississippi and has had to endure a symbol that represented bigotry, \nhatred, and everything this country is not, I am convinced that an \neffort to remove this flag from the hallowed Halls of the House of \nRepresentatives is the right thing to do.\n  We all know the history of the South. We know the secessionists' \nmotivations behind the Civil War, and my ancestors were those \nindividuals who were held in bondage against their will.\n  We are a Nation of laws. We should not identify with symbols of \nhatred and bigotry. That flag, those symbols should be put in a museum. \nThey should not be flown under any circumstance where there is freedom \nand dignity in this great institution of ours.\n  I know it is a hard choice for Members to do, but I saw what happened \nin Charleston, South Carolina, last Wednesday. The whole world saw it, \nand they did not like it. This is one step toward getting us healed as \na Nation.\n  I take it personally. I have had churches burned in my district. I \nhave had men and women killed for trying to do the right thing; yet, \nwhen I see people trying to defend that way of life which that flag \nrepresents, this is not who we are as an institution.\n  Because of that, I offer the privileged resolution. I understand \nwhere we are with it, but I have issues with it.\n  I appreciate the gentleman yielding the 2 minutes.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the referral of this resolution to \ncommittee.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nMichigan (Mrs. Miller), the distinguished chair of the Committee on \nHouse Administration.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the majority \nleader for yielding the time.\n  I would just say, Mr. Speaker, to my colleague from Mississippi, I \ncertainly was moved personally just listening to him speak now; and I \nlistened to him last night when he offered his privileged motion.\n  I would say that the Committee on House Administration is looking \nforward to hearing more from Representative Thompson, as well as all of \nthe congressional delegation from the great State of Mississippi, on \nthis resolution. As well, our committee, of course, would want to have \nan opportunity to hear from all of the elected representatives at the \nState level of the great State of Mississippi.\n  We want to say that we sincerely appreciate Representative Thompson \nfor offering his privileged resolution and to assure the gentleman from \nMississippi, Mr. Speaker, that our committee will give this measure \nevery serious consideration and every thoughtful consideration.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the motion to refer.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to refer.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas \nand nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15-\nminute vote on the motion to refer will be followed by 5-minute votes \non adoption of House Resolution 338 and the motion to suspend the rules \non H.R.

Then he moved \nto the cloakroom, where he has been a steady presence ever since.\n  Now, you all know Tim is a good guy and, frankly, quite a character, \nand he wears the worst ties of anybody here.\n  But, Tim, God has blessed you with great success because you are the \nkind of guy who works hard and gives back. So, on behalf of the whole \nHouse, I want to thank you for your long and distinguished service, and \nI wish you and your wife all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4665-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING TIM HARROUN\n\n  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. HOYER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``AGOA Extension and \n     Enhancement Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since its enactment, the African Growth and Opportunity \n     Act has been the centerpiece of trade relations between the \n     United States and sub-Saharan Africa and has enhanced trade, \n     investment, job creation, and democratic institutions \n     throughout Africa.\n       (2) Trade and investment, as facilitated by the African \n     Growth and Opportunity Act, promote economic growth, \n     development, poverty reduction, democracy, the rule of law, \n     and stability in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (3) Trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa \n     has more than tripled since the enactment of the African \n     Growth and Opportunity Act in 2000, and United States direct \n     investment in sub-Saharan Africa has grown almost sixfold.\n       (4) It is in the interest of the United States to engage \n     and compete in emerging markets in sub-Saharan African \n     countries, to boost trade and investment between the United \n     States and sub-Saharan African countries, and to renew and \n     strengthen the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n       (5) The long-term economic security of the United States is \n     enhanced by strong economic and political ties with the \n     fastest-growing economies in the world, many of which are in \n     sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (6) It is a goal of the United States to further integrate \n     sub-Saharan African countries into the global economy, \n     stimulate economic development in Africa, and diversify \n     sources of growth in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (7) To that end, implementation of the Agreement on Trade \n     Facilitation of the World Trade Organization would strengthen \n     regional integration efforts in sub-Saharan Africa and \n     contribute to economic growth in the region.\n       (8) The elimination of barriers to trade and investment in \n     sub-Saharan Africa, including high tariffs, forced \n     localization requirements, restrictions on investment, and \n     customs barriers, will create opportunities for workers, \n     businesses, farmers, and ranchers in the United States and \n     sub-Saharan African countries.\n       (9) The elimination of such barriers will improve \n     utilization of the African Growth and Opportunity Act and \n     strengthen regional and global integration, accelerate \n     economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, and enhance the trade \n     relationship between the United States and sub-Saharan \n     Africa.\n\n     SEC. 103.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material to H.R. 1295, the Trade \nPreferences Extension Act of 2015, as amended, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Washington (Mr. Reichert), a senior member \nof the Committee on Ways and Means, the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nSelect Revenue Measures, who is the author of the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance bill.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and \nthank him for his leadership on this series of trade bills that we have \nbeen considering for the last few weeks.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the preferences bill before \nus. This bipartisan legislation renews both the Generalized System of \nPreferences and the African Growth and Opportunity Act. GSP is an \nimportant program, both to Washington State businesses and promoting \neconomic development across the globe.\n  Similarly, the renewal of AGOA is critical to further strengthening \nour ties with Africa. The strong bipartisan vote this legislation \nreceived weeks ago made clear there is strong support for these \nprograms in Congress and among the American people.\n  Also included in this legislation is a renewal of Trade Adjustment \nAssistance, and I am proud, as Mr. Ryan said, to sponsor the House \nlegislation to renew TAA because there is a need for this program. I \nbelieve increased trade is good for all Americans. It creates jobs and \nit makes America stronger. But I also understand that as we create jobs \nand trade, and our jobs change over the next few years, along the way \nsome workers may need extra assistance and additional training. That is \nwhy TAA is so important.\n  Now, we have made great strides this past week by sending TPA to the \nPresident's desk; and I am also proud that TPA was attached to another \nbill, which happened to be a labor bill, TSP, which created a fair \napplication of retirement benefits for Federal public safety officers. \nNow, Mr. Speaker, we must move forward, pass TAA and AGOA today, \nGeneral System of Preferences.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the debate these last weeks and months has been about \nhow do we get a strong and effective trade policy and trade agreement. \nThat debate only intensifies now. Supporters of trade promotion \nauthority, TPA, thought vague negotiating objectives and a passive role \nfor Congress in the process were the way to go, in part because many on \nthe majority side feel that more trade is essentially better, no matter \nits terms or conditions.\n  The opponents of TPA wanted to ensure that TPP negotiations were on \nthe right track, with no blank check to USTR, when there are so many \noutstanding areas where we are not satisfied with the status of \nnegotiations or where we are uncertain of their outcome. Now we can \nfocus like a laser beam on those issues. The argument about the process \nof TPA is now behind us and the challenge of the substance of TPP smack \nin front of us.\n  Automatic embrace of centuries-old doctrines does not meet the \nchallenges of intensifying globalization, so we will continue to shine \na bright light on the critical issues, like market access, state-owned \nenterprises, intellectual property and access to medicines, worker \nrights, environment, currency manipulation, and investment provisions \nthat could put at risk domestic regulations. Our calls for improvements \nto the negotiations will only grow louder.\n  In order for TPP to gain the support of the American people, it will \nneed to gain the votes of a much broader coalition of Members of \nCongress than voted for TPA. The issue is not protrade versus \nantitrade, but whether we shape trade agreements to spread the benefits \nbroadly, including the middle class of Americans.\n  Take, for example, the two trade bills before us today: the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act and our trade preferences programs. House \nDemocrats have been key architects of these programs. For example, in \nthe 1990s, our colleagues Charlie Rangel and Jim McDermott, working \nwith Phil Crane, laid the foundation for the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act of 2000.\n  These programs are designed to help shape trade, to ensure that its \nbenefits are more broadly based. We can see that in AGOA, stronger \nlabor and other eligibility criteria and the inclusion of textile and \napparel products can give us additional leverage to help raise living \nstandards.\n  The same is doubly true with the Haiti program. While there is much \nwork to be done in Haiti, one critical element of our program, \ninspections of factories by the independent group Better Work, is \nresulting in improved compliance with Haitian labor laws and better \nconditions for workers there.\n  Finally, this bill includes a reauthorization of Trade Adjustment \nAssistance. I am an ardent supporter of TAA and introduced a bill \nearlier this year with Adam Smith to reauthorize it. I support H.R. \n1295. To be sure, this TAA is not perfect. It falls short of the high \nwater mark we established for the program in 2009.\n  At a time when trade is expanding and is expected to expand even \nfurther with new trade agreements, we should be ensuring adequate \nfunding for workers who lose their jobs as a result of trade and are \ntransitioning to new jobs, not cutting the program. But we need to \nrestore the program also for service workers and for trade with all \ncountries, improvements that were wrongly allowed to lapse at the end \nof 2013, and we need to extend the entire program for the future.\n  TPA, TPP, TAA, it might seem like a word scramble, but going forward, \nTPP, to the American people, will be about jobs and wages. They expect \nus to work hard to get it right as it is being negotiated, not simply \nleaving their elected officials with a ``yes'' or a ``no'' vote after \nTPP is done. We have a lot of work to do, and there is no ducking these \nissues now.\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, people on both sides of the aisle have been working for \nyears to promote American trade. We took big steps when we passed TPA \nlast week and sent it to the President yesterday. Passing TPA, I \nbelieve, is an achievement that this Congress should be very proud of. \nIt is going to empower Congress in trade negotiations. It will help \nAmerica get the best possible trade agreements for American workers, \nand it will tell the world that the America that they knew and the \nAmerica that they know is an America that is still willing to lead.\n  I especially want to thank my colleagues in the House, like \nCongressman\n\n[[Page H4690]]\n\nRon Kind and Congressman Earl Blumenauer, for their leadership on this \nissue. I also want to thank our friends in the Senate, like Senators \nHatch and Wyden. But to pass TPA, we needed a little bit of trust. We \npromised our Democratic friends, if they stay with us on TPA, that we \nwill follow through with this bill that is before us today, and so we \nare here today to keep our word.\n  There are three parts to this bill, all three of which have \nbipartisan support. First, we reauthorize the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Act, which is in keeping with the agreements that we have \nmade. This program helps workers whose jobs have moved elsewhere to \nfind new opportunities through job training. Traditionally, we have \nalways authorized TPA and TAA, and that is what we are doing here. We \nhave always authorized them together, and that is effectively what we \nare doing here. We have made some improvements to the program.\n  Second, we reauthorize a number of trade preferences for developing \ncountries. This bill reauthorizes a number of programs that have broad \nbipartisan support: AGOA, GSP, and Haiti Hope. These programs lower \ntrade barriers between our country and these developing countries. It \nis the best example of trade not aid that you can come up with. They \ngrow our trading ties, because when we grow, they grow. This is good \npolicy that has been well respected and supported by both sides of the \naisle. Therefore, we have every incentive to get this done.\n  Third, we make sure that our companies can use our trade remedy laws \nto address unfair trade practices. This is something that we have \nworked with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, our colleagues \nfrom steel country and the House Steel Caucus, to make sure that our \ntrade laws are actually enforced and, when our trade laws are not being \nfollowed, when they are being abused, that we have quick remedies to \nthese situations. All of this legislation will strengthen the American \neconomy. It will strengthen America's credibility on the world stage, \nand it will strengthen American leadership.\n  With that, I urge its passage.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I now yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nRangel), who was an inspiration for AGOA and a major author.\n  (Mr. RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, this is a good day for America, and it is a \ngood day for us in the House. There are so many people to thank for \nmaking this day possible, not just for the people in developing \ncountries in Africa, but, more importantly, for Americans who \nrecognize, unless we can raise the level of survival in other \ncountries, our country is not fulfilling its moral and economic \nobligations.\n  I want to give a special thanks to the chairman of the Committee on \nWays and Means. It is kind of rough listening to him talking about TPP, \nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership, because he knows and I know that, if we \nwanted each bill passed, we would be concerned not by what the \nmultinationals want, but we would be concerned about the middle class. \nThe middle class you can help by having infrastructure, you can help by \nhaving an education, all the things that are not Democratic issues. On \nthis particular AGOA bill, he gave assurances that he thought that this \nstanding alone did not have to get involved in the controversy that \npeople had over the more controversial bill. Like he said, he made his \ncommitment. He kept his commitment. It is things like this that should \nhave younger Members realizing Congress can do it, we can work \ntogether, and I thank him publicly for that.\n  You will be hearing more from other Members in terms of the \ninvolvement that they have had. Certainly, Mr. Levin from the very, \nvery beginning working with Jim McDermott, working with Republicans, \ngave birth to this bill 10 years ago, and his guidance and support and \nthe Ways and Means members have given another year.\n  Karen Bass, she is something special. She came to us after serving as \nCalifornia speaker. She grabbed Africa, foster care, and those types of \nissues that people have left behind, but she managed to make certain \nthat everyone knows that this country cares, and cares deeply.\n  It is ironic that as we talk about Africa, we are talking about \nHaiti, we are talking about developing countries, and we also are \ntalking about those workers who, through no fault of their own and \nbecause of international and national decisions, have lost their \nopportunity to have self-esteem and to have a job.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  These are issues that we have touched on in this bill. These are \nissues that go nowhere in terms of how far America has to go in order \nto be fair and equal and allow us to include real wages, real \neducation, and real opportunity in the pursuit of happiness.\n  But since we are trying and since there is nothing in this bill that \ndoesn't point us in the right direction, especially on the same day \nthat the United States Supreme Court has recognized that compassion is \nnot restricted to just those who can afford insurance on their own, I \njust want to thank the leadership in this House, both Republican and \nDemocrats, for the great work that allows me to be a proud Member of \nthis House.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 2 minutes \nto the gentleman Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan), a distinguished Member of \nthe Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. MEEHAN. I thank the chairman for his leadership in bringing the \nbipartisan solution to the trade promotion authority.\n  I stand right now in support of the Trade Preferences Extension Act, \nwhich is before us at the moment, and encourage my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to join in supporting this.\n  I speak first about Trade Adjustment Assistance, a program I have \nseen in my own district, where I have watched for workers, when it can \nbe demonstrated that they have had their jobs impacted because of \nforeign implications, there is a support network in place.\n  I have seen the value of that program and believe that it is \nimportant that we keep the tradition of TAA, but we also need to point \nout that there have been significant improvements in this program.\n  There is streamlining. Some of the underperforming programs were not \nreauthorized. There is accountability. There will now be performance \ngoals for TAA that are aligned with other job training programs.\n  Consolidation is a third part. It is a process in which we will \npromote direct services for participants over administrative spending. \nThese are important and critical improvements to a program that already \nhas a history.\n  I just want to close my comments. There is a very important provision \nin the Trade Preferences Extension Act dealing with improving \nantidumping and countervailing duty laws.\n  As an attorney, I appreciate the importance of creating an accurate \nrecord. This allows us to do this in a vitally important area, in the \nbattle against the dumping that is being done that are affecting \nAmerican jobs at home.\n  First and most important, it will allow the Department of Commerce to \nhave the ability to create an accurate record. When, in fact, what you \nhave is a foreign party that fails to cooperate with the agency's \nrequest, they will be able to impute the information that is necessary \nto make that case.\n  In addition, they will be empowered to be able to disregard prices or \ncosts of inputs that foreign producers purchase if the Department of \nCommerce has reason to believe or suspects that the inputs in question \nhave been subsidized or dumped.\n  Once again, it creates an accurate record.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. MEEHAN. I thank the gentleman.\n  Because I think this is such a critically important issue to be able \nto create the kind of record--and it gives the Department of Commerce \nthe kind of discretion to be able to look at the facts and to take \nrecalcitrant countries and hold them accountable by creating what is \naccurate in the form of the case that we can make to assure that \nworkers here at home are being protected.\n  These are important and valuable assets in the ability for us to \ncontinue to\n\n[[Page H4691]]\n\nprotect American jobs. It is for those reasons that I strongly \nencourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the Trade \nPreferences Extension Act of 2015.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer), another distinguished member of our committee.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy.\n  I rise in support of the effort today, and I would first acknowledge \nwhat my friend, the chairman of the committee, said a moment ago.\n  At times, trust is in short supply in this institution for a whole \nhost of reasons, but we were given ironclad assurances from the \nSpeaker, from the President, from the chairman, from Senator Wyden, \nSenator Hatch, and Leader McConnell that TAA would come back to this \nfloor to be voted on. I think it is important that that has in fact \noccurred.\n  To adapt, respond, and grow a 21st century workforce, we need Trade \nAdjustment Assistance. What we have before us is an improvement over \ncurrent law. It is not as good as what we had in 2009. I hope that we \nwill be able to build on this and move forward. This program has helped \nmore than 100,000 Americans, including 3,000 of my fellow Oregonians \nwho received job training and financial support.\n  There will continue to be winners and losers in the global economy, \nwhether we have trade agreements with countries or not, like with \npressures from China. It is important that we provide this for our \nworkers. With our vote today, we do so.\n  I lend my voice saluting Chairman Rangel for the work that he has \ndone on AGOA. Having this package before us, including new economic \nopportunities for growing the economies of Africa, Haiti, and other \nplaces around the world is critically important. The 10-year extension \nis an example of how trade can improve these critical living standards.\n  Finally, I have to acknowledge one little parochial interest in this \nbipartisan provision I worked on with Mr. Reichert that creates jobs in \nthe Northwest and helps all outdoor enthusiasts.\n  Right now, innovative footwear faces an unreasonable reality coming \nto our borders. Two identical-looking running shoes are imported. One \nmust pay a significantly higher tariff for a single reason: they have a \nwaterproof liner.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Coming from the Pacific Northwest, waterproof \nmatters. To be able to end this outmoded tariff code charging extremely \nhigh tariffs for no reason at all, I think, is an important step \nforward.\n  I look forward to continuing work to fine-tune the tariff regimen \nthat we have, but this is an important one for the people that I \nrepresent in the Northwest. I appreciate working with Mr. Reichert to \nbe able to get this one across the finish line.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi), the chairman of the Trade \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, this is a good day for America.\n  As the previous speaker just said, globalization occurs with or \nwithout America engaging in the world. It is important for America to \nengage in the world, to write the rules of the global balance economy; \nbut whether or not we do or we don't, there will be winners and losers \nbecause of globalization.\n  This bill is called the preferences bill, but it is more than just \nabout preferences. It is about America's leadership in Africa. It is \nabout America's leadership in Haiti. It is about America's leadership \nat home in providing trade assistance for those workers who did lose \ntheir job because of globalization.\n  My dad was one of them. Long before America engaged in a bilateral \ntrade agreement, my dad lost his job as a steelworker. There are \nimportant provisions in this bill written by Chairman Ryan that will \nhelp the steel industry. That is really important. My dad was in that \nindustry. He lost his job of 25 years. He benefited from trade \nassistance.\n  This is important for American workers. This is also important for \nthose workers who lost their job through no fault of their own and who \nlost their health care. The health coverage tax credit is renewed in \nthis bill.\n  This bill almost wasn't, quite frankly. There was a lot of rhetoric \non the floor of this House and the floor of the other House about the \nword of our chairman and the word of our Speaker and about how this \nwouldn't come up and we can't trust them.\n  Well, let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, our chairman's word has \nbeen gold from day one in this process. Every commitment he has made \nhas come through. Through this process, every commitment our Speaker \nhas made has come to be.\n  We wouldn't be on the floor today debating this bill and approving \nthis bill in a little while if it weren't for the leadership of \nChairman Ryan and the leadership of Speaker Boehner. They both deserve \nour thanks.\n  Also, the chairman has put together a great staff at the Ways and \nMeans Committee. They should be thanked for their yeoman's work in this \nprocess, which has been very difficult but very bipartisan and very \nbicameral.\n  Americans want this place to work. Americans want Congress to work \ntogether for America's benefit. America's leadership in the world today \nis a little bit stronger. The light of America is shining a little bit \nbrighter because of the work that this Congress has done on this bill \nand the other bills, including the customs bill that this Congress has \nput together and will be sending to the President's desk shortly.\n  America is going to lead in the global economy because of what we \nhave done today. Americans should be proud that Congress is working \nagain.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Kind), another distinguished member of our committee.\n  Mr. KIND. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this trade preferences bill \nand the Trade Adjustment Assistance legislation that is before us \ntoday.\n  As the previous speaker pointed out, for us to be in this situation \ndid require a little leap of faith. We weren't sure how we were going \nto be able to get back after the procedural snafu earlier to have a \nchance to reconsider Trade Adjustment Assistance, but I give credit, \nand I thank the leadership on both sides of the aisle, especially my \ngood friend and colleague on the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Ryan \nfrom Wisconsin; the Speaker; and Senator McConnell.\n  They promised, as we did move forward trying to give the President \ntrade promotion authority, that they wouldn't pull any punches, that \nthey would allow Trade Adjustment Assistance to come back for \nconsideration, and that is exactly what is happening today.\n  This has not been an easy process, but this week, the President will \nget trade promotion authority on his desk so this administration can go \nforward and try to negotiate the best agreement in the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership--and even with our European allies--that we can obtain in \norder to elevate standards and begin to level the playing field so that \nour workers, our farmers, our businesses have a better chance of \ncompeting in that global environment, especially the fastest growing \nregion in the Pacific Rim right now. That is what TPP is all about.\n  It is also important to recognize the significant work done with the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act. That is all about our relationship \nwith the countries in Africa and Haiti and where we go here in the 21st \ncentury together. It is important that we get this accomplished today, \nalong with the Trade Adjustment Assistance bill.\n  That is the help we are able to provide displaced workers who are \nimpacted by globalization the job training and education funds so they \ncan reintegrate as quickly as possible in the economy and be full \nparticipants of this 21st century global economy.\n  That would not have happened if the political stars had not aligned. \nThere are areas of common agreement here in this country, as \nrepresented in this Congress. Today is proof of that, being able to \nmove forward on a trade agenda that is important for U.S. global \nleadership, important for our workers, growing the economy and our \ncompetitiveness as a Nation.\n\n[[Page H4692]]\n\n  Again, I commend the leadership shown on both sides of the aisle. We \nare looking forward to more opportunity to work together in the future. \nI encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  I add my thanks, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Tiberi left, but he did a lot of \nwork on this legislation. He did yeoman's work on it.\n  I just want to echo the sentiment that has been said here, which is \npassing these very challenging bills, doing a number of bills, did \nrequire a lot of trust between the two parties, which we have not seen \na lot of lately.\n  I am just very pleased to be a part of this dynamic where we have \ngiven each other our words, we have kept our words, and therefore, we \nare getting this done. As a result of that, I believe that the country \nis far better off. This policy is good for America, and it restores our \nleadership in the world.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pascrell), another distinguished member of our committee.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I have heard from both sides of the aisle \nthe term ``winners and losers.''\n  Our workers who are laid off because of the deals that have been put \nbefore this Congress in the last 15 years are not losers. They are the \nmost productive workers in the world. How dare you call them losers.\n  We are all patting each other on the back here. We are talking about \na piece of legislation that is like putting the cart before the horse.\n  We want to prevent people from being laid off--engineers, laborers, \ntechnicians. Our trade deals have been a joke. Not one person has come \nto this floor to explain to us--and I know that is not the bill we are \ntalking about, that has already been deep-sixed in its past--not one \nperson has come to the floor and told us how these jobs are going to be \ncreated through trade.\n  We are not antitrade. What we want is fair trade deals. How dare you \ncall our workers losers.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is reminded to direct his \nremarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I say that through you to them.\n  All we have been hearing over the past few months is that we need to \ngrant the President fast-track authority so we can finalize the Trans-\nPacific Partnership because it will be good for American workers; and \nyet here we are today, voting on a package to prepare for the opposite: \nthe loss of American jobs because of a trade deal that doesn't put \nAmerican workers first.\n  I could support the Trade Adjustment Assistance. You need to help \nthose people who are going to be laid off because of these trade deals \nthat are so great so that they kept their jobs or some other jobs were \ncreated. Where are those jobs?\n  If American workers are going to have the rug pulled out from under \nthem because of trade deals, something should be there to break their \nfall. The sad reality is that we need TAA. And even the sadder reality \nis that, despite the great need, this TAA bill before us today is \ninadequate.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. The trade adjustment bill we are voting on today \ncontains a number of flaws. The TAA has been used as a bargaining chip \nto push the TPA over the finish line. I would prefer that we didn't \nneed a TAA at all. Trade Adjustment Assistance is not preferable to a \njob.\n  Secondly, the bill cuts funding for the worker from $575 to $450 \nmillion per year. You got your pound of flesh. At a time when trade is \nexpanding, this bill slashes funding for worker training by 20 percent.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen), a distinguished member of the \nWays and Means Committee and a member of the Trade Subcommittee, in an \neffort to try and restore the civil dialogue and bipartisan dialogue we \nhave been having.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for \nhis leadership in bringing forward some additional trade legislation \ntoday that is very, very important.\n  I am going to rise in support of H.R. 1295, the Trade Preferences \nExtension Act, for a couple of key reasons, because there are some key, \nimportant provisions that accomplish some very critical goals.\n  First, it extends those vital trade preferences with both Africa, \nthrough the African Growth and Opportunity Act, as well as Haiti. And \nthese investments now, these preference programs, provide vital \nopportunities for American investment, for U.S. investment, long-term \ninvestment. These countries are asking for this investment for the long \nterm.\n  It helps the African workers, it helps Haitian workers and businesses \nas they establish themselves as developing countries to making sure \nthey are going to be set for the 21st century global economy.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, this is more about establishing soft power, \nstrategic alliances, and that is smart power.\n  Secondly, the legislation renews the Generalized System of \nPreferences program. Now, this is another very important program that \nreduces tariffs and, therefore, it reduces prices. It helps consumers \nhere in the United States each and every day and the amount of product \nthat they consume.\n  Importantly, Mr. Speaker, the bill authorizes also the USTR to \ndesignate certain travel goods, including purses, briefcases, attache \ncases, and backpacks, to be eligible under this GSP program, expanding \nnew production opportunities for U.S. businesses. This is a provision \nthat I personally have long supported.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think what you are seeing over the last few days is \nthe trade agenda moving forward on a very bipartisan basis. Every \nPresident since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, regardless of their \npolitical background and their party background, has understood and \nengaged the world with the United States leading in trade.\n  That tradition is continuing now with this Congress, with this \nPresident. We want to see it through. We want to see more opportunity \nfor enhanced trade, because more trade means more jobs and higher-\npaying jobs for our American workers, especially in manufacturing right \nhere at home.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing this important bill to \nthe floor. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lee).\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank our ranking member for yielding \nand for your very critical and tremendous leadership on these issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a strong supporter of this African Growth and \nOpportunity Act, let me first say that I am extremely disappointed that \nAGOA was used as a bargaining chip to pass the unrelated Trade \nAdjustment Assistance package. AGOA has been a longtime cornerstone of \nthe U.S.-Africa relationship.\n  And I just have to thank Congressman Rangel and Congresswoman Bass \nand members of the Congressional Black Caucus who have done everything \nthey could do, everything possible to keep AGOA a clean bill, without \nbeing loaded with non-Africa trade-related issues.\n  Yet, in spite of these efforts, we are faced with a bill, really, \nthat looks like a Christmas tree. But I will reluctantly vote for this \nbecause Africa deserves better. It deserves not to be caught up in the \ngimmicks of this body. And we will continue to fight for American jobs, \nAmerican workers, and a TPP that creates jobs in America, economic \ngrowth in America, and preserves jobs in America. So this is not over.\n  On top of the very cynical way that these trade bills have been \nbrought to the floor, the TAA included in this bill is inadequately \nfunded and fails to protect workers who will ultimately be displaced by \nmassive trade agreements like the TPP--and that will happen.\n  It is unfortunate that we have to pass a TAA to protect workers from \njob losses that we know will exist which we are told won't exist. So at \nleast we need to, sooner or later, come back with a TAA that is fully \nfunded, at least to the tune of $575 million. We have got to do that.\n\n[[Page H4693]]\n\n  This TAA fails to cover all workers who will adversely be affected by \nTPP, and it even excludes public sector employees from eligibility. \nThis is simply wrong. We must do better.\n  It is time for us to get real and stop putting American workers at \nrisk with trade deals like TPP. We need an adequate trade assistance \nbill and a trade policy that protects and creates American jobs and \neconomic growth in America.\n  But, quite frankly, we have to have trade policies that create \nmarkets also for African goods, jobs in Africa.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 15 seconds.\n  Ms. LEE. Also jobs in Africa; healthcare issues like HIV and AIDS; \ndevelopment assistance, such as the Millennium Challenge Account.\n\n  So we can't neglect Africa, and we can't allow the continent of \nAfrica to be used as a gimmick in this overall process, which I think \nwas very, very poor and reflects poorly on this body.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, let me yield myself 1 minute to \ntry and clarify some of what was just mentioned.\n  The reason we are here with this bill and the reason TAA is attached \nto the AGOA bill is because of the dilatory tactics from the minority a \ncouple of weeks ago.\n  In keeping with our word, we brought this Trade Preferences bill \nthrough the House on its own stand-alone. And so the reason this is \nhappening is not because of the majority, but because of what the \nminority did with respect to the TAA bill. So I just want to be very \nclear, that is why we are where we are.\n  Having said all of that, we are still keeping our agreement going \nthat these bills are going through.\n  The second point I would like to make is TPP does not exist yet. \nThere is no Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. There are talks. \nThere have been talks for years, and those talks are still ongoing. But \nwe do not have a trade agreement yet. That was why we needed to pass \nTPA, so that we can get a trade agreement like TPP.\n  So I would just encourage all Members not to oppose something they \nhave not yet seen, not to prejudge an agreement that does not yet \nexist.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 1 \nminute.\n  It is very important that we recognize 95 percent of the world's \nconsumers. They don't live in this country. They live in other \ncountries. And if we want good jobs that pay more, we need to be able \nto make and grow things in America and sell them overseas into other \nmarkets, other countries.\n  Since TPA last expired in 2007, there have been 100 trade agreements \nnegotiated and enacted around the world where we were a party to zero, \nnone of them. What that means is other countries are lowering the trade \nbarriers between themselves, and we, America, by not being a part of \nthis, have much higher barriers. So when we want to make something and \nsell it overseas, it is a lot more expensive for them to buy our \nproducts than buying our competitors' products.\n  There were 48 trade agreements enacted in Asia since 2000 alone. We \nwere a party to two of them.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, giving myself an additional 30 \nseconds, we were a party to two of those agreements and, as a result, \nour share of trade going into Asia, meaning exports going there from \nour country, went down 42 percent.\n  One in five jobs is tied to trade. These jobs pay more. This is about \njobs.\n  So I would simply encourage our Members: Don't take a position on \nsomething that doesn't exist yet. Read. See with your own eyes, then \nform an opinion. But I would argue, it is not in your constituents' \ninterest to simply say what you are for or against before you even see \nwhat it is.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, could I ask for the balance of our time?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 12\\1/4\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. Speaker, the reason for the vote on TAA some days ago was because \nit was used as a bargaining chip to get votes for TPA. That is what the \nvote on TAA was all about.\n  Secondly, I just want to observe, it is said don't judge TPP in \nopposition before you see it. The problem is so many people are judging \nin favor of it while it is still being negotiated and labeling it for a \ncertain kind of an agreement while it is still being negotiated.\n  So, for those who criticize those who are opposed before they see it, \nI would like to say to them, what is good for the goose is good for the \ngander. Don't embrace it so fully and so passionately before it is \ncompleted, and it is far from being completed.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \nConnolly).\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend from \nMichigan, and I take his word seriously. I think it is good counsel for \nboth sides. Let's wait and see what the fine print has to say before we \ndraw our lines in support or opposition. I take those words to heart.\n  I must say, I echo the words of Chairman Ryan. We are here today not \nunder some cynical ploy to use the Africa bill to pass Trade Adjustment \nAssistance, rather, we are here to save Trade Adjustment Assistance \nbecause some decided it was worth sacrificing to get at Trade Promotion \nAuthority. That was their political judgment, and they are entitled to \nit. But they are not entitled to then accuse those of us trying to save \nthat program of cynicism. That is the least thing happening today.\n  We are all about trying to keep workers who might be displaced, who \nwill be displaced from globalization and, yes, maybe trade, get some \ntraining, get some help. That is what this program has done. It is a \ndemocratic program, and Chairman Ryan and Speaker Boehner have kept \ntheir word.\n  That is what today's vote is also about: redeeming a pledge made to \nus that we would have a second bite at this apple. And thank God we do, \nbecause American workers are going to benefit from it.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Ellison), who is so active on these issues.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chairman, ranking member, I will submit \nfor the Record a letter from the President of the AFL-CIO, Mr. Richard \nTrumka.\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: We are in the final stretch of a long \n     and contentious battle over the congressional grant of trade \n     negotiating authority to the President. Congress has now \n     approved fast track authority, which will give the executive \n     branch the opportunity to negotiate--in secret--as many trade \n     agreements as it can through at least June 30, 2018 (and \n     likely through 2021). Fast track 2015 fails to hold the \n     executive branch accountable for achieving negotiating \n     objectives, addressing the U.S. trade imbalance, or ensuring \n     that trade deals adequately protect good jobs, workers \n     rights, environmental protections, access to affordable \n     medicines, food safety, and other vital protections for \n     working families.\n       This week, Trade Adjustment Assistance (H.R. 1295 or TAA) \n     will come before the House of Representatives. Unfortunately, \n     and against the advice of many members of Congress, TAA has \n     been packaged with an important and necessary bill to provide \n     trade preferences to sub-Saharan African countries--the \n     African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The AFL-CIO has \n     long supported renewal of AGOA, and we will continue to work \n     closely with our African trade union brothers and sisters to \n     ensure that AGOA supports workers' rights and sustainable \n     development.\n       The AFL-CIO has been clear that this TAA bill is \n     inadequately funded and fails to take into account job \n     disruptions from massive pending trade agreements like the \n     Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and others that may be \n     negotiated over the course of the next six years. TAA ought \n     to include a minimum funding level of $575 million and ensure \n     that public sector workers are eligible. Moreover, the \n     funding mechanism for TAA remains highly problematic: despite \n     a fix to one ``pay-for,'' partial funding for TAA is achieved \n     in this bill by cutting $250 million from Medicare payments \n     to hospital kidney dialysis centers. These unrelated program\n\n[[Page H4694]]\n\n     cuts are unwarranted and compromise the integrity of the \n     program. Furthermore, this violates the principle that \n     Medicare savings should be plowed back into Medicare.\n       The sequencing and cynical packaging of votes on Trade \n     Promotion Authority (TPA), TAA, and the Customs Enforcement \n     bill have been designed to obfuscate clear policy issues and \n     force members of Congress to make awkward and conflicting \n     votes with inadequate information.\n       Scheduling a fast track vote without assurance that an \n     adequately funded TAA would ever be enacted or that important \n     trade enforcement measures would be included compounds the \n     existing failures of U.S. trade policy to promote the \n     interests of working families. There is significant \n     uncertainty about what version of the Customs bill might \n     eventually emerge from the conference process, or whether any \n     TAA or Customs bill will eventually reach the President's \n     desk at all.\n       The changes made to the Customs bill in the House of \n     Representatives eviscerated key enforcement, currency and \n     human rights provisions, while inserting ideologically \n     motivated and counter-productive negotiating objectives with \n     respect to climate change and immigrant rights. Every member \n     of Congress who voted for TPA essentially endorsed this \n     process and signaled a willingness to accept these \n     problematic changes to the fast track objectives, as well as \n     a willingness to enact new job-killing trade agreements \n     without any guarantee that displaced workers will receive \n     adequate training and support.\n       We deplore the procedural machinations used by the \n     Republican congressional leadership and endorsed by the White \n     House to advance a flawed package of trade bills, absent any \n     clarity or certainty about the final outcomes.\n       We cannot endorse the current TAA legislation, given its \n     shortcomings. We would oppose TAA in a heartbeat if by doing \n     so we could be assured that we could slow or stop a flawed \n     trade agenda from moving forward, and we are confident that \n     we would have the votes to defeat it. However, in light of \n     the unfortunate passage of TPA by the House and the Senate, \n     we recognize that many members will be reluctant to imperil \n     the passage of AGOA and may reasonably lack confidence that \n     the Republican leadership will give them a chance to vote for \n     an improved TAA bill.\n       Despite President Obama's repeated assurances that he would \n     not sign TPA without TAA, this no longer seems to be the \n     case. The President has made clear that his only priority in \n     the trade agenda is passage of TPA--regardless of what \n     happens with respect to currency, trade enforcement, \n     trafficking in persons, immigration policy or climate \n     change--let alone assistance to dislocated workers. We do not \n     have confidence that the White House would hold out for a \n     stronger TAA bill if this one were to fail. We therefore urge \n     you to vote your conscience, and we will respect your \n     decision, whatever it may be.\n       We will redouble our efforts to shape and improve U.S. \n     trade policy. We will vigorously oppose TPP if it continues \n     on its current course--with problematic provisions on \n     investor-state-dispute settlement, procurement and \n     intellectual property rights; without any protections against \n     currency manipulation; with weak rules of origin; and with \n     inadequate protections for workers' and human rights and the \n     environment. We will continue to work closely with Congress \n     and with our allies in the environmental, consumer, human \n     rights, family farm, faith, development, domestic business, \n     immigrants', women's and Internet privacy rights \n     organizations--among many others--to educate and mobilize our \n     members and the American public about what a good trade \n     policy ought to be and why this one falls short.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard L. Trumka,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I submit this letter from Mr. Trumka \nbecause I think, perhaps more than anybody else in this whole country, \nhe is in touch with workers and what they need; and labor has been a \nsolid wall of opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Trade \nPromotion Authority.\n  The fact is, when people said we don't know what it is and it is an \nunknown, that is not true. We have, as Members, been able to go and \nread some of it. Pieces of it have been leaked. And everything I have \nseen so far has been incredibly disappointing and represents a real \nthreat to the interests of working people, which Mr. Trumka is an \nexpert on.\n  I mean, I think it is really odd that we think the person who is \nexpert at representing American workers knows so little and workers in \ngeneral know so little about what is good for them. Maybe we should \nlisten to the people who have borne the brunt of these trade bills in \nthis country, from NAFTA all the way down.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  Mr. ELLISON. The fact is, yeah, we do need Trade Adjustment \nAssistance.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. ELLISON. If this Trans-Pacific Partnership is anything like the \ntrade bills we have seen so far, we are going to need a way bigger \nTrade Adjustment Assistance than this represents.\n  Trade Adjustment Assistance is a good thing, but it is an admission \nthat we are going to have displaced workers. We are saying people will \nbe hurt by this trade bill, and so we are going to try to mitigate some \nof the harm.\n  The billions and billions of dollars that will be made by \ntransnational corporations from the Trans-Pacific Partnership--well, \nlet me tell you, we ought to be doing a whole lot more than the meager \namount of Trade Adjustment Assistance that is captured in this bill.\n  I will tell you this, the interests of the American people are what \nwe should be thinking about. I have not heard a word about how this is \ngoing to help raise workers' wages. In fact, there is every reason to \nbelieve that this will put downward pressure on American workers at a \ntime when we have seen historic income inequality and stagnation of \nworker pay.\n  America needs to be the land of opportunity, not the land of economic \nstagnation caused by trade bills like the one I am afraid we are about \nto talk about. I am moving on the TPP, and we will fight that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. \nBass), who has made the AGOA such an important part of her life here.\n  Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 1295, the Trade \nPreferences Extension Act of 2015, which includes the reauthorization \nof the African Growth and Opportunity Act, or AGOA.\n  I want to thank Chairman Ryan, who made a commitment at the beginning \nof the year that we would follow through and we would make sure that \nAGOA was on the President's desk. I want to thank Ranking Member Levin; \nChairman Tiberi; and a giant in this House and one of the original \nauthors of AGOA and a mentor to me and many, many others in this house, \nMr. Charlie Rangel, for their leadership on AGOA.\n  I want to thank members of the African Diplomatic Corps, African \nheads of state, the diaspora, and members of the African civil society \nfor their tireless work on this legislation.\n  It has been almost a year since President Obama brought together \nheads of state from 50 African nations for the historic U.S.-Africa \nleaders summit last August. This summit was the largest event any \nAmerican President had held with African heads of state, and it was \ncritical in creating the momentum and support that AGOA now enjoys.\n  Over the next 10 years, Africa will become an even more important \npart of the world economy with a large youthful population that is \nincreasingly university educated, tech savvy, and entrepreneurial. \nWithout question, it is in the interest of the United States and the \ncountries of Africa that we work toward a stronger and mutually \nbeneficial economic relationship that will stand the test of time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nCuellar).\n  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, 95 percent of all consumers are outside the \nUnited States. When you look at who exports and who is involved in \ninternational trade, over 80 percent of the companies that do this are \nsmall- and medium-sized companies. In fact, in the State of Texas, 93 \npercent of all the companies that export are small- and medium-sized \ncompanies.\n  One point that we understand, if we want to make sure that labor and \nenvironmental standards are higher in those countries that we want to \ndeal with, the only way we can do that is by engaging, by talking, and \nby having a conversation; and that is why these trade agreements are \nimportant.\n  Again, I support a TPA. I support TAA. On TPP, let's reserve our \njudgment, and let's make a decision on the facts at this time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I have no further speakers. Since I reserve \nthe right to close, I will let the gentleman finish his speakers, and \nthen I will do a quick close.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. \nJackson Lee).\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nher remarks.)\n\n[[Page H4695]]\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank Ranking Member Levin for \nalways standing in the gap with a creative mind for trade but for \nworkers.\n  Let me acknowledge my colleague from Wisconsin and indicate that \nthose of us who stand here today have several reasons for doing so.\n  It was in 1997 that I traveled to the continent of Africa and looked \nat the rich resources of people and product and understood that that \ndeveloping continent needed a bridge of opportunity. I am not against a \nbridge of opportunity, and therefore, I vote and support the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act and those African nations who have extended \ntheir hand of friendship to the United States to create jobs.\n  At the same time, I have to represent some of the most impoverished \nand one of the largest groups of working people in the South in the \nState of Texas. Oh, I know that there is benefit. Texas is a State that \nfits appropriately for benefit in trade, but there are workers that I \nmust be concerned about. I really stand here today to support the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Act.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. There is not one district where the Department of \nLabor does not document the loss of jobs through trade. I would rather \nbe standing here today and saving a monumental amount of jobs for those \nindividuals that may have skills that are not in the chief executive \noffice.\n  I want to make sure that there is help, and I also want to say let's \nkeep negotiating to get a component that deals with workers. The Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Act is for workers. It is to give you that \ncushion; and it is to, in actuality, be able to help over 10,853 \nworkers in my State alone.\n  We are here today to say keep pushing for an equality in trade \nnegotiations to be able to lift the boats of workers across America, \nand then we are telling those who may be the beneficiary or the victim \nof dumping or other tactics that we will not leave here without voting \nfor Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n  Again, I thank my colleague for realizing we are better together than \nwe are divided. I thank my colleague Mr. Levin, who was never wavered \nfrom understanding trade, but having the empathy of the working man and \nwoman.\n  I stand with him, and we are going to move America forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion to Concur to H.R. 1295--\nTrade Preferences Extension Act of 2015.\n  Put simply, this bill will create jobs, protect workers and help grow \nour economy.\n  Specifically, this bill includes three separate provisions:\n  trade preferences for developing countries;\n  trade adjustment assistance; and\n  Leveling the Playing Field.\n  As it relates to the Trade Preferences Extension Act, this provides \ndeveloping countries with duty-free access to a range of goods that are \notherwise subject to tariffs to help promote commerce and boost our \neconomy.\n  The bill extends the important African Growth and Opportunity Act \n(AGOA) and trade programs for countries who most need it such as Haiti \nthrough 2025.\n  As it relates to the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), since 1962, \nthe Trade Adjustment Assistance has provided assistance to workers who \nface challenges due to global competition.\n  Pre 2009, the only beneficiaries of TAA were manufacturing workers \nout of work due to American trade, utilizing our free trade agreements \nto engage our global partners.\n  However, the 2009 legislation extended the program to cover a larger \npool of workers such as those in the service sector, as well as \nmanufacturing workers who lose their jobs due to trade with any \ncountry.\n  Additionally, TAA also extended coverage to public sector workers.\n  Currently, TAA has increased funding for worker training from $220 \nmillion per year to $575 million per year.\n  This is a step in the right direction.\n  I support this bill because it provides us with the opportunity to \nreauthorize TAA to protect workers who may lose their jobs due to trade \nwith other countries.\n  According to the Department of Labor and Commerce, between 2009 and \n2013 over 770 18th Congressional District constituents benefitted from \nthe Trade Adjustment Assistance Program.\n  This means thousands of families were able to put food on their \ntables.\n  For instance, 46,521 workers were certified in the state of Texas \nbetween 2009 and 2013.\n  In 2013 alone, over $46,000,000 was allocated to Texas, covering over \n10,853 workers in the state of Texas and thousands of families.\n  Finally, I support this bill because it levels the playing field.\n  Specifically, it includes improvements to U.S. antidumping and \ncountervailing duty laws by:\n  providing the Department of Commerce with more discretion to \ndetermine dumping or subsidy rate to apply to an uncooperative foreign \ncompany;\n  requiring the International Trade Commissions (ITC) to consider \nadditional factors when determining whether a domestic industry has \nbeen materially injured;\n  allowing Department of Commerce to use a different calculation \nmethodology to compare domestic and foreign costs if the methodology \ndoes not produce an appropriate comparison;\n  clarifying that the Department of Commerce when approximating costs \nin a non-market foreign economy can disregard the price of goods that \nare dumped or benefit from illegal subsidies; and\n  providing that Department of Commerce with more discretion to reject \nvoluntary respondents, which will allow the Department of Commerce to \nuse its limited resources on other matters.\n  Job creation, economic security, growing our economy and the \nprotection of workers are the reasons why I support this bill.\n  For the millions of American lives that will be enriched by this bill \nthat is why I strongly support the Trade Preference Extension Act of \n2013.\n  I support this bill and will keep an eye on it to make sure we make \ngood on our promise to the American people in creating jobs and our \ncommitment to growing our economy.\n  I urge all members to support the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. \nPelosi), our leader.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I \ncommend him for his tremendous, relentless, persistent leadership on \nbehalf of America's workers. They have no better friend than you, Mr. \nLevin, and your pursuit of bigger paychecks for American workers and \ndoing so without exploiting workers in other countries because, as we \nknow, that only leads to stagnation of wages in America. You have \nunderstood that so clearly. You have taught us so well. It is an honor \nto serve with you, Mr. Levin.\n  We come to this place with the Senate passage of TPA and the \nrecognition that there will only be TPA signed. It no longer is \nconnected to TAA. We have a choice today to choose between voting for \nTAA or not.\n  If it was the intent of the Republicans in the Senate to attach TAA \nto AGOA in order to bring down both bills, they are very wrong because \nwe reject that, even though we would have hoped for a better TAA.\n  When we are talking about trade agreements that involve 40 percent of \nthe world's economy, very large with a very small TAA bill, it is \nwoefully small, but at least it is there. I would have fought for a \nbigger bill. We are not given that opportunity.\n  As small as it is, tying it to AGOA and perhaps pulling down AGOA, \nwell, we reject that. People said: Oh, let's just defeat the TAA bill, \nand AGOA will come up another way.\n  We didn't trust that. We don't trust that the Republicans would allow \nAGOA to come up another way. For that reason, from strength, knowing \nthat we could defeat TAA, but at the same time bring down AGOA, it was \nwisely decided that we should just end this phase now, especially since \nthe idea that both bills or no bill no longer existed.\n  This is the end of phase one, and to get to this point, there has \nbeen a massive mobilization in our country of people of faith; people \nwho are concerned about environment; women's groups; and, of course, \nour friends in organized labor. There has been a massive mobilization \nfor America's working families.\n  We all stand ready to go to the next phase, and that next phase is to \nkeep a very sharp, clear, bright light focused on the provisions of the \nTPP. Most people really didn't realize TPP and TPA, they are different \nthings. Now, they will know.\n  While I respect the values of the administration, giving their \nnegotiators all of this power, it gives them no reason to come back \nwith anything better than a great trade agreement for\n\n[[Page H4696]]\n\nAmerica's working families, and that is what we are here to fight for.\n  We do not believe in trickle-down economics at home, and we do not \nbelieve in trickle-down trade policy where it helps people at the top, \nentities at the top, and then trickles down maybe to the workers.\n  We can do this thinking in new, fresh, and entrepreneurial ways. What \nhas bothered me about this debate is it is so stale; it is so old in \nterms of you are either for globalization and recognize it as a reality \nand you are for participating in it or you are not--how condescending.\n  Of course, we know we live in a global economy. Globalization is \nsomething that goes well beyond trade. It is about outsourcing and \noffshoring and all kinds of other ways of taking jobs away from our \nworkforce.\n  It is something that is a possibility that can be done, and that was \nmy aspiration, that we can do something great, something new, something \nthat benefited all workers, lifted up all workers, not exploiting some \nin some country to the advantage of multinational corporations and \nstagnation for American workers' wages.\n  Everybody says this is better than the status quo. Well, ``better'' \nis a comparative word. If the status quo is not good, better is less \nbad. We want something best. Good, better, best, never let it rest \nuntil good is better and better is best; that is what we were told in \ngrade school.\n  Better can also mean less bad. If this is the standard that we are \ngoing with, something that is less bad than the status quo, that is \nsimply not good enough.\n  The possibilities are so great for the world, for the planet, so we \nmust recognize the relationship between trade policy and people's \nlives. We must recognize the relationship, the interconnection between \ncommerce around climate.\n  We cannot enable a trade agreement to go forward that degrades the \nenvironment, especially now that our awareness is so great about the \nimpact of business decisions on the environment that our people live \nin, the air that our people breathe, and the rest.\n  We must recognize that we can only accomplish this with greater \ntransparency than this TPA enables us to have. That is done. We are \narguing that.\n  We are saying now, for TPP, the American people need, expect, and \ndeserve for us to see what the course of this debate is about so that \nthey can weigh in, so that, at the end of the day, the final product \nwill be something that we can rally around or understand why certain \ndecisions had to go a certain way, but not something that is just put \nthere to say, up or down, you either understand we live in a global \neconomy or you do not.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  That is, again, Mr. Speaker, condescending and not worthy, really, of \nthe debate, and certainly not worthy of our responsibility to America's \nworking families. So I am excited about the prospect as we go forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this legislation today. I wish we had a \nbetter TAA, and I certainly do not want to vote against the goal. I \nwant to commend Karen Bass and Charlie Rangel who worked on this--\ncreated it, really--from the start. It is really important, and we \nshould be happy about passing that. This could have been on the \nPresident's desk before now if our colleagues in the Senate would have \njust voted for it and sent it there, except that they decided to hijack \nit by putting this TAA in there and changing this debate. But that is \nokay. It is what it is.\n  We go forward again with a bright spotlight on TPP. If there is any \nvalue to what we have been through--which I think has been a great one \nin terms of mobilization and unifying people about the importance of \nthe stability of America's financial stability and of America's working \nfamily--it is that we are ready with judgment and knowledge, again, \nengaged in the debate as we go forward. We won't be part of the debate \nbecause TPA prohibits that. But the American people will want to be \nengaged in that debate, and we, as their representatives, will have to \nvote on it at some point.\n  President Lincoln said that public sentiment is everything. The more \nthe public knows about what is happening, I think, the better the \nagreement will be. That is my hope, and that is what we will fight for.\n  So this is another day, a new day to go forward. I congratulate my \ncolleagues who have worked so hard to get us to where we are, but we \nhave much more to do, much bigger possibilities for the American \npeople, and much recognition that it is a whole new world in terms of \nour understanding of our interconnections. Technology aids us, \ninformation helps us, and communication can be our salvation as we \nshare information.\n  So again, Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. Levin for his leadership \nand so many people who worked so hard on all of this, and I look \nforward to possibly a time when we not only have a unified Democratic \nCaucus but a unified Congress to come together with one thing in mind \nas we approach the Fourth of July: remembering e pluribus unum--from \nmany, one. We are one country. I don't think partisan politics, \nDemocrats, Republicans, have anything to do with this debate. It is a \ndebate about advancing America's workers and about bigger paychecks for \nAmerica's workers as we lift up workers throughout the world, as we \nprotect our environment, and as we go into the future.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), a member of our committee.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, we have had a very \nrigorous and robust debate on trade. Trade is important to not only the \nentire country, but certainly it is important to the communities that I \nrepresent.\n  Throughout this process, I have followed the dictates of organized \nlabor, and I have followed the dictates of the people I represent, \nwhich means I voted ``no.'' I listened to the logic of the Democratic \nleader just this moment, and I am going to vote with her. I am going to \nvote for this legislation today because it is necessary to help those \nindividuals who are going to be displaced, and they need all the help \nwe can provide. I will vote to help them.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we proceed to vote, let me just reflect a bit as \nsomeone who has been working on trade issues for some time.\n  At one point when USTR would not negotiate the trade agreement, Mr. \nRangel and I actually did the negotiating of the Peru free trade \nagreement with the Peruvian Government. I don't suggest that should be \nthe usual practice.\n  As I look back on our debate on TPA, I think it has essentially been \na prelude, a prelude to more vigorous debate about the contents of TPP. \nI think this debate has stirred the pot, and now it is important that \nthis Congress--that this Congress--impact the ingredients in the pot \nand that we do so while the ingredients are being cooked and not simply \nafterwards, because these ingredients affect the lives of American \nbusinesses, American workers, and working families; and when we get it \nwrong, as sometimes has been true, people get hurt and millions of jobs \nare lost.\n  So I think we now have to rededicate ourselves as these negotiations \nproceed to be an active partner and insist that we be an active \npartner, that we know what is going on, and that we are able to discuss \nwith the public what is going on. I think that is where we are today.\n  Within that spirit, Mr. Speaker, I urge that Democrats support this \nbill on TAA.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, first I would like to clarify a few things. The reason \nwe are here is because of the defeat of TAA the first time it came \nthrough here. That is why this bill is such this way.\n  The idea that by combining this for the Preferences was somehow a \nplan in the other body to defeat the two bills, I would just like to \nremind people that the first Preferences bill passed 97-1 when it \npassed the Senate. This bill was voice-voted in the Senate yesterday, \nso if someone was planning on trying to defeat these bills, they sure \npicked the wrong way to go about doing it.\n  What is really happening here is a commitment is being honored the \nsecond time around to make sure that these bills have passed, and I am\n\n[[Page H4697]]\n\npleased to see that. So I don't read into anything that the other body \ndid other than respond to the fact that TAA was defeated here the first \ntime around. Now we have rebuilt the process, kept the agreements, and \nhere we are passing a bill that the Senate voice-voted yesterday.\n  Why is this important, Mr. Speaker? These three bills are bipartisan. \nTAA is offered by Mr. Reichert, a Republican from Washington. \nPreferences is something that has gotten near universal support from \nboth sides of the aisle. It is very good policy, and everyone on both \nsides of the aisle is in favor of TAA.\n  We also have heard from our manufacturers that they need trade \nremedy, that when another country and a company from another country \nviolate our trade laws and dump product into our market, we ought to be \nable to do something about it. So there is a bipartisan acknowledgment \non that front, too. That is why this package is here. I anticipate a \ngood vote count.\n  At the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, the reason we are doing this is \nbecause we care about workers, we care about American leadership, and \nwe care about jobs. The reason you need trade agreements is to remove \nthose barriers so that the little guy, the small business, can also \nhave access to these foreign markets. That is one of the elements to \nthis debate that I think is missing.\n  Without trade agreements, big businesses can survive, no problem. Do \nyou know why? Because big businesses can just erect a factory in \nanother country to sell into that other country. It happens all the \ntime. We call it outsourcing. So a big company can set up a factory in \nanother country, hire people in that other country, and ship our jobs \nover there to make their product there to sell into those markets.\n  Trade agreements, on the other hand, remove those barriers, make it \nso that you can build it here and send it over there. That means small \nbusinesses can also get engaged in trade. Small businesses can also get \naccess to these markets. So by getting in a trade agreement, we remove \nthose barriers from these countries who say, ``If you want to sell your \nproduct in our country, then make it in our country,'' to getting a \ntrade agreement saying, ``We remove these barriers, and we will allow \nyou to make it in your country, America, and send it here.''\n  Mr. Speaker, that is why we want trade agreements, so we can keep \njobs and keep manufacturing in America, make and grow more things here \nso that we can have more jobs here and send them over there. It is why \nwe have a trade surplus in manufacturing with the countries we had \ntrade agreements with and a big manufacturing deficit with the \ncountries we do not have trade agreements with.\n  We are pretty generous, Mr. Speaker. We already let a lot of other \ncountries sell their goods into our country. Just go through Walmart, \nFarm & Fleet, K-Mart, or Shopko, wherever you go buy stuff, and you \nwill see things made in other countries all down the aisle. I bought \nthis shirt I am wearing right now in Kenosha, Wisconsin, at the outlet \nmall. It was made in Malaysia.\n  Go to these other countries, and you will not see something similar. \nYou will not see a bunch of American products on their store shelves. \nTrade agreements say: Hey, wait, that is not fair. Let's make it fair. \nYou give us the same kind of access to your country that we are giving \nyou to our country.\n  That is what we get with trade agreements; level the playing field, \nkeep it fair, and give us access to the fact that we have one in five \njobs in America tied to trade, the fact that these jobs on average pay \n18 percent more, so that we can keep that going so that we can have \nmore jobs with higher wages. That is what this is about.\n  When a worker is displaced--if a worker is displaced--TAA is there to \nhelp that person get job training skills and benefits so they can get a \nnew skill to get a new job to keep their life going where they want it \nto go.\n  So that is why I expect a good vote here today. I am pleased that we \nare able to honor the agreements that were made, and I am very pleased \nthat we are sending the signal to the rest of the world that this \ncountry is still willing and able to lead.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on consideration of the H.R. 2822, and \nthat I may include tabular material on the same.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Denham). Pursuant to House Resolution \n333 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of \nthe Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the \nbill, H.R. 2822.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1254\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 2822) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, \nenvironment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 2016, and for other purposes, with Mr. Graves of Louisiana in the \nchair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert) and the gentlewoman from \nMinnesota (Ms. McCollum) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to bring to the floor H.R. 2822, the \nfiscal year 2016 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations bill.\n  As we begin, I want to personally thank Chairman Rogers for his \nleadership and support. Under his guidance, the Committee on \nAppropriations is again setting the standard for getting things done in \nthe House. The Interior bill is the seventh appropriation bill to come \nto the floor so far this year.\n  I also want to thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), \nmy good friend and ranking member, for her partnership and work on this \nbill.\n  Finally, I want to thank each of our subcommittee members for their \nefforts and the collegiality that continues to be the hallmark of our \nsubcommittee's deliberations. Even though we may have differences of \nopinion within this bill, I greatly appreciate the Members' \nconstructive contribution, and I mean that sincerely.\n  The committee has made very difficult choices preparing this bill. As \nreported by the Committee on Appropriations, the fiscal year 2016 \nInterior and Environment bill is funded at $30.17 billion, which is \n$246 million below the fiscal year 2015-enacted level and $3 billion \nbelow the budget request. We have made a sincere effort to prioritize \nneeds within our 302(b) allocation. I would like to point out a few of \nthe highlights.\n  Again, this year, the committee has provided robust wildland fire \nfunding. Fire suppression accounts at the Department of the Interior \nand the Forest Service are fully funded at the 10-year average level. \nThe hazardous fuels program was increased by $75 million to $526 \nmillion in the fiscal year 2015-enacted bill, and that increase has \nbeen maintained in this bill.\n  This bill also continues critical investments in Indian Country, a \nnonpartisan priority of the committee. Building upon the bipartisan \nwork of the former subcommittee chairmen Mike Simpson, Jim Moran, and \nNorm Dicks, this bill continues to make investments in education, \npublic safety, and health programs in Indian Country.\n  Overall, funding for the Indian Health Service is increased by $145 \nmillion, or 3 percent, while funding for the Bureaus of Indian Affairs \nand Education is increased by $165 million, or 6 percent, from fiscal \nyear 2015 levels, the largest percentage increase in this bill.\n  This bill provides full funding in fiscal year 2016 for the Payment \nin Lieu of Taxes, or PILT, payments. PILT payments are made to 49 of \nthe 50 States as well as to the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. \nVirgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n  The bill provides $2.7 billion for the National Park Service, \nincluding more than $60 million in new funding, relating to the \ncentennial of the Park Service.\n  We have also addressed a number of priorities within the Fish and \nWildlife Service accounts. The bill funds popular cost-shared grant \nprograms above the fiscal year 2015-enacted levels. It also provides \nadditional funds to combat international wildlife trafficking, protects \nfish hatcheries from cuts and closures, continues funding to fight \ninvasive species, and reduces the backlog of species that are recovered \nbut not yet de-listed.\n\n[[Page H4700]]\n\n  The bill provides $248 million for the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, programs that enjoy broad support--bipartisan support, for that \nmatter. Some Members would prefer more funding; others would prefer \nless for LWCF. We have attempted to forge a middle ground that begins \nto return the emphasis of the Land and Water Conservation Fund to its \noriginal intent of recreation and State and local acquisitions.\n  Overall, funding for EPA is reduced by $718 million, or 9 percent, \nfrom fiscal year 2015-enacted levels. Members from the Great Lakes \nregion will be pleased to know that the Great Lakes Restoration \nInitiative is maintained at the fiscal year 2015-enacted level of $300 \nmillion. Rural water technical assistance grants and many categorical \ngrants, including radon grants, are level funded at the fiscal year \n2015 enacted level.\n  Again this year, there is a great deal of concern over the number of \nregulatory actions being pursued by the EPA in the absence of \nlegislation and without clear congressional direction. For this reason, \nthe bill includes a number of provisions to stop unnecessary and \ndamaging regulatory overreach by the Agency.\n  Before closing, I would like to address the Endangered Species Act \nprovisions in this bill. We have no interest in interfering with \nscience or letting any species go extinct, but we are concerned about \nFederal regulatory actions lacking in basic fairness and common sense. \nThe provisions in this bill address problems created by an ESA driven \nnot by science, but by court orders that drain limited Agency resources \nand force the Department to cut corners to meet arbitrary deadlines. \nNowhere is this more evident than with the sage-grouse.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  States are rightfully concerned that a listing or unnecessarily \nrestrictive Federal land use plans will jeopardize existing \nconservation partnerships with States and private landowners. These \npartnerships are necessary to save both the sagebrush ecosystem and \nlocal economies.\n  So long as sage-grouse are not under imminent threat of extinction, \ncooperative conservation must be given a chance to work. That is why \nthis bill maintains a 1-year delay on any decision to list sage-grouse \nalong with full funding to implement conservation efforts.\n  House consideration of this bill is the next step in a long \nlegislative process. I hope over the coming months we will come \ntogether, as we do each year, to find common ground. In that spirit, I \nlook forward to continuing to work with Ms. McCollum and the Members of \nthe House on both sides of the aisle.\n  In closing, I want to thank the staff on both sides for their hard \nwork on this bill. On the minority side, I would like to thank Rick \nHealy, Rita Culp, Joe Carlile, as well as Rebecca Taylor. They have \nplayed an integral role in the process, and their efforts are very much \nappreciated.\n  On the majority side, I would like to thank subcommittee staff \nKristin Richmond, Jackie Kilroy, Betsy Bina, Jason Gray, Darren \nBenjamin, and Dave LesStrang. I would also like to thank Ian Foley, \nRebecca Keightley, Alexandra Berenter, and Tricia Evans on my personal \nstaff for their great work.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill. It deserves the support of the \nMembers of this body.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H4701]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.001\n\n\n\n[[Page H4702]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.002\n\n\n\n[[Page H4703]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.003\n\n\n\n[[Page H4704]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.004\n\n\n\n[[Page H4705]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.005\n\n\n\n[[Page H4706]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.006\n\n\n\n[[Page H4707]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.007\n\n\n\n[[Page H4708]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.008\n\n\n\n[[Page H4709]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.009\n\n\n\n[[Page H4710]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.010\n\n\n\n[[Page H4711]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.011\n\n\n\n[[Page H4712]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.012\n\n\n\n[[Page H4713]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.013\n\n\n\n[[Page H4714]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.014\n\n\n\n[[Page H4715]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.015\n\n\n\n[[Page H4716]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.016\n\n\n\n[[Page H4717]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.017\n\n\n\n[[Page H4718]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.018\n\n\n\n[[Page H4719]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.019\n\n\n\n[[Page H4720]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.020\n\n\n\n[[Page H4721]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.021\n\n\n\n[[Page H4722]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.022\n\n\n\n[[Page H4723]]\n\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  First, I would like to acknowledge and thank Ranking Member Lowey for \nher support and her mentorship as I start working on this very first \nappropriations bill on the House floor.\n  I would like to thank my subcommittee chairman, Ken Calvert, for the \neffort he has put into this bill. I appreciate that even as Chairman \nCalvert grappled with an inadequate funding allocation, he carried out \nhis work in an open and thoughtful manner. The chairman is to be \ncommended for his diligence in holding 14 budget hearings, where we \nreceived testimony from nearly 150 witnesses.\n  Let me also, along with the chairman, express my appreciation to the \nsubcommittee staff on the minority and majority sides for their hard \nwork during another difficult budget year.\n  Unfortunately, the inadequate 302(b) allocation given to the \nInterior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations sets this \nbill up for failure. The majority's refusal to adopt a sufficient \noverall budget allocation for discretionary appropriations has led to a \nbill that severely underfunds investments and protections that are \npriorities for the American people.\n  The subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for FY 2016 is $246 million \nbelow the current year's enacted level. When added to the cuts of the \npast 5 years, this bill is more than $2 billion below the FY 2010 \nenacted level. In fact, when adjusted for inflation, this bill invests \nless than what was appropriated in 2005.\n  But it gets worse. The rising emergency costs of combating wildland \nfires, court-ordered Native American contract support costs, and the \nmajority's decision to abandon mandatory funding for the Payment in \nLieu of Taxes program, otherwise known as PILT, means the remaining \nfunding available for other critical public programs is far below the \nFY 2015 enacted.\n  PILT has been mandatory spending in the past, and almost 2,000 \ncounties use this compensation for lost tax revenue to provide vital \nservices. PILT should not be in this discretionary bill. It should be \nreturned to mandatory spending.\n  The courts have ruled that Congress must pay full contract support \ncosts to tribal nations. Contract support costs are true mandatory \nspending, and they should not be in this discretionary bill.\n  Catastrophic wildland fires are natural disasters and, just as any \nother natural disaster, they should be treated as such emergency \nspending. Catastrophic wildland fires should not be subject to \ndiscretionary spending caps in this bill.\n  Together, spending on these three activities consumes $5.4 billion, \nor 18 percent of the bill's budget allocation. It is time for the \nauthorizing committees to stop ignoring this problem and responsibly \naddress what are truly mandatory costs, because these costs are burning \nthrough our budget allocation.\n  So what does that mean for the rest of the programs funded by H.R. \n2822? After years of cuts and flat funding, it means we are going \nbackwards and undermining efforts to preserve America's natural and \ncultural heritage, failing to meet our commitments to the social and \neconomic well-being of Native Americans, and causing real and lasting \nharm to the environment.\n  We received compelling testimony this year on the unmet needs in \nIndian Country, especially in the areas of education and health. Yet \nthis bill's inadequate allocation means that many Native American \nprograms receive far less funding than what the President requested and \nwhat Native Americans indeed deserve.\n  This is unfortunate because, as the chairman pointed out, he and I \nshare a deep bipartisan commitment to bettering the lives of Native \nAmericans and to uphold our Federal trust and treaty obligations.\n  Last year, attendance at our national parks was at a record high. \nWith the upcoming centennial of the National Park Service in 2016, \nvisitation is expected to increase. But what will visitors find when \nthey come to the centennial celebration?\n  Without additional funding, they will find historic hotels in \nYellowstone and Glacier National Parks that have serious health, \nsafety, and accessibility issues. They will find closed facilities at \nYosemite due to 70-year-old sewer lines that are failing. And under the \nRepublican spending plan, what visitors will not find are the hundreds \nof seasonal rangers that the Park Service needs to hire to restore \nstaffing capacity to 2010 levels.\n  Under H.R. 2822, less than 16 percent of the funds requested for the \nNational Park Service's centennial are provided. By underfunding the \nCentennial Challenge, this bill misses the opportunity to allow the \nAmerican public to support their parks through matching donations.\n  The National Park's Civil Rights initiative fares only slightly \nbetter, with just 19 percent of the request funded. It is our \nresponsibility to act now to preserve the stories and monuments of the \ncivil rights movement.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund is cut by more than 25 percent \nbelow the FY 2015-enacted level, continuing the pattern of \nshortchanging conservation.\n  Wildlife programs are underfunded as well, with cuts or flat funding \nto programs that assist in the recovery of species or help to prevent \ntheir listing in the first place. Funding decisions such as these set \nup the Endangered Species Act to fail.\n  However, the most significant and devastating cuts are again targeted \nat the Environmental Protection Agency. The bill cuts the EPA by $718 \nmillion from the FY 2015-enacted level, a 9 percent cut. This is on top \nof the nearly 20 percent cut the Agency has received over the past 4 \nyears.\n  The air every American breathes and the water every American family \ndrinks are all at risk by the funding cuts and policy attacks in this \nbill. When the majority says it wants to rein in the EPA, what they are \nreally doing is denying the protection of our air and water.\n  The consequences of abandoning public health and environmental \nprotection will be negatively felt in communities across this Nation. \nWhy? Because this bill cuts the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water \nRevolving Funds by more than half a billion dollars. The revolving \nfunds are part of a partnership with our communities to build and \nrepair infrastructure that protects America's drinking water and \nprevents sewage from contaminating our water. And when we invest in \nthese water systems, we are also creating jobs in communities all \nacross the country.\n  Earlier this month, the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior \nreleased their latest summer fire forecast, which showed that fire \ncosts are likely to exceed FY 2015-enacted levels by nearly $300 \nmillion.\n  Wildland fires burn up 12 percent, or $3.9 billion, of the bill's \nallocation. And without some relief, these numbers will only continue \nto grow.\n  In just the past 3 years, we have had to make up a total of a \nbillion-dollar shortfall that forced agencies to borrow funds from \nother accounts to pay for fire costs. We know the answer to this \nproblem. Many of us are cosponsors of Mr. Simpson's bill, H.R. 167, to \ntreat a portion of these wildfire costs as they are--disasters.\n  Yet as problematic as the funding decisions in this bill are, what is \neven more troubling are the more than two dozen problem legislative \nriders and funding limitations contained in the bill, with seven of \nthese being new this year.\n\n  These provisions do not belong in the bill. These are proposals that \nshould be moved through the authorizing committee, where open, \ntransparent, and thoughtful debate can take place.\n  The riders the majority have hung on this bill undermine our Nation's \nbedrock environmental laws, endanger public health and safety, and deny \nthe impact that climate change is having on our planet.\n  Several of these riders would require that Agency scientists and \nprocedures be ignored, saying that they ``can't be trusted.'' Yet other \nprovisions would overturn Federal court decisions and limit judicial \nreview.\n  As lawmakers, we create the legislation that guides our Nation, but \nmy colleagues in the majority seem to need a reminder that we are only \none of three branches of government. Clearly, we are the most important \nbranch. But the other two branches have jobs to do as well.\n  For a majority that complains about the Federal rulemaking process, \nit is\n\n[[Page H4724]]\n\nsurprising to see that the bill contains directives that certain \nFederal rules be issued. It would appear that the majority is okay with \nFederal rulemaking, but only as long as the rules are the ones they \nwant.\n  With the inadequate funding and special interest provisions, I share \nthe administration's concerns about this bill. I will submit the \nStatement of Administration Policy on H.R. 2822, which is eight pages \nand includes a veto threat.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n    H.R. 2822--Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related \n                   Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016\n\n                          (Rep. Rogers, R-KY)\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. \n     2822, making appropriations for the Department of the \n     Interior, Environment, and related agencies for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. The \n     bill drastically underfunds core Department of the Interior \n     programs as well as the Environmental Protection Agency's \n     operating budget, which supports nationwide protection of \n     human health and our vital air, water and land resources. \n     Funding levels in the bill would prevent investments that \n     reduce future costs to taxpayers by facilitating increased \n     energy development and maintaining facilities and \n     infrastructure in national parks, refuges, forests, public \n     lands, and Indian Country. They would make it harder for \n     States and businesses to plan and execute changes that would \n     decrease carbon pollution and address the challenges the \n     Nation faces from climate change. They would also reduce \n     support for partnerships and effective collaboration with \n     States, local governments and private entities on efforts to \n     restore and conserve natural resources. Further, the bill \n     includes numerous highly problematic ideological provisions \n     that have no place in funding legislation. These provisions \n     threaten to undermine the ability of States and communities \n     to address climate change and protect a resource that is \n     essential to America's health--clean water, as well as the \n     most basic protections for America's special places and the \n     people and wildlife that rely on them. If the President were \n     presented with H.R. 2822, his senior advisors would recommend \n     that he veto the bill.\n       Enacting H.R. 2822 and adhering to the congressional \n     Republican budget's overall spending limits for fiscal year \n     (FY) 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments \n     in middle-class priorities. Sequestration was never intended \n     to take effect: rather, it was supposed to threaten such \n     drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that \n     policymakers would be motivated to come to the table and \n     reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms. The \n     Republican framework would bring base discretionary funding \n     for both non-defense and defense for FY 2016 to the lowest \n     real levels in a decade. Compared to the President's Budget, \n     the cuts would result in tens of thousands of the Nation's \n     most vulnerable children losing access to Head Start, \n     millions fewer workers receiving job training and employment \n     services, and drastic cuts to research awards and grants, \n     along with other impacts that would hurt the economy, the \n     middle class, and Americans working hard to reach the middle \n     class.\n       Sequestration funding levels would also put our national \n     security at unnecessary risk, not only through pressures on \n     defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, \n     Homeland Security, and other non-defense programs that help \n     keep us safe. More broadly, the strength of our economy and \n     the security of our Nation are linked. That is why the \n     President has been clear that he is not willing to lock in \n     sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to \n     defense without also fixing non-defense.\n       The President's senior advisors would recommend that he \n     veto H.R. 2822 and any other legislation that implements the \n     current Republican budget framework, which blocks the \n     investments needed for our economy to compete in the future. \n     The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress \n     to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense \n     priorities and offset the cost with commonsense spending and \n     tax expenditure cuts, as Members of Congress from both \n     parties have urged.\n       The Administration would like to take this opportunity to \n     share additional views regarding the Committee's version of \n     the bill.\n\n\n                 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n\n       EPA Operating Budget. The Administration disagrees strongly \n     with the bill's reduction to EPA's operating budget by $474 \n     million, or 13 percent, compared to the FY 2016 Budget \n     request. This reduced level of funding would significantly \n     undermine implementation of the Clean Power Plan and the \n     recently finalized Clean Water Rule. The Clean Power Plan is \n     a flexible and practical approach to addressing the risks of \n     climate change by reducing carbon pollution from the electric \n     power sector, the largest source of carbon pollution in the \n     United States. Climate change is not only an environmental \n     challenge, it is also an economic, public health, and \n     national security challenge. Unabated climate change is \n     projected to hamper economic growth in the United States and \n     put the health and well-being of the Nation at risk from \n     extreme weather events, wildland fire, poor air quality, and \n     illnesses transmitted by food, water, and disease carriers \n     such as mosquitos and ticks. Failing to address climate \n     change would also exacerbate poverty and contribute to \n     environmental degradation in developing countries, \n     potentially resulting in resource shortages, political \n     instability, and conflict. Meanwhile, the bill also reduces \n     funding to implement the recently finalized Clean Water Rule \n     that would ensure waters protected under the Clean Water Act \n     are more precisely defined and predictably determined. By \n     delaying implementation of this rule, business and industry \n     face a more costly, difficult, and slower permitting process.\n       State Categorical Grants. The Administration opposes the \n     $118 million reduction to State and Tribal Categorical grants \n     compared to the FY 2016 Budget request. Often, States and \n     Tribes implement environmental programs through delegated \n     authorities. However, the bill reduces these grants to States \n     and Tribes to carry out activities such as water quality \n     permitting, air monitoring, and hazardous waste management \n     programs. In addition, the bill reduces funding for \n     brownfields projects by $35 million, or 32 percent, from the \n     FY 2016 Budget request. This reduced level of funding \n     severely limits opportunities for local communities to \n     revitalize their contaminated lands to improve environmental \n     quality and spark economic redevelopment.\n       State Revolving Funds (SRFs). The Administration objects to \n     the funding levels provided for EPA's Clean Water and \n     Drinking Water SRFs. The bill reduces SRF funding by a \n     combined $527 million from the FY 2016 Budget request, \n     reducing necessary support to help communities finance water \n     infrastructure improvements, resulting in approximately 200 \n     fewer projects being funded nationally.\n       Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Limits for Power Plants. The \n     Administration strongly objects to section 428 of the bill, \n     which would prohibit the use of funds to propose, finalize, \n     implement or enforce carbon pollution standards for fossil \n     fuel-fired electric generating units that are the largest \n     source of carbon pollution in the United States. The bill \n     seeks to derail Administration efforts to address under \n     section 111 of the Clean Air Act the urgent economic, \n     public health, and national security impacts of unabated \n     climate change. Failure to reduce the utility sector's \n     carbon footprint places the Nation at risk from extreme \n     weather events, wildland fire, poor air quality, global \n     instability, accelerated environmental degradation, and \n     illnesses transmitted by food, water, and disease carriers \n     such as mosquitos and ticks.\n       Clean Water Act (CWA). The Administration believes that the \n     CWA provisions in the bill undermine efforts to protect \n     America's clean water resources, which are critical to \n     American families and businesses. The Administration strongly \n     objects to section 422 of the bill in particular, which would \n     disrupt the Administration's current efforts to clarify the \n     scope of CWA, hamstring future regulatory efforts, and create \n     significant ambiguity regarding existing regulations and \n     guidance.\n       Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). The Administration regards the \n     SCC as an essential component of the environmental rulemaking \n     process and opposes the Congress' interference with the \n     Interagency Working Group's (IWG) development of the SCC. The \n     Administration strongly objects to section 437 of the bill, \n     which would force the IWG to revise the SCC using only the \n     discount rates and ``domestic'' SCC values stated in \n     Executive Order 12866 and Office of Management and Budget \n     Circular A-4. This revision would ignore the trans-boundary \n     movement of carbon, fail to capture key costs of carbon \n     emissions, and disrupt dozens of upcoming rules that would \n     use the SCC to monetize carbon reduction benefits.\n       Limitations on Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) \n     Program under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The Administration \n     objects to section 435 of the bill, which would block the \n     finalization, implementation, and enforcement of a rule to \n     prohibit certain uses of climate super-pollutants known as \n     hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Domestic action to reduce use of \n     HFCs is consistent with U.S. advocacy for addressing HFCs on \n     a global basis, such as through an amendment to the Montreal \n     Protocol.\n       National Ocean Policy. The Administration objects to \n     section 425 of the bill, which prohibits any funding provided \n     in the bill from being used to implement the marine planning \n     components of the National Ocean Policy. This provision would \n     prohibit the Department of the Interior (DOI) and EPA from \n     participating in marine and coastal planning efforts, a \n     process to better determine how the ocean, the Nation's \n     coasts, and the Great Lakes are managed in an efficient \n     manner.\n       Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n     Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) Financial Assurance. The \n     Administration objects to section 427 of the bill, which \n     prohibits the use of funds to develop, propose, finalize, and \n     implement financial responsibility requirements under CERCLA \n     108(b). On May 19, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit ordered EPA to develop an \n     expedited schedule for financial responsibility rules for the \n     hardrock mining industry and for three other industries. This \n     provision would severely limit EPA's ability to develop these \n     rules in a timely manner and abrogates EPA's responsibilities \n     laid out in CERCLA 108(b).\n       Classification of Forest Biomass Fuels as Carbon-Neutral. \n     The Administration objects\n\n[[Page H4725]]\n\n     to the bill's representation of forest biomass as \n     categorically ``carbon-neutral.'' This language conflicts \n     with existing EPA policies on biogenic CO2 and \n     interferes with the position of States that do not apply the \n     same policies to forest biomass as other renewable fuels like \n     solar or wind. This language stands in contradiction to a \n     wide-ranging consensus on policies and best available science \n     from EPA's own independent Science Advisory Board, numerous \n     technical studies, many States, and various other \n     stakeholders.\n       e-Manifest. The Administration objects to the elimination \n     of funding for e-Manifest development, EPA's system for \n     electronically tracking the transport of hazardous waste. \n     While the Administration acknowledges the concern about the \n     pace of development of the e-Manifest, eliminating the \n     requested $7 million in funding at this time would jeopardize \n     EPA's ongoing progress to develop the system and begin \n     operations in the coming years.\n       Lead Test Kits. The Administration objects to section 426 \n     of the bill that would disrupt EPA's current activities under \n     the 2008 Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting rule until EPA \n     approves a commercially available ``improved'' lead paint \n     test kit. This provision would undermine EPA's efforts to \n     protect sensitive populations from exposure to lead, a known \n     toxin to children and developing fetuses, during home \n     renovation projects.\n\n\n                    Department of the Interior (DOI)\n\n       Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Topline. The Administration \n     opposes the $159 million, or 5 percent, reduction to BIA as \n     compared to the FY 2016 Budget request. This funding level \n     would limit DOI's ability to make key investments in \n     education and wrap-around services to support Native youth, \n     eliminating all increases to post-secondary scholarships and \n     $10 million for education program enhancement funds to allow \n     Bureau of Indian Education to drive school improvement and \n     reforms. The bill reduces funding for initiatives aimed at \n     supporting tribal self-determination through the creation of \n     a one-stop portal to facilitate access to Federal resources \n     and funding to address data gaps in Indian Country, and the \n     creation of an Office of Indian Affairs Policy, Program \n     Evaluation, and Data to support effective, data-driven, \n     tribal policy making and program implementation. In addition, \n     this bill eliminates all increases to natural resources \n     management on tribal lands, including funds to help tribal \n     communities prepare for and respond to the impacts of climate \n     change.\n       National Park Service (NPS) Centennial. The Administration \n     opposes funding levels provided for the NPS Centennial. The \n     bill fails to provide adequate funding to prepare for the \n     Centennial in 2016, resulting in the delay of roughly 70 \n     percent of line-item park construction projects and 36 \n     percent of repair and rehabilitation projects, and forgoes \n     millions in matching private donations. The bill also fails \n     to provide funding for engaging youth and cultivating the \n     next generation of conservation-minded individuals, including \n     funding for transportation assistance to students from Title \n     I schools.\n       Onshore Inspection Fees. The bill does not include a \n     proposal in the FY 2016 Budget request to institute a new \n     onshore oil and gas inspection fee program. The proposal, \n     which is similar to the program already in place for offshore \n     operations, would cover the cost of inspection activities and \n     reduce the net cost to taxpayers of operating the Bureau of \n     Land Management's (BLM) oil and gas program. Failure to adopt \n     the new fees and associated funding would hamper the BLM's \n     ability to protect human safety, conserve energy resources, \n     facilitate the proper reporting of oil and gas production, \n     and ensure environmental requirements are being followed in \n     all phases of development.\n       State and Tribal Wildlife Grants. The Administration \n     opposes the 15 percent reduction to State and Tribal Wildlife \n     Grants compared to the FY 2016 Budget request. This important \n     program allows States and Tribes, key partners in \n     conservation, to strategically protect wildlife and conserve \n     habitat in a way that complements Federal investments and \n     yields better results for the public.\n       Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT). The bill provides $452 \n     million for PILT, which the Administration has proposed to \n     fund through a separate mandatory appropriation in line with \n     its previous congressional enactment. While the \n     Administration appreciates the Committee's support for PILT, \n     inclusion of these funds in the bill comes at the expense of \n     all other programs funded by the bill.\n       Carcieri Land into Trust. The bill fails to include the \n     provision in the FY 2016 Budget request to clarify and \n     reaffirm the Secretary of the Interior's authority to acquire \n     land in trust under the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA). In \n     Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U.S. 397 (2009), the Supreme Court \n     held that the Secretary could acquire land in trust under the \n     IRA only for tribes that were ``under Federal jurisdiction'' \n     in 1934. A legislative solution would help achieve the goals \n     of the IRA and tribal self-determination by clarifying that \n     DOI's authority under the law applies to all tribes, whether \n     recognized in 1934 or after. Such legislation would be \n     consistent with the longstanding policy of assisting Tribes \n     in establishing and protecting a land base sufficient to \n     allow them to provide for the health, welfare, and safety of \n     tribal members, and in treating all tribes equally for \n     purposes of setting aside lands for tribal communities.\n       Hydraulic Fracturing: Section 439 of the bill would block \n     DOI from implementing, administering or enforcing the Bureau \n     of Land Management's recently-finalized Hydraulic Fracturing \n     rule. This would leave the agency reliant on 30-year old \n     requirements and prevent it from taking key steps to improve \n     the safety of oil and gas drilling activities and improve \n     opportunities for BLM to coordinate standards and processes \n     with States and Tribes to reduce administrative costs and \n     improve efficiency.\n       Stream Buffer Regulation. Section 423 would prohibit DOI's \n     Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation, and Enforcement from \n     updating 30-year-old stream protection regulations to reflect \n     modern science and technology and better protect people and \n     the environment, provide industry more certainty, and address \n     recent court decisions.\n       Hunting, Fishing and Recreational Shooting. Sections 421 \n     and 424 would substantially impair the enforcement of a \n     longstanding ban on the use of lead ammunition in the hunting \n     of migratory waterfowl, and would complicate in other ways \n     the overall implementation of hunting, fishing, and \n     recreational shooting on public lands.\n       Wildlife Trafficking. Section 120 would interfere with \n     ongoing Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) actions to combat \n     wildlife trafficking, curb the poaching of African Elephants, \n     and restrict trade in ivory, which would impair U.S. \n     leadership in the global fight against ivory poaching.\n       Endangered Species Act Restrictions. Sections 117, 121, and \n     122 of the bill undercut the Endangered Species Act by \n     limiting the ability of the FWS to properly protect, based on \n     the best available science, a number of species, including \n     the greater sage grouse, northern long-eared bat, and certain \n     gray wolf populations. Language provisions, like those \n     affecting the sage grouse, would only create additional \n     uncertainty and undermine unprecedented efforts to conserve \n     the sagebrush landscape and the Western way of life.\n       Federal Acknowledgement of American Indian Tribes. Language \n     under the heading ``Bureau of Indian Affairs, Administrative \n     Provisions'' in the bill would block DOI from finalizing, \n     implementing, administering, or enforcing the \n     Administration's proposed Federal acknowledgment rule, \n     preventing DOI's effort to improve the regulations governing \n     the process and criteria by which the Secretary of the \n     Interior acknowledges an Indian Tribe.\n\n\n        DOI and Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service\n\n       Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). The Administration \n     objects to the drastic reduction of $152 million, or 38 \n     percent, to the requested discretionary funding for DOI and \n     USDA LWCF programs. LWCF is a cornerstone of Federal \n     conservation and recreation preservation efforts. This \n     funding level would severely impede agency capacity to \n     further protect our Nation's natural heritage. To date, the \n     LWCF has contributed to the protection of key public lands, \n     such as Rocky Mountain National Park, Mount Rainier National \n     Park, and portions of the Appalachian Trail, among others, as \n     well as State and local recreation projects and important \n     cultural heritage sites.\n       Wildland Fire Suppression. The Administration's cap \n     adjustment for wildfire suppression was not included in this \n     bill. Continued inaction on this proposal, which has \n     bipartisan support, would increase the likelihood of \n     disruptive funding transfers for suppression and away from \n     the very restoration and fire risk reduction programs that \n     are meant to restore landscapes and reduce suppression costs \n     and restore landscapes.\n       Land Management Operations. The Administration opposes the \n     $502 million, or 8 percent, reduction to operational funding \n     to land management agencies, relative to the FY 2016 Budget \n     request. This reduction would undermine support for the \n     provision of basic public and business services that support \n     the long-term health and resilience of national parks, \n     forests, refuges, and other public lands.\n       Water Rights on Federal Land. Section 434 prohibits \n     agencies from conditioning land use authorizations on the \n     transfer, relinquishment, or impairment of a water right, or \n     on the acquisition of a water right in the name of the United \n     States. This language is unnecessary for its intended \n     purpose, and would preclude land management agencies from \n     protecting the public interest. The provision would eliminate \n     the ability of land management agencies to maintain \n     sufficient water for other congressionally-designated \n     purposes and ensure water rights are tied to the activities \n     for which they were developed. These restrictions would also \n     hamper cooperative work with land users to improve land \n     conditions, such as range improvements, or conduct habitat \n     mitigation activities as part of land use agreements.\n\n\n            Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service\n\n       Land Management Improvements. The bill provides $357 \n     million for capital improvement and maintenance of the \n     national forest system, a 5 percent increase from the FY 2016 \n     Budget request. While the Administration supports the capital \n     improvement and maintenance of the Nation's public forests in \n     order to increase its health, resilience, and accessibility, \n     the increase in this bill comes at the expense of other \n     needed priorities.\n\n\n                Department of Health and Human Services\n\n       Indian Health Service (IHS) Topline. The Administration \n     strongly opposes the reduction to funding for Native American \n     health\n\n[[Page H4726]]\n\n     care programs and facilities of the Indian Health Service \n     (IHS) by $300 million, or 6 percent, below the FY 2016 Budget \n     request. This would result in inadequate funding for the \n     provision of health care to a population that is sicker and \n     poorer compared to national averages. For example, compared \n     to the FY 2016 Budget request, the bill reduces funding by \n     nearly $50 million for Purchased and Referred Care, a program \n     that supports health care not available in IHS and tribal \n     facilities, which would exacerbate existing levels of denied \n     care and waiting lists for services.\n       Contract Support Costs. The Administration objects to the \n     limitation in funding for tribal Contract Support Costs (CSC) \n     for BIA and IHS. Specifically, the bill would limit funding \n     for CSC that could perpetuate the funding issues described in \n     the Supreme Court's Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter decision. \n     The Congress should pursue a long-term solution for CSC \n     appropriations, providing an increase in funding in FY 2016 \n     as part of a transition to a new three-year mandatory funding \n     stream in FY 2017, as proposed in the President's Budget.\n\n\n                            Other Provisions\n\n       Smithsonian Institution. The bill reduces funding for the \n     Smithsonian Institution by $116 million, or 12 percent, below \n     the FY 2016 Budget request--a reduction that can be expected \n     to reduce public access to the Smithsonian as well as \n     increase safety concerns through delays in planned \n     renovations. With over 30 million visits to Smithsonian \n     facilities recorded in 2014, it is important to ensure the \n     museums, galleries, National Zoological Park, and nine \n     research facilities that make up the world's largest museum \n     and research complex remain open, maintained, and available \n     to the generations of Americans who make use of this unique \n     institution each year. Specifically, the bill reductions \n     would delay renovation for the National Air and Space Museum, \n     where the museum has had to establish temporary covered \n     walkways to protect the public from potential falling debris \n     from its facade, and would reduce operating hours for the \n     museums, including the new National Museum of African \n     American History and Culture.\n       Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA \n     Act). The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the \n     FY 2016 Budget requests for DOI and EPA to implement the DATA \n     Act. This funding would support efforts to provide more \n     transparent Federal spending data, such as updating \n     information technology systems, changing business processes, \n     and employing a uniform procurement instrument identifier.\n       U.S. Digital Service Team. The Administration urges the \n     Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget requests for DOI \n     and EPA to develop U.S. Digital Service teams. This funding \n     would support managing the agency's digital services that \n     have the greatest impact to citizens and businesses.\n\n\n                        Constitutional Concerns\n\n       Several provisions in the bill raise separation of powers \n     concerns.\n       The Administration looks forward to working with the \n     Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations process moves forward.\n\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, we owe it to our constituents to be good \nstewards of the environment, to be protectors of public health, and to \nbe defenders of the public good. We can do better than what this bill \noffers. H.R. 2822 falls short of our responsibilities to present and \nfuture generations. As such, I cannot support the bill in its current \nform.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield such time as he \nmay consume to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the full \ncommittee chairman.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the fiscal year 2016 Department of \nthe Interior and Environment Appropriations bill. This is the eighth of \nthe 12 individual bills that have made it to the floor. That is a \nrecord pace, by the way. It is the fastest that these bills have come \nbefore the House since at least 1974, when the Budget Control Act came \ninto being.\n  This bill, as the chairman said, provides just over $30 billion in \ndiscretionary funding for programs that preserve and nurture our \nNation's unique natural and cultural heritage. This fulfills our \nresponsibility to the American taxpayers to provide funding for these \nimportant programs within a smart and sustainable budget.\n  Our responsibility to the American taxpayers, of course, doesn't end \nthere. The people of this Nation expect their government to act in a \nway that fosters economic development and job creation. This current \nadministration has been neglecting that duty, instead choosing to push \na regulatory agenda that would create an environment hostile to \neconomic growth, that would put our energy independence at risk, and \nthat could cost thousands of hard-working Americans their jobs.\n  So this bill takes important steps to stop this harmful executive \noverreach. First and foremost, we limit funding for the Environmental \nProtection Agency, cutting its funding by 9 percent from last year.\n  The bill also prohibits the EPA from implementing a litany of its \negregious, expensive regulations, including applying new greenhouse gas \nregulations for power plants, updating existing ozone regulations, and \nchanging the definitions of ``navigable waters'' and ``fill material,'' \nall of which could spell disaster for our economy.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  The bill also prevents the Bureau of Land Management from hampering \neconomic growth by halting increases in oil and gas inspection fees and \nfrom burdening ranchers with higher grazing fees.\n  Provisions like these will help get the government out of the way of \ngrowth, preventing the overregulation and overtaxation of American \nbusiness and industry, and keeping down manufacturing costs and utility \nbills for families across the country.\n  In addition, the bill also focuses funding on other important \nDepartment of the Interior related programs. For instance, the bill \ncreates a new $30 million program to help accelerate the reclamation of \nabandoned mine lands, boosting local community redevelopment.\n  The bill also fulfills our moral and legal obligations to American \nIndians and Alaska Natives, increasing funding for programs that will \nhelp improve education systems, health facilities, and other \ninfrastructure.\n  The bill prioritizes the prevention of and preparation for wildland \nfires, increasing funding for these programs billwide by $52 million.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a fine appropriations bill that we have before \nus today. I want to commend Chairman Calvert for his good work on this \nbill. He, the ranking member, and the subcommittee have done a thorough \njob on the bill, and I am proud to support it. I also want to thank the \nstaff for their work to bring this bill to the floor today.\n  This is the maiden voyage, Mr. Chairman, of this cardinal, this new \nchairman, the new chairman of this subcommittee. This is his first \nbill, and it is a good one. I want to salute him and his staff for \ndoing a great job in putting together a bill that was tough to put \ntogether. Congratulations to you.\n  Before I close, Mr. Chairman, I want to take a moment to recognize \none of my staff members, Mike Robinson, who will be moving on to \ngreener pastures next week.\n  Mike started working for me nearly 20 years ago and has had several \ntenures in my personal office. Four years ago, he joined the \nAppropriations Committee, the front office, as coalitions and Member \nservices director.\n  Many of our colleagues have gotten a chance to know Mike over these \npast 4 years. He has answered your questions. He has helped you offer \namendments. He has helped guide dozens of appropriations bills to \npassage. He has been an integral part of the staff over these years, \nand we will miss him greatly when he departs.\n  Thank you, Mike, for all of your hard work. We are very grateful to \nyou.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is an appropriations bill that puts our Nation's \neconomy first. It preserves the role of the Federal Government, making \nsure the government is doing its job well, not in a way that intrudes \ninto the lives of American businesses or the American people, but in a \nway that encourages our economy to grow and thrive, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bill.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Mrs. Lowey), the ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Calvert; \nChairman Rogers; as well as my good friend Betty McCollum, who is doing \nan outstanding job in her first year as ranking member of the \nsubcommittee; and all the hard-working staff on both sides of the \naisle.\n  However, while I appreciate the chairman's willingness to accommodate \nsome Democratic priorities, this\n\n[[Page H4727]]\n\nis the latest in a series of bills that drastically shortchanges job-\ncreating investments and vital environmental protections, while \ncarrying a wish list of special interest giveaways that hurt hard-\nworking American families' health and safety.\n  The President proposed to end sequestration through more reasonable \nand realistic budgeting 4 months ago, but Republicans have yet to \nengage on finding a workable solution. How much longer do we have to \nplay this charade, the Republican shutdown strategy, before the House \nconsiders bills that could be enacted?\n  Refusing to adopt a sufficient overall allocation for discretionary \ninvestments has led to a bill that severely underfunds far too many \npriorities.\n  The EPA would be slashed $1.17 billion below the President's request, \n$718 million below the 2015 enacted level. Such a draconian cut would \ntake EPA investments back to 1997 levels.\n  Capital programs are dramatically underfunded, with Indian Health \nfacilities receiving $173 million less than the President's request.\n  Over half a billion dollars in cuts to the State revolving funds \nendanger our Nation's water infrastructure, cutting 32,000 construction \njobs on 207 projects, risking public health with fewer water and \ndrinking water projects.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund, which conserves irreplaceable \nlands and improves outdoor recreation opportunities, would be cut by 30 \npercent below the current level.\n  Unsurprisingly, the majority seeks to dismantle critical \nenvironmental protections in the bill that are supposed to advance \nenvironmental initiatives.\n  In a demonstration of solidarity with climate change deniers and the \ncoal industry, the majority would prevent the administration from \nadvancing new rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Despite the fact that it harmonizes existing activities to protect \nthe environment, 2.8 million ocean industry jobs, $282 billion in GDP \ngenerated by ocean industries in coastal States, the National Ocean \nPolicy's implementation would be blocked.\n  Once again, the majority has waged war on the Endangered Species Act, \nplacing politics above science and jeopardizing the protection of \nprecious species, including wolves.\n  Instead of allowing the United States to lead the world to end the \ntrade of ivory, the Fish and Wildlife Service's efforts would be rolled \nback.\n  Given the number of unnecessary riders, it is particularly \ndisappointing that the majority didn't include our colleague, Mr. \nSimpson's wildfire bill, an excellent proposal that would improve our \nability to prepare for and respond to disasters.\n  Democrats are more than willing to find a balanced and fiscally \nresponsible way to lift the sequester that is strangling our \ninvestments in America's future and invest in a stronger defense, \nbetter infrastructure, and bigger paycheck for America's hard-working \nfamilies.\n  I hope that, as we move forward, this bill makes those investments \nand sheds unnecessary policy changes. I urge my colleagues to oppose \nthis misguided bill.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins), our new hard-working \nmember.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I want to express my \nappreciation to your hard work and to the ranking member, to your \nstaff, and all who have worked so hard on this legislation.\n  This bill is notable for what it funds and what it doesn't fund.\n  West Virginians, we love our clean water. We love clean air. We love \nour mountains and our forests and our rivers.\n  What West Virginians do not love is this President's war on coal. \nThis week, petitions from 26,000 West Virginians were delivered to my \noffice asking the President to stop the war on coal. West Virginia's \njobs and our citizens' livelihoods are on the line. The President has \nrequested hundreds of millions of dollars to spend on new regulations, \nprograms, and an army of lawyers to defend his illegal regulatory \noverreach.\n\n  Our State has lost 7,000 coal jobs in just the last 3 years of this \nadministration. Today, we say ``no'' to funding the war on coal, ``no'' \nto regulatory overreach. We do cut the EPA's budget by more than $1 \nbillion from what was requested. We halt harmful, job-killing rules on \nnew and existing coal-fired power plants.\n  We say no to changing the definition of navigable waters and fill \nmaterial, no to imposing ozone regulations that are simply \nunachievable, and no to imposing the stream buffer zone rule.\n  The Administrator of the EPA even refused to come to West Virginia to \ntalk to our communities and hard-working coal miners, but instead, when \nshe refused, I brought coal miners to the Appropriations Committee to \ntell their story, and it was a powerful story.\n  Today, I am here with 26,000 other voices to make sure they are heard \nhere at the Capitol.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership. Thank you for the hard \nwork.\n  I would appreciate a ``yes'' vote on this important legislation\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Kilmer), a member of the subcommittee who is very \nvalued.\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking the \nsubcommittee chairman, my friend from California, and the ranking \nmember, my friend from Minnesota, for the hard work that they have put \ninto today's bill.\n  As a new member of the committee, I have gotten to see firsthand the \nenormous amount of work that went into the product that we have before \nus today, and it is, frankly, a testament to the hard work of the \nAppropriations Committee staff that we have been able to get to this \npoint.\n  I want to begin by expressing support for a number of really \nimportant provisions in the bill that I think are critical points of \nprogress. In a very tough budget environment, this bill boosts funding \nfor the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service, \nincreasing the Federal commitment to addressing the needs of Indian \nCountry.\n  Coming from timber country, I can say that there is also a very \nstrong effort here to ensure that the Forest Service can responsibly \nincrease harvest levels on our national forests, as well as supporting \nnew tools, such as collaboratives, that have the potential to bring \nfolks together in a way that reduces the litigation risk surrounding \nthese projects.\n  Of course, I would love for us to be able include in this bill Mr. \nSimpson's legislation addressing wildfire disaster funding. I have \nheard from so many people in my neck of the woods just how important it \nis that we get this taken care of it.\n  The bill also provides essential resources to support recovery \nefforts in the Puget Sound. As both the chairman and ranking member of \nthe subcommittee know, this is big deal, both for our natural \nenvironment and for our economy; and I will continue working with them \nto make sure we are dedicating the needed resources for this critical \neffort.\n  Unfortunately, I will have to oppose the bill before us today. This \nbill comes in at $2 billion below the President's budget request. It \nwould cut funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It fails to \nmake needed investments in the National Park System and takes a meat \naxe to the Environmental Protection Agency and the programs that \nprotect clean water.\n  Mr. Chairman, to conclude, let me just say we need to come together \nin a bipartisan way to end sequestration, to remove these budget caps, \nand to work on bipartisan bills that make the investments our Nation \nneeds to boost economic development and protect our natural resources \nfor future generations.\n  I hope we do that, and I am eager to be a partner in doing that.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter) for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to thank \nyou and the Appropriations Committee for its hard work on bringing this \nimportant legislation to the floor.\n  As you know, we have been working with your staff on an issue of \ngreat importance to the Port of Savannah, which services 40 percent of \nAmerican consumers.\n  Since 1940, the National Park Service has leased a small parcel of \nland on\n\n[[Page H4728]]\n\nCockspur Island within the Fort Pulaski National Monument to the \nSavannah Bar Pilots. The bar pilots help navigate large ships through \nthe Savannah River channel to the port and have done so from Cockspur \nIsland since as far as back as the 1730s.\n  In 2011, at the request of the Park Service, Congress passed \nlegislation to change the relationship between the bar pilots and the \nPark Service. With enactment of the Fort Pulaski National Monument \nLease Authorization Act, Public Law 112-69, the relationship between \nthe bar pilots and Park Service was shifted from a series of special \nuse permits to a noncompete lease of up to 10 years.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  At the time of consideration of the legislation, the Congressional \nBudget Office estimated the annual lease fee for the bar pilots would \nbe $25,000, a slight increase from their existing rate based on a 2008 \nappraisal conducted by the Park Service.\n  It has come to my attention that the Park Service is attempting to \nuse passage of the legislation to increase the lease fee by as much as \ntenfold. This is extremely problematic because such an increase could \nthreaten to force the bar pilots off Cockspur Island.\n  Simply given their history on the island, the idea of forcing the bar \npilots to relocate is inappropriate, in and of itself. However, this is \nmore troubling when you realize that pilotage services are required by \nlaw, so vessels are required to use their services to move in and out \nof the Port of Savannah, and there is no other known location from \nwhich pilots could operate more efficiently.\n  Moving the facility could lead to longer transit times for vessels, \nincreased safety risk in foul weather, delays in ship movement, and \ngreater fuel usage for pilots and vessels waiting to call on the Port \nof Savannah.\n  The resulting environmental and economic harm would significantly \nincrease costs and could threaten growth at the Port of Savannah just \nas the Federal Government embarks on the construction phase of the $706 \nmillion Savannah Harbor Expansion Project.\n  The legislation passed in 2011 was intended to create a long-term fix \nto the permitting issue, not to create an outlet by which the National \nPark Service could continuously raise fees to exorbitant levels.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would request your support of our efforts to find an \nequitable and timely resolution to this matter that reflects Congress' \nintent and establishes a process for ensuring that the pilots are \ncharged only fair market value in line with previous National Park \nService appraisals and that they are able to continue operating from \ntheir current location on Cockspur Island.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for bringing this \nmatter to my attention. I share your concerns that this change could \nnegatively impact the growth at the Port of Savannah just as work \nbegins on the expansion project.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.\n  I would note that, in testimony before the Senate, National Park \nService Associate Director Stephen Whitesell testified that the \nSavannah bar pilots have operated ``with virtually no adverse impact on \npark resources, on the visitor experience, or on park operations.''\n  The legislation that passed at the request of the Park Service in \n2011 was supposed to simply improve the legal basis through which the \nbar pilots and the Park Service entered into a contract.\n  I am committed to continuing to work with you to find an equitable \nand timely solution to this matter that ensures the Fort Pulaski \nNational Monument Lease Authorization Act is appropriately implemented \nand that the bar pilots are not forced to move from Cockspur Island.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your attention to \nthis issue and for your service in shepherding this important \nlegislation through the legislative process.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nOhio (Ms. Kaptur), a colleague of mine on the Appropriations Committee.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman from Minnesota, \nRanking Member McCollum, as well as Chairman Ken Calvert of California \nfor working with me to include important language relative to the \nNational Park Service.\n  Specifically, the report addresses a threat to a significant part of \nthe history of the region I represent, the Battle of Lake Erie that \npaved the way for America's expansion beyond 13 colonies, commemorated \nby Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial at Put-In-Bay, \nOhio.\n  Perry's Memorial is at the heart of coastal tourism in Ohio, \nattracting 130,000 visitors just last year, and more than double as \nmany people were reached through their educational activities.\n  Despite its popularity, this site has been unnecessarily targeted for \nconsolidation. The idea that resources and, more importantly, \nmanagement of this popular site would shift to a noncontiguous, smaller \ninstallation in a different State is both concerning and, frankly, \nquite puzzling.\n  Reporting requirements included with the bill are there to ensure \nthat Perry's Memorial will continue operating as a stand-alone site.\n  I would also ask the chairman and ranking member to continue working \nwith me to address this need moving forward to ensure that this \nmisguided consolidation plan is stopped.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I am certainly happy to continue to work with \nthe gentlewoman from Minnesota and to address her concerns as this \nprocess continues.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman very much, and I thank the ranking \nmember.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. The gentlewoman from Ohio has my commitment to work \nwith the chairman to resolve it.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank both the chairman and ranking member.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Gibbs).\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2822, the \nDepartment of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 2016.\n  This bill responsibly ensures the EPA's regulatory overreach is \nchecked by Congress. Key provisions included will stop the EPA's most \nburdensome and damaging regulations and encourage opportunities for \nwater infrastructure investment.\n  This bill ensures that the EPA cannot use resources to expand the \ndefinitions of the ``waters of the United States'' and ``fill \nmaterial'' beyond what Congress wrote in the Clean Water Act. As the \nKing v. Burwell case just taught us, this administration is eager to \nredefine words to suit their purposes. This House must stand up to \nthem, and in this bill, we are.\n  These key provisions are excellent backstops for ensuring the EPA's \nclean water rule does not move forward in implementation because this \nrule is nothing more than a Federal power grab and a substantial \nexpansion of Clean Water Act jurisdiction. Even the agencies \nimplementing this rule have concerns about the clarity of its changes.\n  I am also pleased to see the committee supports an integrated \nplanning approach to help communities affordably manage and meet their \nburdensome regulatory obligations under the Clean Water Act. \nCommunities face enormous financial pressure to have quality services \nfor its residents, including clean water. This approach can potentially \nsave ratepayers millions of dollars while focusing clean water \ninvestments in a way that ensures the greatest water quality benefit.\n  Lastly, this bill encourages the implementation of the bipartisan \npilot program, Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, better \nknown as WIFIA, that was authorized under WRRDA in 2014.\n  Provisions offered in this legislation will set the stage for EPA to \nimplement WIFIA loans in fiscal years 2017 to provide credit assistance \nfor water resource infrastructure projects and act as a complement to \nthe major source of Federal investment in water\n\n[[Page H4729]]\n\ninfrastructure, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, known as the SRF. \nThis program will provide communities increased options and flexibility \nfor funding their critical water infrastructure projects.\n  I thank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for recognizing \nthe importance of these provisions and for putting together a bill that \nsets appropriate levels for agencies and programs.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMaine (Ms. Pingree), a thoughtful and valued member of the \nsubcommittee.\n  Ms. PINGREE. I thank the ranking member for yielding me time and for \nthe nice comments and the ability to work with her on the committee. I \ndo appreciate the work of the Chair and the ranking member very much on \nthis bill.\n  Mr. Chair, there are so many important programs that are funded in \nthe Department of Interior Appropriations bill. I am proud to be on \nthis committee and particularly to serve on this subcommittee.\n  Today's bill was written by a very good chairman in conjunction with \na great ranking member, but at the end of the day, the funding levels \nare still too low. We cannot get bipartisan support on this bill when \nthere are not enough dollars to go around. The reality is we need to \nget rid of the sequester, roll back the Budget Control Act caps, and \npass these bills with funding levels that move our country forward, not \nbackward.\n  As so many of my colleagues have stated, when adjusted for inflation, \nthis bill provides less than the appropriated levels in FY 2005. That \nis just not sufficient for the vital programs in this bill, programs \nthat monitor and protect the water we drink and the air we breathe and \nregulate the products we use.\n  There are some highlights in today's bill, such as the Bureau of \nIndian Education construction budget and the Forest Legacy program and \nthe international forestry accounts, and I am glad to see them there, \nbut there is so much more to be concerned about.\n  I am deeply disappointed in the cut to the Fish and Wildlife Service \nendangered species listing program, which is cut by 50 percent, and the \noverall Land and Water Conservation Fund cuts. This overall Land and \nWater Conservation Fund level is 20 percent less than last year, and \nthat is very frustrating, knowing how important this program is to \nevery single congressional district in the country.\n  I am concerned that programs such as the Aquatic Animal Drug Approval \nPartnership Program are funded at last year's level--and no higher--\nwhen we really need to understand the diseases that affect our fish and \nestablish treatment options to protect them.\n  The U.S. Geological Survey that funds critical research programs and \nthe monitoring of climate change, stormwater gauges, earthquake and \nweather research is also funded only at last year's level.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the \nHumanities were denied the additional resources they requested, \nincluding funds that would have been used to increase programming for \nour veterans and wounded warriors.\n  For those of us in Maine who are so proud of our national park, \nAcadia National Park, and are strong supporters of parks across the \ncountry, there is simply not enough funding. There are not enough \ndollars for the improvements and maintenance that is needed in any \ngiven year, but particularly needed in this special centennial year.\n  The National Park centennial is a once in a lifetime opportunity for \nus to highlight our parks and help millions of Americans who have not \nbeen to a national park before to see our Nation's greatest treasures.\n  Again, I recognize completely the position that this subcommittee and \nour other subcommittees have been in because of the Budget Control Act \ncaps, but these programs deserve more.\n  I look forward to working with our chair and ranking member as this \nbill moves forward, to try to improve the areas that still need \nattention.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, it is my pleasures to yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to \nthe gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Chairman, today, I rise in support of H.R. 2822, the \nDepartment of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act of 2016.\n  It is no secret that the EPA is out of control. I think everybody \nacross this great land knows that. A few weeks ago, the EPA issued \ntheir final rule to redefine waters of the U.S., completely ignoring \nthe will of the House and stakeholders all across America.\n\n  Under this rule change, waters of the U.S. would now include smaller \nbodies of water and even some dry land. In fact, this new definition \nwould extend the EPA's regulatory reach to seemingly any body of water, \nincluding that water puddled in your ditch after a rain storm. Yes, you \nheard me right.\n  I have heard from small-business owners, farmers, Realtors, and \nhomebuilders in my district; and they are all concerned about the \nnegative impact this rule could have--and rightly so. This rule is so \nbroad that it could very well require them to get permission from a \nFederal bureaucrat before acting on their own property.\n  I commend Chairman Calvert and the other members of the committee for \nincluding language in this appropriations bill to prohibit any funds \nfrom being used to implement this new rule.\n  I am proud to support this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is \nleft?\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota has 9 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nRhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a valued Member of this body.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. I thank the gentlewoman, my friend, for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise today to oppose this legislation for many reasons \nbut, in particular, because it vastly underfunds the operation of our \nnational parks, as well as many other important priorities.\n  Next August, the National Park Service will celebrate its 100th \nanniversary. Our national parks are the envy of the world and serve as \na model for their emphasis on conservation.\n  The National Park System accounts for more than 400 parks, heritage \nareas, monuments, and the historical sites; occupies more than 84 \nmillion acres of land in all 50 States; and is home to more than 1,000 \nendangered or threatened animal species. It is the responsibility of \nthe National Park Service to preserve these sites so that future \ngenerations may enjoy them.\n  Our national parks tell a rich story of our stunning landscapes, \nnatural wonders, and historic sites. From Yosemite National Park in \nCalifornia to Mammoth Cave--the world's longest known cave system, in \nKentucky--to the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee and North Carolina, \nour national parks are an essential part of the American fabric and \nhave been called America's best idea.\n  This bill appropriates approximately $2.33 billion for the operation \nof the National Park System over the next year. This is more than $187 \nmillion below the amount that was requested by the President. This \naccount funds the critical needs of our National Park System, such as \nsupport services for new responsibilities within the system, resource \nstewardship, and facilities management.\n  The National Park System is a significant driver of economic \nactivity. More than 275 million people visit our national parks each \nyear. In 2013, it was estimated that every dollar invested in the \nNational Park Service saw a return of $10.\n  We need to do better in ensuring that this economic engine and beacon \nof American tourism is operating at the highest level so that it can \ncontinue to fulfill its vital economic, environmental, and cultural \nrole.\n  Ensuring that the National Park Service has proper funding for \noperation ensures that we are able to preserve the story of our \ncountry's development into the Nation that it is today.\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, the Blackstone River Valley \nNational Historical Park, created last year after I sponsored \nlegislation in the House in cooperation with Senator Jack Reed in the \nSenate, marks the birthplace of the American industrial revolution.\n  Sites like old Slater Mill in Pawtucket and the Museum of Work and\n\n[[Page H4730]]\n\nCulture in Woonsocket help tell the story of how America became an \neconomic superpower.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  It embodies our Nation's economic, environmental, social, and \ncultural transformation. In the best spirit of the National Park \nService, the Blackstone River Valley tells a nationally significant \nmultidimensional story. It illustrates how a beautiful natural \nlandscape and powerful waterways fueled the industrial revolution and \nlaunched far-reaching changes to our Nation's economy and social \nstructure.\n  Blackstone serves only as one example of why it is essential that our \nnational parks are properly funded and are able to operate in a manner \nin which millions of Americans continue to appreciate the storied \nhistory of our Nation.\n  It is long past time to end sequester and set spending levels that \nmeet our current responsibilities to be good stewards of the \nenvironment and protect the natural beauty of America.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNevada (Ms. Titus), a valued Member of this body.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member for yielding me the \ntime.\n  You know, my Republican colleagues have made no secret about the fact \nthat they want to strangle the EPA and undermine its vital \nenvironmental work, but they make little mention of how this bill also \nthreatens our national security.\n  I represent Las Vegas, which is the home of a number of critical \nradiation response programs, including one of the only two EPA mobile \nfield labs that can quickly be deployed should a radiological incident \noccur anywhere in the West. They can process air, soil, and water \nsamples.\n  Because of ongoing budget cuts led by the Republicans, however, EPA \nwill soon be moving this unit to Montgomery, Alabama, and \ndecommissioning its other mobile lab. That will leave the whole country \nwith only one EPA radiation response lab, which will be located over \n2,000 miles from Los Angeles, 2,600 miles from Seattle, and 1,800 miles \nfrom Las Vegas and the Nevada test site.\n  Now, Republicans may be willing to gamble our health and safety to \nsatisfy their corporate friends, but I am not, and that is why I am \nasking my colleagues to vote against this legislation and fund our \nagencies at levels necessary to protect our national security.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I reserve the balance of my time to close.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I do not have an update on the Member \nthat I am waiting for.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I will just say that this is a good bill. \nA lot of work has gone into it, and I would make sure that everyone \nvotes for it because it is a fine bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chair, let me thank our Ranking Member, Congresswoman \nMcCollum, for yielding, and for her tremendous leadership of this \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. Chair, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Interior and Environment bill \nbefore us would place health and safety of all Americans at risk. It \ndangerously cuts finding by $246 million from FY2015 levels and is $3.1 \nbillion less than the President's FY2016 request.\n  The deep cuts to this bill would undermine our air quality, land, \nwater and conservation funding and will have devastating impacts on all \ncommunities in my home state of California and across the country.\n  What's worse--this bill slashes funding for the Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) by more than 700 million dollars--from FY2015 \nlevels and funds the agency at more than a billion dollars less than \nthe President's FY2016 request. These profound cuts would significantly \nharm the Clean Water Fund and the Safe Drinking Water Fund--critical \nprograms that ensure the safety of our drinking water and our children.\n  It also includes $40 million in cuts to the Historic Preservation \nFund (HPP), which would weaken the National Park Services' (NPS) \nability to preserve sites significant in the Civil Rights Movement. \nThis includes sites like the Selma to Montgomery National Historic \nTrail, where many of us participated in the commemoration of the 50th \nAnniversary of Bloody Sunday.\n  Furthermore, there are also egregious policy riders in this bill that \nwould block clean air protections, such as the EPA's Clean Power Plan.\n  Too many families, particularly those in low-income, vulnerable \ncommunities, already suffer from poor air quality because of dirty \ncarbon pollution.\n  We know that communities of color are disproportionately affected by \npollution-related illnesses, including asthma. According to the \nAmerican Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology, one in six African \nAmerican and one in nine Latino children suffer from asthma.\n  There are other toxic policy riders that would block the protection \nof our imperiled wildlife under the Endangered Species Act, like the \nGreater Sage Grouse population.\n  The Endangered Species Act is the only law that has safeguarded more \nthan 2,000 plants and wildlife from extinction. This law enjoys broad \nsupport from nearly 85 percent of Americans. And yet here we are again, \nwith a bill that seeks to undermine decades of, animal protection and \nruns counter to vast public support.\n  Mr. Chair, we need to continue to fight to defend our environment, \naddress climate change, and make real, meaningful impacts on reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions so we protect our environment, our children \nand our future.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us does just the opposite.\n  I hope that as this process moves forward, we can address the \ninsufficient funding allocations and backwards policy riders that would \nharm every American and put our precious environment at risk.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general date has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  During consideration of the bill for amendment each amendment shall \nbe debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the \nproponent and an opponent and shall not be subject to amendment. No pro \nforma amendment shall be in order except that the chair and ranking \nminority member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective \ndesignees may offer up to 10 pro forma amendments each at any point for \nthe purpose of debate. The chair of the Committee of the Whole may \naccord priority in recognition on the basis of whether the Member \noffering an amendment has caused it to be printed in the portion of the \nCongressional Record designated for that purpose. Amendments so printed \nshall be considered read.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2822\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following sums are appropriated, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the Department of \n     the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other \n     purposes, namely:\n\n                  TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\n\n                       Bureau of Land Management\n\n                   management of lands and resources\n\n       For necessary expenses for protection, use, improvement, \n     development, disposal, cadastral surveying, classification, \n     acquisition of easements and other interests in lands, and \n     performance of other functions, including maintenance of \n     facilities, as authorized by law, in the management of lands \n     and their resources under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of \n     Land Management, including the general administration of the \n     Bureau, and assessment of mineral potential of public lands \n     pursuant to section 1010(a) of Public Law 96-487 (16 U.S.C. \n     3150(a)), $1,015,046,000, to remain available until expended, \n     including all such amounts as are collected from permit \n     processing fees, as authorized but made subject to future \n     appropriation by section 35(d)(3)(A)(i) of the Mineral \n     Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 191), except that amounts from permit \n     processing fees may be used for any bureau-related expenses \n     associated with the processing of oil and gas applications \n     for permits to drill and related use of authorizations; of \n     which $3,000,000 shall be available in fiscal year 2016 \n     subject to a match by at least an equal amount by the \n     National Fish and Wildlife Foundation for cost-shared \n     projects supporting conservation of Bureau lands; and such \n     funds shall be advanced to the Foundation as a lump-sum grant \n     without regard to when expenses are incurred.\n\n\n                 Amendment Offered by Mr. Poe of Texas\n\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page H4731]]\n\n\n       Page 2, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $1,000,000)(increased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from Texas \nand a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is really relatively \nsimple. It takes $1 million from the Bureau of Land Management's \nmanagement of lands account and inserts it right back into the account \nwith the intent of identifying unused land for potential sale to \nAmericans.\n  The service charges, deposits, and forfeitures account already has \nthe authority to dispose of land under the Bureau of Land Management, \nbut is not specifically appropriated funds.\n  Today, Mr. Chairman, the United States Government owns and controls \n640 million acres of American land. This is 27 percent of the entire \nlandmass in the United States. If you take all of the countries in \nWestern Europe, the United States Government, Uncle Sam, owns that much \nland and more.\n  In this poster to my left, the red portions of the poster identify \nland that is owned by Uncle Sam, the Federal Government. The white \nportions, of course, are land that is owned by private entities. \nIncluded in the red area is Alaska. The red area represents 27 percent \nof the landmass in the United States. A lot of this land is unused, and \nit is not even managed by the Federal Government. It is just sitting in \nthese different parts of the country.\n  This amendment is very simple. It tells the Bureau of Land Management \nto study the possibility of selling some of this land back to \nAmericans. Let Americans own America, not all of it. We are not talking \nabout the national parks, the national forests. We are not talking \nabout Yosemite. We are talking about the unused abandoned land in the \nUnited States, but yet it is still owned by this Federal Government.\n  That is what this amendment does; it is to require a study take \nplace.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask that this amendment be adopted.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Poe of Texas).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Flores\n\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 20, insert ``(increased by $5,000,000)'' \n     after the dollar amount.\n       On page 62, line 8, insert ``(reduced by $12,307,693)'' \n     after the dollar amount.\n       On page 75, line 14, insert ``(increased by $5,000,000)'' \n     after the dollar amount.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from Texas \nand a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment, along \nwith my friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) and my friend from \nNorth Dakota (Mr. Cramer).\n  This amendment will address an energy infrastructure issue that faces \nour Nation today, as well as continuing regulatory overreach by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  We all know that the American shale revolution has dramatically \nimproved our energy security at home and our economic opportunity for \nhard-working Americans. The United States is now the number one \nproducer of oil and gas in the world, yet we are in the midst of new \nchallenges due to a lack of appropriate infrastructure to bring those \nresources to our consumers.\n  Also, the EPA has recently reported that methane emissions from oil \nand gas wells are down 79 percent since 2005, and total methane \nemissions from natural gas systems are down 11 percent since that same \nyear. However, the administration intends to propose another regulation \nthat only results in more bureaucratic red tape and higher energy \ncosts. This does nothing to address the underlying issue.\n  There is a better solution, which not only achieves lower greenhouse \ngas emissions, but also improves the outcomes for the American \ntaxpayer.\n  My amendment would increase the amount of funds made available to \nboth the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service by $5 \nmillion each to help expedite the approval of additional pipeline \ninfrastructure that would more efficiently and more cleanly deliver our \ntaxpayer-owned resources to consumers. This will ensure that the BLM \nand the Forest Service have the appropriate resources to permit rights-\nof-way for gathering lines on Federal lands. This increase would be \noffset by a very modest reduction of less than one-half of 1 percent to \nthe EPA environmental programs and management accounts.\n  It is important that we safely bring these natural resources to \nmarket using the latest low-emissions, cutting-edge technology. \nPermitting and constructing this critical infrastructure is beneficial \nto the environment since natural gas could be transported, processed, \nand sold to consumers instead of being vented or flared, which creates \nthe greenhouse gas problems.\n  Finally, constructing more pipelines furthers our country's ongoing \nenergy renaissance, while creating more jobs and growing our economy. A \nrecent API study shows over 1.1 million jobs on average per year and \nover $1.1 trillion in capital investments will be generated by updating \nour domestic midstream infrastructure.\n  So, in a nutshell, my amendment provides three great outcomes: first, \nit reduces greenhouse gas emissions; second, it provides critical \ninfrastructure to safely transport taxpayer-owned resources to consumer \nmarkets; and third, it promotes good-paying American jobs for these \nhard-working American families.\n  I also want to take a second to compliment and thank my friend from \nCalifornia (Mr. Calvert) and all of the subcommittee members and all of \nthe subcommittee staff for such a great job on this Interior \nAppropriations bill.\n  I urge our Members to support my amendment and to support the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FLORES. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I like the amendment. I would accept that amendment.\n  Mr. FLORES. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman's amendment would cut $12 \nmillion from the Environmental Protection Agency program and shift $5 \nmillion to the Bureau of Land Management and $5 million to the Forest \nService.\n  Now, I know cutting the EPA is an easy target for many of my \ncolleagues across here on the other side of the aisle, but I want to \nassure my colleagues and understand if this amendment were to be \nadopted, this account funds program is important to both sides of the \naisle. For example, it includes permitting for construction projects \nacross the country; toxic risk prevention, part of the successful \nbrownfields program; pesticide licensing; indoor air quality; \nradiation.\n  Quite frankly, the EPA's work goes beyond the political talking point \nof various regulations, and it is necessary to keep this valuable \nAgency able to do the functions it needs to do to protect public \nhealth.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I want to make sure that everybody knows \nthat this cuts one-half of 1 percent from the EPA to hopefully help \nstop them from pursuing a regulatory scheme where the industry is \nalready working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and then it takes \nthat money and puts it into accounts where we actually achieve \ngreenhouse gas reductions and we bring taxpayer-owned resources to \nmarket in a clean, safe, and efficient way.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  My amendment accomplishes all of those things: reduces greenhouse gas \nemissions, better jobs, and better infrastructure for hard-working \nAmericans.\n  Again, I ask all Members to support my amendment and to support the \nunderlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Flores).\n\n[[Page H4732]]\n\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Garamendi\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 2, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $14,000,000)''.\n       Page 18, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $11,611,000)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from \nCalifornia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, in listening to the previous debate, I \nwould certainly agree we have made great strides in America in \naccessing oil and gas, so much so that we have now become almost energy \nindependent, all for the good. All of that has happened in the last 7 \nto 8 years, and we are thankful for that.\n  However, this appropriation has more money than needed. The \nadministration has asked for about $32 million less.\n  I would like my colleagues to take a look at where we really do need \nto spend some money. This amendment that I am proposing deals with \nthis. This is California's water situation today. The great Central \nValley of California is rapidly depleting its aquifers. The water \nresources that agriculture and communities depend upon are rapidly \ndepleting.\n  This amendment would move about $11,611,000 to the USGS, to \nGeological Survey, for the purposes of studying the aquifers of \nCalifornia. Now, keep in mind that the State of California voters \napproved a $7 billion bond act of which a good portion of that money is \nfor underground aquifer storage.\n  We have to have the science; we have to have the engineering to go \nwith it, and this amendment would provide the additional money that the \nUSGS needs in order to do the surveys and the engineering and \nunderstanding the geology of those areas where we might be able to have \nthe aquifers replenished. That is what it is all about.\n  This leaves plenty of money behind for the purposes that the \ncommittee has identified in the approval and the permitting of mineral \nand gas and oil resources.\n  I see my colleague from California, who is well aware of these \nissues, including aquifers in the San Fernando and the Santa Anna \naquifer area, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Marchant). The gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I don't necessarily oppose where the \ngentleman wants to go; I just oppose the offset right now because, \nunder the budget scenario that we are operating under, we obviously \nhave cut back a lot of these agencies somewhat.\n  I am sympathetic to the job that the United States Geological Survey \nhas. As you know, in California, we probably have the most adjudicated \nwater rights in the world. I will work on this in the future as this \nprocess moves forward.\n  If it is necessary, after some conversations with USGS, that they \nneed additional resources, I will be happy to work with the gentleman \nto attempt to do so, but this offset, we could not accept at this time.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman.\n  Certainly, the chairman understands the issues of water in \nCalifornia, as well as anyone does, and also understands that, in order \nfor us to meet the current and certainly any future drought, we are \ngoing to have to use the aquifers, which will require the services and \nthe knowledge and capability of the U.S. Geological Survey to fully \ncomprehend the potential that the various aquifers have throughout the \nState, those in southern California, as well as the Central Valley and \ncoastal areas.\n  I would be delighted working with the chairman as the process moves \nalong and see if we might be able to find sufficient money and address \nthe specific needs of aquifer surveys by the USGS. I look forward to \nworking with the gentleman on that.\n  Rather than taking a ``no'' vote on this and going to a vote, I heard \nthe gentleman suggest that we can work together and quite possibly \nsolve this problem.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Yoho\n\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 2, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $25,325,000)''.\n       Page 132, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $25,325,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Calvert and the \nranking members for the fine work they have done on H.R. 2822. I think, \noverall, it is a great bill.\n  What my amendment does is move over $25 million from the Bureau of \nLand Management's law enforcement activities and transfer that money \ninto the deficit savings account.\n  Just a brief cap, BLM, Bureau of Land Management, has a force of \nroughly 200 uniformed officers and 70 criminal investigators on staff \nenforcing a wide range of laws. In addition, the FBI has 35,000 agents; \nthe Department of Homeland Security has over 70,000 enforcement agents; \nthe IRS has over 3,700 criminal investigation employees, including \n2,600 special agents; the ATF has over 2,500 special agents; and the \nDEA has over 5,000.\n  With just those five agencies, there are over 115,000 national law \nagents in just these five agencies. I feel that we have enough Federal \nagencies to deal with the problem to enforce the laws on the books, \nespecially when we are talking about the violations on Federal lands.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman's amendment would cut $25 \nmillion from the Bureau of Land Management program and put the savings \ninto the so-called spending reduction account.\n  The gentleman pointed out that he plans on reducing that amount on \nlaw enforcement in the Bureau of Land Management. The employees who are \nout doing this work are already overstretched and find themselves \nsometimes in very dangerous positions.\n  The BLM is the caretaker of our Nation's public lands. They protect \none-eighth of the country. I think that we should make sure that BLM \nlaw enforcement is able to do their job, do their job safely, come home \nto their families, and protect America's resources.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. YOHO. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman knows, I am a westerner. \nAs was pointed out by Mr. Poe, a significant amount of the West is in \nBLM control. In dealing with the BLM over the years, they have a lot of \nland mass that they deal with, and they also work with the Native \nAmerican tribes and others dealing with really a restricted number of \nlaw enforcement.\n  We have commented and criticized about how well they operate, but I \nwould hope that we didn't have to do this because there is a \nconsiderable need for some law enforcement in those vast areas in which \nthe Federal Government owns throughout the Western United States.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, I agree with that. This amendment is about \npriorities.\n  I think with the state of the economy that we are on both sides, I \ndon't have to remind people that we have the debt ceiling coming up, \nand we are short of money; we have the highway trust fund that is going \nto come up again at the end of July, and we are short of money. I \nbelieve that the Federal Government has enough agents and more than \nenough debt for sure.\n\n[[Page H4733]]\n\n  I just encourage people to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  We get people from our district, and they talk to us about what \nhappened out in Nevada with the Cliven Bundy case. When you have the \nBureau of Land Management with SWAT capabilities showing up like they \ndo, we get asked: Why are agencies like this having that kind of \ntactical gear? Why do they have that kind of capacity?\n  This is not to weaken them in a sense, and we do have to patrol those \nareas. I just think, at this point in time, that $25 million would \nserve our debt.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this bill already is $246 million below \nthe FY 2015-enacted level. This amendment only causes further damage.\n  Let's look at what has been happening over the past decade. As the \nfunding has decreased, we know from committee hearings that the demands \non the BLM have increased. There are more oil and gas leases to manage \nto make sure that they are properly protected.\n  These issues that we deal with in the Bureau of Land Management, also \nwith law enforcement, is working directly with the public sometimes who \nare out recreating and accessing these lands.\n  I would just like, once again, to reiterate my strong opposition to \ncutting law enforcement for BLM.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, in lieu of what the chairman is saying, I \nwill withdraw the amendment at this time if we can have a serious \ndiscussion about the debt before September.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Garamendi\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 2, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $4,010,000)''.\n       Page 8, line 14, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $3,902,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, this bill deals with the very real \nproblem for delivering water to southern California.\n  Those people who are familiar with the way in which the California \nwater system works, water flows down the Sacramento River--I will just \nput this up here--water comes down the Sacramento River from the north \nand up the San Joaquin from the south.\n  It all gets to the delta where the massive pumps at Tracy pick the \nwater up, put it in the canals, and send it to the San Joaquin Valley \nand then on to southern California, Los Angeles, Orange County, and \nother cities in that massive urban area.\n  There is a problem in the delta, a lot of problems. One of the \nproblems is aquatic plants. The delta is being totally overrun by water \nhyacinths. Other parts of the United States and the West are also \nfinding these invasive water aquatic plants plugging their pumps, \nreducing water supply, eliminating opportunities for boating, \nrecreation, fishing, and the like.\n  What this amendment does is address that problem by adding $3,902,000 \nto the aquatic habitat and species conservation fund, thereby allowing \nthe Federal agencies to work with the State and local agencies to \nattack the aquatic plants.\n  Specifically in the delta, those who want to have more water flowing \nsouth to the San Joaquin Valley and southern California's great \nmetropolitan areas, including Orange County, ought to be in favor of \nunplugging the pumps and getting the water hyacinths reduced in the \ndelta.\n  That is what we would do. It is a very real problem; it is a problem \nthat exists today, and it is also money that comes from some 32 million \nmore dollars in this Bureau of Land Management oil and gas permitting \naccount than the President thought necessary. Surely, there is a little \nbit of room to move around so that southern California can have the \nwater that it needs.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate what the gentleman is \nattempting to do, again, on the offset.\n  Right now, the BLM is involved in this issue of the sage-grouse in \nthe West. We, in effect, gave both the BLM and the Fish and Wildlife \nService additional resources in order for us not to be in a position to \nlist the sage-grouse so as to make sure that we do what is necessary in \nthe sage ecosystem.\n  At the same time, we have plussed up conservation accounts within the \nFish and Wildlife Service for those types of invasive species. We have \na number of invasive species, not just in the plant world, but, \nobviously, we have this invasive clam, as you mentioned, that is \nstuffing up the quagga mussel, and that is causing disruptions \nthroughout the West.\n  I appreciate what the gentleman is trying to do. It is just that we \nare under the budget allocations we have. We have done what we can in \nboth of these accounts, which is to do good work on conservation and to \nmake sure we conserve species and get rid of bad species throughout the \nUnited States. I would hope the gentleman would withdraw his amendment, \nand I will work with him in the future on the other issue.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, the chairman is quite correct. We do \nhave a problem. We do have quagga mussels. We have this particular one, \nthe water hyacinths, and there are other aquatic invasive species that \nare causing havoc throughout the United States--certainly, the quagga \nmussel in the East, along the Great Lakes, Chicago and the rest--and \ncertainly in California. The energy systems at Hoover Dam, on the \nColorado River, are impeded by quagga mussels, and there is the delta \nwith water hyacinths, and there are other lakes and streams throughout \nthe West.\n  If we let this problem continue to grow, we are going to continue to \nhave less water and less power available to us. This is just under $4 \nmillion coming out of an account that was plussed up by some $32 \nmillion over and above what the administration thought necessary. I \nwould remind all of us that the administration has done a rather good \njob on permitting, so much so that we now have the greatest production \nof oil and gas ever in the United States, so much so that we are on the \nverge of becoming energy sufficient.\n  Do we need another $32 million to do what is already being done, or \nwould that $4 million of that $32 million be better spent in dealing \nwith the very real problem of trying to get water to the pumps so it \ncan go south to Orange County and to Los Angeles and to San Joaquin \nCounty?\n  Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with you, but I am going to \nask for a vote on this one.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, in closing, the plus up in the BLM account \nwas primarily to help resolve the issue in 11 States involving the \nsage-grouse, which is close to a listing, and we have a plus up in the \nFish and Wildlife Service accounts to recognize a real problem that \nhits 11 Western States.\n  We do not underestimate the problems in the West as they involve the \ndrought, and we are going to continue to work on that. Again, I would \noppose this based upon the offset.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       In addition, $39,696,000 is for Mining Law Administration \n     program operations, including the cost of administering the \n     mining\n\n[[Page H4734]]\n\n     claim fee program, to remain available until expended, to be \n     reduced by amounts collected by the Bureau and credited to \n     this appropriation from mining claim maintenance fees and \n     location fees that are hereby authorized for fiscal year \n     2016, so as to result in a final appropriation estimated at \n     not more than $1,015,046,000, and $2,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended, from communication site rental fees \n     established by the Bureau for the cost of administering \n     communication site activities.\n\n                            land acquisition\n\n       For expenses necessary to carry out sections 205, 206, and \n     318(d) of Public Law 94-579, including administrative \n     expenses and acquisition of lands or waters, or interests \n     therein, $7,250,000, to be derived from the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund and to remain available until expended.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Guinta\n\n  Mr. GUINTA.

Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom New Hampshire and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to the \nDepartment of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations bill in order to increase funding by $16 million for the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund.\n  Since 1977, LWCF receipts have been collected annually to \nspecifically fund Federal land acquisition, conserve threatened and \nendangered species, and provide grants to States. However, more than \n$18 billion has been syphoned from the LWCF trust fund since the \nprogram's inception in 1965, diverted from their original conservation \npurpose. Despite a history of underfunding, the LWCF remains a crucial \nFederal program to conserve our Nation's land, water, historic, and \nrecreational heritage.\n  As those in my home State of New Hampshire know, we are lucky to call \none of the most pristine ecological environments in the Nation our \nhome, and we understand firsthand LWCF's impact on both our State's \nnatural resources and on our access to hunting, fishing, and outdoor \nactivities. The LWCF is also an essential tool to expand public lands \nand to protect national parks, national wildlife refuges, national \nforests, wild and scenic river corridors, national scenic and historic \ntrails, the Bureau of Land Management lands, and other Federal areas.\n  I applaud the Appropriations Committee for its hard work on this \nimportant bill as it does prevent harmful executive overreach, reduces \nregulatory burdens on job creators and local communities, and it finds \nimportant savings for taxpayers. I certainly urge my colleagues to \nsupport the underlying bill, but given the importance of the LWCF \nprograms across the country and in New Hampshire, I believe more robust \nfunding for this particular program is important for the reasons I have \nstated.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, as the gentleman knows, the bill already \nprovides $87 million for other land acquisition. Our intent was to \nneedle a Federal land acquisition program that has strong support in \nthe East--certainly, in New Hampshire--and lukewarm support in the \nWest, where the government already owns a significant amount of real \nestate in the Western United States. When the conference begins on this \nbill with the Senate, Congress will exercise its power of the purse by \nselecting projects from the President's budget to improve recreational \naccess that have strong local, State, and congressional support.\n  I will work with the gentleman. I know he is a strong advocate of the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund, but this amendment might leave \nadvocates on both sides of the aisle with some difficult and \nunnecessary choices. Therefore, I ask the gentleman to consider \nwithdrawing his amendment, knowing I will be working with him in the \nfuture to see if we can't be of assistance through the conference \nprocess.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman, and I look forward to \nworking with him on this particular issue as it is important and \ncritical to New Hampshire.\n  I recognize the differences between the East and the West and the \nchallenges that we do face. Certainly, I support, again, the underlying \nbill, and I look forward to working with the chairman on this very \nimportant issue in New Hampshire.\n  Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom New Hampshire?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Garamendi\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 3. line 25, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $1,000,000) (increased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, to everyone here, this is one of those \namendments that really becomes a talking point amendment, but this is \nsomething we need to talk about. Our colleague, a moment ago, raised \nthe question of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In addition to \nthe words that he spoke, we need to be aware that, later this next \nmonth--in about 100 days, actually. I guess that is more than a month--\nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund is going to disappear. It needs to \nbe reauthorized, and I see on the floor here today the men and women \nwho are in a position to make that happen.\n  We really cannot lose this program. For example, there are projects \nin the Sequoia National Forest, which is in the majority leader's \ndistrict, that were funded through the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. There is a Galloway Park playground expansion in Clark County, \nOhio. I think we know in whose district that is--the Speaker's \ndistrict. The chairman of the subcommittee here is from San Bernardino. \nThere is the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument, \nand there is a Santa Ana River Trail and Parkway. I am sure the \nchairman is familiar with that parkway. These are all Land and Water \nConservation projects that, over the years, have been in place. We have \n100 days, and we have got some work to do here.\n  Is the money available? Yes. There is $18 billion in the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund, should it continue to exist, that has not been \nspent. It is sitting there. Well, I guess there is an IOU there. \nActually, the cash isn't there. There is an IOU because, over the \nyears, we have diverted money from the original purpose and law to \ntransfer that money over to all kinds of projects. Perhaps some of it \neven went to debt reduction. Nonetheless, it has not been used for its \nintended purpose and legal purpose, which is for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. Every year, over $900 million of royalties comes in \nfrom the oil and gas and energy companies for the public resources that \nthey mine or pump out of the earth. Only a small fraction of that money \nhas ever gone to the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  I want all of us to pay attention to this extraordinarily important \nprogram--a program that I was able to work with when I was Deputy \nSecretary at the Department of the Interior, overseeing the projects in \nall of\n\n[[Page H4735]]\n\nour districts--parks, local parks, some of the big national parks, \nincluding national forests, such as the one in Mr. McCarthy's district.\n  Why are we not moving aggressively to reauthorize the Land and Water \nConservation Fund? Why is it that, every year, we deny the public, \nwhether it is a playground or a swimming pool or a park expansion \nplayground in Ohio, the opportunity for better lives in their own \ncommunities?\n  I do not understand, and I don't think that if any of us were to \nthink about this for any amount of time that we would not say, yes, \nlet's reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Let's not let \nit expire. Let's make sure that the money that was intended for it--the \nroyalties from the resources of this great Nation--be spent on \nproviding for the projects that all of America can enjoy. That is what \nit is all about.\n  I don't know if I will go to a vote on this one, but I have, in my \nview here, leaders in the House who really have the power and, I think, \nthe obligation to make sure the LWCF, the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, is reauthorized and that we adequately fund it. I achieved, at \nleast, my own goal of talking about something that I believe to be \nimportant.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                   oregon and california grant lands\n\n       For expenses necessary for management, protection, and \n     development of resources and for construction, operation, and \n     maintenance of access roads, reforestation, and other \n     improvements on the revested Oregon and California Railroad \n     grant lands, on other Federal lands in the Oregon and \n     California land-grant counties of Oregon, and on adjacent \n     rights-of-way;

By my amendment, we \nask that an extra $1 million be added to this account. We are \noffsetting the increase by taking $1 million from the $2.4 billion \nEnvironmental Protection Agency programs and management account, hardly \na stretch.\n  The National Wildlife Refuge System has grown to over 563 national \nwildlife refuge and 38 wetland management districts, 150 million acres \nin all. We have several of these national wildlife refuges in my \ndistrict or near my district, including J.N. ``Ding'' Darling National \nWildlife Refuge on Sanibel Island and the Florida Panther National \nWildlife Refuge outside of Naples.\n  The ``Ding'' Darling National Wildlife Refuge, in particular, sets \nitself apart as a leading contributor to the economy, with 816,000 \nvisitors a year. Importantly, my hero, my mother, loves to go there, \nand I love to take her there in the autumn of her lifetime. I ask my \nfellow Members to support this\n\n[[Page H4736]]\n\n$1 million adjustment to these national treasures.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I think this is a good amendment.

Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, by this amendment, we are \nasking for an additional $1 million to be put towards Everglades \nrestoration to be paid for with a decrease in the Environmental \nProtection Agency's environmental programs and management account.\n  I first want to say that I am grateful to my Democratic colleague \nfrom Florida, Patrick Murphy, who has supported me on this and \nrepeatedly supports our important Everglades initiatives.\n  Shortly after retiring from the private sector 3 years ago, I took a \nwalk in the Gulf with my father. When we waded into the Gulf, we got to \nabout knee depth of water, and we looked down and we couldn't see our \ntoes because that was a bad year for all the discharges into the Gulf \nof Mexico.\n  So my dad said to me: Can you do something about this? Just get \ninvolved.\n  I said: Dad, what can a retired auto parts executive do to help this \nsituation?\n  He said: If you get involved, you will figure out what to do.\n\n[[Page H4737]]\n\n  From there, I got involved in local matters and then eventually came \nhere to Congress.\n  In Florida, we are indeed blessed to have an extensive network of \nover 1.5 million acres of freshwater and saltwater, known as Everglades \nNational Park. It is the largest remaining subtropical wilderness in \nthe United States, and it serves as home to numerous beautiful species, \nincluding a number of endangered species. For these reasons, we must \nguarantee the Everglades continue to reflect our shared values of \nhealthy landscape through effective stewardship and conscientious \nmanagement, and that is why I offer this amendment today.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's \namendment. I know he has been a champion for the Everglades. It is \ncertainly a concern of this committee. I want to get out there and look \nat those pythons in the Everglades. I understand they are all over the \nplace.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. There are too many of them.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Yes, too many, that is the problem.\n  I would be happy to support this amendment. I would urge an ``aye'' \nvote when it comes up.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Clawson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment Offered by Ms. Sewell of Alabama\n\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 14, line 10, after the first dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $2,500,000)''.\n       Page 14, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $4,500,000)''.\n       Page 15, line 5, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $4,500,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 8, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $7,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Alabama and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Alabama.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to thank the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), the subcommittee chairman, as \nwell as the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the ranking \nmember, for their hard work in shepherding this important legislation \nto the floor and, most importantly, for working with me and my staff to \npropose this amendment and to make sure that it is budget neutral.\n  On the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, we need to invest \nin the National Park Service sites associated with the civil rights \nmovement, not cut necessary funding. Seminal locations such as the \nSelma to Montgomery National Historic Trail, Little Rock Central High \nSchool National Historic Site, Brown v. Board of Education National \nHistoric Site, and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site \ntell the story of the struggle for civil rights and voting rights in \nthis country. It is our obligation to preserve these prominent \nlocations for future generations.\n  My amendment increases funding by $2.5 million for the documentation \nand preservation of civil rights history as well as restores $2.5 \nmillion for the rehabilitation and preservation of historic sites on \nthe campuses of Historically Black Colleges, and $2 million additional \nfor competitive grants for the civil rights initiative to preserve \nsites of the civil rights movement.\n  Institutions such as Miles College in Alabama and Tougaloo College in \nMississippi served as a base for students who were involved in the \ncivil rights movement. Some projects that would benefit would include \ndigitizing the archives at places like Tuskegee University, where the \nTuskegee Airmen as well as the records and papers of Booker T. \nWashington and George Washington Carver reside. Other sites that would \nbenefit from this funding include the Carter G. Woodson Home National \nHistoric Site in Washington, D.C., the Selma Interpretive Center at \nSelma University, the Selma to Montgomery Interpretive Center at \nAlabama State University, and the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad \nNational Historic Park in Maryland.\n  Mr. Chairman, over the last 5 years, as the Representative of the \nSeventh Congressional District and a proud product of Selma, Alabama, \nmy native hometown, it has been an honor to not only represent this \nwonderful district, but to protect the legacy of those that came before \nus and to make sure that the history of the movement is preserved for \nfuture generations.\n  It was my high honor on March 7, 2015, to welcome President and Mrs. \nObama as well as President and Mrs. George W. Bush, along with 100 \nMembers of Congress and the Senate, Republican and Democrat, to my \nhometown of Selma, where we commemorated the 50th anniversary of the \nSelma to Montgomery March. Let us try to preserve that history and \ncontinue to show our commitment to the legacy of John Lewis and those \nbrave Freedom Fighters who changed the Nation as well as this world by \ntheir quest for equality and justice for all.\n  I want to again thank the subcommittee chair, Mr. Calvert, and I want \nto thank the ranking member, Ms. McCollum, for their dedication and \ncommitment to this preservation. I urge my colleagues to support the \nSewell amendment and commit ourselves to the task of preserving the \ncivil rights and voting rights.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I claim time in opposition, but I am not opposed to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman for a fine \namendment and the great work that she has done working with both the \nmajority and minority staff in fashioning this amendment.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CALVERT. I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for the generosity \nof yielding to me.\n  I also support the Sewell amendment to increase funding for the \nPresident's civil rights initiative. I remain a strong supporter of the \nPresident's initial request for $50 million for the civil rights \ninitiative. While the gentlewoman's amendment would increase funding by \n$7 million, we still have a long way to go to get the adequate funding \nfor these very important sacred places, I might add, in our Nation's \nhistory, to protect them.\n  I appreciate the majority's willingness to accept this amendment, and \nI thank the sponsor for offering it.\n  I thank the gentleman, once again, for his kindness in yielding.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I just want to again reiterate \nmy thanks. In this commemorative year of the Selma to Montgomery March \nand so many pivotal moments, including our upcoming 50th anniversary of \nthe signing of the Voting Rights Act, I thank you for your commitment \nto making sure that we preserve these wonderful sites for future \ngenerations.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chair, I wish to join my colleague from Alabama, \nCongresswoman Sewell, to support this amendment, which would restore \nnecessary funding for preserving our nation's Civil Rights history.\n  This amendment would increase funding by $2.5 million for \ndocumentation and preservation of Civil Rights history, as well as \nrestoring $2.5 million for the rehabilitation and preservation of \nhistoric sites on the campuses of HBCUs. In my own state of Maryland, \nthe Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument in Dorchester \nis currently putting together educational programming in conjunction \nwith the Harriet Tubman State Park, which is slated to open later this \nyear.\n  This National Monument is an important part of telling our American \nstory--especially in light of the fact that, currently, only 26 of our \nnation's 460 national parks have a primary focus on African-American \nhistory.\n  It is our responsibility as federal representatives to come together \nin order to preserve the history of our nation and its people. We must \nkeep this commitment to preserve the legacy of the Civil Rights \nMovement, and the land and structures that will keep that legacy alive.\n\n[[Page H4738]]\n\n  I encourage all of my colleagues, both Democrat and Republican, to \nsupport this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Gallego\n\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 14, line 10, after the first dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $1,000,000) (reduced by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chairman, my amendment will help ensure that all \ncommunities are able to participate in decisions that shape the \nNational Park Service. Environmental justice is defined as the fair \ntreatment and meaningful involvement of all people--regardless of race, \ncolor, national origin, or income--with respect to our Nation's \nenvironmental laws and policies. This amendment represents an important \nstep towards that goal.\n  The NPS has a robust planning, environment, and public comment \ndatabase and Web site, known as PEPC.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  This Web site is used for consultation and providing information on \nplanning issues such as management plans, construction projects, \nenvironmental assessments, and environmental impact statements. This \nWeb site is how the users of the National Park Service can participate \nin NPS decisionmaking.\n  Unfortunately, however, PEPC is only available in English--no \nSpanish, none of the Asian languages spoken by the fastest growing \nsegment of our population, and none of the indigenous languages of our \nNative American brothers and sisters.\n  To address this shortcoming, my amendment will provide $1 million to \nupdate PEPC. This funding will provide translation of the contents of \nPEPC to the public, the ability of the public to provide input into the \nPEPC process in the most commonly spoken languages, and informing \naffected communities of the improvements.\n  Mr. Chairman, America is becoming more and more diverse every day, \nand our land management agencies must adapt to it. It is critical that \nnew and growing community can access our public lands and services. \nThey are the new users and stewards that Federal land management \nagencies such as the National Park Service must engage as it prepares \nfor its centennial.\n  To reach these Americans, the NPS will need improved tools to clearly \ncommunicate with people who may struggle to comprehend materials in \nEnglish. That is exactly what my amendment intends to accomplish. This \nmeasure will help the Park Service and the Department of the Interior \nto achieve their performance benchmarks.\n  One of the key measures of the Department's environmental justice \noutcomes is outreach to minority and underserved communities. Executive \nOrder 13116 states that all Federal agencies shall provide access to \nservices for persons with limited English proficiency. By offering a \nWeb interface in multiple languages, NPS will increase its relevance to \nminority communities and help the Department of the Interior to make \nprogress towards this very important requirement.\n  Mr. Chairman, we can all agree that engaging the public on important \ndecisions that affect their communities is a linchpin of our system of \ngovernment. When all communities are afforded access to the \ndecisionmaking process, we improve the outcomes of those decisions and \nwe strengthen our democracy.\n  I hope all Members will join me in supporting this critical \namendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Beyer\n\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 14, after line 14, insert the following:\n\n                    emergency infrastructure repairs\n\n       For expenses necessary for emergency infrastructure repairs \n     related to the National Park Service deferred maintenance \n     backlog, $11,500,000,000, to remain available until expended.\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from Virginia and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to provide \n$11.5 billion to fund emergency infrastructure repairs related to the \nNational Park Service deferred maintenance backlog.\n  Mr. Chair, earlier this month, the National Park Service, at the \nrecommendation of the Department of Transportation, took the \nprecautionary measure of closing two lanes on the iconic Arlington \nMemorial Bridge, one of the most important entrances to the Nation's \nCapital and a major artery for many of my constituents commuting to \nwork every day.\n  The crisis of the Memorial Bridge, whose replacement will cost a \nstartling $250 million, demonstrates the degradation of park \ninfrastructure throughout the country. It also shows the extent of the \nbacklog and the need to provide funds to ensure reliability for the \neconomy as well as the safety of the public.\n  The backlog has also grown because of a steady decline in the \nconstruction account. Over the last decade, there has been a 62 percent \ndecline, $227 million in today's dollars. The Park Service receives \nonly 58 cents out of every dollar needed just to keep the backlog from \ngrowing.\n  Mr. Chair, the United States is the richest country in the history of \nmankind. We are the democratic leader, the military leader, the human \nrights leader, the financial leader of all the world. Can we not also \nbe the investment leader?\n  This country needs to be the country that invests in our \ninfrastructure today for our children and our grandchildren tomorrow.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of increased funding for \nthe National Park Service in order to address the deferred maintenance \nbacklog.\n  Despite its significant and multifaceted contributions to our \ncountry, the National Park Service budget has been shrinking, \ncompromising its ability to adequately protect our treasured national \nhistory. Shrinking appropriations and increasing wear and tear on aging \ninfrastructure has led to a maintenance backlog of approximately $11.5 \nbillion dollars, including dilapidated visitor centers, unmaintained \ntrails, and failing water treatment facilities.\n  More than half of the maintenance backlog, approximately $6 billion, \nis comprised of transportation projects that require funding through \nthe Highway Trust Fund, not the Park Service. The Arlington Memorial \nBridge, which is so important to our nation, connecting the Lincoln \nMemorial to Arlington National Cemetery, is so badly corroded that it \nmust be partially shut down for six to nine months. In fact, the \nestimated total cost of repairs for the bridge is more than the entire \nannual allocation to the Park Service from the Highway Trust Fund.\n  This trend is completely unsustainable if we want our children and \ngrandchildren to have the same opportunity to visit and enjoy some of \nour nation's most iconic sites.\n  At recent hearings on the Natural Resources Committee, I have heard \nmany of my colleagues express their frustrations with the maintenance \nbacklog. This is our opportunity to address the problem, but we are \nonce again kicking the can down the pothole riddled, crumbling road.\n  Next year is the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service, \nwhich will bring even more visitors to our parks. I urge my colleagues \nto not only address the maintenance backlog at the National Park \nService, but to come together and pass a long-term fix for the Highway \nTrust Fund so that we can address the maintenance backlog.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order that the amendment \nproposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill.\n\n[[Page H4739]]\n\n  The amendment is not in order under section 3(d)(3) of House \nResolution 5, 114th Congress, which states:\n  ``It shall not be in order to consider an amendment to a general \nappropriations bill proposing a net increase in budget authority in the \nbill unless considered en bloc with another amendment or amendments \nproposing an equal or greater decrease in such budget authority \npursuant to clause 2(f) of rule XXI.''\n  The amendment proposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill \nin violation of such section.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of increased funding for \nthe National Park Service in order to address the deferred maintenance \nbacklog.\n  Despite its significant and multifaceted contributions to our \ncountry, the National Park Service budget has been shrinking, \ncompromising its ability to adequately protect our treasured national \nhistory.\n  Shrinking appropriations and increasing wear and tear on aging \ninfrastructure has led----\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman must confine her remarks to the \npoint of order.\n  Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order?\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, the Interior Subcommittee has done its best \nto invest in parks, but given its insufficient allocation, this was the \nonly meaningful way for the very obvious need for the $11.5 billion for \ninfrastructure.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The gentleman from California makes a point of order that the \namendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia violates section \n3(d)(3) of House Resolution 5.\n  Section 3(d)(3) establishes a point of order against an amendment \nproposing a net increase in budget authority in the pending bill.\n  As persuasively asserted by the gentleman from California, the \namendment proposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill. \nTherefore, the point of order is sustained. The amendment is not in \norder.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                  national recreation and preservation\n\n       For expenses necessary to carry out recreation programs, \n     natural programs, cultural programs, heritage partnership \n     programs, environmental compliance and review, international \n     park affairs, and grant administration, not otherwise \n     provided for, $62,467,000.\n\n                       historic preservation fund\n\n       For expenses necessary in carrying out the National \n     Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.), \n     $60,910,000, to be derived from the Historic Preservation \n     Fund and to remain available until September 30, 2017, of \n     which $500,000 is for competitive grants for the survey and \n     nomination of properties to the National Register of Historic \n     Places and as National Historic Landmarks associated with \n     communities currently underrepresented, as determined by the \n     Secretary, and of which $4,500,000 is for competitive grants \n     to preserve the sites and stories of the Civil Rights \n     movement: Provided, That such competitive grants shall be \n     made without imposing the matching requirements in Section \n     102(a)(3) of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 470(a)(3)).\n\n                              construction\n\n       For construction, improvements, repair, or replacement of \n     physical facilities, including modifications authorized by \n     section 104 of the Everglades National Park Protection and \n     Expansion Act of 1989 (16 U.S.C. 410r-8), $139,555,000, to \n     remain available until expended: Provided, That \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, for any project \n     initially funded in fiscal year 2016 with a future phase \n     indicated in the National Park Service 5-Year Line Item \n     Construction Plan, a single procurement may be issued which \n     includes the full scope of the project: Provided further, \n     That the solicitation and contract shall contain the clause \n     availability of funds found at 48 CFR 52.232-18.\n\n                    land and water conservation fund\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       The contract authority provided for fiscal year 2016 by \n     section 9 of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 \n     (16 U.S.C. 460l-10a) is rescinded.\n\n                 land acquisition and state assistance\n\n       For expenses necessary to carry out the Land and Water \n     Conservation Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460l-4 through 11), \n     including administrative expenses, and for acquisition of \n     lands or waters, or interest therein, in accordance with the \n     statutory authority applicable to the National Park Service, \n     $84,367,000, to be derived from the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund and to remain available until expended, of \n     which $48,117,000 is for the State assistance program and of \n     which $9,000,000 shall be for the American Battlefield \n     Protection Program grants as authorized by section 7301 of \n     the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 (Public Law \n     111-11).\n\n                          centennial challenge\n\n       For expenses necessary to carry out the provisions of \n     section 814(g) of Public Law 104-333 (16 U.S.C. 1f) relating \n     to challenge cost share agreements, $20,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended, for Centennial Challenge projects \n     and programs: Provided, That not less than 50 percent of the \n     total cost of each project or program shall be derived from \n     non-Federal sources in the form of donated cash, assets, or a \n     pledge of donation guaranteed by an irrevocable letter of \n     credit.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Ms. Tsongas\n\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 16, line 22, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $30,000,000) (reduced by $30,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Massachusetts and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  My amendment is intended to recognize the National Park Service's \nCentennial Challenge and the importance of funding the program at the \nlevel requested by President Obama and the National Park Service.\n  Next year is the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service, a \nmilestone in this country's history that we as a nation should be proud \nof and celebrate. For a century now, the national parks have preserved \nand protected our Nation's natural, cultural, and historic resources \nfor the use and enjoyment of future generations. I am proud to \nrepresent two national parks.\n  In my hometown, the Lowell National Historic Park was the first urban \nnational park of its kind, commemorating, preserving, and protecting \nthe catalytic role the city played in spawning America's Industrial \nRevolution.\n  Minute Man National Historic Park is just down the road in Concord, \nwhere visitors can see firsthand where the shot heard 'round the world \nwas fired and where the American Revolution began.\n  The many visitors to both sites are grateful that our country has \nmade the commitment to protecting our history and our landscapes for \nfuture generations, coming away awed and inspired by the sites that \nhave shaped who we are as a people.\n  The upcoming centennial is a tremendous opportunity to increase \npublic engagement with our parks so that we may not only celebrate the \nplaces we love to visit with family and friends, but also make the \nnecessary investments that will prepare our parks for the next 100 \nyears.\n  Despite its significant and multifaceted obligations, the Park \nService budget has been shrinking, compromising its ability to ensure \nadequate protection to our treasured national history.\n  Since 2010, there has been more than a 7 percent, or $178 million in \ntoday's dollars, reduction in the account to operate national parks. \nOver the last decade, there has been a 62 percent, or $227 million in \ntoday's dollars, decline in the National Park Service construction \naccount. This has led to an enormous deferred maintenance backlog, \ntotaling $11.5 billion of dilapidated visitor centers, unmaintained \ntrail centers, and failing water treatment facilities.\n  Historically, our parks have had bipartisan support. To mark the 50th \nanniversary of the National Park Service in 1966, President Eisenhower \ninitiated Mission 66, which invested more than $1 billion in \nimprovements to visitor facilities throughout the park system.\n  Ten years ahead of the 100th anniversary, President George W. Bush \nlaunched the Centennial Initiative, a 10-year, $3 billion plan to \nrestore the parks through a combination of public and private funding. \nThat effort was never fully realized, but President Obama revived the \ninitiative ahead of the 2016 centennial celebration.\n\n[[Page H4740]]\n\n  In the FY15 omnibus spending bill, Congress provided $10 million to \nreinvigorate the Centennial Challenge. The initial $10 million Federal \ninvestment was matched by an additional $16 million in private \ndonations for signature centennial projects.\n  In total, 106 projects were selected throughout the country to \nimprove visitor services, chip away at the deferred maintenance \nbacklog, and support youth programs. Over 200 projects were submitted, \ndemonstrating the high demand for additional money to be matched by \nprivate contributions.\n  Given the overwhelming success from the $10 million investment this \nyear, Congress should strongly consider increasing funding levels for \nthe Centennial Challenge in 2017.\n  I understand that this is a difficult task, given the inadequate \nfunding allocation provided for the Interior Department under the \nBudget Control Act and sequestration. I regret that we were unable to \ndo so through this amendment. The funding allocation for the National \nPark Service represents yet another example of why Congress must work \ntogether on a bipartisan basis to end sequestration.\n  I hope that we can find a way to support the Centennial Challenge and \nthe President's budget request for the National Park Service so that we \nnot only celebrate the places we love to visit with family and friends, \nbut to make the necessary investments that will prepare our parks for \nthe next 100 years.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Beyer.)\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Representative Tsongas' \namendment to support the National Park Service's Centennial Challenge.\n  As a former National Park Service Ranger, I am proud to serve as a \nCongressional Friend of the National Park Service Centennial, and I \neagerly await the centennial in 2016: Find Your Park.\n  As the NPS approaches its centennial year, it is important to ensure \nthey have the resources they need to enter into the second century of \nservice to the American people. The Interior Subcommittee has tried its \nvery best to invest in parks, given its insufficient allocation; but \nwith the centennial approaching and the buildup of park needs, this \nlevel is not remotely enough for parks.\n  Recognizing the serious impact of both the Budget Control Act and \nemergency wildfire suppression on the Interior allocation, Congress \nstill must find a way to meet the needs of parks by securing another \nbudget deal to get rid of the threat of sequester. There is no better \ntime than the centennial for a robust investment in our national parks \nby Congress and the American people. It is time to make our national \nparks a national priority.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Ms. TSONGAS.

Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H4741]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, drilling for and transporting oil and gas \nis a dirty and dangerous business. There is no disputing that.\n  No matter what assurances are given by the oil industry, spills do \nhappen, and they will continue to happen as we depend on fossil fuels \nfor our energy needs.\n  Sadly, my constituents in Santa Barbara, California, are far too \nfamiliar with this reality. Just over a month ago, on May 19, over \n100,000 gallons of crude oil spilled from the Plains All American \npipeline along the Gaviota Coast. The oil spilled down a hill, through \na culvert, and into the ocean, eventually spreading thick, black tar \nalong nearly 100 miles of coastline.\n  This was a unique spill, in that it impacted both land and ocean, \nrequiring both the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, as well as \nthe Coast Guard to respond to and lead the cleanup effort.\n  When it comes to oil spills, the damage gets worse by the minute, so \nensuring that spill response teams are properly trained and prepared to \nrespond quickly is essential to minimizing the impacts. This is \nprecisely why the EPA has jurisdiction over the inland oil spill \nprogram.\n  The EPA uses this funding to prevent, to prepare for, and to respond \nto oil spills associated with the more than 600,000 oil storage \nfacilities that the Agency regulates. The EPA's oil program also \nprovides oil spill response resources and training for States, \nlocalities, and tribal governments.\n  Despite its scope and importance, this program has been seriously \nunderfunded for years, and H.R. 2822 only makes things worse by funding \nthis program at nearly 25 percent less than the President requested.\n  My amendment would simply increase funding for this program by $5.4 \nmillion, to match the President's requested amount of $23.4 million for \nfiscal year 2016. This modest increase in funding would help ensure \nthat EPA can do its job to help protect coastal areas, like the one I \nrepresent, from the impacts of oil spills.\n  The funding increase, however, would be offset by reducing the \nconventional energy account at the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, \nor BOME, by an equal amount.\n  I want to be clear. This funding reduction for BOME is intended to \ntarget the funding used for new offshore oil and gas leasing. BOME will \ncontinue to fund safety operations and environmental assessments.\n  The new 5-year offshore oil and gas program being drafted by BOME \ncalls for 14 potential lease sales, including in some new areas off the \nEast Coast. Expanding drilling by cutting funding for oil spill cleanup \nis incredibly irresponsible.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have spent my entire career in Congress fighting to \nstop offshore drilling because I firmly believe the risks outweigh the \nbenefits. Perhaps the current majority does not agree with me on this \ngoal.\n  I hope we can at least all agree that we should not be expanding oil \ndrilling unless we are properly preparing for the spills that will \ninevitably occur. As long as we drill for oil, there will be oil \nspills, and the economic and ecological risks of these spills only \nincreases when the oil is extracted offshore.\n  While the Coast Guard is responsible for responding to offshore \nspills, the recent spill in my district shows that offshore drilling \ncan also have onshore impacts, especially for coastal communities like \nthose I represent.\n  The oil that spilled from the Plains All American pipeline was \nextracted just a few miles offshore in Federal waters. It was then \npumped onshore to a holding facility, and it continued through the \npipeline that ruptured. This offshore oil spilled from the pipeline, \ndown a hillside, on to the beach, and back into the ocean under which \nit had been extracted.\n  Drilling and spill cleanup are inextricably linked. The least we can \ndo is ensure that the EPA has the resources it needs to ensure that the \nspills are quickly and properly cleaned up when they inevitably happen.\n  This is precisely what my amendment seeks to achieve. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. As in the case with many of the amendments today before \nus, I cannot support the offset. Let me say this: EPA may be reimbursed \nfor oil spill response activities from the Oil Spill Liability Trust \nFund.\n  Now, personally, I think EPA should have direct access to that trust \nfund to avoid the delays, these administrative reimbursement delays, \nwhen responding to an oil spill such as what happened in California. \nHowever, that is an authorizing issue, not an appropriating issue.\n  That is the proper place because those dollars will be there \neventually to clean that up, and we just need to clean up the \nbureaucracy to have more immediacy in that process.\n  This offset, I cannot support; and so, for that reason, I oppose the \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, I have no additional speakers. I am \nprepared to close. In closing, I would like to reiterate two points.\n  First, that oil and gas exploration is inherently dangerous, there is \nno disputing that. Spills do happen. Unfortunately, my district \nobserved these consequences firsthand during the Plains pipeline spill \njust over a month ago.\n  Second, if we are going to continue to extract, to transport, and to \nutilize oil, we need to be prepared for the inevitability of these \nspills. The EPA's inland oil spill program is intended for just this \npurpose, to be prepared to respond to the inevitable.\n  It is irresponsible to develop new oil extraction, including \noffshore, without being prepared to respond to its risk.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge support for this amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this \namendment. I don't agree to the offset. The fact that we have an Oil \nSpill Liability Trust Fund, that should be accessed.\n  I will be happy to work with the gentlewoman to work with the \nauthorizers where we can get more immediate response to these kinds of \nactivities that happen from time to time around the country, but I urge \na ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n             Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement\n\n             offshore safety and environmental enforcement\n\n       For expenses necessary for the regulation of operations \n     related to leases, easements, rights-of-way and agreements \n     for use for oil and gas, other minerals, energy, and marine-\n     related purposes on the Outer Continental Shelf, as \n     authorized by law; for enforcing and implementing laws and \n     regulations as authorized by law and to the extent provided \n     by Presidential or Secretarial delegation; and for matching \n     grants or cooperative agreements, $123,354,000, of which \n     $66,147,000 is to remain available until September 30, 2017, \n     and of which $57,207,000 is to remain available until \n     expended: Provided, That this total appropriation shall be \n     reduced by amounts collected by the Secretary and credited to \n     this appropriation from additions to receipts resulting from \n     increases to lease rental rates in effect on August 5, 1993, \n     and from cost recovery fees from activities conducted by the \n     Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement pursuant to \n     the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, including studies, \n     assessments, analysis, and miscellaneous administrative \n     activities: Provided further, That the sum herein \n     appropriated shall be reduced as such collections are \n     received during the fiscal year, so as to result in a final \n     fiscal year 2016 appropriation estimated at not more than \n     $66,147,000.\n       For an additional amount, $65,000,000, to remain available \n     until expended, to be reduced by amounts collected by the \n     Secretary and credited to this appropriation, which\n\n[[Page H4742]]\n\n     shall be derived from non-refundable inspection fees \n     collected in fiscal year 2016, as provided in this Act: \n     Provided, That to the extent that amounts realized from such \n     inspection fees exceed $65,000,000, the amounts realized in \n     excess of $65,000,000 shall be credited to this appropriation \n     and remain available until expended: Provided further, That \n     for fiscal year 2016, not less than 50 percent of the \n     inspection fees expended by the Bureau of Safety and \n     Environmental Enforcement will be used to fund personnel and \n     mission-related costs to expand capacity and expedite the \n     orderly development, subject to environmental safeguards, of \n     the Outer Continental Shelf pursuant to the Outer Continental \n     Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.), including the \n     review of applications for permits to drill.\n\n                           oil spill research\n\n       For necessary expenses to carry out title I, section 1016, \n     title IV, sections 4202 and 4303, title VII, and title VIII, \n     section 8201 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, $14,899,000, \n     which shall be derived from the Oil Spill Liability Trust \n     Fund, to remain available until expended.\n\n          Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement\n\n                       regulation and technology\n\n       For necessary expenses to carry out the provisions of the \n     Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, Public \n     Law 95-87, $123,253,000, to remain available until September \n     30, 2017: Provided, That appropriations for the Office of \n     Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement may provide for \n     the travel and per diem expenses of State and tribal \n     personnel attending Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and \n     Enforcement sponsored training.\n\n\n                Amendment Offered by Mr. Johnson of Ohio\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 24, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $2,000,000)''.\n       Page 65, lines 5 and 10, after each dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $2,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Ohio and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I, too, would like to thank \nChairman Calvert and the subcommittee for a great underlying piece of \nlegislation. We have got a great appropriations bill here, and I look \nforward to supporting it.\n  My amendment to the FY 2016 Interior and Environment Appropriations \nbill will keep the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and \nEnforcement's spending in check with the agency's obligation. \nSpecifically, it will reduce OSM's regulation and technology budget by \n$2 million and transfer those funds to the Drinking Water State \nRevolving Funds.\n  According to OSM, States and tribes perform 97 percent of the \nregulatory activity relating to surface coal mining in the United \nStates; yet OSM receives 25 percent of the staffing resources to \nperform 3 percent of the work.\n  This amendment will help bring spending in parity with the work done \nby OSM.\n  Although the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, or SMCRA, \nwas enacted to allow States with approved programs to assume exclusive \njurisdiction of mining in their States, under the current \nadministration, OSM has increasingly used its inflated budget to \nimproperly usurp the lawful decisions of State regulators.\n  This amendment will help curtail excessive Federal interference and \nrestore the State's role in surface mining regulation. For instance, \nover the past 5 years, OSM has spent more than $10 million of its \ndisproportionately large budget to pursue a wholesale regulatory \nrewrite of the agency's regulatory program.\n  Dubbed the ``stream protection rule'' by the agency, this massive \nregulatory undertaking has little to do with protecting streams and \nmore to do with riding roughshod over State regulating programs and the \nrole of other agencies, including State Clean Water Act regulators.\n  During its pursuit of the stream protection rule, OSM has completely \ncut States out of the process, in violation of its legal obligations \nunder the National Environmental Policy Act.\n  My amendment will help restrain the resources of the agency from \npromulgating a rule made without State consultation and in violation of \nNEPA.\n  In fact, 10 States initially signed a memorandum of understanding \nwith OSM and agreed to serve as cooperating agencies for the \ndevelopment of the environmental impact statement to accompany the so-\ncalled stream protection rule.\n  Of those 10 States, six have withdrawn their respective MOUs due to \nlack of consultation from OSM. These States include Alabama, New \nMexico, Utah, Texas, Kentucky, and West Virginia. More States are \nexpected to withdraw. While Wyoming is still a cooperating agency, they \nhave requested that their State seal be removed from the EIS.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my fellow colleagues to support this amendment \nthat will keep spending in check with the OSM's statutory \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. I \nunderstand there is a level of frustration regarding the Office of \nSurface Mining's continued use of funds to develop the stream buffer \nrule, and we attempted to address that through the bill language to \nlimit funding.\n  I certainly support what you are doing for water infrastructure. It \nis a good amendment that will leverage jobs, and I urge an ``aye'' \nvote.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield 2 minutes to \nmy colleague from West Virginia (Mr. Mooney).\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of \nCongressman Johnson's amendment to cut $2 million from the Office of \nSurface Mining regulatory and technology budget and transfer those \nfunds to the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds.\n  This amendment will cut funding for an office that has launched an \nall-out war on coal in my home State of West Virginia. The Office of \nSurface Mining's stream protection rule is intentionally designed to \nshut down all surface mining and a significant section of underground \nmining in the Appalachian region.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  A 2012 study found the rewrite of the stream protection rule is \nestimated to cost nearly 80,000 direct coal-related jobs. The coal \nindustry is vital to West Virginia and my district. Coal supports over \n90 percent of the power generation in my State. It is crucial that we \ncut the funding for the Office of Surface Mining before they can do any \nmore damage.\n  I thank my colleague for offering this amendment and urge its \npassage.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I thank subcommittee Chairman \nCalvert again for supporting this amendment.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote by my colleagues.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       In addition, for costs to review, administer, and enforce \n     permits issued by the Bureau pursuant to section 507 of \n     Public Law 950987 (30 U.S.C. 1257), $40,000, to \n     remain available until expended: Provided, That fees assessed \n     and collected by the Office pursuant to such section 507 \n     shall be credited to this account as discretionary offsetting \n     collections, to remain available until expended: Provided \n     further, That the sum herein appropriated from the general \n     fund shall be reduced as collections are received during the \n     fiscal year, so as to result in a fiscal year 2016 \n     appropriation estimated at not more than $123,253,000.\n\n                    abandoned mine reclamation fund\n\n       For necessary expenses to carry out title IV of the Surface \n     Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, Public Law \n     950987, $27,303,000, to be derived from receipts of \n     the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund and to remain available \n     until expended: Provided, That pursuant to Public Law \n     9709365, the Department of the Interior is \n     authorized to use up to 20 percent from the recovery of the \n     delinquent debt owed to the United States Government to pay \n     for contracts to collect these debts: Provided further, That \n     funds made available under title IV of Public Law \n     950987 may be used for any required non-Federal \n     share of the cost of projects funded by the Federal \n     Government for the purpose of environmental restoration \n     related to treatment or abatement of acid mine drainage from \n     abandoned mines: Provided further, That such projects must be \n     consistent with the purposes and priorities of the Surface \n     Mining Control and Reclamation Act: Provided further, That \n     amounts provided under\n\n[[Page H4743]]\n\n     this heading may be used for the travel and per diem expenses \n     of State and tribal personnel attending Office of Surface \n     Mining Reclamation and Enforcement sponsored training.\n       In addition, $30,000,000, to remain available until \n     expended, for grants to States for reclamation of abandoned \n     mine lands and other related activities in accordance with \n     the terms and conditions in the report accompanying this Act: \n     Provided, That such additional amount shall be used for \n     economic and community development in conjunction with the \n     priorities in section 403(a) of the Surface Mining Control \n     and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1233(a)): Provided \n     further, That such additional amount shall be distributed in \n     equal amounts to the 3 Appalachian States with the greatest \n     amount of unfunded needs to meet the priorities described in \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) of such section: Provided further, \n     That such additional amount shall be allocated to States \n     within 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Yoho\n\n  Mr. YOHO.

Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Griffith\n\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 26, line 7, strike ``3'' and insert ``6''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, expanding the number of Appalachian \nStates eligible for this program from three to six will allow \nadditional States, including Virginia, to be able to participate. The \ncommittee and the subcommittee came up with a great idea. I just want \nto make sure it is expanded so that more States can benefit.\n  The Kentucky Coal Association was in this week for a press \nconference, and one of their members said to me at that time that the \nsickness that has been in Kentucky is now spreading to Virginia, and \nthey are absolutely right.\n  In 1 year's time, my district has lost hundreds of coal mine jobs due \nto this administration's burdensome regulations on the coal industry; \nbut it is not just the coal mine jobs. Many more jobs in related \nindustries have also been lost.\n  With those jobs, jobs in things as diverse as the hardware store, the \nLong John Silver's--you name it--are being lost throughout the coal \ncountry of Appalachian Virginia.\n  The downturn of the coal industry in my district has led to many \neconomic difficulties for many of my constituents and the local \ngovernments. I believe it is critical that we work to find ways to \nprovide assistance throughout all of the Appalachian coal country, and \nmy amendment would go part of the way to helping restore some economic \nvitality to my district.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, the committee, as the gentleman knows, has \nincluded this as a pilot program to test in a few States how community \nand economic redevelopment can combine in conjunction with reclamation \nof abandoned mine lands.\n  These funds will be provided to States with the largest unfunded \nneeds to date. If you expand that to include six States, this pilot \nthen starts to look more like a program, and that is not the \ncommittee's intent. The committee believes that the lessons learned \nfrom this pilot will inform changes, both pros and cons, under the \nreauthorization of the underlying law.\n  I want to work with the gentleman in the future as this pilot moves \nforward. When we have more information, we can potentially, next year, \nreexamine this.\n  I would ask the gentleman if he would withdraw the amendment. I would \ncertainly be happy to work with him in the future. I know the full \ncommittee chairman is certainly in the interest of him to address the \nneeds of his constituents. We are certainly sympathetic to that.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, I certainly have no quarrel with the \ncommittee or the committee chairman or the subcommittee chairman.\n  I think this is a great pilot project, which was why I thought it was \na brilliant idea, which is why I wanted to at least put this on the \ntable.\n  It is not my habit to offer and then withdraw. Sometimes, you lose; \nand I understand that is probably the case. I did want to put it on the \ntable, and I do appreciate the gentleman's kind remarks.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I would just reluctantly oppose this \namendment at this time.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

This amendment supports the trust \nresponsibility by helping to provide high-quality education in an \nenvironment that is safe, healthy, and conducive for learning.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. I thank the supporters \nof the amendment, and I thank the chairman and ranking member for their \ngreat work on this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition, although I am not \nopposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I know there is no doubt that Indian \nCountry, especially Indian education, is a nonpartisan priority of this \nentire subcommittee. We are committed to building upon the bipartisan \nwork of former subcommittee chairmen Mike Simpson, Jim Moran, Norm \nDicks, and certainly Ranking Member Betty McCollum.\n  We all agree that there are great needs in Indian Country, especially \nin education. In fact, we were in Arizona recently at both the Navajo \nand Hopi reservations and saw firsthand the need for education in this \ncountry.\n  Although I am proud of what we have done for Indian Country in this \nbill, that said, I understand where the gentleman is coming from. I \nrecognize there is so much more to do on Indian education that can and \nshould be done.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from California and the \nranking member for their help.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Rokita), my \nfriend.\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Gosar, Mr. Calvert, and Ms. \nMcCollum for their help in all this.\n  This amendment, which I support, would fund the BIE to the \nadministration's fiscal year 2016 request, but unlike that request, it \nis paid for and adheres to our budget cap.\n  This year, as the chairman of the Early Childhood, Elementary and \nSecondary Education Subcommittee, I have had the opportunity to visit \nseveral BIE schools in Arizona and Minnesota.\n  During these visits, I have seen firsthand the challenges that the \nBIE faces. These challenges consist of crumbling school buildings, \ninadequate technology and Internet connectivity, transportation issues, \nand inconsistent management.\n  These are all serious challenges, and they are all well documented by \nmy official visits, by committee hearings--such as those being done by \nMr. Calvert's subcommittee and mine--by GAO reports, and by the media.\n  This increase in funds will help address the identified challenges by \nproviding the resources needed to improve the academic achievement and \nincrease the graduation rates of Native American students that attend \nBIE schools. This is the goal of all of us for Native American \nchildren.\n  Mr. Chairman, I look at this as a bipartisan issue and appreciate my \ncolleagues' support of Mr. Gosar's amendment.\n  Mr. GOSAR. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \nsupport and my colleague from Indiana for speaking on behalf of this.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

by this Act to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, this \n     action shall not diminish the Federal Government's trust \n     responsibility to that tribe, or the government-to-government \n

dormitory beyond the grade structure in place or approved by \n     the Secretary of the Interior at each school in the Bureau of \n     Indian Education school system as of October 1, 1995, except \n     that the Secretary of the Interior may waive this prohibition \n     to support expansion of up to one additional grade when the \n     Secretary determines such waiver is needed to support \n     accomplishment of the mission of the Bureau of Indian \n     Education. Appropriations made available in this or any prior \n     Act for schools funded by the Bureau shall be available, in \n     accordance with the Bureau's funding formula, only to the \n     schools in the Bureau school system as of September 1, 1996, \n     and to any school or school program that was reinstated in \n     fiscal year 2012. Funds made available under this Act may not \n     be used to establish a charter school at a Bureau-funded \n     school (as that term is defined in section 1141 of the \n     Education Amendments of 1978 (25 U.S.C. 2021)), except that a \n     charter school that is in existence on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act and that has operated at a Bureau-\n     funded school before September 1, 1999, may continue to \n     operate during that period, but only if the charter school \n     pays to the Bureau a pro rata share of funds to reimburse the \n     Bureau for the use of the real and personal property \n     (including buses and vans), the funds of the charter school \n     are kept separate and apart from Bureau funds, and the Bureau \n     does not assume any obligation for charter school programs of \n     the State in which the school is located if the charter \n     school loses such funding. Employees of Bureau-funded schools \n     sharing a campus with a charter school and performing \n     functions related to the charter school's operation and \n     employees of a charter school shall not be treated as Federal \n     employees for purposes of chapter 171 of title 28, United \n     States Code.\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including \n     section 113 of title I of appendix C of Public Law 106-113, \n     if in fiscal year 2003 or 2004 a grantee received indirect \n     and administrative costs pursuant to a distribution formula \n     based on section 5(f) of Public Law 101-301, the Secretary \n     shall continue to distribute indirect and administrative cost \n     funds to such grantee using the section 5(f) distribution \n     formula.\n       Funds available under this Act may not be used to establish \n     satellite locations of schools in the Bureau school system as \n     of September 1, 1996, except that the Secretary may waive \n     this prohibition in order for an Indian tribe to provide \n     language and cultural immersion educational programs for non-\n     public schools located within the jurisdictional area of the \n     tribal government which exclusively serve tribal members, do \n     not include grades beyond those currently served at the \n     existing Bureau-funded school, provide an educational \n     environment with educator presence and academic facilities \n     comparable to the Bureau-funded school, comply with all \n     applicable Tribal, Federal, or State health and safety \n     standards, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, and \n     demonstrate the benefits of establishing operations at a \n     satellite location in lieu of incurring extraordinary costs, \n     such as for transportation or other impacts to students such \n     as those caused by busing students extended distances: \n     Provided, That no funds available under this Act may be used \n     to fund operations, maintenance, rehabilitation, construction \n     or other facilities-related costs for such assets that are \n     not owned by the Bureau: Provided further, That the term \n     ``satellite school'' means a school location physically \n     separated from the existing Bureau school by more than 50 \n     miles but that forms part of the existing school in all other \n     respects: Provided further, That none of the funds made \n     available by this or any other Act may be used by the \n     Secretary to finalize, implement, administer, or enforce the \n     proposed rule entitled ``Federal Acknowledgement of American \n     Indian Tribes'' published by the Department of the Interior \n     in the Federal Register on May 29, 2014 (79 Fed. Reg. 30766 \n     et seq.).\n\n                          Departmental Offices\n\n                        Office of the Secretary\n\n                        departmental operations\n\n       For necessary expenses for management of the Department of \n     the Interior, including the collection and disbursement of \n     royalties, fees, and other mineral revenue proceeds, and for \n     grants and cooperative agreements, as authorized by law, \n     $717,279,000, to remain available until September 30, 2017; \n     of which not to exceed $15,000 may be for official reception \n     and representation expenses; and of which up to $1,000,000 \n     shall be available for workers compensation payments and \n     unemployment compensation payments associated with the \n     orderly closure of the United States Bureau of Mines; and of \n     which $8,128,000 for the Office of Valuation Services is to \n     be derived from the Land and Water Conservation Fund and \n     shall remain available until expended; and of which \n     $38,300,000 shall remain available until expended for the \n     purpose of mineral revenue management activities: Provided, \n     That notwithstanding any other provision of law, $15,000 \n     under this heading shall be available for refunds of \n     overpayments in connection with certain Indian leases in \n     which the Secretary concurred with the claimed refund due, to \n     pay amounts owed to Indian allottees or tribes, or to correct \n     prior unrecoverable erroneous payments.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Sablan\n\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 36, line 8, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $5,000,000)''.\n       Page 38, line 6, after each of the first and second dollar \n     amounts, insert ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom the Northern Mariana Islands and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands.\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Chairman, my amendment increases funding for \nterritorial assistance initiatives managed by the Interior Department.\n  The assistance benefits the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands, which I represent, but also the United States territories of \nAmerican Samoa, Guam, and the United States Virgin Islands, as well as \nAmerica's allies in the Pacific, the Republic of Palau, the Federated \nStates of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  The assistance will continue our commitment to help all of these \nareas to develop economically and become more self-sufficient.\n  Mr. Chairman, much remains to reach these goals. The 2010 Census \nrevealed that poverty levels in the islands remain three to five times \nthe national average, and median income in the Northern Marianas is \nonly $20,000 compared to $53,000 nationwide.\n  The most recent gross domestic product data for the islands, reported \nby the Bureau of Economic Analysis, found that in the Virgin Islands, \nreal GDP declined 5.4 percent in 2013 and declined 2.4 percent in \nAmerican Samoa. In contrast, the real GDP for the United States, \nexcluding the territories, increased 2.2 percent in 2013. So we have a \nlot of catching up to do.\n  Interior has been very responsible in recent years, focusing \ntechnical assistance funds in a way that really will help our areas \ndevelop economically. I am thinking in particular of the Empowering \nInsular Communities program, which is helping us move imported fuels--\nthat are costly and take money out of our economies--to greater use of \nlocally available energy sources.\n  I am thinking about the Insular Areas: Assessment of Buildings and \nClassrooms Initiative, just like the preceding amendment. This program \nfound that only 38 percent of insular schools are in acceptable \ncondition and identified specifically those schools where there are \nsafety hazards for students. The ABC Initiative is systematically \nupgrading that infrastructure so our children have schools that are \nconducive to learning and are safe. Developing those human resources is \nthe surest way to raise our economy. We need to give Interior the \nresources to continue--and finish--that initiative.\n  The additional $5 million my amendment provides can be used for these \nor any of the other territorial assistance programs, such as the Coral \nReef Initiative, brown tree snake control, or compact impact to areas \nnegatively affected by United States immigration policies.\n  Mr. Chairman, all of these programs are works in progress. We should \nprovide more funding for them, and technical assistance funding should \nremain focused on programs that the Department has already begun and \ninvested in. I appreciate the past support for the program and, even in \nthese challenging fiscal times, I urge your support for increased \nfunding for assistance to territories for fiscal year 2016.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H4746]]\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the gentleman's \namendment. I want the gentleman to know that I understand that the \nterritories would benefit greatly from additional funding. We funded \nthe assistance to territories at the FY15-enacted levels. We level-\nfunded that because we know that the money is needed, and we know that \nwe have responsibilities in the territories. However, the offset right \nnow, we have cut back that particular operation considerably, so I \nwould oppose that offset. But I would be more than happy to work with \nthe gentleman as we move this process along, along with the ranking \nmember, to see if we can't get additional funds as we move this process \nalong.\n  Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate the gentleman's intent, but we \nwould have to reluctantly oppose this amendment at this time, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very much the chairman's offer to work \nwith me because I will look him up and work with him and his \nsubcommittee. But let me just make a small point here of what this \ntechnical assistance money means to us.\n  The States are eligible for thousands of Federal programs that help \nStates do one thing or another, from social to educational to \ninfrastructure projects. For the territories, there are only 700-some \nprograms where the territories are eligible. So there is a difference.\n  So this small pot of technical assistance money is a program that \nprovides grants to help the territories pick themselves up and wipe off \nthe dust. It is just a small amount of money. Five million goes a long \nway, Mr. Chairman, when it is fixing the schools that the Army Corps \nhas already identified. I understand there are 1,500 school buildings, \nand 62 percent of them are not safe, and only 38 percent are declared \nsafe. So just like we do for the Bureau of Indian Education, we are \nalso asking that we increase this money.\n  So I will also work with the chair, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from the Northern \nMariana Islands will be postponed.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the fact that the chairman \nis looking towards working more for putting dollars into Indian \neducation, as Mr. Gosar's amendment did, and the bipartisan way in \nwhich this bill has been proceeding forward, and I yield to the \nchairman.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I am more than happy to work with the \nyoung lady to get additional funding for Indian education at any time \nin the future, and we can continue to work together to do that.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I also appreciate the Parliamentarian's patience and \nthe majority's patience while we get another copy of the amendment \npresented to the body for consideration. I thank everyone for their \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. Chairman, Minnesota is a great State, and we would like to have \nthe gentleman from California there so the gentleman can see our great \nlakes and our great water.\n  I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, could the gentlewoman please ship some of \nthat water to California?\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Reclaiming my time and my water, we would love to have \nthe gentleman there, and when the water is very hard, it freezes, and \nthen the gentleman can try ice fishing, which is a great sport.\n  Mr. Chair, I think the amendment is coming to the desk. Once more, I \nthank you very much for your patience, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n\n\n               Amendment Offered by Ms. Castor of Florida\n\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 36, line 8, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $1,913,000)''.\n       Page 62, line 8, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $1,913,000)''.\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentlewoman's motion.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman from Florida and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the House's \nconsideration.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to restore \nbrownfields funding to fiscal year 2015 levels and to make the point \nthat when we help redevelop contaminated properties, we generate a \nlarge return on investments that lift our communities back home.\n  My amendment increases EPA's Environmental Programs and Management \naccount by a modest $1.9 million to be offset by the same amount from \nthe Office of the Secretary. Even with this modest boost, the proposed \nbill on the floor, unfortunately, would remain $4 million below the \nbudget request.\n  Mr. Chairman, when a contaminated property achieves a brownfields \ndesignation and a grant, local communities and businesses can clean up \nthe property and put the property back into use. This type of economic \nredevelopment is key to our neighborhoods and communities, rural or \nurban. It increases property values and creates jobs with just a little \nbit of seed money from the EPA through brownfields.\n  A 2014 study concluded that cleaning up brownfields leads to nearby \nresidential property value increases of 4.9 to 11 percent. Another 2007 \nstudy found that an average of 10 jobs are created for every acre of \nbrownfields redevelopment. And based on historical data, we know that \n$1 of the EPA's brownfields funding leverages between $17 and $18 in \nother public and private financing.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have witnessed great success in brownfields \nredevelopment back home in the Tampa Bay area. For example, when the \nexistence of the Old Mercy Hospital in Midtown St. Petersburg was in \njeopardy due to environmental contamination on the site, the city of \nSt. Petersburg and the EPA stepped in to turn the Old Mercy Hospital \ninto a flourishing community health center. The project created 80 \njobs, saved existing jobs, created new jobs, and it stands now as the \nJohnnie Ruth Clarke Community Health Center, which is the linchpin to \nMidtown St. Petersburg community redevelopment efforts.\n  Similarly, in Tampa, the Tampa Family Health Centers have redeveloped \na number of brownfields sites, including one on the site of a closed \ncar dealership, that have had a very positive impact beyond the health \ncare of thousands and thousands of my neighbors in a severely \nunderserved area. It is one of the primary examples of the growing \nhealthfields initiative which targets redevelopment through brownfields \nto help improve access to health services for our neighbors.\n  Mr. Chairman, the return on investment is so great across America. \nThe Congress must invest much more in our communities, and brownfields \nredevelopment is simply smart policy, especially in places where these \nresources are scarce. It is also a critical part of EPA's environmental \njustice efforts and its Environmental Justice 2020 Action Agenda \nframework. When the EPA released its Environmental Justice 2020 \nframework, I convened local community leaders across the Tampa Bay area \nto solicit their opinions, and brownfields redevelopment was at the top \nof their list.\n\n[[Page H4747]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, we can do better here, and I hope as the appropriations \nprocess goes on we will find ways to help communities redevelop with \nthis small seed money through the brownfields initiative.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum. I \nurge my colleagues to support the Castor amendment to revitalize our \ncommunities back home, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \npoint of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I wish the gentlewoman was able to share \nthis amendment with both the majority and the minority in the committee \nwhere we could have reviewed it. But saying that, I still must oppose \nthe amendment because of the offset.\n  Mr. Chairman, the offset obviously would take money from the \nSecretary and move it over to the EPA, and at this time we have used \nthe Secretary's Office tremendously as an offset already, and I am \nafraid that this may start affecting other programs within the \nDepartment of the Interior. So I would have to oppose this amendment.\n  The gentlewoman's amendment won't increase the cleanup of a \nbrownfields site, it will only pay for salaries over at the EPA, and I \nbelieve that we don't need to do any more for the EPA than has already \nbeen done.\n  So with that, Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, this is an important account to \nbeef up. Remember, we are under the sequester caps, and then we are $4 \nmillion under the budget request even with this amendment.\n  Now, the Secretary's Office is the best place to go for an offset. \nThe Secretary's account is $452 million above fiscal year 2015 levels \nand $389 million above the budget request.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  I would put to you that it would be a better investment for our \ncommunities back home to allow them this little seed money, this little \nmatching money, to redevelop properties, rather than fund the \nbureaucracy at the EPA.\n  I urge approval of the Castor amendment, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on \nthis amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Florida \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                       administrative provisions\n\n       For fiscal year 2016, up to $400,000 of the payments \n     authorized by the Act of October 20, 1976 (31 U.S.C. 6901-\n     6907) may be retained for administrative expenses of the \n     Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program: Provided, That no payment \n     shall be made pursuant to that Act to otherwise eligible \n     units of local government if the computed amount of the \n     payment is less than $100: Provided further, That the \n     Secretary may reduce the payment authorized by 31 U.S.C. \n     6901-6907 for an individual county by the amount necessary to \n     correct prior year overpayments to that county: Provided \n     further, That the amount needed to correct a prior year \n     underpayment to an individual county shall be paid from any \n     reductions for overpayments to other counties and the amount \n     necessary to cover any remaining underpayment is hereby \n     appropriated and shall be paid to individual counties: \n     Provided further, That of the total amount made available by \n     this title for ``Office of the Secretary--Departmental \n     Operations'', $452,000,000 shall be available to the \n     Secretary of the Interior for an additional amount for fiscal \n     year 2016 for payments in lieu of taxes under chapter 69 of \n     title 31, United States Code.\n\n                            Insular Affairs\n\n                       assistance to territories\n\n       For expenses necessary for assistance to territories under \n     the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior and other \n     jurisdictions identified in section 104(e) of Public Law 108-\n     188, $85,976,000, of which: (1) $76,528,000 shall remain \n     available until expended for territorial assistance, \n     including general technical assistance, maintenance \n     assistance, disaster assistance, coral reef initiative \n     activities, and brown tree snake control and research; grants \n     to the judiciary in American Samoa for compensation and \n     expenses, as authorized by law (48 U.S.C. 1661(c)); grants to \n     the Government of American Samoa, in addition to current \n     local revenues, for construction and support of governmental \n     functions; grants to the Government of the Virgin Islands as \n     authorized by law; grants to the Government of Guam, as \n     authorized by law; and grants to the Government of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands as authorized by law (Public Law 94-\n     241; 90 Stat. 272); and (2) $9,448,000 shall be available \n     until September 30, 2017, for salaries and expenses of the \n     Office of Insular Affairs: Provided, That all financial \n     transactions of the territorial and local governments herein \n     provided for, including such transactions of all agencies or \n     instrumentalities established or used by such governments, \n     may be audited by the Government Accountability Office, at \n     its discretion, in accordance with chapter 35 of title 31, \n     United States Code: Provided further, That Northern Mariana \n     Islands Covenant grant funding shall be provided according to \n     those terms of the Agreement of the Special Representatives \n     on Future United States Financial Assistance for the Northern \n     Mariana Islands approved by Public Law 104-134: Provided \n     further, That the funds for the program of operations and \n     maintenance improvement are appropriated to institutionalize \n     routine operations and maintenance improvement of capital \n     infrastructure with territorial participation and cost \n     sharing to be determined by the Secretary based on the \n     grantee's commitment to timely maintenance of its capital \n     assets: Provided further, That any appropriation for disaster \n     assistance under this heading in this Act or previous \n     appropriations Acts may be used as non-Federal matching funds \n     for the purpose of hazard mitigation grants provided pursuant \n     to section 404 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \n     Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170c).\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Ms. Plaskett\n\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nH.R. 2822.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 38, line 6, after the second dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $13,684,000) (increased by $13,684,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom the Virgin Islands and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Chairman, as one of the five Members of Congress \nrepresenting America's offshore territories and as the Representative \nfrom the U.S. Virgin Islands, I am disappointed to see the underfunding \nmade to the FY16 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations bill.\n  Aside from the underfunding to environmental protection programs that \nprotect important natural resources and, among a myriad of things, \nassures Americans have access to clean water, the cuts to this bill \ncome largely at the expense of America's island territories.\n  The Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the \nNorthern Marianas have been a part of this great Nation for more than a \ncentury. Since then, this country has augmented the support to critical \nareas of activity by the respective local governments in these \nterritories.\n  This is done, largely in part, through the Interior's territorial \nassistance activity, in which this bill proposes to underfund by \n$13,684,000.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is unacceptable. Funding through Interior's \nterritorial assistance activity go toward many important functions in \nthese territories, like capital improvement projects. These capital \nimprovement projects, CIP, funds address a variety of infrastructure \nneeds in the U.S. territories, including critical infrastructure such \nas hospitals, schools, wastewater, and solid waste systems.\n  For example, funding through CIP helped the Virgin Islands Waste \nManagement Authority complete the repair of a severely deteriorated \nforce main water line that threatened to leak in nearby ocean water.\n\n[[Page H4748]]\n\n  Improvements to critical infrastructure not only benefit the current \npopulation of these territories and the businesses that invest in those \ncommunities, but lay the groundwork to attract new investment to the \nterritories, which promotes economic development and self-sufficiency.\n  An example of the importance of this funding to the territories is \nhighlighted in the fiscal year '16 budget request, in which my home \ndistrict, the U.S. Virgin Islands, proposes to use approximately $2 \nmillion to address health and safety deferred maintenance items that \nhave been identified in Interior's insular assessment of buildings and \nclassrooms initiative. This is imperative, as our schools are not \nstructurally sound or conducive to the healthy learning environment.\n  Many of the schools in the Virgin Islands are overrun with mold and \nhave severe structural deficiencies, some of which are over a half a \ncentury old.\n  The St. Croix Central High School had to close its doors last year \nbecause of noxious odors that made teachers and students sick. This \nrecurring incident began midway through the 2013 school year and forced \nthe entire student body of more than 1,000 students to join a similarly \npopulated high school in double session for the remainder of the school \nyear.\n  This coming fall, the Virgin Islands government will again close \nschools on the island of St. Croix, but this time, students from three \nschools will be relocated to other schools for at least an entire \nschool year, maybe longer, while the local government works to repair \nthe severely decrepit buildings that house those young people.\n  Mr. Chairman, there hasn't been a school built in the U.S. Virgin \nIslands in the last two decades. The children in my home district, as \nwell as in the other five territories, deserve better and need the \nassistance afforded through this funding.\n  A breakdown of CIP expenditures in 2014 underscores how important \nthis funding is to not only students in our territories, but also to \nour senior citizens as well. Construction or repair to schools and \nhospitals account for nearly half the total amount of CIP expenditures \nlast year.\n  In St. Croix, our hospital is without an adequate mental health \nfacility, as well as St. Thomas, and there are few assisted living \nfacilities and a growing population of aging citizens.\n  The U.S. Virgin Islands also proposes to use $1 million in 2016 CIP \nfunding for structural renovations and equipment upgrades at a variety \nof public libraries on the islands of St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. \nJohn. These repairs and upgrades will help provide a safe, secure, and \ncomfortable location for citizens to use library archives and public \nresources.\n  Mr. Chairman, the people living in America's island territories are \ncitizens of this great Nation, the same as people living in Alaska, \nHawaii, and the 48 contiguous States. We are constitutionally entitled \nto fair and equal representation and full inclusion by this House, as \nwell as by this government.\n  I look forward to continuing to work on this issue.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to also point out that unlike the States, the \nVirgin Islands and the other territories are not part of the formula \ngrants that the other locations have. We do not receive the same \nfunding for grants, programs that provide technical assistance, jobs, \nor infrastructure.\n  In fact, today, with the announcement of the Supreme Court, while we \nare thankful for the rest of the United States, with the Affordable \nCare Act, we are not included in it to the full extent the other States \nare.\n  I am asking, Mr. Chairman, at this time, that this body, as well as \nthis Congress and, in fact, the Federal Government, look to the Virgin \nIslands and look to including us and all of the territories in full \ninclusion.\n  Mr. Chairman, at this time, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from the Virgin Islands?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                      compact of free association\n\n       For grants and necessary expenses, $3,318,000, to remain \n     available until expended, as provided for in sections \n     221(a)(2) and 233 of the Compact of Free Association for the \n     Republic of Palau; and section 221(a)(2) of the Compacts of \n     Free Association for the Government of the Republic of the \n     Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, as \n     authorized by Public Law 99-658 and Public Law 108-188.\n\n                       Administrative Provisions\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       At the request of the Governor of Guam, the Secretary may \n     transfer discretionary funds or mandatory funds provided \n     under section 104(e) of Public Law 108-188 and Public Law \n     104-134, that are allocated for Guam, to the Secretary of \n     Agriculture for the subsidy cost of direct or guaranteed \n     loans, plus not to exceed three percent of the amount of the \n     subsidy transferred for the cost of loan administration, for \n     the purposes authorized by the Rural Electrification Act of \n     1936 and section 306(a)(1) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural \n     Development Act for construction and repair projects in Guam, \n     and such funds shall remain available until expended: \n     Provided, That such costs, including the cost of modifying \n     such loans, shall be as defined in section 502 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974: Provided further, That such \n     loans or loan guarantees may be made without regard to the \n     population of the area, credit elsewhere requirements, and \n     restrictions on the types of eligible entities under the \n     Rural Electrification Act of 1936 and section 306(a)(1) of \n     the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act: Provided \n     further, That any funds transferred to the Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall be in addition to funds otherwise made \n     available to make or guarantee loans under such authorities.\n\n                        Office of the Solicitor\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Office of the Solicitor, \n     $65,142,000.\n\n                      Office of Inspector General\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Office of Inspector General, \n     $50,047,000.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 41, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $2,000,000)''.\n       On page 102, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $1,500,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me thank the chair and the ranking \nmember of this appropriations process for the Interior and Environment \nfor their indulgence and their understanding of how much a part of the \nlives of Americans this legislation is from my amendment dealing with \nthe culture and history of this Nation to that of clean water, clean \nair, our Federal parks, our forestry. This is a vital piece of the \nlivelihood and the life of America.\n  Among other agencies that the legislation funds is the Smithsonian \nInstitution, which operates our national museums, including the Air and \nSpace Museum, the Museum of African Art, the American Art Museum, and \nthe National Portrait Gallery. It also operates the national treasure, \nthe National Zoo.\n  My amendment is simple. It sends a very important message from the \nCongress of the United States to infuse into the people cultural and \nappreciation for the respect and holding of wild animals, for the \nforests, for the number of assets that we should hold very dear, and it \nincreases the Smithsonian Institution by $1.5 million.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Smithsonian's outreach programs bring scholars in \nart, history, and science out of the Nation's attic and into their own \nbackyard. Each year, millions of Americans visit the Smithsonian.\n  In order to fill the Smithsonian's mission, the increase and \ndiffusion of knowledge, the Smithsonian seeks to serve on an even \ngreater audience by bringing it to the communities, to the people who \notherwise would be deprived, or the institutions that would otherwise \nbe deprived of this kind of cultural exchange.\n  This money is not a lot of money, but it is an important statement \nfor those who seek to be connected to the cultural history of America.\n  The Smithsonian's outreach program serves millions of Americans, \nthousands of communities, and hundreds of institutions in all 50 States \nthrough\n\n[[Page H4749]]\n\nloans of objects, traveling exhibitions, and sharing of educational \nresources.\n  Smithsonian outreach programs work in close cooperation with \nSmithsonian museums and research centers, as well as with 144 affiliate \ninstitutions, and others across the Nation. Smithsonian outreach \nactivities support community-based cultural and educational \norganizations.\n  It reaches out to African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino \nAmericans, Native Americans, new Americans, and all Americans from \nkindergarten to college to our senior citizens.\n  What can we do to help this outreach expand? We can provide this \nsimple amendment of $1.5 million to create more mobile museums talking \nabout the extensive history that we have. These mobile museums then \nconnect with our museums that we have.\n  The African American Museum in Houston is one of those that needs the \nbridge that the Smithsonian has. It is a museum that has reached \nprominence, but not the ability to reach a lot of people. This is an \nopportunity to boost the Smithsonian in order to ensure that we have \nthat kind of outreach.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the \ngentlewoman's amendment only because of the offset.\n  The offset that we are talking about is taking money of the inspector \ngeneral's office, which is our auditors, and we desperately need \nauditors in the Federal Government. We, as appropriators, are very \nreluctant to cut the inspector general's office in general.\n  I want to work with the gentlewoman. I recognize her passion to make \nsure that the good work that the Smithsonian does gets out to the \ngeneral community throughout the United States. I am a big supporter of \nthe Smithsonian. We have level-funded the Smithsonian Institution this \nyear. Obviously, we are operating under difficult budget constraints.\n  We certainly support what the gentlewoman wants to do; we just don't \nsupport the offset in which she wants to do it with.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CALVERT. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I think we have had an opportunity to be on the \nfloor together over the years. Thank you so very much. I want to thank \nthe ranking member and the leadership on the committee.\n  My question would be--obviously, this appropriations process is a \nbill here in the House and then there is conference--what would be the \nimmediate strategy of working with you on this goal that we both would \nhave?\n  I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. CALVERT. We will continue to work with the gentlewoman as this \nprocess moves forward and with the ranking member, Ms. McCollum.\n  Who knows, there may be something that happens between A and B, and \nwe may have some additional resources, who knows; but we will certainly \nwork with you to find out if we do.\n  I know that if we can help the Smithsonian Institution out, it is \nreally at the top of our list.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman.\n  Let me, first of all, thank the ranking member for all the hard work \nthat has been done and the chairman. It is a passion for reaching out \nand touching museums like the Houston African American Museum that has, \nas its curator, an excellent leader in John Guess.\n  I would say to museums like that to allow me to take up the chairman \nand the ranking member's leadership and begin to look for what may be \nan extra opportunity to infuse dollars to get the culture of America to \nreach out to all over.\n  With that, in the spirit of collaboration and collegiality, I am \ngoing to at this time withdraw in a friendly manner the Jackson Lee \namendment with a very hopeful commitment to be able to help museums \nlike the Houston African American Museum and many others that really \nbenefit from this connection.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. I thank the gentlewoman for her generosity, and I will \ncontinue to work with her as this process moves forward.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me just say, in concluding, there \nare many things that this bill does. I am hoping that we will rid \nourselves of sequester to let it do more, and one of the things would \nbe this outreach that brings us together as a Nation in a positive way.\n  I cannot say good accolades about Houston museums in general, the \nBuffalo Soldiers National Museum, the Houston African American Museum \nthat has a great purpose, and other museums that I hope we can address \nthe Smithsonian's outreach capability.\n  Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of my \namendment to H.R. 2822, the ``Interior and Environment Appropriations \nAct of 2016.''\n  Let me also thank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for \ntheir leadership in shepherding this bill to the floor.\n  Among other agencies, this legislation funds the Smithsonian \nInstitution, which operates our national museums, including the Air and \nSpace Museum; the Museum of African Art; the Museum of the American \nIndian; and the National Portrait Gallery.\n  The Smithsonian also operates another national treasure: the National \nZoo.\n  Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple but it sends a very important \nmessage from the Congress of the United States.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment provides that increases funding for the \nSmithsonian Institution by $1.5 million to fund outreach programs \nadministered by the Smithsonian Institution.\n  Mr. Chair, the Smithsonian's outreach programs bring Smithsonian \nscholars in art, history and science out of ``the nation's attic'' and \ninto their own backyard.\n  Each year, millions of Americans visit the Smithsonian in Washington, \nD.C.\n  But in order to fulfill the Smithsonian's mission, ``the increase and \ndiffusion of knowledge,'' the Smithsonian seeks to serve an even \ngreater audience by bringing the Smithsonian to enclaves of communities \nwho otherwise would be deprived of the vast amount of cultural history \noffered by the Smithsonian.\n  The Smithsonian's outreach programs serve millions of Americans, \nthousands of communities, and hundreds of institutions in all 50 \nstates, through loans of objects, traveling exhibitions, and sharing of \neducational resources via publications, lectures and presentations, \ntraining programs, and websites.\n  Smithsonian outreach programs work in close cooperation with \nSmithsonian museums and research centers, as well as with 144 affiliate \ninstitutions and others across the nation.\n  The Smithsonian's outreach activities support community-based \ncultural and educational organizations around the country.\n  They ensure a vital, recurring, and high-impact Smithsonian presence \nin all 50 states through the provision of traveling exhibitions and a \nnetwork of affiliations.\n  Smithsonian outreach programs increase connections between the \nInstitution and targeted audiences (African American, Asian American, \nLatino, Native American, and new American) and provide kindergarten \nthrough college-age museum education and outreach opportunities.\n  These outreach programs enhance K-12 science education programs, \nfacilitate the Smithsonian's scholarly interactions with students and \nscholars at universities, museums, and other research institutions; and \ndisseminate results related to the research and collections strengths \nof the Institution.\n  The programs that provide the critical mass of Smithsonian outreach \nactivity are:\n  1. the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES);\n  2. the Smithsonian Affiliations, the Smithsonian Center for Education \nand Museum Studies (SCEMS);\n  3. National Science Resources Center (NSRC);\n  4. the Smithsonian Institution Press (SIP);\n  5. the Office of Fellowships (OF); and\n  6. the Smithsonian Associates (TSA), which receives no federal \nfunding.\n  To achieve the goal of increasing public engagement, SITES directs \nsome of its federal resources to develop Smithsonian Across America: A \nCelebration of National Pride.\n  This ``mobile museum,'' which will feature Smithsonian artifacts from \nthe most iconic (presidential portraits, historic American flags, Civil \nWar records, astronaut uniforms, etc.) to the simplest items of \neveryday life (family quilts, prairie schoolhouse furnishings, historic \nlunch boxes, multilingual store front and street\n\n[[Page H4750]]\n\nsigns, etc.), has been a long-standing organizational priority of the \nSmithsonian.\n  SITES ``mobile museum'' is the only traveling exhibit format able to \nguarantee audience growth and expanded geographic distribution during \nsustained periods of economic retrenchment, but also because it is \nimperative for the many exhibitors nationwide who are struggling \nfinancially yet eager to participate in Smithsonian outreach.\n  For communities still struggling to fully recover from the economic \ndownturn, the ability of museums to present temporary exhibitions, the \n``mobile museum'' promises to answer an ever-growing demand for \nSmithsonian shows in the field.\n  A single, conventional SITES exhibit can reach a maximum of 12 \nlocations over a two- to three-year period.\n  In contrast, a ``mobile museum'' exhibit can visit up to three venues \nper week in the course of only one year, at no cost to the host \ninstitution or community.\n  The net result is an increase by 150 in the number of outreach \nlocations to which SITES shows can travel annually.\n  And in addition to its flexibility in making short-term stops in \ncities and towns from coast-to-coast, a ``mobile museum'' has the \nadvantage of being able to frequent the very locations where people \nlive, work, and take part in leisure time activities.\n  By establishing an exhibit presence in settings like these, SITES \nwill not only increase its annual visitor participation by 1 million, \nbut also advance a key Smithsonian performance objective: to develop \nexhibit approaches that address diverse audiences, including population \ngroups not always affiliated with mainstream cultural institutions.\n  SITES also will be the public exhibitions' face of the Smithsonian's \nNational Museum of African American History and Culture, as that new \nMuseum comes online.\n  Providing national access to projects that will introduce the \nAmerican public to the Museum's mission, SITES in FY 2008 will tour \nsuch stirring exhibitions as NASA ART: 50 Years of Exploration; 381 \nDays: The Montgomery Bus Boycott Story; Beyond: Visions of Planetary \nLandscapes; The Way We Worked: Photographs from the National Archives; \nand More Than Words: Illustrated Letters from the Smithsonian's \nArchives of American Art.\n  To meet the growing demand among smaller community and ethnic museums \nfor an exhibition celebrating the Latino experience, SITES provided a \nscaled-down version of the National Museum of American History's 4,000-\nsquare-foot exhibition about legendary entertainer Celia Cruz.\n  Two 1,500-square-foot exhibitions, one about Crow Indian history and \nthe other on basket traditions, will give Smithsonian visitors beyond \nWashington a taste of the Institution's critically acclaimed National \nMuseum of the American Indian.\n  Two more exhibits, ``In Plane View'' and ``Earth from Space,'' \nprovided visitors an opportunity to experience the Smithsonian's \nrecently opened, expansive National Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy \nCenter.\n  For almost 30 years, The Smithsonian Associates--the highly regarded \neducational arm of the Smithsonian Institution--has arranged Scholars \nin the Schools programs.\n  Through this tremendously successful and well-received educational \noutreach program, the Smithsonian shares its staff--hundreds of experts \nin art, history and science--with the national community at a local \nlevel.\n  The mission of Smithsonian Affiliations is to build a strong national \nnetwork of museums and educational organizations in order to establish \nactive and engaging relationships with communities throughout the \ncountry.\n  There are currently 138 affiliates located in the United States, \nPuerto Rico, and Panama.\n  By working with museums of diverse subject areas and scholarly \ndisciplines, both emerging and well-established, Smithsonian \nAffiliations is building partnerships through which audiences and \nvisitors everywhere will be able to share in the great wealth of the \nSmithsonian while building capacity and expertise in local communities.\n  The National Science Resources Center (NSRC) strives to increase the \nnumber of ethnically diverse students participating in effective \nscience programs based on NSRC products and services.\n  The Center develops and implements a national outreach strategy that \nwill increase the number of school districts (currently more than 800) \nthat are implementing NSRC K-8 programs.\n  The NSRC is striving to further enhance its program activity with a \nnewly developed scientific outreach program introducing communities and \nschool districts to science through literacy initiatives.\n  In addition, through the building of the multicultural Alliance \nInitiative, the Smithsonian's outreach programs seek to develop new \napproaches to enable the public to gain access to Smithsonian \ncollections, research, education, and public programs that reflect the \ndiversity of the American people, including underserved audiences of \nethnic populations and persons with disabilities.\n  For all these reasons, Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment and \nthank Chairman Dicks and Ranking Member Tiahrt for their courtesies, \nconsideration, and very fine work in putting together this excellent \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment at this time and \nbegin to work the process to provide funding to the Smithsonian for \nthat purpose.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

The Clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Beginning at page 59, line 9, strike section 120.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, last week, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService destroyed a 1-ton stockpile of illegal elephant ivory. Most of \nit was seized up from a Philadelphia antique dealer named Victor \nGordon.\n  For at least 9 years, Gordon imported and sold ivory from freshly \nkilled African elephants in violation of U.S. law and the laws of the \ncountries where the elephants were poached and the ivory stolen.\n  How did he get away with this for so long? The ivory was doctored so \nthat it looked old enough to pass through a loophole in the enforcement \nof the African Elephant Conservation Act, a law that was passed in 1989 \nto end the commercial import and export of ivory.\n  While a ton of ivory was confiscated, there is no way to know how \nmuch Gordon had sold during the previous decade or where it is now. All \nwe know for certain is all of it was illegal, all of it is nearly \nimpossible to distinguish from antique ivory, and anyone who bought it \nfrom Gordon, resells it, or buys it from a new owner is contributing to \nthe ongoing slaughter of elephants and the criminal trafficking of \nivory that supports organized crime and terrorism.\n\n[[Page H4753]]\n\n  This has got to stop. How many more Victor Gordons are out there? The \namount is a question that can't be answered. The amount of ivory seized \nfrom his shop represents 100 elephants, roughly the same number killed \nevery day in Africa.\n  The photo we wanted to enlarge was a photo of an Africa elephant that \nhad been killed and its head decapitated and the ivory butchered out of \nits head. Upon review, it was decided that it was too graphic and \ndisturbing for the Chamber and for the floor, and we didn't bring that \none.\n  While much of this poaching is fueled by demand for ivory in Asia, a \nsignificant black market exists in the United States, as evidenced by \nthe Gordon case and similar State level investigations in New York City \nand elsewhere.\n  The only way--and I repeat--the only way to keep U.S. citizens from \nbeing involved, whether knowingly or unknowingly, in this elephant \npoaching and trafficking crisis is to close the enforcement loopholes \nand eliminate the commercial import, export, and trade of Africa \nelephant ivory in this country.\n  That is precisely what the Obama administration is trying to do by \nproposing new rules to limit ivory trade in the United States. Instead \nof assisting in this important cause, House Republicans have slipped a \nrider into the appropriations bill to kill the new rule before it is \neven finalized.\n  My amendment would remove this rider. Ending the commercial ivory \ntrade does not mean taking away people's musical instruments, as some \nhave said, ivory-handled pistols, or family heirlooms. Museum \ncollections, scientific specimens, and sport-hunted trophies will also \nbe allowed to move freely. Further, items containing very small amounts \nof ivory can be bought and sold.\n  Profiteering off elephant parts will no longer be allowed, nor should \nit be. As long as ivory has monetary value, people will kill elephants \nto get it. Eliminating value will eliminate demand and that will reduce \nwildlife poaching and trafficking.\n  I understand the administration's proposed ivory rule is due out very \nshortly, and in the interest of giving everyone a chance to review that \nrule, I will withdraw this amendment today.\n  However, I will not hesitate to return with a similar amendment later \nif that is what it takes to remove this damaging rider from the bill.\n  I ask, Mr. Chairman, unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Arizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                       Reissuance of Final Rules\n\n       Sec. 121.

Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Rhode Island and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  This amendment, which I am offering with my good friends, Mr. Keating \nand Mr. Cicilline, will provide $1 million to the southern New England \nestuaries geographic program. This program was funded at $5 million \nlast year and has been incredibly successful at leveraging resources, \nbringing stakeholders together, and increasing efficiencies.\n  Estuaries are essential for healthy coastal ecosystems. They provide \nbenefits of great economic and ecologic significance, including vital \nnesting and feeding habitats for aquatic plants and animals; yet they \nare increasingly affected by impacts of human activity along our \ncoasts. These funds will be used to continue efforts to protect and \nrestore our coasts and estuaries, which are critical for our \nenvironment and our economy.\n  The southern New England estuaries geographic program supports \nprojects and science to restore the health of southeastern New \nEngland's estuaries watersheds and coastal waters and ensure access now \nand in the future to resilient, self-sustaining ecosystems and \nassociated populations of our fish and shellfish.\n  I would like to take a moment to say that the account that we are \nreallocating from, EPA science and technology, is also critically \nimportant. While we would have liked to offer an amendment increasing \nthe southern New England estuary geographic program to its full funding \namount of $5 million, there were neither sufficient nor appropriate \noffsets in this bill to do so.\n  Mr. Chair, I hope that as our appropriators go to conference with the \nSenate, they are able to restore the full funding amount of $5 million \nfor this important program.\n  I would also like to thank Congressman Keating, along with \nCongressman Cicilline, for being tremendous partners in ensuring that \nour southern New England estuaries are restored and stay healthy for \ngenerations to come.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Calvert, Ranking Member McCollum, and \ntheir staffs who worked on this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the funding for the southern New \nEngland estuary geographic program.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), my good \nfriend and colleague, to speak on the amendment.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague and friend for \nyielding.\n  I also would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Keating, who \nunfortunately could not be with us today, for his hard work on this \nimportant issue, and I thank my colleague from Rhode Island (Mr. \nLangevin) for his elegant words.\n  Mr. Chairman, the estuaries in Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island and \nBuzzards Bay in Massachusetts face significant environmental \nchallenges, many shared by estuaries across the country. These \nchallenges include rivers and streams that are disconnected from the \nlandscape, the loss of critical wetlands, the impacts of centuries of \nurbanization and development, and aging infrastructure.\n  Southern New England estuaries are especially threatened by these \nchallenges. Yet despite the harm that we know is being done to our \nestuaries, southern New England was the only geographic region in this \nbill which saw\n\n[[Page H4754]]\n\nall of its estuary funding eliminated. While some geographic regions \nwere underfunded compared to fiscal year 2016 requests, most requests \nfor geographic regions were either met or, in some cases, increased. \nInexplicably, it was only southern New England that was singled out for \ncomplete elimination of funding for the next fiscal year.\n  This amendment would restore a modest $1 million funding for southern \nNew England estuaries program, as Congressman Langevin said. Then, at \nconference, we hope that full funding is restored.\n  The southern New England watershed has experienced more than 400 \nyears of ecological degradation, which is further exacerbated by the \neffects of climate change. Rivers and waterways have become \ndisconnected from the watershed, which has led to the absorption of \nnitrogen and other pollutants from sources such as septic systems, \ntreatment plants, and storm water runoff.\n  The funding provided to these geographic programs allows for \nessential collaboration between Federal entities, nonprofit and \nacademic institutions, and other private entities to formulate \ninnovative solutions and to produce new technologies to create cleaner \nand clearer waterways. For example, in fiscal year 2014, more than \n$65,000 in grants was awarded to the Narragansett Bay watershed. This \nfunded projects run by Save the Bay in my district, including an \neducation and awareness project for residents and businesses on \nAquidneck Island as well as a partnership program involving the Rhode \nIsland Coastal Resources Management Council to facilitate site visits \nto more than 200 shoreline rights-of-way to determine any needed levels \nof improvement to public access.\n  Programs like these have proven to be effective. In fact, the \nNarragansett Bay Estuary Program was awarded a 2015 Environmental Merit \nAward from EPA New England for outstanding contributions on behalf of \nsouthern New England's public health and natural environment. These \ncollaborative efforts throughout the southern New England region with \ncontinued funding will help to support projects to protect ecological \nhabitats, foster self-sustaining ecosystems, and protect wildlife. \nFederal collaboration and investment is essential to helping local \ncommunities apply for and receive funding.\n  I thank my colleague from Rhode Island and my colleague from \nMassachusetts for the great work they have done on this issue.\n  I urge passage of this amendment by all of my colleagues.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, but I don't \noppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I would be happy to work with the gentlemen, and I would \nurge acceptance of this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his support of \nthe amendment as well as my colleague and Mr. Keating. As I said, this \nis such an important amendment. It includes important funding for \nprotecting our ecosystems.\n  I urge passage of my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                 Environmental Programs and Management\n\n       For environmental programs and management, including \n     necessary expenses, not otherwise provided for, for personnel \n     and related costs and travel expenses; hire of passenger \n     motor vehicles; hire, maintenance, and operation of aircraft; \n     purchase of reprints; library memberships in societies or \n     associations which issue publications to members only or at a \n     price to members lower than to subscribers who are not \n     members; administrative costs of the brownfields program \n     under the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields \n     Revitalization Act of 2002; and not to exceed $9,000 for \n     official reception and representation expenses, \n     $2,472,289,000, to remain available until September 30, 2017: \n     Provided, That of the funds included under this heading, \n     $12,700,000 shall be for Environmental Protection: National \n     Priorities as specified in the report accompanying this Act: \n     Provided further, That of the funds included under this \n     heading, $403,523,000 shall be for Geographic Programs \n     specified in the report accompanying this Act.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Grayson\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON.

The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 62, line 8, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $2,212,000) (increased by $2,212,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Calvert and his \nstaff for working with me on this amendment. It simply seeks to \ndecrease and then increase by the same amount within the $2.5 billion \nappropriation for the environmental programs and management account \nwithin the Environmental Protection Agency. More specifically, my \namendment seeks to remove and then reapply $2.2 million from that \naccount.\n  The intent behind my amendment is simple. It is to put the House on \nrecord of supporting a final funding amount of $27,310,000 for the \nNational Estuary Program and coastal waterways.\n  Currently, the report accompanying this bill calls for $25,098,000 \nfor the National Estuary Program and coastal waterways, which is \n$2,212,000 below both the Senate's proposed appropriations level and \nthe President's request for fiscal year 2016. Hence, the amount \nspecified in my amendment.\n  The National Estuary Program and coastal waterways subaccount within \nthe EPA does important work, including work in my State, especially on \nthe Atlantic Coast. It addresses ocean acidification, seeks to remove \ncoastal watersheds, furthers the National Estuary Program's restoration \ngoals, and assists in the implementation of the very important Gulf of \nMexico hypoxia action plan.\n  Mr. Chairman, there is an area, a large area called the dead zone off \nof Louisiana that literally stinks. It has no fish. It has no \nrecreational opportunities. It has no fishing. It is, in fact, a scar \non the face of the Earth. Part of the funding for this program is used \nto try to overcome the hypoxia situation that has arisen off the coast \nof Louisiana that threatens to spread not only to Texas, Alabama, and \nMississippi, but also to the coast of my State of Florida, eventually, \nif we do nothing about it.\n  The estuarine regions of the United States comprise just 12 percent \nof land area of the United States, but they contain 43 percent of the \nU.S. population and provide 49 percent of all U.S. economic output. The \neconomic value of coastal recreation alone in the United States--beach \ngoing, fishing, bird watching, snorkeling, diving, and so on--has \nconservatively been estimated by NOAA to be between $20 billion and $60 \nbillion annually.\n  Clearly, the $2.2 million increase in funding for the National \nEstuary Program and coastal waterways that I am seeking will result in \ndramatic returns for the American economy, an enhanced quality of life \nfor the American people, and eliminate that scar on the face of planet \nEarth that exists off the coast of Louisiana and should never be \nallowed to spread.\n  Mr. Chairman, I know that you support this amendment, and I am \nthankful for your support. With that in mind, I will stop talking \nbefore I lose your support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n            Amendment Offered by Mr. Mooney of West Virginia\n\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an \namendment to the fiscal year 2016 Interior Appropriations bill that \nwill help strengthen transparency and oversight at the Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA. My amendment simply provides $1 million in \nadditional funding for the Office of Inspector General at the EPA.\n  I thank Chairman Ken Calvert for working with me on this amendment.\n  Under the current administration, the EPA has waged an all-out war on \njobs in the beautiful Second District of West Virginia and on \ncommunities across America. With this backdrop, I think it is \nabsolutely critical that we strengthen oversight and transparency at \nthe EPA. Taxpayers deserve to know what is going on behind the curtain.\n  The Office of the Inspector General plays a critical oversight role \nwithin the EPA. It is the independent office that works diligently to \nroot out waste, fraud, and abuse. For example, a May 28, 2015, report \nfound that two separate EPA employees were viewing pornography at work \nfor up to 6 hours a day, and they were paid in the neighborhood of \n$120,000 a year while doing it.\n  The same report found that Renee Page, who at the time was Director \nof the EPA's Office of Administration, allegedly sold jewelry and \nweight loss pills out of her office. But she didn't stop there with her \nabuses. She hired not one, not two, but 17 family members and friends \nfor paid internships at the EPA.\n  These are just two examples of the incredible abuses of public trust \nand of taxpayer dollars that occur at the EPA. Without rigorous \noversight from the inspector general, these abuses might never have \nbeen exposed.\n  My amendment provides additional oversight funding without increasing \nthe budgetary impact of the fiscal year 2016 Interior Appropriations \nbill. We pull the money from the Office of Public Affairs, which is the \noffice responsible for promoting the administration's radical \nenvironmental agenda, and use it instead for oversight.\n  I would encourage my colleagues today to cast their vote in favor of \nmy amendment.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. I yield to the gentleman from \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to support this \namendment. I appreciate the gentleman's bringing it up, and I encourage \neveryone to adopt it.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mooney).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n            Amendment Offered by Mr. Mooney of West Virginia\n\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 62, line 8, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $2,000,000)''.\n       Page 132, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $2,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom West Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would \nstrike $2 million in funding from the Environmental Protection Agency \nOffice of Policy and transfer those funds to the deficit reduction \naccount.\n  The Office of Policy is located within the EPA Office of the \nAdministrator and is the primary policy arm for the Agency, or what I \nhave been calling the regulatory nerve center. The funding for this \noffice directly supports this administration's radical regulatory \nagenda that is putting an alarming number of my constituents out of \nwork, and they are not shy about it.\n  The head of the EPA's Office of Policy, Joel Beauvais, on October 13, \n2014, boasted to a group of New York University law students that his \noffice ``coordinates the process through which all of the EPA's rules \nare developed, including the clean power plan.''\n  Well, the so-called clean power plan is projected to increase energy \ncosts by as much as $479 billion over the next 15 years. For my \nconstituents in the beautiful Second District of West Virginia, that \nmeans an average electricity price increase of 12 percent. This is \nsomething we cannot afford. Yesterday, on the floor of this Chamber, we \npassed the ratepayer protection plan, which will stop the clean power \nplan, but the Office of Policy is coordinating more than just the clean \npower plan. The EPA issues about 150 new regulations each year, and \nthis office is right at the center.\n  Another rule that deserves attention is the EPA's proposed ozone \nstandard. The National Association of Manufacturers found that this new \nregulation could reduce the United States' GDP by $207 billion to $360 \nbillion annually, leading to 2.9 million fewer jobs between now and \n2040.\n  It is clear that the EPA, under this administration, will continue to \npromote their radical environmentalist agenda through an enormous \nnumber of rules and regulations. We have to slow this process, and that \nis why I propose this amendment to cut the Office of Policy funding by \n$2 million. I would encourage my colleagues today to cast their vote in \nfavor of my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. The gentleman's amendment would cut $2 million from the \nOffice of Policy and Program and put the savings into the so-called \nspending reduction account. If enacted, this would cut an already \nbarebones bill that is plagued by policy riders and further erode our \nenvironment.\n  I am concerned that this cut could have great influence on what the \npolicy division does in its relationship in working with States and \ndivisions within States, community assistance, and its research \ndivision.\n  I would also point out to my colleagues that the spending reduction \naccount has never been enacted into law in the 4 years it has been \nproposed, so there really isn't an account I know of that has been \nauthorized where this fund could go.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and to keep the Office \nof Policy able to do its work that impacts on our States and local \ncommunity.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Calvert).\n  Mr. CALVERT. I agree with the gentleman's amendment. I would urge its \nadoption.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum \nfor their collaborative efforts in putting together this bill that \ncarefully and thoughtfully allocates limited resources in order to \nconserve and restore our Nation's precious natural resources.\n  As you know, States across the Nation, especially those in the West, \nface widespread drought and deteriorating forest health conditions, all \nof which increase the risk of catastrophic wildfires and the tragic \nloss of life and property.\n\n[[Page H4756]]\n\n  Furthermore, these forest health conditions and the wildfires wreak \nhavoc on species habitat; recreational economies; critical \ninfrastructure; and clean, abundant water supplies.\n  In 2014, the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior \nagencies spent over $1.5 million in fire suppression costs to combat \nfires on more than $3.5 million acres of private, State, and Federal \nlands.\n  These suppression costs will only continue to rise if we do not \nappropriately address the critical issues of wildfire preparation, \nincluding hazardous fuel management activities.\n  For far too long, we have been addressing the problem after the fact. \nThat course of action has led to decades of declining healthy forests \nand a staggering increase in the occurrence of catastrophic wildfires, \nputting people, communities, and ecosytems at risk.\n  In fiscal year 2015, Congress provided a $75 million increase for \nhazardous fuels management. I applaud Chairman Calvert and my \ncolleagues for spearheading these efforts, but we can do more.\n  Today, I am offering a simple amendment that will bolster the \nwildfire management system account on the National Forest System lands \nby $20 million, allowing the Forest Service to be able to expand \nongoing work on hazardous fuels reduction and fire mitigation projects.\n  Quite simply, the cost of proactive healthy forest management is far \nless than the cost of wildfire suppression and cleaning up devastating \naftermaths.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  At this time, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. \nPearce), a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from Colorado \nbringing this amendment.\n  In the West, we are finding that our States are being burned up. They \nare burned up because the forests are simply full of fuel that has not \nbeen cut or logged for the last 20, 30 years. These are internal \ndecisions that were created by an inappropriate listing of the spotted \nowl, declaring that timber reduction was the reason the spotted owl was \ngoing extinct.\n  A couple of years ago, the Fish and Wildlife Service reversed that, \nsaying: Oops, logging had nothing to do with it.\n  It doesn't matter. Now, the damage is done. Our forests are chock-\nfull of fuels. It has been extraordinarily dry through the West. Small \nsparks set off tremendous blazes. The wind always blows in the West. We \nfind these raging while fires that weren't in existence 30, 40, and 50 \nyears ago because nature was pretty well in harmony.\n  The idea of the gentleman is simply to put more money into the fuels \nreduction account. That is a commonsense solution that will save us in \nthe West, save our valuable resources, save our valuable forests, and \nit will make sense for the country.\n  I support the amendment and would urge its adoption.\n  Mr. TIPTON. I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), \nthe chairman.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I certainly agree with you. We need to improve the \ncondition of our national forests. My home of California, as you know, \nis going through an exceptional drought. Colorado is just not sending \nenough water down the Colorado River, so you need to help us out a \nlittle bit.\n  This hazardous fuel issue is a huge issue in my area. As you know, we \nhave the blight issue that is just killing trees because we have too \nmany trees in the forests, and it has weakened the forests.\n  This is a good amendment, and I certainly urge its adoption.\n  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maine is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, while I certainly appreciate the challenges \nthat so many Western States are facing right now with the drought and \nvery frightening wildfires, I need to oppose this.\n  Unlike most programs in H.R. 2822, especially within the Forest \nService, the base hazardous fuels program received a $10 million \nincrease above the FY 2015 enacted level.\n  There is a reduction in H.R. 2822 to the biomass grant portion of the \nhazardous fuels program, but I see nothing in this amendment that \naddresses that cut.\n  We would all like to see increases in funding for many programs \nfunded by the bill. Chairman Calvert has certainly been a strong \nadvocate for a robust wildland fire program, including hazardous fuels. \nComing from the fire-prone State of California, as he just mentioned, \nhe knows as well as anyone that our fire programs needs support, and he \nhas funded that accordingly.\n  To provide what would be a record level of funding for hazardous \nfuels, the sponsor of this amendment would cut an additional $20 \nmillion from the EPA, which is why I feel it is important to oppose \nthis amendment.\n  This bill already severely cuts the EPA's main operating account by \n$141.4 million, or 5 percent. I strongly oppose an amendment that takes \nmore money from the already starved EPA. The very air we breathe and \nthe water we drink are endangered by the funding and policy decisions \nmade in this bill, and their consequences will be negatively felt in \ncommunities across this Nation.\n  I know cutting EPA is an easy target for many of my colleagues across \nthe aisle, but I want to make sure that my colleagues understand what \nthis amendment would cut if it was adopted.\n  This account funds programs that are important to both sides of the \naisle, including permitting for construction projects across the \ncountry, toxics risk prevention, the cleanup of toxic waste sites, \npesticide licensing, and radiation prevention.\n  EPA's work goes beyond the political talking point of scary \nregulations and is necessary to keep vulnerable populations safe from \nenvironmental disasters. It is beyond reason, frankly, to cut the very \nFederal employees that have ably responded to the disasters such as the \nBP oil spill and the coal ash spill in Kingston, Tennessee, in 2008.\n  I do not support gutting the EPA further, and I oppose this \namendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, the current Environmental Protection Agency \nlikes to applaud itself that it is a champion of clean air and clean \nwater. For those of us who live in the West, this is not a political \ntalking point. This is reality.\n  If you care about clean air, think about the carbon that is emitted \nfrom wildfires. Think about the devastation to the wildlife habitat as \nour forests burn. Think about clean water as ash is washed down through \nthe ravines into very narrow watersheds where we have endangered \nspecies residing as well.\n  I would submit, Mr. Chairman, that we actually put action through our \nwords in terms of being proactive and in terms of addressing forest \nhealth. If you care about clean water, if you care about endangered \nspecies, if you care about clean air, this is an opportunity to \nactually allow us to be able to move the ball forward, to be able to \naddress what the Environmental Protection Agency says it is about--that \nis clean air, clean water.\n  This amendment will help achieve that goal, and encourage my \ncolleagues to adopt it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from California and a\n\n[[Page H4758]]\n\nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, although I had planned to withdraw my \namendment, I feel it is important to discuss the Clean Water and Safe \nDrinking Water State Revolving Funds and the benefits these funds \nprovide to our Nation.\n  Droughts are becoming more severe, which is putting an incredible \nstrain on our water supply in California, and in my district, where we \nare experiencing a historic drought for the last 4 years. We have to \nmanage our available water in smart and efficient ways.\n  We lose an estimated 7 billion gallons of water a day from leaking \npipes, with some cities losing as much as 30 percent of their water. At \nthe same time, these cracks expose the water supply to an increasing \nnumber of waterborne diseases and contaminants. This means utilities \nface considerable challenges as they try to provide both adequate and \nsafe drinking water to families and businesses.\n  Upgrading our infrastructure would save trillions of gallons of water \na year and make our water safer to drink, but the best part is that, \naccording to the American Water Works Association, there are already \nenough shovel-ready water projects around the United States that would \ncreate work for more than 400,000 Americans, including almost 90,000 \ndirect construction jobs. These are jobs that would be welcomed with \nopen arms in our towns and cities across the United States.\n  Our Nation's water infrastructure is in desperate need of repair. \nAccording to an infrastructure needs survey by the EPA, nearly $335 \nbillion worth of repairs, upgrades, and replacements are needed by \nwater systems in the next 20 years to continue providing safe drinking \nwater and protecting public health. Almost $300 billion is needed to \nrepair and replace wastewater and storm water pipes and treatment \nplants.\n  Furthermore, the National Association of Clean Water Agencies and the \nAssociation of Metropolitan Water Agencies estimate that utilities will \nneed to spend $448 billion to $944 billion by 2050 just to deal with \nclimate change impacts.\n  Considering the significant water infrastructure needs our country is \nfacing, the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Funds \nhave never been more important.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  These funds help finance projects that handle and treat domestic \nsewage and storm water and deliver drinking water to homes and \nbusinesses. These infrastructure investments also create jobs and have \na positive impact on the economy well beyond the amount spent.\n  Unfortunately, the bill proposes significant--and I want to repeat \nthat--significant reductions to drinking water SFRs and over a $400 \nmillion cut in the Clean Water Act sewage treatment SFRs.\n  The Nation's water infrastructure needs already exceed the available \nfunding, and cutting the revolving funds by this much means that a \ngreater number of deserving community projects will not be able to get \ndone. This approach will only imperil our infrastructure and our \nhealthy communities that it helps foster.\n  Congress should commit to providing the necessary funding to maintain \nand upgrade our Nation's ailing water infrastructure and make sure that \nthe green infrastructure is a critical part of that process.\n  My State of California is doing its best to cope with a severe and \nongoing drought, and Congress must do its best to fund and support the \nneeded infrastructure and water quality enhancements that preserve our \nprecious water resources and create a sustainable system.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Kildee\n\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 68, strike lines 1 and 2 and insert the following: ``: \n     Provided further, That an entity shall not be an eligible \n     recipient for a grant under this paragraph unless the entity \n     has experienced at least 15 percent population loss since \n     1970, as measured by data from the 2010 decennial census and \n     has experienced prolonged population, income, and employment \n     loss resulting in substantial levels of housing vacancy and \n     abandonment and such housing vacancies and abandonments are \n     concentrated in more than one neighborhood or geographic area \n     within a jurisdiction or jurisdictions.''.\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from Michigan and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, my hometown of Flint, Michigan, has endured \ndecades of job loss and population loss through the slow, painful \nerosion of our manufacturing base. Previous trade deals, population \nshifts, bad land use management, and trade deals like NAFTA, for \nexample, have accelerated the job losses in my hometown.\n  That has had the effect of reducing local revenues, creating lower \nhousing prices, less local services, and less investments in things \nthat matter the most, like infrastructure, including our own water \nsystem. To reinvest in those places costs money that the cities don't \nhave.\n  The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund was specifically designed to \nassist communities with maintaining and improving water infrastructure. \nThis fund provides critical support to ensure safe, clean drinking \nwater is available in our communities.\n  Many of us represent communities, however, that have outstanding \nloans issued under the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund from prior \nto 2009, and those loan funds are ineligible for certain types of help \nbecause of the timing of those loans.\n  In Flint, our current water system loses over a third of the treated \nwater due to decades-old delivery systems before it even reaches the \nfaucets in homes and businesses. This city has relied on the Drinking \nWater State Revolving Fund to improve this system, but the challenge \nand the cost is immense.\n  The cost is even more daunting when the city is working to pull \nitself out of an economic downturn that has lasted not just a few \nyears, but has lasted decades.\n  So we should, as Congress, give these communities the tools that they \nneed to build bridges and roads, to fix their aging water systems, and \nbring, most importantly, economic development. My amendment would be an \nimportant step to doing this.\n  First, it would allow current revolving loan funds to be used to \nprovide loan forgiveness to cities that have outstanding loans, \nregardless of the date of the incurrence of that loan. Prior to 2009, \nthose loans are not eligible for loan forgiveness. Loans incurred after \n2009 are actually eligible for forgiveness. So the first option, we \nwould like to see those pre-2009 loans eligible for forgiveness.\n  Second, the option to use new funds to provide loan forgiveness on \nprior loans is limited because these cities have had--this amendment \nwould limit that loan forgiveness to cities that have had significant \nfinancial problems due to population loss, cities that have had a \npopulation loss of more than 15 percent since 1970 and also have a high \nrate of abandoned and vacant buildings--basically, the cities that are \nin no position right now to finance improvements to their system just \nbecause of the level of abandonment, the level of population loss, and \nthe revenue loss associated with it.\n  Allowing financially distressed cities like Flint to have loans \nforgiven will bring some stability to these communities and allow them \nto better serve their residents.\n  So I ask for support for this amendment to help communities across \nthe country, like Flint, the backbone of the American economy in the \n20th century, so that they can again become leaders in the 21st \ncentury.\n  If we don't re-invest in those places and find ways to do that, we \nare going\n\n[[Page H4759]]\n\nto have a difficult time having them join the economy in a way that \nreally makes a difference for the people who live there.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the \namendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes \nlegislation in an appropriation bill and, therefore, violates clause 2 \nof rule XXI.\n  The rule states in pertinent part:\n  ``An amendment in a general appropriations bill shall not be in order \nif changing existing law.''\n  The amendment requires a determination.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, other than to say that I will continue to \npress every opportunity I have to find a way to help these communities.\n  I understand the gentleman's point of order, and I will continue to \nwork with him and any other Member of this body that will help me find \na path forward to help communities like this community of Flint that is \nreally struggling to deliver clean water to its residents.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The Chair finds that this amendment includes language requiring new \ndeterminations, such as levels of population loss and housing vacancy.\n  The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of \nclause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The point of order is sustained, and the amendment is not in order.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Administrative Provisions--Environmental Protection Agency\n\n              (including transfer and rescission of funds)\n\n       For fiscal year 2016, notwithstanding 31 U.S.C. 6303(1) and \n     6305(1), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, in carrying out the Agency's function to implement \n     directly Federal environmental programs required or \n     authorized by law in the absence of an acceptable tribal \n     program, may award cooperative agreements to federally \n     recognized Indian tribes or Intertribal consortia, if \n     authorized by their member tribes, to assist the \n     Administrator in implementing Federal environmental programs \n     for Indian tribes required or authorized by law, except that \n     no such cooperative agreements may be awarded from funds \n     designated for State financial assistance agreements.\n       The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is \n     authorized to collect and obligate pesticide registration \n     service fees in accordance with section 33 of the Federal \n     Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136w-\n     8).\n       Notwithstanding section 33(d)(2) of the Federal \n     Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. \n     136w-8(d)(2)), the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency may assess fees under section 33 of FIFRA \n     (7 U.S.C. 136w-8) for fiscal year 2016.\n       The Administrator is authorized to transfer up to \n     $300,000,000 of the funds appropriated for the Great Lakes \n     Restoration Initiative under the heading ``Environmental \n     Programs and Management'' to the head of any Federal \n     department or agency, with the concurrence of such head, to \n     carry out activities that would support the Great Lakes \n     Restoration Initiative and Great Lakes Water Quality \n     Agreement programs, projects, or activities; to enter into an \n     interagency agreement with the head of such Federal \n     department or agency to carry out these activities; and to \n     make grants to governmental entities, nonprofit \n     organizations, institutions, and individuals for planning, \n     research, monitoring, outreach, and implementation in \n     furtherance of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and the \n     Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement.\n       The Science and Technology, Environmental Programs and \n     Management, Office of Inspector General, Hazardous Substance \n     Superfund, and Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund \n     Program Accounts, are available for the construction, \n     alteration, repair, rehabilitation, and renovation of \n     facilities provided that the cost does not exceed $150,000 \n     per project.\n       The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     shall base agency policies and actions regarding air \n     emissions from forest biomass including, but not limited to, \n     air emissions from facilities that combust forest biomass for \n     energy, on the principle that forest biomass emissions do not \n     increase overall carbon dioxide accumulations in the \n     atmosphere when USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis data show \n     that forest carbon stocks in the U.S. are stable or \n     increasing on a national scale, or when forest biomass is \n     derived from mill residuals, harvest residuals or forest \n     management activities. Such policies and actions shall not \n     pre-empt existing authorities of States to determine how to \n     utilize biomass as a renewable energy source and shall not \n     inhibit States' authority to apply the same policies to \n     forest biomass as other renewable fuels in implementing \n     Federal law.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Beyer\n\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 73, strike lines 8 through 23.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, my amendment would correct the assertion in \nthis bill that all forest biomass is carbon neutral. The assertion is \nsimply scientifically inaccurate.\n  In 2012, EPA's Scientific Advisory Board directly challenged the \nclaim that all forest biomass is carbon neutral, explaining that while \nsome types of carbon biomass may indeed be, it is inappropriate to \nassume that all types of forest biomass are carbon neutral. This \nmisperception could have serious consequences for wildlife habitat and \nfor our ability to combat climate change in the coming years. In fact, \nnumerous studies have underscored that using some types of forest \nbiomass, particularly slow-growing trees, can actually increase \natmospheric carbon for many decades.\n  The New York Times this Tuesday mentioned a study commissioned by the \nState of Massachusetts that indicated that the climate impacts of \nburning wood were worse than those for coal for 45 years and worse than \nthat for natural gas for 90 years.\n  To know what types of biomass are truly low-carbon, scientists need \nto actually assess them, and treating all forest biomass as carbon \nneutral is risky. The Energy Information Administration has found that \nthis will lead to a boom in the use of forest and other biomass for \nenergy.\n  While this sounds like a good idea on the surface, the resulting \nlogging would have dire consequences for climate mitigation and \nwildlife habitat. It would also drive up the price of pulpwood and \nother lower grades of wood for wood-product industries.\n  In my State of Virginia, local environmental organizations are \nconcerned that if biomass is treated as carbon neutral, it would \nencourage Dominion Virginia Power to burn wood from forests to meet its \nemission reduction obligations. Dominion has already converted three of \nits existing coal plants to run on biomass fuel and has a hybrid energy \ncenter that can burn up to 20 percent biomass for fuel.\n  I share the concern of these local groups that Virginia will become \nknown as a State that harvests forests to reduce its dependence on \ncoal, rather than developing renewable technologies that clearly reduce \nemissions, such as solar and wind. More broadly, I worry about the \nprecedent that this will set for forest management policy in the U.S. \nand around the world.\n  We have already seen that under the European Emissions Trading \nSystem, where biomass has a zero emissions rating, European companies \nhave invested billions to convert coal plants to plants that can burn \nwood pellets, leading to an incredible demand for wood. Earlier this \nmonth, The Washington Post reported that Europe's climate policies have \nled to more U.S. trees being cut down as wood pellets are being \nexported to meet the demand for wood fuel.\n  More than two dozen pellet factories have been constructed in the \nsoutheastern U.S. over the past decade, along with special port \nfacilities in Virginia and Georgia to ship the wood to Europe. Demand \nfor wood in Europe is so robust that wood pellet exports from the U.S. \nnearly doubled from 2012 to 2013 and are expected to nearly double \nagain this year.\n  We should not create artificial demand to meet scientifically \nunsubstantiated goals. It is critical that we make sure that the \naccounting used to estimate net biogenic emissions is scientifically \naccurate before we implement policies that might add carbon pollution \nrather than reduce it.\n\n[[Page H4760]]\n\n  Mr. Chair, I will withdraw this amendment, but I do so urging my \ncolleagues to support policies that are scientifically accurate, and to \nrealize that not all forest biomass is carbon neutral, and that the EPA \nshould take that into consideration.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman and the ranking member to \nmore appropriately consider biomass.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Moolenaar). Is there objection to the request \nof the gentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Of the unobligated balances available for ``State and \n     Tribal Assistance Grants'' account, $8,000,000 are \n     permanently rescinded: Provided, That no amounts may be \n     rescinded from amounts that were designated by the Congress \n     as an emergency requirement pursuant to the Concurrent \n     Resolution on the Budget or the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       For fiscal year 2016, and notwithstanding section 518(f) of \n     the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1377(f)), \n     the Administrator is authorized to use the amounts \n     appropriated for any fiscal year under section 319 of the Act \n     to make grants to federally recognized Indian tribes pursuant \n     to sections 319(h) and 518(e) of that Act.\n\n                      TITLE III--RELATED AGENCIES\n\n                       DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                             Forest Service\n\n                     forest and rangeland research\n\n       For necessary expenses of forest and rangeland research as \n     authorized by law, $277,507,000, to remain available until \n     expended: Provided, That of the funds provided, $70,000,000 \n     is for the forest inventory and analysis program.\n\n                       state and private forestry\n\n       For necessary expenses of cooperating with and providing \n     technical and financial assistance to States, territories, \n     possessions, and others, and for forest health management, \n     including treatments of pests, pathogens, and invasive or \n     noxious plants and for restoring and rehabilitating forests \n     damaged by pests or invasive plants, cooperative forestry, \n     and education and land conservation activities and conducting \n     an international program as authorized, $220,665,000, to \n     remain available until expended, as authorized by law; of \n     which $50,660,000 is to be derived from the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund.\n\n                         national forest system\n\n                     (including transfers of funds)\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Forest Service, not otherwise \n     provided for, for management, protection, improvement, and \n     utilization of the National Forest System, $1,490,093,000, to \n     remain available until expended: Provided, That of the funds \n     provided, $40,000,000 shall be deposited in the Collaborative \n     Forest Landscape Restoration Fund for ecological restoration \n     treatments as authorized by 16 U.S.C. 7303(f): Provided \n     further, That of the funds provided, $355,000,000 shall be \n     for forest products: Provided further, That of the funds \n     provided, up to $81,941,000 is for the Integrated Resource \n     Restoration pilot program for Region 1, Region 3 and Region \n     4: Provided further, That of the funds provided for forest \n     products, up to $65,560,000 may be transferred to support the \n     Integrated Resource Restoration pilot program in the \n     preceding proviso: Provided further, That the Secretary of \n     Agriculture may transfer to the Secretary of the Interior any \n     unobligated funds appropriated in a previous fiscal year for \n     operation of the Valles Caldera National Preserve.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Benishek\n\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 75, line 14, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(reduced by $2,000,000)''.\n       Page 76, line 8, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(increased by $2,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment \nto H.R. 2822, the fiscal year 2016 Interior, Environment, and Related \nAgencies Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, my district covers nearly half the State of Michigan \nand includes three Federal forests. These forests are a major vacation \ndestination for people, not only in my district, but in districts of \nMembers all across the country.\n  Yet, sadly, many of our constituents arrive to the Federal forests of \nnorthern Michigan to find that the road to their favorite fishing spot \nor hiking trail or ORV path has been arbitrarily closed by the Forest \nService, with no warning and no input from the local community.\n  Mr. Chairman, the last thing that people want to do when they travel \nto the woods of northern Michigan with their families is to learn about \nthe obscure policies of the U.S. Forest Service, a Federal agency that \ntreats the forests like their personal property instead of a public \nresource for everyone to enjoy.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Activities like hunting, snowmobiling, fishing, and hiking all depend \non access to these forests. And it is important to note that the \noutdoor economy contributes over $5.5 billion and 194,000 jobs to \nMichigan, most of which are in my district.\n  My amendment is an opportunity to demonstrate to the Forest Service \nthat their focus should be on making our forests more open and \naccessible to the American people. In practice, the amendment would \nreduce spending from the National Forest System vegetation and \nwatershed program by $2 million and transfer those funds into the \ncapital improvement and maintenance fund.\n  Now, you might ask yourself, What does that have to do with opening \nforest roads?\n  Well, I will tell you.\n  According to the Forest Service, when work is necessary to open a \nroad for access, they use the capital improvement and maintenance fund. \nIf the Forest Service is working to close a road to appease \nenvironmentalists who don't want anyone to visit the forest, they use \nthe vegetation and watershed line item.\n  My amendment is simple. It gives more dollars to the Forest Service \nto keep roads open rather than closed. In addition, the CBO says that \nthis change would save taxpayers $1 million for fiscal year 2016.\n  Mr. Chairman, today I am standing up on behalf of my constituents in \nmy district who want to use their forests responsibly, who want to \nteach their kids and grandkids how to hunt, fish, and snowmobile. They \nwant to enjoy nature. Furthermore, I am standing up today for the small \nbusinesses that employ families throughout the outdoor economy.\n  For example, I recently visited Extreme Power Sports in Gaylord, \nwhere they sell a variety of all-terrain vehicles, sleds, and safety \ngear. This small business sells ATVs and sleds to users all over the \ncountry who come to enjoy the trails and forests in our State and \nbeyond.\n  In addition to businesses like Extreme Power Sports, the hotels and \nrestaurants around northern Michigan are supported by those who come to \nvisit our forests year-round.\n  Healthy, accessible forests are important for our way of life in \nnorthern Michigan and across the United States. All of our constituents \ndeserve improved access to the forests, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. BENISHEK. I yield to the gentleman from Idaho.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the gentleman for raising these concerns about \nhow the Forest Service is managing its roads and trails in Michigan. I \nwill tell you that the same concerns exist around the country, in Idaho \nas well as other States, too.\n  Chairman Calvert and the committee would be happy to work with you on \nthis issue as the Interior bill moves through the process.\n  If there is no objection, we would be willing to accept the \namendment.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nRouzer) having assumed the chair, Mr. Bishop of Michigan, Acting Chair \nof the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported \nthat that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.

Mr. Speaker, reserving my right to object.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I express my deep disappointment that the \nHouse will adjourn without having concluded its business.\n  Charter authority for the Export-Import Bank is set to expire this \ncoming Tuesday should Congress fail to reauthorize it, which apparently \nwe are going to fail to do. Shutting down the Bank puts at risk tens of \nthousands of jobs at American businesses whose exports are supported by \nthe Bank's financing mechanisms.\n  Everybody knows that a bill to reauthorize the Bank has the votes to \npass in this House. Everybody has known that the charter authority to \nback up loans by those who would buy goods from American workers \nexpires at the end of this month. The Speaker of this House has said \nthat jobs will be lost shortly after we fail to do this act, which we \napparently are going to fail to do.\n  It is the will of the House and ought to be reflected by a vote of \nthe House that this charter be renewed. And once we send it down the \nhall, such a bill will pass the Senate. Who said so? Senator Roy Blunt, \nwho used to be the majority whip and majority leader and minority whip \nin this House.\n  Before leaving to go home to our districts, we ought to reauthorize \nthe Bank and provide certainty, Mr. Speaker, to businesses and their \nworkers who depend on it to level the playing field against foreign \ncompetitors.\n  There are 85 such banks located in 60 countries with whom we compete. \nThis will diminish, at least for a short time, our ability to compete \nin international markets. That will cost, as Speaker Boehner has said, \njobs in the short term.\n  At the same time, I want to say that my friend from Mississippi, \nRepresentative Thompson, noticed a resolution that was referred to the \nCommittee on House Administration today. Mr. Speaker, I believe that \nthat resolution deserves to be considered in the committee without \ndelay, and I hope it will be.\n  In the aftermath of the horrific and racially motivated murders of \nnine innocent people in Charleston last week, Americans across the \ncountry are taking a long overdue, critical look at the practice of \nallowing confederate symbols of hatred, slavery, and segregation to \nremain on prominent display in our public places. There is no public \nspace more visible and more important than this United States Capitol \nBuilding.\n  Mr. Thompson's resolution would authorize the Speaker to remove \nMississippi's flag--the only one to include the battle flag of the \nConfederacy--from the Capitol complex until such time as the State of \nMississippi selects a new flag, free from a legacy of bigotry, \nexclusion, and racism.\n  I hope that Mississippians will move swiftly to design a new flag \nthat more accurately reflects their pride in diversity, tolerance, and \nequality.\n  There is no reason why any Member or staffer, especially those whose \nancestors suffered the horrors of slavery and segregation, should have \nto see that symbol in the temple to liberty that is our Capitol.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that the House is adjourning \nwithout having completed its task for the June work period and without \nhaving shown the American people that Congress can do what it has been \nsent to do: support job growth, promote justice, and achieve results \nfor those it serves.\n  Mr. Speaker, if I thought continuing my objection would lead to the \nswift enactment today or tomorrow of the Export-Import Bank, I would \nobject. I do not believe that that would be the result; and, therefore, \nI will shortly withdraw my objection, but with a plea to the majority \nparty that they bring to the floor very shortly after we return the \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank and that the Committee on \nHouse Administration give prompt consideration to the resolution of the \ngentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson).\n  I withdraw my reservation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation is withdrawn.\n  Without objection, the concurrent resolution is concurred in.\n  There was no objection.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4761-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4761-H4762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PATRIOT WEEK\n\n  (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, with our 239th Independence Day \naround the corner, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing what makes our Nation the greatest country in the world by \ncelebrating Patriot Week later this year.\n  In 2009, while I served in the Michigan Senate, we became the first \nlegislative body to recognize Patriot Week. Since then, five States and \ncountless private organizations have participated in celebrating our \nFounders and other great Americans who furthered the cause of liberty.\n  Patriot Week pays tribute to influential Americans, from George \nWashington to Martin Luther King, Jr.; it celebrates our values, from \nequal protection under the law to limited government; and it remembers \nour most important events, from the passage of the Constitution in 1787 \nto the ratification of the 19th Amendment, to many other events that \ncollectively define our country.\n  Mr. Speaker, my resolution recognizes how each of these events has \nadvanced the principles we hold in the highest regard and encourages \nour schools, our government agencies, States, and private employers to \nparticipate as well as take time to remember and learn about these \nevents that are so important to our history.\n  Patriot Week begins by remembering those who died in the attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, and those who sacrificed to save others. It ends on \nSeptember 17 by celebrating Constitution Day and honoring those who \nrisked everything to establish this Republic, for which we all have the \nprivilege of serving.\n\n[[Page H4762]]\n\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nmy Patriot Week resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4762-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             {time}   1715\n                              ALOHA SPIRIT\n\n  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, a week ago, a man walked into a church in \nSouth Carolina and, in cold blood, gunned down nine worshippers. His \nactions were motivated by ignorance and hate. Throughout history and \nalso in present day, unfortunately, there has been so much terror and \nsuffering caused by ignorance and hate.\n  Mr. Speaker, in order to truly transcend racism, we must do more than \nremove slurs from our national vocabulary. In Hawaii, my home State, \nthat consciousness is known as the aloha spirit--the consciousness of \nlove and respect for all others, regardless of differences such as \nrace, religion, gender, or nationality.\n  Understanding this truth is the path to peace. I would like to quote \nMahatma Gandhi who said:\n\n       There must be a recognition of the existence of the soul \n     apart from the body, and of its permanent nature, and this \n     recognition must amount to a living faith; and, in the last \n     resort, nonviolence does not avail those who do not possess a \n     living faith in the God of love.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4762-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING CAROLINE ROBERTSON\n\n  (Mr. ROUZER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to recognize a \ntruly inspirational individual from my district. Caroline Robertson is \na 12-year-old girl from Potters Hill, North Carolina. We met last \nOctober at an event in Beulaville. She was born with Trisomy 18, a rare \nchromosomal disorder.\n  Despite her diagnosis, Caroline has maintained a positive outlook on \nlife, choosing to live every minute of every day. Last year, Caroline \nwas crowned a ``Dream Angel'' by the North Carolina Outstanding Little \nMiss Pageant. She is using her crown to help raise awareness for \nhandicapped children throughout North Carolina.\n  Earlier this year, Caroline hosted a fundraiser called Bikers, Tea, \nand Tiaras to raise money for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. \nThere were over 35 crown titles in attendance, including Miss North \nCarolina 2014, Beth Stovall.\n  Caroline has had to overcome more adversity in 12 years than most of \nus will in a lifetime. She is a true inspiration to all around her, and \nI am honored to know her.\n  I would like to thank her for her work as a Dream Angel, and I know \nshe will continue to accomplish great things in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4762-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS WITH IRAN\n\n  (Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, it seems like every day there is a startling \nheadline about a new concession to Iran in the nuclear negotiations. We \nare undeniably cascading further and further from where these talks \nstarted just 19 months ago.\n  With the latest deadline for the deal only 5 days away, I fear and \nexpect that even more damaging concessions to the Iranians are on the \nway. It doesn't need to be this way. We don't have to accept it, and we \nmust make sure that our voices continue to be heard by the \nadministration on this historic issue.\n  We know that upon reaching a deal--any deal--there will be a full on \nPR blitz to try to sell this agreement. When that happens, we must \nstand strong and avoid the temptation to simply go along with the \n``thrill of the deal.''\n  Instead of getting swept up in the momentum, we must not flinch from \nthe simple, foundational idea that we have dedicated ourselves to all \nalong, preventing Iran from having any path to a nuclear weapon. We can \ndo it if we stick together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4762-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4762-H4765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SUPREME COURT ISSUES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Moolenaar). Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it has been a big day over at the Supreme \nCourt and a big day for the Constitution as the Constitution has taken \na rather profound hit.\n  I understand the rules, Mr. Speaker. The rules are made clear. We \nwill not impugn anybody's integrity and office up here, so I am not \ntalking about an individual, I am talking about how completely \ndishonest, disingenuous, and how much affront to the Constitution and \npure candor the majority's opinion is at the Supreme Court.\n  Nothing is more of an indictment against the majority opinion than at \nthe end of the opinion itself. The majority indicted themselves with \ntheir own words.\n  At the end of the majority opinion, the majority says, ``In a \ndemocracy, the power to make the law rests with those chosen by the \npeople. Our role is more confined''--and then quotes from Marbury v. \nMadison--``to say what the law is.''\n  The Court today goes on to say: ``That is easier in some cases than \nin others. But in every case we must respect the role of the \nlegislature, and take care not to undo what it has done. A fair reading \nof legislation demands a fair understanding of the legislative plan.\n  ``Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance \nmarkets, not to destroy them. If at all possible, we must interpret the \nAct in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter. \nSection 36B can fairly be read consistent with what we see as Congress' \nplan, and that is the reading we adopt.''\n  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals Fourth Circuit is \naffirmed.\n  That majority opinion is an indictment of the majority. The \nConstitution is worthless--absolutely worthless--when we have a \nmajority of the Supreme Court that makes up law or in this case says: \nDo you know what? We know what Congress passed, we have read it, and we \nget it.\n  It makes exceedingly clear that unless a State sets up a State \nexchange for health care, then that State will be punished by not \ngetting subsidies. That was debated, and that was included by the \nmajority of the House and Senate without a single Republican vote, not \na single Republican vote.\n  As the former chair of Ways and Means told some of our Members: We \ndon't need your vote, and we don't want your input.\n  They did it as one party, jamming this down the throats of the \nRepublican Party and the majority of the American people. That is why \nthey lost the majority in November 2010.\n  They made it very clear. If you don't set up a State exchange, you \ndon't get the subsidies in your State. God bless all the States that \nstood up and said: No, this is wrong. A majority of the American people \ndidn't want this. You passed this without any input from nearly a \nmajority of the constituents that are represented by Republicans. You \ndidn't care that it was the most partisan a bill that has ever passed \nin Congress. You didn't care. You forced it. It is bad for Americans, \nand we are not going to help you by setting up a State exchange. Yes, \nwe understand the law is very clear. Our State doesn't get the \nsubsidies from the Federal Government--those are called bribes to be \nmore literal--our State won't get the bribes that you throw back at us \nthat came from our taxpayers if we don't set up the State exchanges. We \nunderstand that.\n  So what happens? The people that passed that bill and the President \nthat helped pass the bill and forced it through and signed it realized \nthey had made a major mistake, and rather than come and get Republicans \nto fix the disaster they had created, the President who had indicated \nhe has a pen and he has a phone, decided: That allows me to make law, \ncreate new law, and change law completely that I have already signed \ninto law because I got a pen and a phone, I can just change it upon my \nwhim.\n  The President basically decided, through his administration, they \ndecided that they would set up Federal exchanges. Even though the law \nwas\n\n[[Page H4763]]\n\nvery unequivocal, those States get no subsidies. They decided we better \nstart giving them subsidies. If I sound sensitive about this, Mr. \nSpeaker, it is because I am.\n  This disaster of a healthcare bill that costs so many of my \nconstituents the health insurance they liked because they were lied to \nevery time they were told by anybody if you like your policy you can \nkeep it, that was a lie, and when people were told, Nobody that is in \nthis country illegally will ever get insurance under ObamaCare, that \nwas a lie.\n  When they were told, If you like your doctor, you can keep your \ndoctor, no matter who told it to them, that was a lie. They were all \nlies.\n  We found out later they talked about it within the White House and \ndecided: Well, the best thing to do is not to tell everybody that they \nstand a good chance of losing their own health insurance and losing \ntheir doctor and losing their hospital and losing their particular \npolicy that may keep them alive. Let's don't tell them that. Let's just \nsay, if you like your doctor, if you like your health care, you can \nkeep it.\n  The bill passed. It was a bad bill, and now, we have a Supreme Court \nthat has entered into the fiction and the fraud that this opinion can \nsomehow act like the law was equivocal when it was very unequivocal.\n  God bless Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas at the--well, the \nminority opinion, as it says here, I have a copy of the whole opinion, \nincluding the dissent, Justice Scalia with Justice Thomas and Justice \nAlito join, dissenting.\n  That dissent starts by saying the Court holds that when the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act says ``exchanges established by the \nState,'' it means ``exchanges established by the State or the Federal \nGovernment.''\n  That is, of course, quite absurd, and the Court's 21 pages of \nexplanation make it no less so.\n  The dissenting opinion also states in answer to the question of \nwhether someone who buys insurance on an exchange established by the \nSecretary gets the tax credit, he says: ``You would think the answer \nwould be obviously.''\n  Obviously, there would hardly be a need for the Supreme Court to hear \na case about it. In order to receive any money under section 36B, an \nindividual must enroll in an insurance plan through ``an exchange \nestablished by the State.'' The Secretary of Health and Human Services \nis not a State.\n  Further down, he says: ``Words no longer have meaning if an exchange \nthat is not established by a State is `established by the State.' ''\n  Further down he quotes: ``The plain, obvious, and rational meaning of \na statute is always to be preferred to any curious, narrow, hidden \nsense that nothing but the exigency of a hard case and the ingenuity \nand study of an acute and powerful intellect would discover.''\n  That quote is from Lynch v. Alworth-Stephens Company.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Under all the usual rules of interpretation, in short, the government \nshould lose this case, but normal rules of interpretation seem always \nto yield to overriding principle of the present Court: the Affordable \nCare Act must be saved.\n  Mr. Speaker, the trouble this Nation is in when we have a President \nwho makes law at the sound of his voice, at the stroke of his pen, \nwithout going through Congress, and then that is aggravated \nexponentially by a Supreme Court that enters into the charade.\n  As the Court said on page 5 of its dissent, adopting the Court's \ninterpretations means nullifying the term ``by the State,'' not just \nonce, but again and again throughout the act.\n  It goes on to point out that the term ``by the State'' is mentioned \nseven times throughout the bill and that the majority on the Court, \nthey could care less about the Constitution, they could care less about \ntheir oath. They feel their job is to uphold anything that this \nPresident and the former Democratic majority sent to them, regardless \nof how badly it requires them to ax the Constitution.\n  Page 12 of the dissent says: ``For its next defense of the \nindefensible, the Court''--talking about the majority--``turns to the \nAffordable Care Act's design and purposes.''\n  Well, obviously, they need to turn to something because the law was \nvery clear. To get the subsidies, a State had to set up an exchange.\n  Page 13 of the dissent says: ``Having gone wrong in consulting \nstatutory purpose at all, the Court goes wrong again in analyzing it.''\n  Page 15 of the dissent says: ``Compounding its errors, the Court \nforgets that it is no more appropriate to consider one of a statute's \npurposes in isolation than it is to consider one of its words that \nway.''\n  Page 16 of the dissent says: ``Worst of all, for the repute of \ntoday's decision, the Court's reasoning is largely self-defeating.''\n  It goes on to explain why.\n  Page 18 of the dissent says: ``The Court's decision reflects the \nphilosophy that judges should endure whatever interpretive distortions \nit takes in order to correct a supposed flaw in the statutory \nmachinery. That philosophy ignores the American people's decision to \ngive Congress `all legislative powers' enumerated in the Constitution, \nciting article I, section 1. They made Congress, not this Court, \nresponsible for both making laws and mending them.\n  ``This Court holds only the judicial power, the power to pronounce \nthe law as Congress has enacted it. We lack the prerogative to repair \nlaws that do not work out in practice, just as the people lack the \nability to throw us out of office if they dislike the solutions we \nconcoct. We must always remember, therefore, that our task is to apply \nthe text, not to improve upon it.''\n  The dissent actually cites precedent for that very language.\n  Trying to make its judge-empowering approach seem respectful of \nCongressional authority, the Court asserts that its decision merely \nensures that the Affordable Care Act operates the way Congress meant it \nto operate.\n  First of all, what makes the Court so sure that Congress meant tax \ncredits to be available everywhere? Those are great questions that the \ndissent asks, even though they are rhetorical.\n  The Supreme Court struck a blow for tyranny today. I predicted this \nfor quite some time because when you have someone who is Solicitor \nGeneral under the Obama administration and who has the job of \nadvising--well, first of all, defending legislation and defending acts \nthat the administration wanted defended in court, but of course, part \nof that means, as any good lawyer will tell you, that attorney that \ndefends you in court must give you advice about that which he or she \nmay have to defend in court.\n  Either we had a Solicitor General go before the Senate and lie that \nthere had never been any discussions about the Affordable Care Act, \nabout ObamaCare, in the presence of the Solicitor General, or the \nSolicitor General was completely incompetent.\n  Everybody that voted for that Solicitor General should have their \nheads examined because either a lie or incompetence should have been \nenough to keep a former Solicitor General from going on to the Supreme \nCourt of the land. It didn't happen. That person went on the Court.\n  It also is reprehensible for judges, Justices, on the Supreme Court \nto flaunt the law, disobey perhaps one of the most critical laws \nassigned to the court, in order to participate in an opinion in which \nthey want to change the law.\n  Apparently, since the Supreme Court didn't come down with a decision \nregarding same-sex marriage today, that should be coming out next week. \nSo far, there has been no notice that the two Justices that perform \nsame-sex weddings would be disqualifying themselves as 28 U.S.C. \nsection 455 says.\n  With your indulgence, Mr. Speaker, I have a chart.\n  28 U.S.C. section 455 says very clearly in A part--there is an A part \nthat would disqualify judges, or Justices, and then there is a B part \nthat may as well, but A is a certainty.\n  ``Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall \ndisqualify himself''--that can be male or female--``in any proceeding \nin which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.''\n  That is the law. When we have two Supreme Court Justices that, so \nfar, have given no indications of anything but that they are going to \nintentionally knowingly violate that law and participate in a majority \nopinion,\n\n[[Page H4764]]\n\nthen we have to wonder how much longer this little experiment in a \ndemocratic republic will last. I would submit not much longer.\n  The laws of Moses, the Bible, helped found this country. When all \nseemed lost and nothing appeared to be agreeable to a majority in the \nconstitutional convention, they took a recess to go worship God at the \nReformed Calvinist church in Philadelphia.\n  We still have part of what the preacher prayed, what he spoke. He \nseemed to make a real difference because they came back. As Alexander \nHamilton noted--someone not noted for being spiritual--he noted that, \nclearly, the finger of God was involved in bringing together people \nthat could not agree in such an incredible document.\n  We turn our back once again today, as a majority of the Supreme Court \ndid, on the clear meaning, clear statement of the law. So far, I hope \nand pray they will have a change of heart and not disobey the law in \norder to try to change law overriding State constitutions, as it may.\n  I hope and pray they will have a change of heart and they will \ndisqualify themselves, anyone on the Supreme Court, who clearly, not \njust might reasonably be questioned, but they clearly were biased and \npartial when it comes to same-sex marriage. Hopefully, they will \ndisqualify themselves, and we will get an opinion by a more objective \nCourt; but if they don't, we are looking at a constitutional crisis of \nincredible proportions.\n  Does a country have to follow a law created out of whole cloth by a \nmajority of unelected judges who violate the law itself in order to \ncreate new law? I think the answer is: No, you don't have to follow \nthat kind of law.\n  There is no question that the persecution of Christians who practice \ntheir religion, as set out in the Bible, will be forced to subject \nthemselves to persecution, as this administration already has shown.\n  It doesn't matter if you are a nun and you have devoted your entire \nlife to helping the poor and the downtrodden, your little sister of the \npoor; it doesn't matter to this administration.\n  They are going to drag you through the muck, through the devastation \nof having to go to court, all because you happen to believe what the \nFounders believed, the huge majority since, heck, over a third of the \nsigners of the Declaration of Independence were actually ordained \nChristian ministers, and then the great work by churches to force the \nConstitution to mean what it said so that slavery was eliminated, the \ngreat work of an ordained Christian minister named Martin Luther King, \nJr., in pushing the issue of civil rights for one and all, so that one \nday, hopefully, we can have people judged not by the color of their \nskin, but by the content of their character.\n  The things Martin Luther King, Jr., believed in, that he was ordained \nand preached, the things those abolitionist churches believed with all \ntheir hearts, if the Supreme Court does what the indications are they \nwill likely do, they would be persecuted for their beliefs, our very \nFounders would be persecuted for their beliefs. This isn't about \nslavery. We did away with that. It is tragic.\n  No one, no matter what their sexual preference is, should be \ndiscriminated against; but when it comes to marriage, it is the \nbuilding block, the foundational building block established by nature \nitself, by nature's God, by the law of Moses, the Moses imprint that \nexists above my head here in this Chamber, that exists on the southern \nwall of the chamber of the Supreme Court, and is the law as Jesus laid \nit out regarding marriage when he quoted Moses.\n  We are coming into some difficult days, and I am afraid this decision \ntoday that mocks the law, both case law and the written law, we are \ncoming into some difficult days.\n  Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Rothfus), my friend.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I heard the discussion going on about today's Supreme \nCourt decision, and I, too, am very troubled by what I read today. To \nme, there are a couple of big issues at play here.\n  One is accountability and how this Congress 5 years ago rammed \nthrough legislation without reading it. We all remember the famous \nline: ``Pass it to find out what is in it.'' The American people \ncontinue to find out what is in it. I heard the President talking today \nabout this law's being woven into the fabric of the country. What is \nbeing woven into the fabric of the country are higher premiums, higher \ndeductibles, less choice, more Washington, more bureaucrats, more \nforcing people to violate their consciences. That is not the way we \nneed to be going.\n  Now we see how the Supreme Court for the second time has allowed, \nreally, a lack of accountability. When we saw in the NFIB case how they \nsaid, ``Oh, it is not a penalty; it is a tax,'' there were people in \nthis Chamber who argued for the Affordable Care Act in saying there are \nno taxes here. Then the Supreme Court absolved them of that \nresponsibility by saying, ``Oh, it is a tax. We will keep it in \nplace.'' Here today is clear language that subsidies would go to only \nthose exchanges that were established by the State.\n  There is a serious problem here, and it is not just with Congress' \nnot being held accountable for the laws it passes; there is a \nseparation of powers issue here as we see another branch of the \ngovernment invade the lawmaking responsibility that this Congress has. \nAgain, I want to talk about Justice Scalia's dissent here.\n  ``The Court's decision reflects the philosophy that judges should \nendure whatever interpretive distortions it takes in order to correct a \nsupposed flaw in the statutory machinery. That philosophy ignores the \nAmerican people's decision to give Congress `all legislative powers' \nenumerated in the Constitution.''\n  That is what the Constitution says.\n  ``They made Congress, not this Court, responsible for both making \nlaws and mending them. This Court holds only the judicial power--the \npower to pronounce the law as Congress has enacted it. We lack the \nprerogative to repair laws that do not work out in practice, just as \nthe people lack the ability to throw us out of office''--that is, the \nSupreme Court--``if they dislike the solutions we concoct.''\n  This is the Congress' responsibility to amend the laws, not the \nSupreme Court's. The dissent continues:\n  ``Rather than rewriting the law under the pretense of interpreting \nit, the Court should have left it to Congress to decide what to do \nabout the Act's limitation of tax credits to State exchanges . . . The \nCourt's insistence on making a choice that should be made by Congress \nboth aggrandizes judicial power and encourages congressional \nlassitude.''\n  Mr. Speaker, it is the Congress' job to make law. It is the Court's \njob to interpret the law, not to rewrite the law as it did in the NFIB \ncase and not to rewrite the law as it did today.\n  I thank the gentleman for raising these very serious issues as to \nwhat happened with the Court today.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. I appreciate the gentleman's observations.\n  Frankly, Mr. Speaker, I knew when I stood with Mr. Rothfus in the \nSenate Chamber in recent years past, in support of a filibuster, that I \nwould enjoy standing with him on other occasions, and I appreciate so \nmuch his observations.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to finish with this observation from John \nAdams, 1776 July. He is writing to Abigail. In the last paragraph, he \nwrites:\n  ``You will think me transported with enthusiasm''--in talking about \nthe Declaration of Independence--``but I am not. I am well aware of the \ntoil and blood and treasure that it will cost to maintain this \nDeclaration and support and defend these States. Yet, through all the \ngloom, I can see the rays of ravishing light and glory. I can see that \nthe end is worth more than all the means, that posterity will triumph \nin that day's transaction even though we may regret it, which I trust \nin God we shall not.''\n  For this to stand as a country, as a democratic Republic as created, \nit takes courage and it takes integrity, and we didn't get that from \nthe Supreme Court today.\n\n[[Page H4765]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4765-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4765-H4766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      AN AGREEMENT WITH IRAN MUST BAR ITS PATH TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey \n(Mr. Smith) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, the deadline is bearing down on \nus for the President's nuclear agreement with Iran. So, at this moment, \nCongress must send the administration a strong message: In order to be \nacceptable, any agreement must bar every Iranian path to nuclear \nweapons.\n  This means the deal must last for decades. There has been a lot of \nreporting of stopgap deals that would try to restrict Iran in the short \nterm while giving it a blank check after just some 10 years. Such an \nagreement would be absurd, Mr. Speaker. Given Iran's longstanding \nnefarious quest for nuclear weapons and its government's genocidal \nanti-Semitism, I and the vast majority of my colleagues in Congress \nwould never accept such a bad deal.\n  Iran will also have to dismantle its current nuclear infrastructure \nand turn over nearly all of its stockpile of uranium. Iran prefers to \nmerely ``disconnect'' its 19,000 centrifuges. That is totally \nunacceptable --coming from the Iranian Government with its murderous \nthreats to annihilate the State of Israel and its obsessive hatred of \nJews worldwide. It is estimated that centrifuges could be reconnected \nin a matter of mere months--and so they must be dismantled, and the \ncore should be removed from the Arak heavy water reactor.\n\n  It also means there can be no lifting or a reduction of sanctions \nuntil the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, certifies that \nIran has complied with its commitments under the agreement; and IAEA \ninspectors must be granted access to any and all suspected sites. This \naccess must be unimpeded, Mr. Speaker, meaning that the IAEA must be \nable to conduct inspections at military sites as well. The rule must be \nfull access--anytime, anywhere.\n  Iran must also fully account for its past efforts to develop nuclear \nweapons. Unless it does so, there is no way to establish a baseline \nfrom which to measure its current capacities and potential future \nviolations and responsibly gauge a ``breakout time.''\n  Mr. Speaker, these are minimum criteria. In order to get \ncongressional approval, any deal the President presents to Congress \nwill have to have met them. The Nuclear Agreement Review Act gives \nCongress the authority to review any agreement with Iran and to pass a \njoint resolution barring any statutory sanctions relief. The \nadministration and the Iranian Government need to know that the vast \nmajority of my colleagues will be as firm as I am in insisting on them. \nI am certainly prepared to vote against any agreement that does not \nmeet these criteria.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration has shown itself far too weak \nin dealing with Iran. For example, last week, Secretary Kerry said that \nthe United States is ``not fixated'' on Iran's explaining its past \nbehavior--a significant backtracking on his earlier insistence on this \ncrucial point.\n  In fact, throughout June, we have been reading disturbing reports of \nadministration weakness in the negotiations on a whole range of \nissues--from demanding access to potential nuclear sites to signaling a \nwillingness to repeal non-nuclear-related sanctions. Just yesterday, \nfive of the President's top former Iran advisers wrote an open letter, \nwarning that the agreement ``may fall short of meeting the \nadministration's own standard of a `good' agreement.'' The letter \noutlined concerns about concessions at the same time that Ayatollah Ali \nKhamenei appeared to back away from other preliminary understandings.\n  There are many other signs of the administration's weakness, Mr. \nSpeaker, in its dealings with Iran. Fundamentally, it refuses to speak \ntruths that are obvious to everyone: that the Iranian Government has \nmade itself the enemy of the United States and the genocidal enemy of \nthe State of Israel, and that our goal must always be to prevent it \nfrom acquiring or manufacturing nuclear weapons now and long into the \nfuture. A nuclear Iran would be a grave threat to our country and an \nexistential threat to Israel, our closest ally. That is intolerable. \nThe administration seems to no longer recall that Iran is the leading \nsponsor of Hezbollah and Hamas.\n  Mr. Speaker, the case of Pastor Saeed Abedini is another sad sign of \nadministration weakness toward Iran. Saeed Abedini is an American \ncitizen. He was in Iran in 2012, visiting family and building an \norphanage, when he was taken prisoner. As a matter of fact, he had been \ngiven permission by the Iranians to do just that. Twelve years before, \nhe had converted to Christianity and, later, was involved in the home \nchurch movement in Iran. Knowing about his conversion and earlier \nengagement in home churches, Iranian authorities approved his 2012 \ntrip, approved his orphanage building, and then imprisoned him. He has \nbeen in prison ever since then and has suffered immensely from beatings \nthat have caused internal bleeding, death threats, solitary \nconfinement, and more. His wife, Naghmeh, who is also an American and \nhas been a heroic champion for her husband and their two children, has \nalso suffered. I have chaired two hearings when we have heard from \nNaghmeh, who told the compelling story of her husband, of her love for \nher husband, of the gross injustice that he has been forced to suffer. \nIt is time the administration made this a priority and a very, very \nimportant matter in the nuclear negotiations.\n  The administration is not doing enough to secure his release. There \nis no doubt about it. The administration does little more than raise \nhis case and those of other American prisoners on the sidelines of the \nnuclear negotiations because it sees the prisoners as sideline issues. \nThis is an American citizen, unjustly imprisoned now for over 1,000 \ndays--and tortured--in Iran, and the administration has a few marginal \nconversations with Iranian officials and considers that good enough. It \nis deeply disturbing. It ought to be a central priority.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is also a very alarming sign of what we might expect \nthe administration to present us with when we return to session in \nearly July. That is why Congress' responsibility is to be prepared to \nmaintain a much firmer line on the outcome of these negotiations--when \nwe review the agreement--than the administration seems to be taking.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues a couple of excerpts from today--they were released today--\nfrom the State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \nfor 2014, which reads in pertinent part:\n  ``The most significant human rights problems were severe restrictions \non civil liberties, including the freedoms of assembly, speech, \nreligion, and press; limitations on the citizens' ability to change the \ngovernment peacefully through free and fair elections; and disregard \nfor the physical integrity of persons whom authorities arbitrarily and \nunlawfully detained, tortured, or killed.\n  ``Other reported human rights problems included: disappearances; \ncruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, including \njudicially sanctioned amputation and flogging; politically motivated \nviolence and repression; harsh and life-threatening conditions in \ndetention and prison facilities, with instances of deaths in custody; \narbitrary arrest and lengthy pretrial detention, sometimes \nincommunicado; continued impunity of the security forces; denial of \nfair public trial, sometimes resulting in executions without due \nprocess; the lack of an independent judiciary; political prisoners and \ndetainees; ineffective implementation of civil judicial procedures and \nremedies; arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, and \ncorrespondence; severe restrictions on freedoms of speech, including \nvia the Internet, and press; harassment and arrest of journalists; \ncensorship and media content restrictions; severe restrictions on \nacademic freedom; severe restrictions on the freedoms of assembly and \nassociation.''\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  That is just a few of the catalog of horrors being imposed upon \nIranians and people like our own American citizens being held in \ncustody, like Pastor Saeed Abedini.\n\n[[Page H4766]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/house-section/article/H4766-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FURTHER MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A further message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks \nannounced that the Senate has passed without amendment a bill of the \nHouse of the following title:\n\n       H.R. 893.
