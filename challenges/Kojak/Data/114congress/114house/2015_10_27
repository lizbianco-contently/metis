The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Brooks) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, between 2000 and 2014, in the 16 \nto 65 age bracket, although the American economy created 5.6 million \nnet new jobs, American-born citizens lost 127,000 jobs. All job gains \nin America--and more--went to people born in foreign countries.\n  In 2012, 51 percent of households headed by immigrants relied on \nwelfare compared to 30 percent of households headed by someone born in \nAmerica, thus driving up America's deficits and driving down America's \nability to pay for safety nets for Americans.\n  This week I vote on Paul Ryan's bid for House Speaker. While Paul \nRyan has excellent communication skills, is charismatic, understands \nthe economic risk of out-of-control deficits, and the like, Paul Ryan \nand I have a major disagreement on border security.\n  Last week, on October 22, Paul Ryan, I, and others met about his \ncandidacy. Border security was discussed. Thereafter, I hand-delivered \nto Paul Ryan, on the House floor, at, roughly, 4 p.m., a letter that \nstates:\n  ``Paul: Struggling American families have lost more than 8 million \njob opportunities to illegal aliens. All lower and middle income \nAmerican workers have suffered from suppressed wages caused by the \nsurge in both illegal alien and lawful immigrant labor supply.\n  ``Your past record and current stance on immigration conflicts with \nthe values of the Americans I represent and causes great concern to me \nand the Americans I represent.\n  ``Yesterday during discussions about the Speaker race, you made two \nrepresentations about immigration that stood out. They are:\n  ``1. It is unwise or unproductive to bring up any immigration \nlegislation so long as Barack Obama is President.\n  ``2. As Speaker, you will not allow any immigration bill to reach the \nHouse Floor for a vote unless the immigration bill is `supported by a \nmajority of the majority' of Republican House Members.\n  ``Although you talk faster than I can write your words down, I \nbelieve the above statements properly reflect what you said. I send \nthis letter to confirm that I accurately portray your remarks and that \nI may rely on them when the House Floor Vote for Speaker occurs next \nweek.\n  ``If my portrayal of your words errs in any respect, please deliver \nto me (before the GOP Conference meeting next week in which we are to \nconduct Speaker elections) a written communication correcting my \nerrors.\n  ``If I do not receive such a communication from you, then I will \ninfer that you concur that my portrayal of your remarks is accurate and \nthat I, and the rest of the GOP Conference, and the American people, \nmay rely on your words as I have written them.\n  ``I need your assurance that you will not use the Speaker's position \nto advance your immigration policies, except when in accord with the \ntwo above statements, because there is a huge gap between your \nimmigration position and the wishes of the American citizens I \nrepresent.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, for the first time in over a dozen \nyears, an unusual legislative procedure--a discharge petition--has been \nsuccessfully mounted in the House. This is an extraordinary effort to \nallow the House to work its will--a mechanism that was part of a \npackage of reform, dating back over a century, to deal with the iron \nrule of Speaker Joe Cannon. The subject of the petition, the Ex-Im \nBank, was almost as obscure as the procedure that brought it to the \nHouse.\n  This is an agency that for over 70 years has provided financing for \ntransactions similar to which all of our competitor nations provide \ntheir exporting companies. In this case, American companies will have \nthe credit tools that will enable them to cost-effectively engage in \ninternational transactions that other private institutions won't \nfinance because of political or commercial risks.\n  Even if providing this service meant a modest exposure to the \ntaxpayer, which might occasionally cost money, it was probably worth it \nto have the businesses support good-paying American jobs and to be able \nto compete with foreign companies.\n  Yes, it would be worth it. It is not just a low-risk proposition. The \nEx-Im Bank is a service that has made billions of dollars for the \nUnited States Treasury. It turns a profit--about $2 million in the last \n2 fiscal years.\n  This is interesting--a service that all of our competitor nations \nprovide their companies. It hasn't cost the taxpayers any money. In \nfact, it makes money for the Treasury. Why was it allowed to expire?\n  This is another example of where a minority of the House, for \nideological reasons, decided they were going to take over the process. \nIn this case, they were going to kill the Ex-Im Bank. They did so over \nthe objections of the administration, of the business community, of \nmany Members of Congress, of people in organized labor.\n  It was hard to maintain decorum during last night's debate when the \nchair of the committee complained that, somehow, by approving the \ndischarge petition and the procedural motions that followed, we were \nstifling the will of the House. I smiled as people lamented that they \nwould not be able to offer amendments. Members came to the floor, \nsaying they had amendments they wished they could offer and now they \nwere being shut out.\n  How ironic.\n  His committee had no intention of allowing the House to participate \nin the give-and-take of legislation he was lamenting was slipping away. \nHis committee didn't allow this proposal to come to the floor. The \ncommittee did not amend and refine the Ex-Im Bank. The committee killed \nit by having the authorization expire without giving the whole House a \nchance to be part of that decision.\n  Now the people who were caught on the wrong side of the majority of \nthe House, with a losing argument and a minority position, were \nsuddenly concerned that the House was being shut out. They had been \nshutting out the House for the last 2 years. They had denied efforts at \nreform. Only when their hand was forced did they somehow resort to the \nmost specious of arguments. This is like, as they say, the person who \nkills his parents and then pleads for mercy from the court because he \nis an orphan.\n  There is no reform because they didn't want reform. They were the \nones who shut the House out. Now, because of the courageous action by a \nbipartisan group, led by our Republican colleagues--eloquently and \nbravely--the House will no longer be shut out. American business will \nbe stronger; and the House has demonstrated that there sometimes will \nbe opportunities for a bipartisan majority to have its interests \nrepresented.\n  We can only hope that this sets a precedent for how we solve other \nproblems, from raising the debt ceiling, to dealing with budgets, to \nrebuilding and renewing America. Involve the entire House--solutions \nare possible--and America will be better served.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7192-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7192-H7193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE TRIUMPH OF EVIL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, last Thursday, President \nObama used his veto power for the fifth time since taking office. This \ntime, it was to reject the $612 billion defense authorization bill: \nH.R. 1735, the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  President Obama vetoed the defense bill on the same day that an \nAmerican was killed in Iraq. With so much uncertainty and conflict \naround the world, I would have expected our President to have \nunderstood the importance of supporting this bipartisan defense bill. \nThis veto is inexcusable. Not only is this a blatant show of disrespect \nfor our troops, but it is disrespect for our Nation.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act also contains key provisions \nthat will greatly benefit my State of West Virginia. The provisions \ninclude the drug interdiction and counterdrug program, the National \nGuard State Partnership Program, and $3.9 million in funding for the \nCharleston, West Virginia, Air National Guard Base.\n  It is shortsighted and wrong that the President refused to sign this \ncritical defense bill. The bill gives our troops essential resources, \nbut President Obama vetoed it because he wants concessions in other \nareas of government spending.\n\n[[Page H7193]]\n\n  It is time to stop playing politics with our military. I urge my \ncolleagues in the House and Senate to join together to override this \nveto.\n  Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, I stood on the floor of this Chamber \nand shared the stories of my constituents who have family members in \nSyria who are experiencing the political turmoil that is seen on the \nnews daily. These stories paint a disturbing picture of what life is \nlike in Syria right now.\n  Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad is inflicting a reign of terror on \nhis own people that include the worst kinds of torture, the repeated \nuses of chemical weapons bombardments, and the siege and starvation of \ninnocent people. Assad has killed more than 130,000 of his own people \nand has forced an additional 3 to 4 million to flee the country.\n  These problems have been exacerbated by the failure of leadership \nfrom the United States of America. It is not just that Obama has a bad \nplan for how to handle the crisis in Syria. It is that he has no plan \nat all.\n  Edmund Burke once said: ``All that is necessary for the triumph of \nevil is that good men do nothing.''\n  That is exactly what the Obama administration has done: nothing. Evil \nis triumphing because of it. Innocent people will continue to die if we \ndo not act now. We must take the first step and establish a no-fly zone \nso that Assad cannot continue to bomb his own people from the sky. It \nis so photos like these won't be commonplace in our news.\n  This critical action will help, but we have to do more. I call upon \nthis administration to wake up to that fact.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7193-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1015\n                          A POWERFUL COALITION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, over the last several weeks, I visited \nsix high schools in my district to meet with juniors and seniors, about \n2,000 students in total.\n  Almost all of the students I meet are U.S. citizens. The majority are \nLatinos. Some have immigrant parents, and most will soon be eligible to \nvote.\n  All of them have one question for me. It starts every Q and A at \nevery high school I visit. The questions are about Donald Trump. Is he \ngoing to be our next President? Is it true that he wants to revoke our \ncitizenship and deport us to the countries our parents came from? Is it \ntrue he wants to round us up, Mr. Gutierrez, and deport us all?\n  It is very sad when the questions a Congressman gets from American \nhigh school students are about how much they should fear their own \ngovernment, whether their own government is going to break up their \nfamilies, whether their own government is going to treat them not as \ncitizens and as equal partners, but as outsiders and pariahs in their \nown country.\n  When they hear that Trump is ``leading in the polls,'' they think \nthat means there is a pretty good chance that he will be the next \nPresident. When they see him on TV shows like Jimmy Fallon, not to \nmention CNN and Fox News, they get the feeling that he is a celebrity \nthat all of us in America admire.\n  When they hear that Trump is hosting ``Saturday Night Live''--not \njust being a guest but actually hosting, even after saying Mexican are \nmostly rapists, criminals, and drug dealers--they get the impression \nthat calling whole groups of people rapists, criminals, and drug \ndealers based on their ethnicity or national origin is basically okay \nwith us in America.\n  The real question these Chicago-area high school students have is: \nHey, Gutierrez, what are you going to do to defend us from Donald \nTrump? What are you going to do to stand up for us?\n  This leads to an intense discussion about American politics. And I \nask the students right back: What are you going to do to stand up for \nyourselves, for your community?\n  Look, motivating 17- and 18-year-olds to do something is not always \neasy, including motivating them to register to vote when they are old \nenough and to actually go out and vote. But when I ask these young \nAmericans whether they plan to get registered and vote, every hand goes \nup in the classroom.\n  Donald Trump is spurring youth voter mobilization like I have never \nseen before. Nationally, we know that 93 percent of Latinos under the \nage of 18 are citizens of the United States and that every 30 seconds a \nLatino citizen turns 18. That is about a million a year for the next \ndecade or so. If they are half as motivated as the young people I am \ntalking to in Chicago, Donald Trump could have a tremendous impact on \nthe youth vote in the coming election.\n  But let's be honest, do we really want to motivate civic \nparticipation through fear of deportation, racial profiling, and \nfamilies being broken up? These are American teenagers growing up to \ndistrust their government.\n  Trump wants to take us back to the good old days of race relations, \nwhich apparently means the 1950s, when President Eisenhower evicted \nmillions of immigrants and U.S. citizens from the United States. Dr. \nCarson, who believes that human history is only about 5,000 years old--\nthat is what he says, we have only been around 5,000 years--says of \nmass deportation schemes: ``I think it's worth discussing.''\n  Here in the House, we have considered measures to deport children \nmore quickly, to make groups more distrustful of the police, and to \ndelay Homeland Security funding.\n  Testifying on one of these bills before the Rules Committee last \nyear, I made the unfortunate but real suggestion that Republicans were \ngravitating toward mass deportation policies, which provoked a response \nfrom the chairman, Mr. Sessions. He said: Gutierrez, ``there is no one \nin responsible Republican leadership that has said we should deport 13 \nor 11 million people. And I find it extremely distasteful that people \nwould come here and suggest things that we have not suggested.''\n  Well, now that people are suggesting mass deportation openly and are \ngaining in the public opinion polls in the Republican Party, I wonder \nwhy there is so much silence from the Republican Members of this body.\n  But it is not just young Latino voters in Chicago that are being \nmotivated by Republican attacks. When Republicans attack Planned \nParenthood and block laws to guarantee equal pay for women, that \nmotivates women to register and vote. When Republicans celebrate people \nwho will not issue marriage licenses to two men or two women, a lot of \npeople in the LGBT community get motivated to register and vote.\n  When Republicans rail against unions and block increases in the \nminimum wage, while, of course, they earn $174,000 a year, and block \nenvironmental standards and block sensible gun laws, a lot of working \nclass and middle class Americans get motivated to register and vote.\n  Together with those young people I talked about at those high \nschools, we are forming a very, very powerful coalition, a coalition so \npowerful that some day, even Republicans themselves will want to be \npart of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7193-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7193-H7194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOLDING THE EPA ACCOUNTABLE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Westmoreland) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring awareness to the \nreckless acts of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  On August 5, 2015, the EPA triggered the release of millions of \ngallons of toxic waste into the Animas River near Durango, Colorado, \ncontaining lead, arsenic, and other pollutants.\n  Originally, contaminated water was seeping into the Gold King Mine \nfrom another nearby mine. When the Gold King Mine owner refused to \nallow the EPA on his property, the EPA threatened to fine him up to \n$35,000 a day--let me repeat--$35,000 a day for a leak that wasn't \ncoming from the owner's mine. It was only after these thuggish threats \nthat he was forced to let the EPA on his property.\n  In fact, as recently as last week, investigators from the Interior \nDepartment concluded their independent investigation into the August \nspill and determined that the spill was preventible and occurred due to \nthe actions of the EPA. The best that EPA administrator Gina McCarthy \ncould do is say\n\n[[Page H7194]]\n\nthat she was ``deeply sorry'' and that the spill was a ``tragic and \nunfortunate accident.'' That is not all: there was no accountability, \nno reparation, nothing.\n  How can the American people trust a government agency charged with \nprotecting our environment when the same Agency is responsible for \ncausing even more damage? Actions speak louder than words. This is more \nof the same from the EPA. They are another arm of the Federal \nGovernment looking to bully private citizens, but this is nothing new \nfrom the EPA.\n  Almost a decade ago, a gentleman from my district faced a costly, \nalmost devastating battle with the EPA. Mr. Paul McKnight owned an old \ncotton warehouse in Senoia, Georgia. After a former deadbeat tenant of \nMr. McKnight, who had already been responsible for the EPA spending \n$1.6 million in a brownfield cleanup, could not afford to remove 2,000 \nbarrels of toxic waste from this warehouse that Mr. McKnight knew did \nnot exist, the EPA was called in to inspect the building by some \nanonymous caller who said that they could smell a leak. Once the EPA \ngot there, their inspector said they couldn't smell a leak. There was \nno leak, but they did find 2,000 barrels containing toxic material.\n  Without Mr. McKnight's knowledge, the EPA declared this warehouse an \n``imminent fire hazard'' and cleaned up the chemicals at a cost of \n$800,000, even though the previous tenant had a bid of 170. Later, at a \npublic forum, an EPA representative stated that the EPA had the funds \nto clean up the warehouse, only to bill Mr. McKnight later for that \noverpriced cleanup. Not only did they bill him for the overpriced \ncleanup, but they sought over $1 million in cleanup fees and placed a \nlien on his real estate holdings, including his farm and his home.\n  I helped Mr. McKnight to get the case reconsidered. After 8 years in \ncourt, he was able to get it reduced down to $600,000.\n  The EPA shouldn't use legal loopholes and cower behind exemptions at \nthe cost of taxpayers and, not only that, to charge somebody that had \nno knowledge of the barrels even being there, rather than the man who \nput the barrels there. This gentleman served 1 year and 4 months in \nFederal prison for this. It was his second offense, and yet Mr. \nMcKnight was fined over $1 million.\n  That is why I have introduced three bills over the last 2 months \ntargeting the EPA. My bills: H.R. 3531, No Exemptions for EPA Act; H.R. \n3655, EPA Pays Act; and H.R. 3699, Judgment Fund Taxpayer \nAccountability Act are all aimed at holding the EPA to the same \nstandards and requirements as private citizens.\n  My bills remove these legal loopholes for the EPA and force them to \nrepay the Federal Government for any damages the EPA causes. If I were \nto accidentally cause the same disaster, do you think that I would get \noff by just saying ``I'm sorry and I promise not to do it again''? That \nis why we have introduced these three bills.\n  So I ask my colleagues to, please, join me in holding the EPA \naccountable in any future accidents by supporting H.R. 3531, 3655, and \n3699.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7194-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DEBT CEILING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, in 1983, President Ronald Reagan wrote to \nthen-Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, urging him to raise the debt \nceiling. In his letter, he said: ``The risks, the costs, the \ndisruptions, and the incalculable damage lead me to but one conclusion: \nThe Senate must pass this legislation before the Congress adjourns.''\n  Twenty-three years later, we now find ourselves 1 week away from \ndefaulting on our debt for the first time in our Nation's history. \nInstead of making sure we preserve the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States, as President Reagan had done 18 times during his tenure, \nsome want to hold our economy hostage to extract ideological wins.\n  This is not the time for partisan bickering and political \ngamesmanship, not when it means delaying Social Security benefits for \nseniors and those with disabilities, withholding paychecks from our \nbrave Active Duty servicemembers, and postponing interest payments on \ngovernment-issued bonds.\n  We have a responsibility to live up to our obligations no matter \nwhat. That is not politics; it is basic governing.\n  The longer we wait to meet our obligations and raise the debt \nceiling, the closer we get to another credit rating downgrade, a spike \nin interest rates, and a severe slowdown in economic growth. This is \nnot an overstatement.\n  Let's look back at what happened in 2013 during the last debt ceiling \nstandoff. Just the possibility of default caused rates on Treasuries to \nrise by almost half a percentage point. That cost taxpayers as much as \n$70 million.\n  This time around, if we actually default, market forecasters estimate \nthat interest payments on Treasuries would increase Federal deficits by \n$10 billion over the short term and by $70 billion a year after that. \nThat is money that wouldn't be going to critical investments in \nresearch and development, education, and infrastructure.\n  On top of that, higher interest rates on Treasuries could lead to a 1 \npercent reduction in GDP. That would mean the loss of almost 700,000 \njobs, and that is just a conservative estimate.\n  Make no mistake, every American would be impacted. Middle class \nfamilies looking to buy a home would face higher mortgage rates. A half \na percentage point increase in mortgage rates would increase the \nlifetime cost of an average home loan by almost $19,000. Small-business \nowners would face difficulties trying to secure new loans as lending \ntightens up. And students will have an even harder time trying to pay \nfor college as student loan rates skyrocket.\n  We owe it to our constituents to move toward responsible governing \nand away from governing by crisis, which has become all too common \naround here.\n  The bipartisan budget package unveiled last night affirms the full \nfaith and credit of the United States and represents real progress for \nhardworking American families who are tired of threats of default and \npartisan gridlock.\n  Now is not the time for politics. Now is the time for thoughtful \nconsideration, bipartisan compromise, and, most importantly, finding a \npath forward for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7194-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7194-H7195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Olson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, this is the last week of National Breast \nCancer Awareness Month. Before it ends, I would tell the American \npeople about two amazing women from Sugar Land, Texas, two good friends \nof my family, two women who are here for a reason, two people who are \ntouching others in need, two people who are making a difference.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Meet Irma and Sasha. Stunning, aren't they? They are related. They \nlook like sisters, but they are not. They are mother and daughter. The \nmom, Irma, is on the left. Her baby girl, Sasha, is on the right. Irma \nand Sasha are sisters in a cause. Both have fought breast cancer, and \nboth have won.\n  Each year over 200,000 American women hear four crushing words: You \nhave breast cancer. Irma feared those words because she knew they may \nbe coming. Both of her sisters heard those four words. One died.\n  Irma beat her cancer, but lived in fear. With her family's history of \nbreast cancer, her daughter had a good chance of hearing those four \nterrible words. Five years after Irma beat breast cancer, Sasha banged \non her door, crying without end. She was 31, and she had aggressive \nbreast cancer.\n  Irma was by Sasha's side every second of her fight against cancer. \nMom watched her daughter lose each breast. Mom watched her daughter go \nthrough 16 rounds of harsh chemotherapy. Mom watched her daughter lose \nall of her hair, her eyebrows, her eyelashes. Mom watched her daughter \nlose that smile. Sasha thought that she was no longer beautiful. Her \nwill to fight was decreasing.\n  Irma took charge. She told Sasha that ``no matter how sick you feel, \nget\n\n[[Page H7195]]\n\nup, shower, and put some lipstick on. You are beautiful.''\n  Then it hit both of them. They were women of style and grace. Cancer \ntook that away. The only wigs they could find looked good on circus \nclowns. There was not a beauty shop for women with breast cancer, a \nplace where they are pampered, a place where they are beautiful. They \nwere going to end that.\n  Dad had no choice. He gave Sasha his life savings, and in 2013 my \nwife and I walked into our friends' dream store, Cure & Co., on its \nopening day. Cure & Co. gives women with cancer real wigs, real \nfacials, and real beauty products. Sasha and Irma give their clients \nhope and love in the worst of times, the greatest gifts of all.\n  Look one last time at Irma and Sasha. They are gorgeous, stunning, \nand beautiful. They have had breast cancer. Both of them have beaten \nbreast cancer, and both of them will never leave the fight until breast \ncancer is cured forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7195-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7195-H7196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REFUGEE CRISIS IN EUROPE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nOhio (Ms. Kaptur) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, last week I came to the floor and \nrecommended that the Obama administration appoint a special envoy with \na very broad portfolio: dispatched to work on a diplomatic solution to \nthe tragedy that is destroying Syria and unfolding in the Middle East, \nnow having broad impact in greater Europe.\n  I want to point out to those who are listening that the displacement \ncrisis in the Middle East, centered in Syria, has consumed seven \nnations and propelled the largest refugee crisis Europe has faced since \nWorld War II. Already in Syria, over a quarter of a million people have \nbeen killed--civilians--and that is probably a low number.\n  With over 12 million people displaced, Europe is being besieged by \nhundreds of thousands, legions, of the dispossessed. Meanwhile, it \nalmost seems surreal that no effective diplomatic negotiation is \nunderway that holds the prospect of leading to peace.\n  I again ask the Obama administration to dispatch a special envoy with \na broad portfolio to work full time on a diplomatic solution to the \ntragedy that is destroying Syria.\n  Then yesterday in The New York Times appeared an editorial by the \nlegendary 39th President of the United States, Jimmy Carter, entitled \n``A Plan to End the Syrian Crisis.'' I served President Carter during \nhis years in the Presidency.\n  I well remember the incredible moment in 1979 when President Carter \nstood with Anwar Sadat, the President of Egypt, and the Prime Minister \nof Israel, Menachem Begin, and they signed that treaty in March of \n1979. Who would have ever thought that that moment in history would \nhave been possible? Yet, until today, that treaty holds between Egypt \nand Israel, and it has made a gigantic difference in the saving of \nlives in that extremely troubled region.\n  In his editorial to The New York Times, President Carter references \nthat the Carter Center--which he founded and to which he has dedicated \nhis life with his wife Rosalyn ever since his service as President--has \nbeen deeply involved in Syria since the early 1980s. Who would know \nmore than he?\n  He recommends the only real chance of ending the conflict is to \nengage the United States, Russia, Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia in \npreparing a comprehensive peace protocol with Syria. He knows what that \nrequires. He recommends a cease-fire, formation of a unity government, \nconstitutional reforms, and elections.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include for today's Record the editorial entitled ``A \nPlan to End the Syrian Crisis.''\n  I say to my colleagues and to those who are listening: As we watch \nthis tragedy unfold, our Nation is the most powerful nation in the \nworld. Surely, we should have the wisdom and the will to take this \nlatest tragedy, which we had no small part in precipitating, and find a \nway to bring the parties to the table.\n  What is happening in Syria due to the lack of a diplomatic solution \nis now impacting Europe in ways that we have not seen since World War \nII. It is very destabilizing.\n  With what is happening inside Ukraine today due to Russia's invasion, \nwith over 1.7 million displaced persons internally, if Russia would \nhappen to turn the tourniquet tighter in eastern Ukraine and cause \nadditional displacement across Europe, imagine what the winter months \nwould bring.\n  I can't urge in strong enough terms that the Obama administration pay \nheed to President Carter's very lucid editorial in yesterday's New York \nTimes. I commend all Members and citizens to read it.\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 26, 2015]\n\n                    A Plan To End the Syrian Crisis\n\n                           (By Jimmy Carter)\n\n       I have known Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria, since \n     he was a college student in London, and have spent many hours \n     negotiating with him since he has been in office. This has \n     often been at the request of the United States government \n     during those many times when our ambassadors have been \n     withdrawn from Damascus because of diplomatic disputes.\n       Bashar and his father, Hafez, had a policy of not speaking \n     to anyone at the American Embassy during those periods of \n     estrangement, but they would talk to me. I noticed that \n     Bashar never referred to a subordinate for advice or \n     information. His most persistent characteristic was \n     stubbornness; it was almost psychologically impossible for \n     him to change his mind--and certainly not when under \n     pressure.\n       Before the revolution began in March 2011, Syria set a good \n     example of harmonious relations among its many different \n     ethnic and religious groups, including Arabs, Kurds, Greeks, \n     Armenians and Assyrians who were Christians, Jews, Sunnis, \n     Alawites and Shiites. The Assad family had ruled the country \n     since 1970, and was very proud of this relative harmony among \n     these diverse groups.\n       When protesters in Syria demanded long overdue reforms in \n     the political system, President Assad saw this as an illegal \n     revolutionary effort to overthrow his ``legitimate'' regime \n     and erroneously decided to stamp it out by using unnecessary \n     force. Because of many complex reasons, he was supported by \n     his military forces, most Christians, Jews, Shiite Muslims, \n     Alawites and others who feared a takeover by radical Sunni \n     Muslims. The prospect for his overthrow was remote.\n       The Carter Center had been deeply involved in Syria since \n     the early 1980s, and we shared our insights with top \n     officials in Washington, seeking to preserve an opportunity \n     for a political solution to the rapidly growing conflict. \n     Despite our persistent but confidential protests, the early \n     American position was that the first step in resolving the \n     dispute had to be the removal of Mr. Assad from office. Those \n     who knew him saw this as a fruitless demand, but it has been \n     maintained for more than four years. In effect, our \n     prerequisite for peace efforts has been an impossibility.\n       Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, \n     and Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister, \n     tried to end the conflict as special representatives of the \n     United Nations, but abandoned the effort as fruitless because \n     of incompatibilities among America, Russia and other nations \n     regarding the status of Mr. Assad during a peace process.\n       In May 2015, a group of global leaders known as the Elders \n     visited Moscow, where we had detailed discussions with the \n     American ambassador, former President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, \n     former Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, Foreign Minister \n     Sergey V. Lavrov and representatives of international think \n     tanks, including the Moscow branch of the Carnegie Center.\n       They pointed out the longstanding partnership between \n     Russia and the Assad regime and the great threat of the \n     Islamic State to Russia, where an estimated 14 percent of its \n     population are Sunni Muslims. Later, I questioned President \n     Putin about his support for Mr. Assad, and about his two \n     sessions that year with representatives of factions from \n     Syria. He replied that little progress had been made, and he \n     thought that the only real chance of ending the conflict was \n     for the United States and Russia to be joined by Iran, Turkey \n     and Saudi Arabia in preparing a comprehensive peace proposal. \n     He believed that all factions in Syria, except the Islamic \n     State, would accept almost any plan endorsed strongly by \n     these five, with Iran and Russia supporting Mr. Assad and the \n     other three backing the opposition. With his approval, I \n     relayed this suggestion to Washington.\n       For the past three years, the Carter Center has been \n     working with Syrians across political divides, armed \n     opposition group leaders and diplomats from the United \n     Nations and Europe to find a political path for ending the \n     conflict. This effort has been based on data-driven research \n     about the Syrian catastrophe that the center has conducted, \n     which reveals the location of different factions and clearly \n     shows that neither side in Syria can prevail militarily.\n       The recent decision by Russia to support the Assad regime \n     with airstrikes and other military forces has intensified the \n     fighting, raised the level of armaments and may increase the \n     flow of refugees to neighboring countries and Europe. At the \n     same time, it has helped to clarify the choice between a \n     political process in which the Assad regime\n\n[[Page H7196]]\n\n     assumes a role and more war in which the Islamic State \n     becomes an even greater threat to world peace. With these \n     clear alternatives, the five nations mentioned above could \n     formulate a unanimous proposal. Unfortunately, differences \n     among them persist.\n       Iran outlined a general four-point sequence several months \n     ago, consisting of a cease-fire, formation of a unity \n     government, constitutional reforms and elections. Working \n     through the United Nations Security Council and utilizing a \n     five-nation proposal, some mechanism could be found to \n     implement these goals.\n       The involvement of Russia and Iran is essential. Mr. \n     Assad's only concession in four years of war was giving up \n     chemical weapons, and he did so only under pressure from \n     Russia and Iran. Similarly, he will not end the war by \n     accepting concessions imposed by the West, but is likely to \n     do so if urged by his allies.\n       Mr. Assad's governing authority could then be ended in an \n     orderly process, an acceptable government established in \n     Syria, and a concerted effort could then be made to stamp out \n     the threat of the Islamic State.\n       The needed concessions are not from the combatants in \n     Syria, but from the proud nations that claim to want peace \n     but refuse to cooperate with one another.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7196-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Now it is \nautumn, and without the Ex-Im Bank, we are losing American jobs.\n  Last month, General Electric announced it will move production of \nlarge, gas-powered engines to Canada, along with 350 jobs, because the \ncompany cannot access financing from the Export-Import Bank.\n  Boeing was recently told by a Singapore-based satellite company not \neven to bother bidding on a satellite contract because they lacked the \nfinancing from Ex-Im.\n  These are just a few real-life examples of the real-world \nconsequences of letting Ex-Im expire.

This is one of the many reasons \nthat I supported increased funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth. American scientists and researchers are the best in the world, \nbut they do need our support to put an end to this disease once and for \nall.\n  I am also proud to be the lead Republican sponsor of H.R. 1925, a \nbill to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Dr. Ernie Bodai, the \ncreator of the breast cancer research stamp. Since its introduction in \n1998, the stamp has been an effective tool for increasing awareness and \nhas raised over $80 million to support the cause.\n  This month, please take a moment to join me in remembering those who \nlost the battle to breast cancer, while celebrating survivors, those \ncurrently fighting the disease, and all of those helping women live \nlonger, healthier lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7196-10", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7196-H7197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SOLAR ENERGY\n\n  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, solar energy serves the national interest \nin a number of ways. It is reducing our reliance on fossil fuels that \nare causing climate change. It is helping America\n\n[[Page H7197]]\n\nto become energy independent. It is creating jobs, 3,000 of them, at or \nnear the solar plant under construction in Buffalo, New York.\n  Solar panels empower consumers to generate clean and affordable \nenergy at home and to sell the extra energy that they do not use to the \ngrid. A policy called ``net metering,'' which requires utilities to pay \na fair price for this energy to the consumer, is currently in place in \nall but six States. It has been vital to the growth of the solar \nindustry by providing consumers with certainty on the savings that \nsolar will produce in their energy bill.\n  That is why I have introduced legislation to direct the Department of \nEnergy to conduct a study on all of the impacts of net metering. \nThrough a comprehensive analysis, we can ensure that regulators and \npolicymakers have the accurate information they need to make a sound \ndecision on whether to support consumer-generated solar energy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7197-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT VETOED\n\n  (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, my heart breaks for our military men and \nwomen who last week watched their Commander in Chief as he vetoed the \nNDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act. This was a bill that \nwould give them more pay and better benefits for the job that they are \ndoing. He vetoed it, great flourish, called a ceremony.\n  He vetoed the bill because he wanted more money for his domestic \nagenda that includes more money for broken agencies like the EPA and \nthe IRS. Imagine that.\n  In Congress, our first responsibility is to provide for the common \ndefense, and the NDAA just does that.\n  This year's defense bill passed both the House and the Senate with an \noverwhelming bipartisan majority. It is the most reform-centered \ndefense bill in decades.\n  It includes pay and benefits for our troops. Did you know 83 percent \nof our military personnel have retired with no retirement benefits? It \nchanges that.\n  The President vetoed it. It would have given them 401(k)-style \nbenefits. The President vetoed it. He should be ashamed of those \nactions. The men and women in uniform deserve better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7197-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATION'S CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, well, it is long past time for Congress to \ndo its job and get serious about funding a long-term solution to fix \nour crumbling roads and bridges, all of our infrastructure in this \ncountry.\n  In Michigan, of all States, we know that we need to invest in order \nto grow our economy. To build a 21st century economy, we need state-of-\nthe-art infrastructure.\n  No more short-term fixes, no more month-to-month funding. I have \nvoted against these short-term bills in the past, and I am going to \ncontinue to do so.\n  We are in urgent need of dramatic investment in infrastructure. \nNearly a third of our roads are in poor or mediocre condition. One out \nof four of our bridges require significant repair. In my own hometown, \nour water infrastructure is wholly inadequate to provide even clean \nwater to our residents.\n  We just cannot continue to threaten our economy by failing to do our \njob. Congress needs to do its job. The American people go to work every \nsingle day, and the least that they can expect is that we do the same \nthing and do our job.\n  If we really believe in our future in this Congress, we ought to be \nwilling to invest in it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7197-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FAIRNESS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR MARRIED HOUSEHOLDS WITH STUDENT LOANS \n                                  ACT\n\n  (Mr. MARCHANT asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, student loan debt is now the fastest \ngrowing and second-largest type of household debt in America. It is no \nsurprise that many Americans are putting off marriage and family life \nfor financial reasons.\n  The decline in marriage is a problem that could impact our economy \nand society for decades to come. Yet, our Tax Code punishes married \nhouseholds who have student debt. That is why I have introduced the \nFairness and Opportunities for Married Households With Student Loans \nAct.\n  Currently, an individual with student loans can deduct up to $2,500 \nin interest paid on their loans, but that amount does not increase for \nmarried couples filing jointly. So spouses who both have student loan \ndebt are limited to just one $2,500 deduction. This is not fair.\n  My bill increases the deduction to $5,000 for married couples. It \nonly makes sense. It also strengthens incentives toward marriage and \nfinancial independence.\n  With student debt putting pressure on our economy, let's stop \npenalizing marriage and start helping families build a stronger future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7197-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       2015 JOBS FAIR AND ECONOMY\n\n  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I recently hosted my third annual \nhiring event where 500 applicants connected with more than 70 employers \nlooking to fill positions.\n  I was delighted to see Ramona Young and Sommatra Jackson at the \nevent, two women hired at my first event in 2013. They were back this \nyear representing the company that hired them.\n  Their success continues to motivate me. For every Ramona and \nSommatra, there are hundreds of Americans looking for good-paying jobs \nthat allow them to build toward a future.\n  So today I rise on behalf of those American workers still looking for \ngood-paying jobs.\n  We all know the statistics. Our economy is growing. After 67 months \nof consecutive job growth, our unemployment rate stands at 5.1 percent \nfor the first time since 2008, but the fact is there are nearly 8 \nmillion Americans still searching.\n  The people I met at my hiring event were talented, skilled, and \ndriven. They are hungry for an opportunity to work, to put their skills \nto good use, and to provide for their families.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in creating an economy that works for \neveryone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7197-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7197-H7198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS\n\n  (Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize \nOctober as Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Far too many families \nfall victim to domestic violence. In fact, one in four women will \nexperience domestic violence at some point in their lives.\n  I want to recognize and thank the organizations, their staff, and \ntheir volunteers across my district for what they do to help victims of \ndomestic violence.\n  To cite just one example, Mr. Speaker, last week the Berks Women in \nCrisis held their annual Silent Witness Project march and ceremony to \nhonor and remember victims lost. A group of about 75 people marched \nfrom the Berks Women in Crisis center to the Reading Area Community \nCollege, carrying 25 red silhouettes of women, men, and children killed \ndue to domestic violence. Each cutout held a brass shield with the \nsummary of that victim's story.\n  By spreading awareness of these horrors of domestic violence and \nencouraging victims to speak up, we can and must help reduce the number \nof women victimized.\n  I applaud the efforts of this annual ceremony and march and want to \nlet them know that their work is recognized by the community. Indeed, \nthe work of all the organizations, their staff, and volunteers is \ncritical.\n\n[[Page H7198]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7198-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                     STAND WITH SHERIFF LUPE VALDEZ\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand with Lupe. That is \nDallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez. Sheriff Lupe Valdez has a great \nhistory in Dallas County, but recently she has come under attack from \nour Governor for trying to build relationships between the law \nenforcement community and the immigrant community.\n  Governor Abbott sent a threatening letter to Sheriff Valdez, \nquestioning her decision to decline certain Federal ICE detainers when \nthe immigrant in question is not a public safety risk--not a public \nsafety risk.\n  Sheriff Valdez understands that, in order to serve and protect the \nimmigrant community, she must have the trust of that community.\n  I call on Governor Abbott, instead of trying to erode that trust \nbetween law enforcement and the immigrant community, to work with the \nRepublican Texas delegation to push for comprehensive immigration \nreform, to push for the things that the business community wants, that \nthe church community wants, in order to do something about our broken \nimmigration system instead of trying to push for things like sanctuary \ncity bills.\n  If we work together with the immigrant community and do the right \nthing, together we can work on solving a lot of these issues.\n  I ask my colleagues and the Governor to stand with Lupe and to do the \nright thing when it comes to Texas immigrants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7198-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING VESTA MANGUN\n\n  (Mr. ABRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mangun, started The Pentecostals of \nAlexandria when it was known as the First United Pentecostal Church \nwith just 38 members. Today The Pentecostals of Alexandria is made up \nof thousands of members, largely thanks to the dedication of the Mangun \nfamily.\n  The work of Ms. Mangun extends far beyond community.

That is a good thing.\n  Mr. Speaker, the showing of a video of a student being dragged out of \na classroom violently while educators stand by and watch is a bad \nthing. It calls upon the Justice Department of that State, the Attorney \nGeneral, and the local district attorney to stand up and be counted.

Mr. Speaker, last week the President once again \ndisappointed the American people while only seeking to advance his own \npolitical agenda. Despite only vetoing four bills in 7 years, the \nPresident took the extraordinary measure of vetoing a bill vital to \nkeeping Americans safe.\n  The annual National Defense Authorization ensures our troops have the \ntools and training they need to destroy our enemies and to return to \ntheir loved ones back at home. This bill has been passed for 53 \nconsecutive years, yet this President saw fit to veto it, putting \ncampaign promises above our military and the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, the world is not becoming a safer place. In fact, it is \nbecoming much more dangerous. China is building military islands in the \nSouth China Sea. The Russians are destabilizing Europe. Foreign \nfighters are flooding to ISIS by the thousands. Iran is on the path to \nhaving a nuclear weapon. Yet this President is more concerned about \nliberal politics than he is about the safety of our Nation.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a very \ninnovative program in my home State of Arkansas. Governor Asa \nHutchinson proclaimed October to be Farm to School Month. The Farm to \nSchool program provides healthy, locally grown food to our State's \nschools while creating new revenue streams for our Arkansas farmers.\n  According to the USDA, 169 schools, serving over 86,000 young \nArkansans, participate in the program. This directed over $600,000 into \nlocal economies by purchasing products from local farmers.\n  The Farm to School program helps to combat childhood obesity by \nencouraging healthy eating habits among our youngest, most \nimpressionable citizens. Also, at a time when families are moving away \nfrom the rural, agricultural parts of our Nation, I believe it is vital \nthat our children know how and where their food is produced. The Farm \nto School program helps to educate them.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe the Farm to School program is important to the \neconomy, health, and education of Arkansas' Fourth District. I look \nforward to working with the many stakeholders in Arkansas to see the \ncontinued success of the Farm to School program.\n\n[[Page H7199]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7199-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                             CLEAN THE BARN\n\n  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. DAVIS of California.

I \nrecently hosted a Manchester Job Fair to help meet the need, and I am a \nproud cosponsor of the Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act of \n2015.\n  Right now, according to Medicare rules, a nurse practitioner may not \nprescribe home healthcare services for beneficiaries. They must seek a \ndoctor's permission, a process that would take weeks in rural areas \nlike northern New Hampshire.\n  The New Hampshire Nurse Practitioner Association visited me in \nWashington last month to tell me about this critical problem. Current \nrules add extra time and cost to home health care. Qualified nurses \nshould be able to make the best decisions for their patients, \nespecially in the isolated or homebound arena.\n  The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act would allow nurses to \ndo their jobs and help patients recover. It is time to remove a \nneedless layer of bureaucracy and give them the tools they need to \nsucceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7199-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1230\n                       FARM TO SCHOOL ACT OF 2015\n\n  (Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to pay attention to the \nFarm to School Act of 2015. Like my colleague from Arkansas, California \nis a big agricultural State, and we know that kids go hungry.\n  We have the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Children Act, providing some $5 \nmillion annually in competitive programs for schools to establish the \nFarm to School Act programs. These programs are vitally important to \nfarmers, increasing their income, but even more important to kids who \ncan get good, healthy food, locally grown and available in their \nschools.\n  So let's pay attention here. Let's get this new bill underway. Let's \nmove this program forward. Let's put some money so our kids can have \ngood food and our local farmers can have a good market.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7199-6", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS IN TURKEY\n\n  (Mr. TROTT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. TROTT.

With so much on the line \nfor Turkey, both domestically and internationally, it is my sincere \nhope that the elections are held in an environment that is consistent \nwith international standards on November 1.\n  Free and fair elections are a fundamental part of any democratic \nsociety, and Turkish citizens of all backgrounds deserve to know that \nnot only does their vote count, but it will be cast in a welcoming, \nsafe and open atmosphere.\n  Freedom of the press is also a crucial part of democracy and, with \nthe future of Turkey at the forefront of the November elections, \nTurkish citizens deserve to hear every narrative, and journalists and \nreporters should not have to worry about intimidation or legal action, \nsimply for doing their jobs.\n  As Turkey enters a pivotal moment in its history, I wish them a safe \nand successful election day. And just like any democratic society, the \nreal winners at the end of the day will be the citizens of Turkey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7199-7", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7199-H7200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRESS' LAST SHORT-TERM EXTENSION OF THE HIGHWAY BILL\n\n  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n\n[[Page H7200]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, today we will vote on what, hopefully, will be \nthis Congress' last short-term extension of the highway bill. We have \nmade progress on a long-term bill, and the House should consider that \nlegislation next week. This is good news.\n  But the short-term bill also includes an inevitable but disappointing \nextension of the deadline for railroads to install positive train \ncontrol technology. This technology can prevent train accidents and is \ndesigned to save lives.\n  Originally, Congress gave railroads 7 years to install positive train \ncontrol, but as that deadline approaches, the railroads are woefully \nbehind schedule. With the railroad industry's threat to shut down over \nour heads, we have no choice but to go through with this extension.\n  I worry what the consequences will be for this. This has to be the \nlast delay that we give to the railroads.\n  Congress did not mandate positive train control to be a thorn in the \nrailroads' side. It was done to save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7200-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON MEAT\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to set the record \nstraight regarding a claim this week by the International Agency for \nResearch on Cancer classifying processed meats as carcinogenic and red \nmeat as a probable carcinogen.\n  According to the American Cancer Society, there is a lifetime risk of \ndeveloping colorectal cancer of 5 percent. By this organization's own \nfindings, eating a cold-cut sandwich or a hot dog every day would only \nraise that risk to around 6 percent.\n  Doctors with the International Agency for the Research on Cancer \nadmit that the risk for someone to develop cancer due to red meat \nconsumption is dwarfed by the risk caused by cigarette and alcohol \nconsumption.\n  With that in mind, Mr. Speaker, this study should not be used for \nscaremongering in causing people across the Nation to believe that red \nmeats or processed foods are dangerous.\n  The fact remains that variety is the key to a healthy, well-balanced \ndiet, and that cancer is not caused by a single food.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7200-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FIX OUR BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM\n\n  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, today I call upon the House of \nRepresentatives to finally fix our broken immigration system.\n  The American people have had enough.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nreauthorizing the Export-Import Bank.\n  In the First District of Georgia, the Ex-Im Bank facilitates exports \nfor over 17 companies, more than half of which are small businesses, \nover $500 million in exports, and supports over 3,200 jobs.\n  Around Georgia, those numbers jump to more than $4 billion in exports \nfrom 205 companies supporting almost 30,000 jobs.\n  With the recent expiration of the Ex-Im Bank, many of these companies \nhave suffered the loss of millions of dollars in new business growth, \nmarket access, and risked thousands of jobs.\n  While we stand here debating the future of the Ex-Im Bank, our \ncompetitors are leveraging their own versions of their export-import \nagencies to increase their market shares abroad.\n  While I advocated for reforms that go further than this legislation, \nit does provide critical reforms necessary to ensure taxpayers are \nprotected while allowing the bank to do its important work.\n  Passing this legislation is essential to protecting thousands of \njobs, and I urge my colleagues to join us in reauthorizing the Ex-Im \nBank and to let the world know America is open for business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7200-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGENITAL HEART FUTURES ACT\n\n  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS.

Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from \nGeorgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to bring \nforward this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee and the hundreds of \nthousands of young men and women who one day hope to retire.\n  The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1090, the Retail Investor \nProtection Act. The Rules Committee met on this measure yesterday \nevening and heard testimony from both the chairman and ranking member \nof the Financial Services Committee.\n  The rule brought forward by the committee is a structured rule. There \nwas only one amendment submitted to the Rules Committee on this bill, \nand the House will have the opportunity to debate and vote on the \namendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) later \ntoday.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  This legislation went through regular order in the Financial Services \nCommittee and was also passed by the House in the 113th Congress by a \nvote of 254-166 with a number of my friends from the other side of the \naisle voting for the legislation. I hope we can put aside our political \ndifferences and vote in a similar bipartisan fashion here today.\n  This rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and \ncontrolled by the chairman and ranking member of the Financial Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to hearing the stories that Members will \nshare highlighting the desperate need for H.R. 1090 to become law.\n  I also have heard firsthand from men and women in my district who are \nscared about their financial future. Navigating retirement planning can \nbe a difficult task, especially for young men and women just entering \nthe workforce. They often rely on financial planners to offer advice on \nthe steps they need to take today so one day they can retire.\n  I had the opportunity to meet with one of those financial planners in \nmy office just a few months ago. Beth Baldwin is a financial planner \nwho works for Edward Jones in my hometown of Gainesville, Georgia. She \ntook the time to come to Washington to meet with me and other elected \nofficials because she was scared about the impact that the fiduciary \nrule would have on her ability to do her job. She told me that the \nadministration's fiduciary rule prevents her from helping people.\n  Beth told me that financial advisers should always provide advice \nthat is in their client's best interest, but the rule places \nunnecessary and burdensome requirements on both advisers and clients.\n  That is not what we are about as a country, Mr. Speaker. We are the \nworld's greatest economic engine, the land of hope and opportunity, \nbecause we believe in the ingenuity and hard work of people. Our \nfounders believed in people. They were on their team, and they created \na governmental structure that is for the people and by the people. \nFrankly, Mr. Speaker, that is what this Republican majority stands for: \nthe people who get up every day looking to how they can make it better.\n  The Republican majority is for people. We believe in their hopes, we \nbelieve in their dreams, and we want them to succeed. When my son gets \na little older and starts thinking about retirement, I want him to be \nable to go to a professional and get some advice and seek good \ninformation.\n  If H.R. 1090 isn't signed into law, then financial advisers like Beth \nBaldwin won't be able to help him. In fact, they won't be able to help \nothers who have helped my family, like Wayne Parrish, who is a dear \nfriend of our family, but is also someone who advises us in our \nfinancial decisions. This is something that is threatening not only his \nlivelihood, but many teachers that work with my wife. This is about \npeople, Mr. Speaker.\n  Across the Nation today, there are 9 million households that rely on \nsmall business retirement plans. And there are 3 million small-saver \nhouseholds. These are the people who need Congress now, more than ever, \nto be on their team.\n  To them, this debate isn't over definitions and enhanced coordination \nand studies. It is over their future. It is over their ability to make \ninformed decisions, to find somebody like Beth or Wayne or a number of \nothers all across this country who can help them plan for the future.\n  Financial advisers should be free to offer advice to their clients \nbased on what is best for them as individuals and small businesses, not \nbased on what advice most limits their liability.\n  Saving for retirement is already difficult. It requires tough \ndecisions. But the one thing that can keep a devastating financial \ndecision from being made is advice from a qualified professional.\n  I in no way believe we should model our policies after other \ncountries. We have talked about that before here. However, when we can \nlearn from their mistakes, we should.\n\n[[Page H7202]]\n\n  The United Kingdom implemented a similar rule in 2013. Two years \nlater we can see the negative effects. The rule has created an advice \ngap in which 60,000 investors are unable to receive financial advice \nbecause their accounts are too small.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know some stories that have been told on the floor and \nfrom many Members here. I remember when I and my wife were just \nstarting out. To tell me what little bit that I had saved was too small \nis an affront to the very free enterprise system that helps people \nclimb to where they want to go and fulfill their dreams. We should \nnever be satisfied with when we tell people they can't get advice \nbecause their pot, so to speak, is too small.\n  Several of my constituents from northeast Georgia recently wrote to \nme about the administration's fiduciary rule. Here is what they said: \n``The rule as proposed is not workable and would have numerous \nunintended consequences for American workers and retirement savers, \nparticularly those who are middle class. The requirements in the rule \nwould drive the market to fee-based arrangements that are used only for \nwealthier clients and are not the best fit for many investors. As a \nresult, middle-class savers would be forced into low-service, do-it-\nyourself accounts, depriving them of meaningful, personalized planning \nadvice.''\n  Let me repeat that: ``depriving them of meaningful, personalized \nplanning advice.''\n  We are here today as the Republican majority, advancing H.R. 1090, \nbecause we are for the middle class. Because we refuse to accept any \nrule from this administration that would deprive the middle class of \nthe tools they need to make good financial decisions.\n  One of my constituents also wrote: ``The time to act is now before \nAmericans are deprived of consumer choice on how to plan for retirement \nand invest their savings.''\n  Another said: ``Recently, I became aware of a proposed rule that \nwould undermine my ability to plan for my retirement in ways I believe \nbest for me.''\n  It is the very heart of why we are here, Mr. Speaker. It is taking up \nfor those who need someone to say: Government, it is time to let the \nfree enterprise, time to let the middle class, the hardworking folks of \nour country, have advice and be able to access that.\n  I cannot understand why some of my friends on the other side of the \naisle support a rule that would undermine anyone's ability to plan for \ntheir retirement in ways that are best for them. This isn't a political \nissue. It is about people and their future. It is as simple as that.\n  Financial planning isn't one size fits all. It is customized, \nindividualized, based on the need of a particular family or small \nbusiness. ObamaCare is a perfect example of what happens when the \nadministration takes over an industry without regard to the needs of \nthe middle and lower class.\n  Another constituent wrote to me and said: ``With this rule, it seems \nthe government has determined that I am not smart enough to make my own \ninformed investment decisions. I do not agree. Saving for retirement is \ndifficult enough. Why add more obstacles and complexity? I urge you to \nplease preserve the freedoms investors currently enjoy to choose how we \ninvest in our retirement accounts and plan for a better financial \ntomorrow.''\n\n  This administration, Mr. Speaker, is already costing families jobs, \nconstitutional liberties, affordable quality health care, and a strong \nnational defense. Let's not also take away from them the ability to \nplan for retirement.\n  I remember when, just a little over 27 years ago, my wife and I \nwalked down the aisle and we said, ``I do,'' for better, for worse, for \nricher, for poorer. And, Mr. Speaker, we have been through all of that.\n  But, at times, we had people who came into our lives, investment \nadvice that would help us with her teacher retirement, help us with \nadvice that I didn't have the time or really the understanding to work \non.\n  If we take that away from folks like myself and families in my \ndistrict and families in your district and families all over the \ncountry, then what are we saying to the American people? We are saying: \nthe government knows better than you.\n  I am a firm believer that this government was started and will stand \nboth for the people and of the people, and that is what this Republican \nmajority is doing today. That is why this rule is important, and that \nis why this bill is important.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the 30 \nminutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to thank you, Mr. Speaker. Rather than having a mere Speaker \npro tempore, as I had the opportunity to do as a freshman in the \nmajority, it is always exciting to be presided over by the actual \nSpeaker of the body, the second in line to be President of the United \nStates, and particularly somebody who has dedicated so much of his life \nto public service, Mr. Speaker, as you have, and left his mark on this \ninstitution.\n  I am sure that there will be additional opportunities for showing our \ngreat regard and esteem with which this body holds you, Mr. Speaker. \nBut I think it is somewhat apt that perhaps, if not the final time you \nact as presiding officer of this body, at least the final rule is \nrelated to retirement, which you, Mr. Speaker, will presumably soon be \nexperiencing, and is an important topic of discussion for this body.\n  Now, we may have our disagreements about whether curtailing this rule \nis in the interest of the American people or not, but I know that we \nboth have a deep and abiding interest in making sure that Americans are \nsafe in their retirement. I think it is wonderful that you are \nhighlighting the importance of retirement security by presiding over \nthis particular debate yourself, Mr. Speaker.\n  I rise in opposition to the rule, which is a structured rule for H.R. \n1090. Frankly, it is premature to be considering this bill when we \ndon't know what the final rules will look like out of the Department of \nLabor, rather than allow the Department of Labor to continue doing its \njob, which has included many stakeholders.\n  I know firsthand the Secretary of Labor has not only reached out to \nme and met with me on numerous occasions as well as my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle and has appeared before one of the committees \nof jurisdiction that I serve on, the Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce, of which you, Mr. Speaker, are a prior chair as well, and \nengaged with the financial services community, consumer protection \norganizations, and many others in his very earnest and serious attempt \nat making sure that the many shortcomings of the initial draft rule, \nwhich you and I might agree on, Mr. Speaker, are addressed in the final \nrulemaking. I think the Secretary deserves that opportunity. The \nhardworking men and women of the Department of Labor deserve that \nopportunity.\n  And then, if, in fact, the mark is missed, it might be appropriate \nfor this body to consider amending or changing any rule to address the \nfears that both of us share on both sides of the aisle with regard to \nensuring that people of low and moderate income do have access to high-\nquality advice and that the legitimate educational activities of \nfinancial services organizations are allowed to continue to provide \nthat type of advice.\n  Now, this legislation is somewhat wrapped in a seemingly arcane \nmatter. It has to do with whether it is under the jurisdiction of the \nDepartment of Labor or the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding \nnew fiduciary standards of care.\n  We had the chair of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. Hensarling, \nbefore us in the Rules Committee yesterday. He simply said that, under \nDodd-Frank, the SEC has the ability to pass rules regarding fiduciary \nstandards of care. I don't think anybody disputes that the SEC has the \nlegal authority to do so.\n  I question here--and I think this was well established--that they are \nunlikely, because of their ongoing implementation work in many other \nareas, to get to this any time soon, whereas the Department of Labor is \nnearing the end of a 2-year-long-plus process around trying to make \nsensible rules to ensure that conflicts of interest within retirement \nadvice are offered, consumer protections are provided, and\n\n[[Page H7203]]\n\nthe market is allowed to operate in a more efficient way with regard to \noffering quality retirement products and appropriate retirement \nproducts to consumers.\n  After the Department of Labor retracted the flawed first version of \nthis rule several years ago, they released a new version of the rule in \n2015. They have been getting input from a broad spectrum of \nstakeholders through a long and extended comment period.\n  I have provided feedback. Stakeholders in the retirement community \nhave. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have. We all know \nwhat some of the fundamental issues that we are trying to address are, \nMr. Speaker.\n  Today most Americans are not saving enough for retirement and are not \nsecuring their retirement. The retirement savings gap is estimated at \n$14 trillion, and one in five Americans who are approaching retirement \nhave zero private retirement savings.\n  As the ranking member on the Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions \nSubcommittee of the Education and the Workforce Committee, I am very \ninterested in working in a bipartisan fashion to address this savings \ngap. Helping to make sure that Americans save for retirement is not a \npartisan issue. Whether one is a Democrat or a Republican, eventually, \nyou are going to need to retire, some of us, Mr. Speaker, before \nothers.\n  This bill did not have to be partisan either. I think, if we had \nwaited and targeted any particular flaws in the final rule, there might \nhave been an ability to build a bipartisan consensus. I am optimistic \nthat the Secretary of Labor and the Department of Labor will get their \nrules right.\n  Investors need to be able to trust the person advising them about the \nmoney they need to live after retirement. On the other hand, we need to \nprotect individuals' and small businesses' access to advice.\n  Mistakes in investments cost billions of dollars to individuals and \nthe economy. Of course, a mistake can occur with wrongful advice from \nsomebody who has a conflict of interest, but mistakes can also occur if \nthere is a lack of access to quality advice. We need to be cognizant of \nboth of those potentials as we look at improving the ability of the \nAmerican people to save for their retirement.\n  I know that everybody involved with this rule and many of the \nstakeholders who will be impacted actually agree on a lot of the big \nconcepts. They agree generally that financial advisers should use the \nbest interest or fiduciary standard because the client's best interest \nshould be paramount.\n  The main disagreement is about how to make this happen and how to \nimplement the rule in a way that makes sense. Most advisers today do \nwhat is in the best interest of their client. They are good actors, and \nthey help their clients save for retirement.\n  It is critical that our final rule, as the Secretary himself has \nsaid, does not upend an entire business model that works for good \nactors and works for many American families. However, making sure that \nwe have a standard in place that the few bad actors need to abide by \nand are not able to wreak havoc in allowing American families to plan \nfor their retirement is also essential.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Now, just because there is disagreement on some of the specifics of \nthe rule doesn't mean that we should use a bill that wholesale removes \nthis authority and transfers it entirely to an SEC entity, which is \nunlikely to proceed with rulemaking and can't even proceed with \nrulemaking while this President is in office under a timeline even if \nthey were to begin expeditiously. So, effectively, this underlying \nlegislation is an effort to thwart the ability of this President, this \nSecretary of Labor, and even the SEC under this President, from acting \nin a way to protect the American people from conflicts of interest in \nretirement products that are not suitable for their needs.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1090 would actually prevent the Department of Labor \nfrom issuing any sort of fiduciary rule until after the Securities and \nExchange Commission issued a rule. Now, the Department of Labor clearly \nhas the authority to write and implement this rule. That is not even \nbeing called into question; it is simply the timeline of which agency \ngoes first. But due to the realities of the SEC, the Commission is not \nmoving forward a rule any time in the near future, and that is simple \nreality.\n  So what this bill actually does is it effectively kills the \nDepartment of Labor's ability under President Obama to update the \nfiduciary standard under ERISA. Would it make sense for Congress to \nmandate that the IRS couldn't take action to collect taxes until the \nTreasury acted first? This is a similar situation.\n  I believe the Department of Labor must take into account the high \nnumber of outstanding questions and requests for comments that they \nproposed in the rule, the incredible volume of feedback the rule has \nreceived, including from myself and Members on both sides of the aisle \nand outside stakeholders. To date, there has been a number of letters \nfrom both parties requesting changes to the proposed rule. I signed \nonto a letter with 96 Democrats, and there are over 3,500 public \ncomments, hundreds of thousands of people signing their names to \npetitions. The Department of Labor hopefully will listen to this \nfeedback as they issue their final draft rule to make the effort \nstreamlined while protecting investors and workers.\n  My staff and I have had dozens of meetings and phone calls to the \nDepartment of Labor with Secretary Perez. I have submitted over two \ndozen questions for the record to the Department of Labor on the \nsubject, and I am satisfied and optimistic that these concerns will be \naddressed in the final rule.\n  I am just now leading a letter with several of my colleagues \nrequesting an additional comment period to look at the changes the \nDepartment of Labor is planning to make to the rule. So the answer, I \nthink, Mr. Speaker, is to take the time to get these rules right, make \nsure they don't have unintended consequences, and not prejudge them by \ninvalidating them before they are out of the gate. That is what I \nconsider a constructive way forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have learned from these conversations that we need to \nmove forward with a productive process, and I believe the Labor \nSecretary is committed to doing that. We may have disagreements about \nthe final outcome, but we should see what that final outcome is before \nwe pass legislation that requires us to pretend that the problem \ndoesn't exist.\n  While the specifics of the fiduciary rule are important, and DOL \nneeds to make changes and communicate them to stakeholders, this \nlegislation is very counterproductive to those ongoing discussions that \nhave occurred over the last several years. This bill would effectively \nprevent protections from being implemented after years of work, \nmeetings, and due diligence involving financial services companies and \ninvolving retirement advocacy organizations, not to mention the fact \nthat this bill will not become law. The President has already put out a \npromise to veto the legislation should it reach his desk. So, instead, \nwe should be spending our time on more important work for the American \npeople. With just over a month to take action until a government \nshutdown and with the transportation bill expiring, we have six \ncongressional working days to raise a clean debt ceiling. I am hopeful, \nMr. Speaker, that you will be able to bear witness to that as a Member \nand leader of this body in the short future, in the next couple of \ndays. Just as astonishing, we have the highway funding shutdown.\n  So here we are again. I think that we need to work on bills that have \na chance of becoming law. We shouldn't prejudge rules that I think the \nSecretary has really worked hard to ensure involve multiple \nstakeholders, and hopefully, we will be satisfied with the final rules \nthat address many of the potential unintended consequences and concerns \nthat my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have raised, including \nmyself.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the comments \njust made, but I think there is a general disagreement, and we will \nhave a disagreement in just a few moments about article I and what we \nare supposed to be doing here and taking care of the American people.\n\n[[Page H7204]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman \nfrom North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Georgia for \nyielding. In the spirit of bipartisanship, let me associate myself with \nthe opening remarks and kind words of Mr. Polis about the Speaker.\n  Mr. Speaker, if adopted, the proposed fiduciary rule would reduce \naccess to reasonably priced investment options for lower and middle \nclass families and small-business owners across the country. It will \nalso increase costs for Americans trying their best to save for \nretirement.\n  Our country faces difficult retirement challenges, and the last thing \nthe Federal Government should do is create new barriers blocking the \nretirement security the American people deserve. The fact is we have \nseen this scheme before. This proposal contains many of the same flaws \nas the administration's failed 2010 proposal, which was ultimately \nwithdrawn because of harsh bipartisan opposition.\n  The Department of Labor's rushed and uncoordinated process has again \nresulted in an unworkable proposal, and I urge the administration to \nuse the same logic that it did the first time and withdraw its damaged \nproposal.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, many American workers don't have access to \npaid sick days, which means they can't miss work without losing a day's \npay or risking their job security. If we defeat the previous question, \nI will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up legislation that \nwould allow workers to earn paid sick leave.\n  Mr. Speaker, everyone should be able to take care of themselves or \ntheir loved ones when they are sick and not have to worry about losing \ntheir jobs or falling behind on their bills because of illness.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from \nColorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. To discuss our proposal, I yield such time as she may \nconsume to the distinguished gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. \nDeLauro).\n\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the previous \nquestion. Defeating the previous question will allow us to amend the \nrule to provide for consideration of the Healthy Families Act. What is \nthe Healthy Families Act? It is an act that would allow workers to earn \nup to 7 days of job-protected sick leave each year.\n  Mr. Speaker, being a working parent should not mean choosing between \nyour job and taking care of yourself and your family. But at least 43 \nmillion private sector workers--39 percent of our workforce--must make \nthis decision every time illness strikes. Millions more cannot earn \npaid sick time to care for a sick child or for a family member.\n  Employers ultimately suffer when workers have to make this choice. \nIncreased turnover rates amount to greater costs, and employers can \njeopardize the health of other employees when their policies force \nemployees to come to work sick.\n  With regard to families, I listen to people--as we all do in our \ncommunities--all of the time. I can talk to you about Eva, the bus \ndriver who picks up kids in the morning on their way to school. They \nare there with their parents, and she says that I see parents with \ntears in their eyes as they are putting their child on the bus, knowing \nthat their child is sick, but they can't afford to stay home with that \nchild because they could lose their job. They could get pay docked. \nThey are making a choice, and that is not how they view themselves as a \nparent.\n  Paid sick day policies have been enacted successfully at the State \nand at the local levels. Nearly 20 jurisdictions across the country \nhave adopted paid sick days, and there is strong public support for \nuniversal access to paid sick days. Eighty-eight percent of Americans \nsupport paid sick day legislation.\n  The Healthy Families Act allows working families to meet their health \nand their financial needs while boosting businesses' productivity and \nretention rates--strengthening our Nation's economy. It is common \nsense. It is business savvy. This is the right thing to do.\n  Today there isn't a parent staying home with their children. Mothers, \nfathers, grandmothers, aunts, and uncles, everyone is in the workplace. \nLet our public policy reflect the way that families are trying to make \nit today. We need to work to protect public health, to boost the \neconomy, and to help hardworking families have access to paid sick \ndays.\n  Let's pass the Healthy Families Act, and I urge my colleagues to \noppose the previous question.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Crenshaw).\n  Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying \nlegislation. I am the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nFinancial Services and General Government. My subcommittee is charged \nwith overseeing the budget of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  That is the agency of the Federal Government that is charged with \nprotecting investors and making sure that the capital markets are fair \nand orderly, and that is what they do every day. In fact, Dodd-Frank \ngives them more authority in this area than any other agency in the \nFederal Government, so I find it a little bit surprising that the \nDepartment of Labor, whose day-to-day job is not to oversee investment \nadvisers, whose day-to-day job is not to oversee broker-dealers, and \nyet they will decide that they are going to write a rule dealing with \nfiduciary standards for those that are involved in retirement accounts. \nWell, it just seems to me that is backwards. That is upside down.\n  The SEC ought to be acting in this area. That is their primary role. \nIf we are going to let other agencies write rules that might be in \nconflict, might create confusion, and might be duplicative, then it \nseems to me we are going to give those individuals who are struggling \nto make a living and to make ends meet, we are going to have a \ndifficult time understanding what their retirement accounts are all \nabout and who is in charge and what are the rules and the standards.\n  So the SEC should act first, and that is all this bill does. It says \nthe SEC should act first in dealing with investor security to make sure \nthat capital markets are fair and orderly and that the Department of \nLabor is prohibited from finalizing any rule in this regard.\n  So I think it is a commonsense piece of legislation. I thank the \nsponsors for bringing it, and the committee for bringing it up, and so \nI urge adoption of this rule and adoption of the underlying legislation \nas well.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, even if my friends on the other side of the aisle think \nthey might not like this final rule, let's at least give the Department \nof Labor, after several years of hard work, the chance to produce it. \nIf at that point the majority feels that there are parts of the rule \nthat they don't want or don't like or want to invalidate or are \ncounterproductive, that would be the appropriate time for this kind of \nbill to intervene in those efforts before those rules are finalized.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have been very satisfied with the work of the \nDepartment of Labor and the Secretary of Labor to engage Members of \nthis body on both sides of the aisle and the financial services \ncommunity to ensure that many of the acknowledged flaws that are in the \ndraft bill are addressed in any final rule that is brought forward.\n  This bill is effectively an effort to thwart the entire process \naround addressing a real problem, and that real problem is the conflict \nof interest and poor quality retirement advice that is being given to \ntoo many American families.\n  The Secretary is not seeking to upend a business structure that \nallows access to quality financial advice for millions of middle class \nAmerican families, and I believe that any concerns with regard to that \nwill be addressed in the final rulemaking.\n  With little time left before so many deadlines and cliffs that this \nbody has--transportation funding expiring, the Federal budget expiring \nwithout a\n\n[[Page H7205]]\n\npotential government shutdown, the debt ceiling, and so many others--\nwhy are we discussing a bill that is not going to become law? Again, \nyou are seeking to overturn a ruling before it is made. The President \nhimself would veto this bill. There will not be two-thirds of this body \nto overturn this veto.\n  When we are discussing taking actions that affect actions that the \nPresident is taking, keep in mind that under our constitutional \nrepublic, if we were to override the President, it would take both \nDemocrats and Republicans, and Democrats in large numbers. Now, I \nunderstand there may be a few handful of my Democratic colleagues \nsupporting this final bill, not very many, certainly not enough to \nbring it close to the two-thirds threshold. So, again, that would \nqualify as a waste of time for this body, and a premature waste of time \nat that.\n  Let's give the Department of Labor the ability and the benefit of the \ndoubt to bring forward these rules, and then perhaps if they overstep \nand have a lot of flaws, then, Mr. Speaker, the Republicans might have \nmore Democrats willing to join them in counteracting these rules. But \nat this point, it is entirely premature to interdict the entire \nrulemaking process to protect American retirement without even knowing \nwhat those rules are that we are seeking to circumvent.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I think it is a fundamental difference, again, in the way we choose \nto look at how we do our business up here. There is a constitutional \nflow to this. It is called Article I. It is our responsibility as \nelected Representatives, both from Georgia, from Colorado, from all \nover this country, it is our responsibility to look at this.\n  I think one of the things that frustrates me, and I know it \nfrustrates many of my constituents back home, is that it seems like \nevery time--as my friend has said--that we are preempting or putting \ndown all this hard work done by the agencies, well, everything that is \npointed to so far, it is not our job as Congress to worry about the \nwork product of an agency. Our job is to take care of the American \npeople and make sure that their interests are best concerned. My first \ninterest is the folks of the Ninth District of Georgia. My first \ninterest is not, did the office or agency of an administration of any, \nRepublican or Democrat, did they work real hard on it? I appreciate \ntheir work.\n  But the problem we are coming back to here is we are facing a real \nissue. We are simply saying the SEC needs to go first. We are simply \nsaying let's put these priorities in line, and let's simply say that we \nlook at this. It is not the executive body's determination to make the \nlaw, so to speak. It is our body. So if we choose to intervene here, \nthen it is our prerogative to do so, taking care of what we are doing.\n  I think also to simply say--and I love this argument--that if the \nPresident is not going to sign and we don't have enough to override, \nthen fine, let's make that argument to the American people. And if the \nadministration chooses to do this and chooses not to, then let them \ntell the American people and the teachers in my district and the law \nenforcement officers in my district and people who need this advice and \nlooking at the history and say: We don't care about you, let our \nbureaucracy work, let bureaucracy ring instead of freedom ring.\n  If that is what the President and the administration wants to do, \nthen so be it. I will stand on the side of the American people. I will \nstand on the side of the middle class. I will stand on them being able \nto take what they have and get advice so they can make it better. If \nthat is the argument they want to be had, let's have it.\n  Mr. Speaker, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I think that the remarks by my colleague on the Rules Committee are \npart of the problem here. The way that laws are passed require the \nHouse and the Senate to pass a bill in the same form and the President \nto sign that bill, or if the President vetoes that bill, two-thirds of \nthe body to overrule it.\n  And, of course, no one doubts that if this body of the House wants, \nthey can continue to pass bills that the Senate won't bring up, as they \nhave dozens, I would have to get a count, perhaps, hundreds of times, \nor bills that the Senate will pass but the President will veto, and the \nPresident vetoed, I believe, his fifth bill with the defense \nreauthorization last week.\n  Certainly, if the majority chooses, if the Republicans choose, this \nbody can continue to do that, or this body can work together with the \nSenate and the President to pass laws that address issues that the \nAmerican people have brought to us to solve, and that takes compromise. \nThat doesn't mean this body should say, ``It is our way or the \nhighway,'' and the Senate says, ``Sorry, it is the highway,'' and the \nPresident says, ``Sorry, it is the highway.'' It means, roll up your \nsleeves and work together.\n  If we are going to solve a problem like immigration in this country, \nour broken immigration system, and replace our broken immigration \nsystem with one that works, that restores border security, the rule of \nlaw, benefits our economy, and unites families, it will take all sides \nworking together. Guess what? Last session, the Senate passed a bill. \nIt was this House that didn't spend even a minute of time on the floor \ndebating that bill or bringing forward something that the American \npeople demand to replace our broken immigration system with one that \nworks and protects our country.\n  So, again, I don't doubt the ability of this body to keep passing \nbills that don't go anywhere. Perhaps, it makes some of my Republican \ncolleagues feel good. They go home, and they say: Gee, we passed this \nout of the House. We passed that out of the House. The problem is the \nSenate. The problem is the President.\n  But that is just an excuse for blame and more and more problems. I \nthink what the American people want is not this finger pointing. They \ndon't want the Senate to say: We solved immigration; it was the House's \nfault. They don't want the House to say: We defunded ObamaCare; it is \nthe Senate and President's fault they didn't do it.\n  They want us to work together, work together to implement the \nAffordable Care Act and address some of the problems in it, work \ntogether to replace our broken immigration system with one that works, \none to work together to cut our budget deficit, one to work together to \nfund an infrastructure and transportation bill, and--this is an \nexample--if there are deficiencies in the final rule, work together to \nmake sure that those deficiencies are addressed so that our common goal \nthe Democrats and Republicans share of making sure that Americans have \nquality, nonconflicted advice in their retirement savings is able to \noccur across the country.\n  I call on Speaker Boehner and, of course, whoever succeeds him as \nSpeaker, as well as the rest of the House leadership, to present truly \nbipartisan efforts to move forward on the various issues that we face \nand not yield to the easy temptation to pass single-Chamber bills in \nthe House that aren't even brought up by the Senate and, if they were, \nit would be vetoed by the President. That is not how laws are made. \nThat is how rhetoric is made. The American people want their problems \naddressed by this body, not just more hot wind and rhetoric that this \nbill is an example of.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I appreciate that because there are many people in America right now \nwho remember just a few years ago when there was plenty of hot rhetoric \ncoming from this Chamber, and it is really punishing the American \npeople now. It is called ObamaCare. It is called Dodd-Frank. I guess \nthe warm winds are still blowing.\n  It is amazing to me that when you look at this--and I can go back in \nhistory--and I think the one thing that we maybe can come to an \nagreement on is when you govern and when you are in the majority, you \npass bills that reflect your majority values. You do not reflect, in \nthis case, an administration that happens to have different values. We \nare continuing to work for the\n\n[[Page H7206]]\n\nAmerican people, just as my friend when he was in the majority--as he \nsaid, he sat in the chair as a freshman--they would have passed bills \nthat, oh, by the way, probably wouldn't have made it through that \nRepublican administration. Some got vetoed. And if it did get vetoed, \nyou would come back and work the process of an override, and that can \nhappen.\n\n  The problem here is I believe--and this is just fundamental--I \nbelieve that we can work on different ideas. There are things that the \ngentleman from Colorado and I can agree on or disagree on. I think it \ngoes back just basically to the problem that many of us are frustrated \nwith, is that there are three branches of government that the Congress, \nthe House and the Senate, whether we agree on everything or not, is not \nthe point. The point is, are we making the voices heard from our \ndistricts and doing so in a meaningful way?\n  If that means that Republicans feel one way and Democrats feel \nanother way, that so be it. But I, as long as I am part of the \nmajority, we are going to put our values forward, and we are going to \nsay: This is what we believe in. We would like for you to come on. And \nwe will find areas where we can agree.\n  But I will never stand by just because the administration, as they \ndid just this past week with the NDAA, put politics over our troops. As \nsomeone who served in Iraq, it is time to quit playing politics with \nour troops.\n  If we want to get specific about what we are playing politics with \nhere, then we can understand that. That is a disgrace. And what we have \ngot to understand is--we are going to put stuff here--we are simply \nsaying: Here is a fix that we believe; let the SEC work first.\n  That is our policy statement. If they don't agree, fine. But when it \nis fighting for the people of the Ninth District of Georgia and also \npeople for America and middle class and lower income folks who are just \ntrying to make their retirement and get good advice, I will never back \nup or apologize for taking the time to fight for the American people. \nIf that is a waste of time, I will be up here every day taking that \ntime for the American people.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  This is a very interesting discussion with my colleague from Georgia. \nWhen you look at the work product of this body in the House of \nRepresentatives, this body has voted to repeal ObamaCare, the \nAffordable Care Act, over 54 times. So it is clear to the American \npeople--my colleague from Georgia can tell his constituents--we voted \nto repeal ObamaCare. We did. I didn't vote for that, but the majority \nof this body did that--not once, not twice, not three times, not four \ntimes, not five times. I can count all the way up to over 54 times. In \nfact, many of us are losing track about how many times this body is on \nthe Record opposing ObamaCare, but that is not how laws are made. That \nis part of the process. One would say once should suffice for it to \npass this body.\n  The bill also would need to pass the Senate. And as the President has \nindicated, it is unlikely that something called by many people \nObamaCare would be repealed by a President named Barack Obama. He, of \ncourse, would veto any legislation that ended the Affordable Care Act, \nhis signature health care policy that he passed in his first term in \noffice.\n  So, again, it looks at what we do with this body. When one wonders \nwhy the approval ratings of the House of Representatives are as low and \ncontinuing to plummet as they are, I think it is because rather than \naddress the concerns of the American people around making health care \nwork and more affordable and passing constructive laws through the \nsystem that address some of the shortcomings in ObamaCare, whether it \nis addressing some of the shortcomings in Dodd-Frank, rather than \ntaking that path, this body instead is passing single-Chamber bills, \nlike we are here today, with regard to undermining a rule that we \nhaven't even seen yet because some people think it might be \ncounterproductive or bad. If it is, let's have that discussion.\n  But, again, as a Member of this body, I have been happy so far with \nthe efforts of the Secretary of Labor to engage with the stakeholder \ngroups and Members of this body to get this rule right. I honestly \nbelieve that the only reason this legislation was brought to the floor \nis it is hard for the Republican caucus to agree on much else. It is \nhard for them to agree on something that might be a governing effort to \npass. So, instead, we are dealing with single-Chamber bills. On weeks \nthat we could be dealing with funding transportation or infrastructure \nor cutting our deficit or going after government waste and fraud, we \nare instead repealing ObamaCare again and again and again or repealing \na rule that we haven't even seen because people think they might not \nlike it if they do.\n  Look, we have a choice in this body. The Republicans in the majority \ncan either sit back and bring partisan legislation to the floor each \nweek and watch costs of the American people go up and watch problems go \nunsolved, or we can come to the table and start a serious discussion \nwith the House and the Senate, with the President, with Members of this \nbody on both sides of the aisle, about important things that actually \nmove our country forward, grow our economy, promote our national \nsecurity, reduce our deficit, including the basics of keeping our \ngovernment open and paying our bills on time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the \nprevious question. I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I want to just finalize some time here and just really look at this \nbecause what is really interesting in the last few minutes is many \ntimes in this--and I appreciate my colleague from Colorado--this is, \nfrankly, why I believe most of us came into public service, is to have \nhonest debate, go back and forth. But I will have to say as I close \nhere, I do want to make it back to what this bill does and what this \nrule is that you are going to be voting on. It just says: Let the SEC \ngo first.\n  Now, I know that is hard to understand. And if you are watching this, \nyou might have a hard time understanding because my friend just said \nthat we won't wait on a rule and then that we are repealing a rule. So \nI am not sure how you can repeal a rule that you have not waited on, \nand if the rule is not there, you are repealing. No, we are simply \nsaying: Let the SEC go first. So you can't repeal something that your \nown statement said you are waiting on.\n  And, also, by the way, a Dear Colleague letter that says that we know \nfrom many, many of my Democrat friends across the aisle are sending \naround saying: DOL, we have got a lot of concerns about this; we want \nto make sure you do it right. I think this is a good way to do it, and \nit is called being part of a bipartisan solution here on the floor, and \nlet's put it back right and let it go that way instead of sending a \nletter to DOL and letting them make sure they get it right because they \nacknowledge that there are real concerns about the workability of this \nrule in progress, and this is right now being circulated.\n  I think I just want to say I support this bill, H.R. 1090, because I \nbelieve that men and women should have the ability to choose their type \nof financial professional who best meets their investment needs. This \nisn't about protecting investors. It is about the administration once \nagain telling families that they know what is best for them. They have \ntold families that they know better when it comes to health care. They \nhave told families they know better when it comes to education. They \nhave told families they know better when it comes how and where to \nspend their money, and the results have been devastating.\n\n  H.R. 1090 isn't going to undo all the devastating impacts of this \none-size-fits-all regulatory approach, but it will prevent from taking \naway the ability of families to plan their financial future. This bill \npassed with bipartisan support last Congress, and on behalf of my \nconstituents, I deeply hope it does so again.\n  Again, it is about who you fight for. It is a consistency. I will \nconsistently stand here and say what is best for those hard-working, \nmiddle class,\n\n[[Page H7207]]\n\nlower income class, and anybody else who earns as much as they want to \nto have the access to get the financial planning they need in the way \nthat is best for them without the interference of a bureaucratic \norganization that has taken so long and already shows results from \nother places that are devastating. We are not going to do that. We are \ngoing to put this forward and let's see who we are really standing with \nand who we are really standing for.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n      An Amendment to H. Res. 491 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     932) to allow Americans to earn paid sick time so that they \n     can address their own health needs and the health needs of \n     their families. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on Education and the Workforce, the chair and \n     ranking minority member of the Committee on House \n     Administration, and the chair and ranking minority member of \n     the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. After \n     general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment \n     under the five-minute rule. All points of order against \n     provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of \n     consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall \n     rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as \n     may have been adopted. The previous question shall be \n     considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to \n     final passage without intervening motion except one motion to \n     recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of \n     the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution \n     on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House \n     shall, immediately after the third daily order of business \n     under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the \n     Whole for further consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 932.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime, and I move the previous question on the resolution.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Carter of Georgia). The question is on \nordering the previous question.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include extraneous materials on H.R. 3819.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3819, which extends Federal surface \ntransportation programs through November 20, 2015.\n  This bill allows States to continue to fund transportation projects, \nand it prevents 4,100 U.S. Department of Transportation employees from \nbeing furloughed. H.R. 3819 funds these programs at the authorized \nlevels for fiscal year 2014. No offsets or transfers of funding to the \nhighway trust fund are necessary for this extension since the trust \nfund will remain solvent during this period.\n  Last week, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure \nunanimously approved a bipartisan, multiyear surface transportation \nreauthorization bill. This extension will enable the House to continue \nits work on this important legislation. H.R. 3819 also includes \ncritical language extending the deadline for railroads to implement \npositive train control technology to 2018.\n  We have known for some time that railroads simply cannot meet the \ncongressionally mandated positive train control, or PTC, deadline of \nDecember 31, 2015. What has become more apparent is how catastrophic it \nwould be for the Nation's economy if we don't extend the deadline now.\n  Without an extension, railroads will stop shipping important \nchemicals critical to manufacturing, agriculture, clean drinking water, \nand other industrial activities. In fact, some railroads are already \nnotifying shippers they will stop accepting chemical shipments by \nDecember 1. This is creating extreme uncertainty across a variety of \ngroups that rely on rail shipments, from farmers who need ammonia for \nfertilizer, to water utilities that need chlorine to purify drinking \nwater.\n  Some industrial companies have already begun the planning process for \nshutting down plants because they cannot operate without chemicals \ndelivered by rail. We have heard from one\n\n[[Page H7212]]\n\nchemical company in New Hampshire that said its railroad will stop \npicking up chlorine on November 13.\n  This company is the only supplier of chlorine to the entire six-State \nNew England region for drinking water and wastewater treatment. \nTherefore, after November 13, New England could very well be without \nchlorine to clean its water.\n  On a broader scale, a PTC-related rail shutdown would pull $30 \nbillion out of the economy in one quarter alone and lead to 700,000 \njobs lost in just one month. It is our responsibility to extend this \ndeadline now and avoid such harm to the Nation's economy.\n  This language is based on bipartisan, bicameral work over the last \nseveral weeks, and it would ensure that railroads implement positive \ntrain control as quickly as possible.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3819.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  On July 1, when we last visited the issue of a short-term extension \nfor surface transportation, I bemoaned the fact that little progress \nhad been made on a long-term, 6-year bill. I am pleased today that I \ndon't have to use the same talking points.\n  We did, through the actual legislative process--with lengthy \nnegotiations leading up to it--pass out of committee a 6-year bill, \nwhich relates to policies that would underlie a 6-year investment in \nour crumbling infrastructure. That is the good news.\n  It was ultimately a bipartisan effort in the tradition of the \ncommittee. There is not too much to make partisan about moving goods \nand people from here to there efficiently except for those who are \nopposed to the Federal Government being involved and, who, luckily, \ndon't represent a majority on our committee. So that is the good news.\n  The bad news is we still do not have the funding mechanism before us, \nso we have to do another short-term extension. Also, the currently \nstated objective for funding is totally inadequate. I mean, America is \nfalling apart. It is embarrassing, actually.\n  These States, including many all-red Republican States--14 States--\nhave voted to raise gas taxes since 2013 to invest in maintaining or in \nrebuilding their infrastructure or in building out new transportation \noptions to get their citizens and goods out of congestion--14 States. \nSince 2008, nearly half of the States have taken action to raise more \nfunds.\n  The Federal Government last raised the gas tax in 1993, and we are \ntold any increase in user fees--gas tax, barrel tax, indexation of the \ngas tax, vehicle miles traveled--is all off the table. We cannot ask \nthose who use the system to pay user fees to improve the system that \nthey use on a daily basis. I think the American people are more \nrealistic than that.\n  Luckily, this bill contains a provision that, should this Congress or \na future, more enlightened Congress decide to allocate additional \nfunds, those funds will flow through under the policies set out in this \nbill and the formulas set out in this bill without any further action \nby Congress, as it is really a good idea to avoid coming to Congress \nfor anything whenever you can. So that is, I think, a very important \nprovision of the bill.\n  There is an AP story today that kind of goes to the heart of this, \nand it talks about the fact that, in many States, they are abandoning \nroads and bridges. We are not just talking about the rural heartland \nanymore. This has been somewhat commonplace in the rural heartland, \nwhere they have been saying, ``We can't afford to pave these roads \nanymore. We are going back to gravel.'' We are talking about King \nCounty in Washington State. We are talking about the counties and State \nareas surrounding Des Moines, Iowa.\n  We are talking about major urban areas and the fact that, since the \nFederal Government has failed to invest and to live up to its \npartnership for major, critical urban area projects or major projects \nfor our ports or other choke points on the system, States have had to \nconcentrate resources there.\n  They have tried to raise more money, again, with no help from the \nFederal Government. Now they are having to abandon the 20th-century \ntransportation system. I mean, that is pretty darned pathetic, that we \nare not holding up our end of that bargain and making any effort to do \nthat. So that is the bad news part.\n  As the chairman mentioned, this bill also includes critical \nprovisions to extend positive train control deadlines. With the \nexception of some portion of Amtrak, nobody will be able to meet the \ndeadline of January 1, which does mean an extraordinary disruption of \nthe movement of freight and commuter and passenger rail across the \nUnited States.\n\n  We have worked very hard with the Senate in negotiations, and we have \na bicameral agreement on the extension. It is tough. It says we are not \ngoing to get to this point again. It is not going to be kick the can, \nkick the can, kick the can.\n  It says that all of the entities that are required to put in place \npositive train control will put forward a plan for approval with \nmeasurable benchmarks over this 3-year period, and they will be tracked \nas to meeting those benchmarks during that 3-year period.\n  So it won't be that, suddenly, we get to the end of 3 years and we \nhear from a majority of freight and/or passenger-commuter railroads, \nsaying, ``Gee, we just can't make it.''\n  We will know where we are headed and will be able to target our \nefforts on those who are lagging behind. At the end of that, yes, it \nwill be possible to get another extension, but they all will have had \nto have installed the equipment.\n  The reality is that this is an expensive and complicated process, and \nputting in the equipment is, obviously, the first critical part and \nturning it on, but then it can take up to 2 years to get it certified \nas operational. So we are acceding to that reality in this legislation \nby saying: 3 years and measurable goals to get to the 3 years. \nEverybody is up with installation, and, hopefully, most will be \noperational at that point.\n  Some may not be due to circumstances beyond their control, even \nthough they have made the necessary investments, and under negotiations \nwith the Secretary of Transportation, they could get further \nextensions. So that is a very time-sensitive portion of this bill.\n  I have had many colleagues on my side saying, ``I am really tired of \nthese short-term extensions. I really don't want to vote for another \none.''\n  I have said that this is different. We have the policy in place--we \ndon't have the funding yet--and we have got this very critical element \nof positive train control.\n  I am urging Members on my side of the aisle to support this proposal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Denham), the subcommittee chairman on \nRailroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials.\n  Mr. DENHAM. I thank Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member DeFazio, and \nRanking Member Capuano for working with us to develop this important \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation would ensure that railroads actually \nimplement positive train control. We need to do it as quickly as \npossible and as safely as possible for the safety of our country.\n  As chairman of the Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials \nSubcommittee, we have been monitoring the railroads' progress in \nimplementing PTC, positive train control, including holding a hearing \nin June that brought stakeholders in from across the country so as to \nunderstand exactly what the impacts are.\n  We have known for some time that most railroads simply won't be done \nwith positive train control implementation by the end of this year. \nNow, several different things went into the delays of this, one of \nwhich is the FCC, where you have two government agencies not working \ntogether to get the tens of thousands of poles permitted so that they \ncould actually have the communication interface.\n  PTC is a huge undertaking, requiring 38,000 wayside interfaces be \ninstalled along 60,000 miles of track. In addition, 18,000 locomotives \nneed to be upgraded and 12,000 signals need to be replaced. All of \nthese elements need to be seamlessly communicated across different \nrailroads.\n\n[[Page H7213]]\n\n  But what is important here is that we actually have benchmarks in \nplace on implementation, that we have reporting on the progress and \nenforcement of the metrics throughout the entire extension. We need to \nmake sure that this gets done right and that it gets done quickly.\n  Given this obvious need for an extension, a few weeks ago, Chairman \nShuster and I, with Ranking Members DeFazio and Capuano, introduced a \n3-year PTC extension. This bipartisan piece of legislation has garnered \nover 130 coauthors. Additionally, more than 200 stakeholders have \nsigned letters to the Transportation Committee who support a PTC \nextension.\n  Just to give you a few examples from California:\n  If we don't extend the PTC deadline, the Altamont Corridor Express \ncommuter rail service will shut down, putting more commuters on \nCalifornia's congested highways.\n  In the Central Valley, farmers will be negatively impacted, as \nfarmers rely on rail for their fertilizers and our dairies and our \ncattle yards depend on feed that only comes in on rail. That is why the \nCalifornia Farm Bureau Federation and the California League of Wheat \nGrowers are supporting a PTC extension deadline.\n  Those are just a few examples of broad and wide agreement among \nrailroads, shippers, and consumers that Congress should pass this \nlegislation.\n  In conclusion, we have worked in a bipartisan manner with our Senate \ncounterparts to develop this legislation, and I believe this bill will \nensure that PTC gets done as soon as possible and as safely as \npossible.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nthe District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), the ranking Democrat.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Shuster and Chairman Graves \nas well as Ranking Member DeFazio for working with me and for all of us \nbeing able to work together on what will be, when it gets to the floor \nin November, I believe, the first 6-year or long-term transportation \nbill in 10 years. That is why it is possible not to fret that we are \nnow going through another extension.\n  As a matter of fact, the States have the funds until January. These \nshort-term extensions have compelled the States to stash their money \nwithout spending all of it because what they need to get to are long-\nterm projects or at least projects that take more than a few months or \na year or two, so we are making progress. When we authorize a 6-year \nbill, there will be a real burden on us to make sure that, in fact, it \nis 6 years.\n  I would advise my colleagues to support this last short-term \nextension. It is bipartisan. It is both Chambers. It avoids furloughs.\n  There is a bill waiting off stage. However, there is a funding \nmystery. I don't like mysteries, particularly with long-term bills. But \nI have to believe that the appropriate committee is meeting every day--\nit must be in secret--in order to fund this bill.\n  At least we have done our work, and we have done it in a bipartisan \nway. I won't trouble with the entire bill. There will be time to get to \nthat.\n  I will say, on positive train control, that I regret there had to be \na 3-year extension. I do think that puts at jeopardy those that have to \nbe in these trains--employees and passengers. As I looked at what it \ntook to do positive train control, I don't think we had any \nalternative. So that gives people 3 years.\n  With the benchmarks, I hope that we will get most of this done way \nbefore 2018. I don't like permitting individual waivers because, after \nall, there have been at least 2 years spent trying to do something \nabout positive train control, and the jeopardy is clear when we see \nwhat has happened already with respect to terrible crashes that have \ntaken human life.\n  Finally, I just want to say that perhaps the greatest challenge we \nhave is a challenge that we must meet.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Simpson). The time of the gentlewoman \nhas expired.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, and that is a new way to fund the highway \ntrust fund. There is in the final bill some experimentation that I \nregard as urgent.\n  I thank my good friends on both sides of the aisle for this short-\nterm extension, which I hope will be the last in a very long time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Newhouse).\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support this legislation.\n  I first want to thank Chairman Shuster as well as Ranking Member \nDeFazio for their hard work in marking up a meaningful, long-term \ntransportation bill. It truly is something our country has eagerly \nanticipated, and we appreciate both you and your staff's hard work for \ngiving our country the certainty that is needed on road and rail \nprojects.\n  I also want to say I appreciate you including a deadline extension \nfor the full implementation of positive train control safety \ntechnology. While this technology is vitally important for safety and \nmany reasons, it has become increasingly clear that our Nation's \npassenger and freight railroads are unable to meet the current \ndeadline.\n  As a farmer, I can tell you the resulting shutdown our country's \nfreight network could experience if this deadline is not extended would \nhave devastating consequences for both our farms and our entire \nNation's economy. I appreciate your swift attention to this issue.\n  I urge all of my colleagues' support.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I just want to say my heartfelt thanks to the leaders of the \nDemocrats on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Mr. \nDeFazio and Ms. Norton, for getting this extension until November 20. \nIt doesn't give us much time, but we need to get down to work, get this \npassed next week, get it into conference, and work to get this on the \nfloor as soon as possible.\n  I also thank them for a sound extension to PTC, which is absolutely \nvital to the Nation's economy to get this thing extended so we continue \nrail shipments and to make sure that we have got something in place \nthat gets this important technology deployed in a reasonable way, a \nresponsible way to make sure that our rail system continues to be even \nsafer than it is today. It is a very, very safe system today.\n  So I urge all my colleagues to support this.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for \nthis extension and I truly hope this is the last one we need to pass \nfor a very long time. This extension also addresses an emergency \ninvolving Positive Train Control (PTC).\n  Positive Train Control (PTC) is a critical system and it's very \nimportant that we address this issue in a rational manner. We need to \nimplement positive train control as soon as humanly possible, but we \nneed to get it done right. I don't want to see a situation where the \nfederal government is fining railroads on a daily basis or picking \nwinners and losers, because I don't think that is good for anyone. Our \nrailroads are a critical part of our nation's economy and I'd much \nrather have them spending their money on implementing PTC and improving \nand expanding their infrastructure.\n  I believe wholeheartedly that reauthorizing a surface transportation \nbill will give the economy just the type of boost it needs. A long term \ntransportation bill will strengthen our infrastructure, provides \nquality jobs, and serves as a tool to put America back on a path toward \nlong-term economic growth.\n  Last week the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee passed a \nfair bill that moves us closer to sending a long term bill for \nPresident Obama to sign in to law.\n  This important legislation included a critical freight grant program, \nadditional programs and funding for transit systems and their \noperators, continues the Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP) and \ncreates a new non-motorized safety grant program, includes a much \nneeded extension of Positive Train Control (PTC) implementation, \nincreased funding for Grade Crossings, Requires more information on \nHazardous Trains to State Emergency Response Commissions, incentivizes \nstates to combat racial profiling, and extends the Disadvantaged \nBusiness Enterprise (DBE) Program.\n  Unfortunately, without critically needed additional funds, we're \nrobbing Peter to pay Paul and forcing our states and local \ntransportation agencies to pay more for New Starts and other programs \nwhile limiting their flexibility to use these funds. And we're missing \nout on an opportunity to ensure our infrastructure is meeting the needs \nof the disadvantaged and\n\n[[Page H7214]]\n\nworking class to ensure they have fair access to employment and \neconomic centers.\n  We absolutely need to do more to protect pedestrians and bike riders \nfrom harm. According to the May 2014 Pedestrian Danger Index (PDI), \nOrlando is ranked as the most dangerous place for pedestrians, with \nJacksonville and Tampa also included in the top five most dangerous \ncities. This bill spends more time protecting corporations from \nliability than it does protecting the traveling public. Moreover, we \nneed to ensure that all sizes and modes of transportation are treated \nequally in the freight grant program and should remove any caps on \nfunding for these entities.\n  Again, I encourage my colleagues to support this extension and \nsupport bringing a long term transportation bill to the House floor as \nsoon as possible.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, I rise to speak on H.R. 3819, ``Surface \nTransportation Extension Act of 2015,'' which reauthorizes federal-aid \nhighway and transit programs for three weeks through November 20, 2015.\n  The bill also extends by three years the December 31, 2015 deadline \nfor railroads to install positive train control systems but, within 90 \ndays of enactment, all affected railroads must submit to the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation a revised PTC compliance plan.\n  Mr. Speaker, instead of this 22-day temporary extension, I would have \nstrongly preferred that we were debating a comprehensive, fair, \nequitable, and long-term transportation reauthorization bill the nation \ndesperately needs.\n  We have had two years to do so.\n  Democrats want such a bill as does the President, but apparently our \nfriends across the aisle do not since they have spent the last two \nyears wasting time on advocating policies wanted by no one except for \nthe right-wing extremists of the Tea Party.\n  But I reluctantly support this emergency but temporary measure \nbecause as the Department of Transportation has reported, if we do not \nact now highway trust fund balances will reach dangerously low levels \nby November 20 and result in a reduction of payments to states by an \naverage of 28 percent.\n  Many states have already begun to cancel or delay planned \nconstruction projects, threatening 700,000 jobs, including 106,100 jobs \nin my home state of Texas.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Highway Trust Fund was created in 1956 during the \nEisenhower Administration to help finance construction of the \nInterstate Highway System, which modernized the nation's transportation \ninfrastructure and was instrumental in making the United States the \nworld's dominant economic power for two generations.\n  Our national leaders then understood that investing in our roads and \nbridges strengthened our economy, created millions of good-paying jobs, \nand improved the quality of life for all Americans.\n  It is currently composed of two accounts that fund federal-aid \nhighway and transit projects built by states. Federal funding from the \ntrust fund accounts for a major portion of state transportation \nspending.\n  The Highway Trust Fund is financed by gasoline and diesel taxes, \nwhich until the last decade produced a steady increase in revenues \nsufficient to accommodate increased levels of spending on highway and \ntransit projects.\n  However, those tax rates--18.4 cents/gallon federal tax on gasoline \nand a 24.4 cents/gallon tax on diesel fuel--have remained unchanged \nsince 1993 and were not indexed to inflation so the value of those \nrevenues has eroded over the years, and, combined with the fact that \nvehicles have been getting increasingly better mileage, the revenues \ndeposited into the Highway Trust Fund beginning last decade have not \nkept pace with highway and transit spending from the trust fund.\n  Consequently, since 2008, Congress has periodically had to transfer \nat the 11th hour general Treasury revenues into the trust fund to pay \nfor authorized highway and transit spending levels and avoid a funding \nshortfall.\n  The total amount to date is more than $62 billion.\n  Obviously, this practice is economically inefficient and injects \nuncertainty in the highway construction plans, projects, and schedules \nof state and local transportation agencies, not to mention the anxiety \nit causes to workers and businesses whose economic livelihood is \ndependent on those projects.\n  Mr. Speaker, the last transportation authorized by Congress for 4 \nyears or more, SAFETEA-LU, expired on September 30, 2009, at the end of \nFY 2009.\n  Because Congress and the Administration could not agree to a new \nreauthorization, it was necessary to resort to stop-gap temporary \nextensions on no less than eight occasions spanning a period of 910 \ndays before Congress finally enacted the ``Moving Ahead for Progress in \nthe 21st Century Act'' (MAP-21 Act) on July 6, 2012, which reauthorized \nhighway and transportation programs through Fiscal Year 2014, a little \nmore than two years, or until September 30, 2014.\n  MAP-21 was intended as a short-term measure to give Congress and the \nAdministration breathing room to reach agreement on a long-term \nreauthorization bill.\n  Yet, as Mr. Levin, the Ranking Member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, has often pointed out, since gaining the majority in 2010, \nour Republican colleagues have failed to take any action to sustain the \nHighway Trust Fund over the long-term and shore up vital infrastructure \nprojects and has not held even a single hearing on financing options \nfor the Highway Trust Fund.\n  Instead, House Republicans have wasted the nation's time voting to \nrepeal the Affordable Care Act more than 60 times, waging a War on \nWomen, pursuing partisan investigations into the Benghazi tragedy, the \nIRS, defunding Planned Parenthood, and trying to overturn President \nObama's executive actions that make our immigration enforcement laws \nless inhumane.\n  Instead of doing their job, House Republicans big new idea is to \nattack the President for doing his job.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is long past time for this Congress, and especially \nthe House majority, to focus on the real problems and challenges facing \nthe American people.\n  And one of the biggest of those challenges is ensuring that America \nhas a transportation policy and the infrastructure needed to compete \nand win in the global economy of the 21st Century.\n  To do that we have to extend the reauthorization of current \ntransportation programs and to authorize the transfer of the funds to \nthe Highway Trust Fund needed to fund authorized construction projects \nand keep 700,000 workers, including 106,100 in Texas on the job.\n  But that is only a start and just a part of our job.\n  The real work that needs to be done in the remaining days of this \nCongress is to reach an agreement on a long-term highway and \ntransportation bill that is fair, equitable, fiscally responsible, \ncreates jobs and leads to sustained economic growth.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour \nequally divided and controlled by the chair and\n\n[[Page H7220]]\n\nranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services or their \ndesignees.\n  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is going to be an important debate that we have \ntoday because it is a debate about what type of economy we are going to \nhave: an economy based upon fairness, where your prosperity is \ndependent upon how hard you work on Main Street; or is it dependent \nupon who you know in Washington?\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  I respect the views of all Members, but if we are ever--ever--to deal \nwith the threat of a social welfare state, we must first take care of \nthe corporate welfare state, and the face of the corporate welfare \nstate is the Export-Import Bank.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the \nchairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee of the Financial \nServices Committee\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work that my \nchairman has done. I chair the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee, \nthe subcommittee that has jurisdiction directly over this.\n  In the last conference when I was vice chair of that committee, we \nstarted a work group looking at various reforms that could happen, and \nthat continued on into this term. We had a number of us on all sides of \nthe issue that were working together.\n  The real problem arose, though, when those of us who felt that we \nneeded to move in a direction where we were transferring that liability \nfrom the taxpayer back to businesses--when we felt that we were \nproposing some of those reforms, those who were most benefiting from \nthe program said: Absolutely not. Not a direction we can go. Cannot be \na phaseout. Cannot be a sunset. Cannot be a change to make these \nrecourse loans. Cannot make them only loans as opposed to grants. In \nother words, it was business as usual.\n  It might be a good business decision to transfer business liability \nand risk to somebody else, but it is a bad idea to transfer that \nadditional liability to the U.S. taxpayer.\n  I think that we have a couple of issues in front of us, Mr. Speaker, \nas was talked about yesterday. First is the issue of the Ex-Im Bank and \nthe entitlement mentality that has grown up, and that is just a symptom \nof it.\n  As the chairman has said, if we cannot take care of and tackle this \nentitlement mentality within the business community, how in the world \nare we going to have the moral standing to tackle that same entitlement \nmentality on the social side of our spending?\n  So it is sad to believe, in my mind, that some people think that this \nis the only or the best program that we can put forward for the U.S. to \nremain competitive on the world stage.\n  We know that we have put ourselves at a disadvantage through the \nregulatory environment that has been created not only under this \nadministration, but under previous administrations as well. We know \nthat the tax regime that we have is also a huge problem.\n  I just ask that my colleagues oppose this effort to make sure that it \nis status quo in Washington, D.C.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, yesterday this House took a historic and bipartisan vote \nin support of reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank. We showed that \nDemocrats and Republicans can work together to overcome the obstruction \ncaused by an ideologically driven minority that put its own \nuncompromising principles over the needs of the American people.\n  The 4-month shutdown of the Export-Import Bank engineered by the \nchairman of the Financial Services Committee has led to hopelessness, \nuncertainty, and fear for the many workers across this country whose \nlivelihoods rely on the support of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  As reports continued to pile in on the loss of jobs caused by the \nBank's shutdown, the chairman has remained deliberately indifferent to \nthe harm inflicted on the lives of these Americans. The cost of this \nindifference is more than 100 transactions worth more than $9 billion \nthat have been indefinitely put on hold pending the Bank's \nreauthorization. Unfortunately, many of these contracts have now been \nlost for good.\n  Today we are showing the small-business owners and their employees \nthat this indifference does not extend to the whole House of \nRepresentatives. Supporters of the Bank care about them, about their \njobs and their communities.\n  It is high time we reopened the Ex-Im Bank for business. Instead of \nshipping jobs abroad, let's start shipping American exports again. \nLet's put America back to work and pass this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the distinguished chairman of \nthe House Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to express my strong disapproval for this bill \nfor the Export-Import Bank. This is a profound debate we are having. It \nis about what kind of economy we are going to have. Are we going to \nreward good work or good connections? I think there are plenty of other \nways to expand opportunity in this country, and corporate welfare is \nnot one of them.\n  The biggest beneficiaries of this bank, two-thirds of their money \ngoes to ten companies and 40 percent goes to one company. And this bank \ndoes cost money. Just ask the Congressional Budget Office when they use \nreal scorekeeping.\n  Do you remember Fannie Mae? Do you remember their accounting? Do you \nremember when they told us they weren't going to cost any money? Until \nthey did. And it cost us billions.\n  The other excuse, Mr. Speaker, that I just don't buy is that other \ncountries do this and so should we. We shouldn't acquire other \ncountries' bad habits. We should be leading by example. We should be \nexporting democratic capitalism, not crony capitalism.\n  There is this criticism of those of the free enterprise system who \ncompare it to competition like a sport where the critics of free \nenterprise say there is a winner and there is a loser, just like a \nboxing match or a football game.\n  Well, that is true when it comes to crony capitalism. That is the \ncase when it comes to corporate welfare because, in that case, the \nwinner is the person with the connections, it is the company with \npower, and it is the company with clout.\n  The loser is the person who is out there working hard, playing by the \nrules, not knowing anybody, not going to Washington, and hoping and \nthinking that the merit of their idea and the quality of their work is \nwhat will win the day. That is what is rewarded under a free enterprise \nsystem.\n  Free enterprise is more about collaboration. It is more about \ntransactions of mutual benefit where everybody benefits, the rising \ntide lifts all boats, equality for all, and equal opportunity. That is \nfree enterprise. That is small d, democratic capitalism. This thing is \ncrony capitalism. I urge it be rejected.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), a member of the Financial \nServices Committee and the ranking member of the Monetary Policy and \nTrade Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the reauthorization of \nthe Ex-Im Bank. I just want to take a moment to recognize her tireless \nwork on behalf of the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  Ms. MOORE. I thank you so much, Madam Ranking Member.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to support this \nbipartisan initiative to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. The \nExport-Import Bank is about three things in this country that we need \nto be debating here more often, and that is jobs, jobs, and jobs. \nGetting the bill to the floor for this historic vote is about something \nthe country also needs more of, and that is bipartisanship.\n\n[[Page H7221]]\n\n  I am very distressed, Mr. Speaker, to continue to hear the debate \nthat somehow the financing of the Export-Import Bank is contributing to \nthe welfare state and that, if we are to tackle the social welfare \nprograms under Social Security, we have got to get rid of this \ncorporate welfare.\n  I am distressed to continue to hear that defeating the Export-Import \nBank is a backdoor approach to ending Social Security. If you listen \nvery carefully, colleagues, you are going to hear this over and over \nagain.\n  I do want to thank Representatives Hoyer, Lucas, Waters, Heck, \nFincher, and the House Members on both sides so that we can now go back \nto our districts, look U.S. workers in the eyes and say that we are not \ngiving them welfare, that we are giving the thousands upon thousands \nupon thousands of people in the chain an opportunity to work for a \nliving. This is not a Democrat or a Republican victory, but a victory \nfor all our workers.\n  I would ask that the body vote for the reauthorization of the Export-\nImport Bank. I hope the Senate takes our example and we send this to \nthe President for his signature. Our work and our businesses should not \nhave to wait one more day to reignite this powerful engine of job \ncreation.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Price), the distinguished chairman of the House Budget \nCommittee.\n  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a difficult and an important issue. With all due \nrespect, I urge my colleagues to proceed with caution regarding a \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, particularly under the \nprocedural motion that has been used to get this bill to the floor \ntoday.\n  Many Members, including myself, have real concerns that we are \nsidestepping the important work of our committees, in this case, both \nthe Financial Services Committee and the Rules Committee.\n  This leaves no room for amending or altering the legislation to \nbetter reflect the overall will of the House. This bill is, in fact, \nnot even a product of the House. It is the exact same text that was \ntaken from the Senate, and, just like this one, it bypassed the \ncommittee procedure over there as well.\n  By shortchanging the process, this effort is shortchanging the debate \nthat we should be having about legitimate disagreements over the \nExport-Import Bank, and, thereby, we are shortchanging the American \npeople.\n  For example, we know that, by statute, 20 percent of the Export-\nImport Bank's authorizations are supposed to go to small businesses. \nYet, today only 1 percent of 1 percent of small businesses are actually \naided by the Bank.\n  We also know that, when the Ex-Im subsidizes foreign corporations, it \nruns the risk of undermining American business. It is estimated that \nthe Export-Import Bank has led to the loss of 7,500 jobs in the \nAmerican airline industry alone and a loss of over $684 million in \nrevenue.\n  These are serious concerns at a time when we should be fostering a \nclimate of healthy economic opportunity and growth right here at home \nrather than a system that effectively chooses winners and losers.\n  It may not necessarily be the intention of my colleagues who \nsupported this discharge petition effort to undermine the legislative \nprocess or to diminish the importance of our committees or, above all, \nto limit what we can and should be having here, a healthy debate over \nlegitimate policy disagreements.\n  But, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, that is precisely what is occurring. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this process and \nto stop this dangerous precedent from taking root.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Washington (Mr. Heck), a tireless advocate for our exporters who \nhas never missed an opportunity to fight for the Export-Import Bank and \nthe American workers it supports.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. Speaker, watching the nonstop ideological warfare waged on the \nExport-Import Bank over the last nearly 3 years reminds me of my very \nfavorite Will Rogers adage: People feel about Congress the same way \nthey do when baby gets hold of the hammer. And that is, in fact, what \nwe have been treated to.\n  But the fact of the matter is today we have an opportunity to turn \nthat adage on its ear and do something that the American public will \nfeel good about Congress for, for today we have an opportunity to vote \nfor jobs, 164,000 in just last calendar year supported by the Ex-Im, \ngood-paying jobs, send-your-kid-to-college jobs, buy-a-home jobs, take-\na-vacation jobs, and have-a-secure-retirement jobs.\n  Mr. Speaker, tonight we have an opportunity to strengthen and protect \nthe manufacturing base of America, because the truth of the matter is \nit is not unrelated to our national defense infrastructure. The same \nentities that make up our manufacturing base keep us safe, and we \nshould not forget that.\n  Tonight we have an opportunity, indeed, to vote for reform of the \nExport-Import Bank despite the fact that it has a default rate that is \nthe envy of commercial banks and a collection rate as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, the truth of the matter is we can vote to increase loss \nreserves, improve risk management, modernize and update their IT, and \nnotwithstanding what was said by the gentleman from Michigan, it also \nhas a pilot recourse program in it on the reinsurance for payment side.\n  Tonight we have an opportunity to vote for a reduction of the \ndeficit. Yes. The Ex-Im for a generation has transferred cash--the heck \nwith your theoretical accounting model--transferred cash into the U.S. \nTreasury, $675 million just last fall.\n  Let me say it again. Tonight we have an opportunity to vote for jobs. \nNo more Waukesha, Wisconsins, Ms. Moore, no more Waukesha, Wisconsins, \nwhere an entire factory is being shuttered because we have failed to do \nour job in reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member, the leader, the \nwhip, and especially I want to thank my friends, Mr. Lucas of Oklahoma \nand Mr. Fincher of Tennessee, for their profile in courage. It was, \nindeed, a profile in courage to do the right thing. Tonight we have an \nopportunity to put American jobs first. Tonight we have an opportunity \nto put America first.\n  I don't know about you, but I came here from the private sector. I \ndon't reside in some kind of fantasy plot within an Ayn Rand novel. I \nlive in the real world, and in the real world we solve problems. This \nwill solve problems. Vote ``yes''.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nUtah (Mr. Chaffetz), chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform \nCommittee that held a number of key hearings on the Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I stand to express opposition to the \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.\n  As we look at these weighty issues, I think it is important that we \nlook at both the liability and the accountability in this factor.\n  When you look at the reliability, whenever we make decisions about \nspending money, we are talking about pulling money out of somebody's \nwallet and giving it to somebody else.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  And, in this case, as we look at liability, we are taking every \nAmerican's wallet and putting it on the line and saying: Should we or \nshould we not create liability for more individuals across the \nheartland? And for mom and dad, I just don't think that is the right \nequation. I fundamentally disagree with it.\n  If these are such good loans and they are so profitable, then do them \nin the private sector. You don't need the Federal Government to do \nthem.\n  And when it comes to accountability. Let's remember, this is a bank \nthat just this year had a bank employee who plead guilty to bribery--\nbribery of all things. The inspector general of the bank testified \nbefore our committee that they expect even more actions. And the \ninspector general on one project could not even validate more than $500 \nmillion in spending. And I can tell you, as the chairman of the \nOversight and Government Reform Committee, they have not been \ntransparent in giving us the information.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n\n[[Page H7222]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), a member of the \nFinancial Services Committee.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the \ngentlewoman for yielding and for her leadership.\n  I rise in strong support of reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank.\n  There is never really a good time to commit economic suicide, and now \nwould be especially a bad time. The Export-Import Bank creates jobs by \nsupporting exports, and it costs taxpayers nothing--zero. In fact, \nsince 1992, the Ex-Im has returned nearly $7 billion to the U.S. \nTreasury.\n  Killing the Ex-Im Bank would be especially bad right now. Export \ndemand is falling because of our strong dollar and economic headwinds \nin China and Greece and Europe. We have to remember that there are 85 \ndifferent export-import banks around the world from China to Canada, \nall of which are supporting exports more than we are. We are in a \ncompetitive world. They say when you lose a job, it goes somewhere \nelse. But what the opposition isn't saying is that it is going \noverseas.\n  I support the Export-Import Bank, and we should vote for \nreauthorization.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Garrett), chairman of the Capital Markets \nSubcommittee of the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.\n  In June of this year, after 81 years of doling out taxpayer-funded \nwelfare for megacorporations, the American people said enough, and \nCongress let the Export-Import Bank expire.\n  Yet, today, through a little known and little used legislative \nmaneuver being used to circumvent the will of the American people, they \nare resurrecting this fund for corporate welfare.\n  The Export-Import Bank transformed the role of government from a \ndisinterested referee in the economy into a biased actor that uses your \ntaxpayer dollars to tilt the scales in favor of its friends, and it \nmocks the American Dream by making victims of the startups that dare to \ncompete.\n  If we promoted responsible government policies, responsible budget \npolicies, expanded free markets, lowered and simplified the income \ntaxes, and repealed onerous regulations, American businesses would \nthrive in the global markets. But none of that is on the table today on \nwhat we are about to consider.\n  Instead, the proposal before us is the resurrection of a bank that \nembodies the corruption of the free enterprise system. Yes, we have the \nopportunity today to save capitalism from cronyism. Yes, we have the \nopportunity to protect the American taxpayer and the American Dream and \nto preserve free enterprise. We have the opportunity today to keep the \nExport-Import Bank out of business. We should take each of those \nopportunities.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Sherman), a member of the Financial \nServices Committee.\n  (Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, in the ideologically perfect world of Ayn \nRand novels, there is no Ex-Im Bank for the United States or any other \ncountry. In the real world, Germany has an export credit agency. China \nhas one. Canada has one. They are all much bigger than ours.\n  When I gave 100 speeches for George McGovern, they accused us of \nfavoring unilateral military disarmament. Now, we see some who are in \nfavor of unilateral economic disarmament. Our products face tough \ncompetition, and sometimes the order goes to whomever has the best \nfinancing. Ninety percent of Ex-Im Bank's loans go to small business \nand the other 10 percent help Big Business buy from American suppliers. \nTwo hundred and fifty Members of this Congress support Ex-Im Bank, with \nparticular courage among the 40-something Republicans who signed the \ndischarge petition.\n  As co-chair of the CPA Caucus, let me tell you, the Ex-Im Bank makes \na substantial profit under generally accepted accounting principles. \nThat is why they have been able to transfer $7 billion to the Treasury.\n  Ronald Reagan said: The Export-Import Bank contributes in a \nsignificant way to our Nation's export sales.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Westmoreland), a valuable Member of the House Financial \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  I rise in opposition to H.R. 597, to the Export-Import Bank, and to \nthe process Members have used to circumvent regular order and the \namendment process of the House.\n  I have more Delta employees in my district than any other district in \nthe United States. Their jobs are at risk because the Export-Import \nBank picks winners and losers in the American economy.\n  When the Ex-Im Bank finances a Boeing airplane for Emirates \nAirlines--as if Emirates Airlines would need any financing--the Bank is \ntelling pilots and flight attendants and mechanics and others in my \ndistrict that their jobs don't matter to the government. That is wrong.\n  My colleagues from Washington State and other areas want you to \nbelieve that they are fighting for the jobs in their district, and I am \nsure they are. I am here fighting for the jobs of my constituents. My \ncolleagues want their constituents to have jobs, but not my \nconstituents.\n  Well, I have news for my colleagues. I care about everyone's job. I \ncare about Boeing jobs, I care about Caterpillar jobs, and, yes, I care \nabout Delta jobs. I want the free market and the quality of U.S. \nproducts to dictate who gets contracts. This is how America was built--\nquality products made by quality employees stamped ``Made in America.''\n  Three years ago, Congress directed the Export-Import Bank to focus on \nan economic impact analysis to ensure the Bank knew the consequences of \ntheir lending decisions. Unfortunately, the Export-Import Bank acts as \nif they are above the requirements of Congress. Instead of following \nthe law, the leadership at the Export-Import Bank colluded with Boeing \nto design an economic impact analysis to keep the status quo in place.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you don't believe me, the House Financial Services \nCommittee has the emails to prove it. These are the bureaucrats that my \ncolleagues are up here protecting. It is shameful, truly shameful.\n  To add insult to injury, my colleagues refuse to allow to offer \namendments to defend my constituents. These are the very same people \nwho cry ``regular order'' yet won't deny the Members to have an ability \nto fight for their constituents.\n  I ask everybody for a ``no'' vote.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa), also a member of the Financial \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of allowing the \nmajority of the Congress to work its will and reauthorize the Export-\nImport Bank.\n  The Bank has supported more than 1.3 million private sector American \njobs since 2009, with nearly 90 percent of its transactions directly \nsupporting small businesses. The Bank is an unbridled, market-driven \nsuccess story that I am proud to support.\n  Three months have passed since a small group of Tea Party Caucus \nmembers threw common sense out the window and surrendered to an \nideological drive to shut down the Bank despite warnings from across \nthe private sector of the devastating consequences for our economy, \nAmerican small-business exporters, and their employees.\n  Today, I stand side by side with my colleagues from across the aisle \nto fight for them, including Ventech Engineers International, based in \nmy area of south Texas. Ventech manufactures small, pre-built oil \nrefineries for export supplying fuel to remote and impoverished areas. \nVentech cannot create more jobs or assist in our national security \nobjectives without financing provided by the Bank.\n  We cannot allow a small minority of the minority Chamber to block job \ncreation and weaken our international priorities.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from\n\n[[Page H7223]]\n\nCalifornia (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished Republican majority \nleader.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for yielding.\n  We are having a debate, a healthy debate, but I don't think this is \nthe structure or the forum in which we should have a debate about this \nbecause we don't have the option for amendments. I think there is a \nbetter way to do this.\n  People have two views about the argument today. But the real question \nof the debate we are having comes down to this: Do we let government \npick and choose who it gives special taxpayer loans to or not? I \nbelieve our constituents know very well what the right choice is. They \ndon't want their tax dollars backing up loans for any businesses. That \nis not the government's job. The private sector can and should do that. \nOur economy does best when the government is left out.\n  When government gets involved trying to centralize power and money in \nitself, corruption is inevitable. The Ex-Im Bank is a perfect example \nof this, and this is my concern. An inspector general is investigating \nat least 31 cases of fraud of the Ex-Im Bank, and this fraud has wasted \nmillions of taxpayer dollars.\n  But it doesn't stop there. A former Ex-Im Bank employee, Johnny \nGutierrez, pleaded guilty this year to taking bribes on 19 different \noccasions to help applicants get loans from the Ex-Im.\n  Another Ex-Im Bank employee was indicted for taking $100,000 in \nbribes to help a Nigerian businessman get loans from the Ex-Im.\n  And we all remember a Congressman, William Jefferson, who was \nsentenced to 13 years in prison for taking bribes to help a company get \nloans from the Ex-Im.\n  You see, there is a pattern, a pattern that won't be solved today, \nregardless of what side you are on.\n  Since 2009, in fewer than 6 years, there have been 49 criminal \njudgments against Ex-Im Bank employees or people who benefited from the \nEx-Im. Many of these people have gone to prison for it. In fact, if you \nadd them all up, that is 75 years they are serving.\n  Now, I wish I could tell you that was my only complaint and problem \nand it ended there, but it does get worse. A large number of loans of \nEx-Im guarantees aren't even for American companies. The Bank actually \nuses taxpayer money to back up loans for companies owned by governments \nof China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and others.\n  These loans to corporations outside of America don't always go well. \nDo you remember NewSat? That is an Australia company that lost $139 \nmillion in taxpayer-backed loans. NewSat's CEO allegedly diverted \ncompany funds to his yacht company.\n  So the question, Mr. Speaker, is when does the corruption become too \nbad? When is it that too many people take bribes? How many taxpayer \nloans must be issued by fraud?\n  So the question I have before this House is, if we are serious, if we \nwant to really make a difference, let's have a process that can change \nthings, let's have a process that can offer amendments, let's have a \nprocess that offers an honest debate, and let's not be shy about what \nthe problems are because I think the American people expect more.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green), the ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Financial Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.\n  There is a better way to do this. It is called regular order through \nthe committee process, bring it to the floor, and make amendments. \nHowever, when that doesn't prevail, the rules allow for what we are \ndoing today, which is exceedingly important.\n  I would say this: the Ex-Im Bank does not take deposits; it makes \ndeposits, and it makes deposits that help us with our deficit. The \nnumbers have been called to our attention: in 2013, about $1 billion; \nin 2014, $675 million. But the Ex-Im Bank has done something more \nimportant than all of these things that have been called to our \nattention for the most part.\n  I think one of the most significant things that it has done is it has \ncaused us to do something that we couldn't do for ourselves, and that \nis create the bipartisanship necessary to span the chasm of \npartisanship that has manifested itself in this House for too long.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), another valuable member of the committee.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I suggest that someone has been missing from this \ndebate. It is the forgotten man or woman--the everyday taxpayer--who is \nbeing asked to carry a risk that those in the private sector will not.\n  In 2008, we learned a tough lesson about privatizing profits and \nsocializing losses. During the good times, many in Congress cheered on \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and their shareholders prospered while \nexecutives made millions; but when the good times ended, the taxpayers \nwere forced to bail out Fannie and Freddie to the tune of $187 billion.\n  The Federal Government is today the guarantor of more than $3 \ntrillion in loans backed by numerous agencies. This level of taxpayer \nleverage is not sustainable, and we must begin to identify parts of the \nportfolio that can be transitioned away from taxpayers.\n  Given that 98 percent of our exports are made without the Export-\nImport Bank, the Bank is one agency that is suitable for transition \nover time to the private sector.\n  However, in the immediate future, Congress must act to protect \ntaxpayers. For example, in this reauthorization, Congress could insist \nthat these loans be fully collateralized, just as is the practice in \nthe private sector.\n  Congress could also require exporters, which profit from the Bank's \nlending to foreign purchasers of their products, to guarantee the \nrepayment of all or of even a fraction of these loans.\n  If phased in smartly, reforms like these would mitigate the potential \nfor the type of $3 billion bailout that the Ex-Im Bank sought in 1987, \nand they would also incentivize our trade representatives to actually \ninitiate negotiations with our trading partners to eliminate all \ngovernment-supported export subsidies and protect the taxpayer from \npotential losses, which is just as they were supposed to do in the last \nreauthorization.\n  Without these commonsense reforms, it is the taxpayer--the forgotten \nman or woman--and not the entity that made the profit who is on the \nhook for the loss. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' \nso that real reform proposals for this institution may be pursued.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter), a member of the Financial Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. PERLMUTTER. I thank the ranking member for allowing me to speak.\n  Mr. Speaker, in my district, which are the suburbs of Denver, 18 \nsmall companies benefit from the Export-Import Bank and the guarantees \nand the support that it provides--hundreds and hundreds of jobs. These \nare jobs in plastics, scientific equipment, food manufacturing, wood \nproducts, and electrical equipment. Those are the forgotten people in \nthis argument. Those are real jobs, real people.\n  Mr. McCarthy said there were two questions. I think the two questions \nare:\n  Should the United States unilaterally disarm at the expense of \nAmerican businesses and U.S. jobs? I think the answer is a resounding \n``no.''\n  The second question is: Should ideology trump reality? The reality is \nthat we are just going to give these jobs to countries all across the \nglobe instead of having them here in America. That is wrong.\n  I urge the passage of H.R. 597.\n  I thank Mr. Heck; I thank Mr. Fincher; and I thank Mr. Lucas for \nbringing this forward. Let's pass this bill today.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Schweikert), another valuable member of the committee.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, have you ever had one of those instances in which you \nare listening and you are trying to find a way to say, ``I believe much \nof the argument we are hearing here is intellectually disingenuous''?\n  The fact of the matter is every year there are trillions and \ntrillions of dollars of surety and import-export credit\n\n[[Page H7224]]\n\nthat moves through the markets, and it doesn't have a government \nguarantee. It does not have a guarantee from our taxpayers.\n  Look, this institution still has a $32 million loan from pre-Castro \nCuba on their books. When they tell you ``Oh, we have this tiny number \nof charge-offs,'' what they are telling you is a lie.\n  Do you remember the hearings we had when we had the discussions as to \nwhat their impairments were? They just stared back at you because they \ndidn't want to have that discussion, because every other financial \ninstitution has to honestly say, ``Here are our impairments. On this \none, it was oil. We only had this level of charge-off.'' What they are \nnot telling you is that they are still carrying loans that have sat on \ntheir books, without a payment, for 50 years.\n  To every citizen of this country, understand that, when this piece of \nlegislation passes, you have just been put on the hook. Your credit has \njust been put on the hook for these types of loans.\n  That is what you intend to do to your taxpayers? That is what you are \ngoing to do to your constituencies?\n  This piece of legislation also purports to have reforms in it. As for \nthe reforms, if they are not already doing these things, they should be \nlocked up already because much of this is the most basic level that you \nwould expect from any financial institution.\n  Then I come to another tab from the GAO and see repeat, after repeat, \nafter repeat where it has already been the law and they have been \nignoring it. Yet we are going to re-charter them again--an organization \nto which we are going to claim we are providing reforms when they are \nthe very reforms from the last time we did this that they did not \nfollow.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), a member of the Financial \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. KILDEE. I thank the ranking member for yielding and for her \nleadership on this issue, along with thanking Mr. Heck, Ms. Moore, Mr. \nFincher, and Mr. Lucas.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Ex-Im Bank used to be bipartisan legislation. It is \nso interesting to hear the outrage expressed by Members on the other \nside for a program that was supported repeatedly by President Ronald \nReagan. Where was your outrage then? I don't recall the outrage back \nthen because then it was fine.\n  I also have heard that this is not the appropriate venue for this \ndebate. This is the Congress of the United States of America, and I \nsuspect that the American people think this is a perfectly appropriate \nvenue.\n  The rule that we have utilized to bring this issue to the floor of \nthe House is a rule that you wrote that allows Members of this body, by \ndischarge petition, to bring legislation to the floor, supported by \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  We are using the rules of the House that you wrote. This is not an \ninappropriate venue. This is an argument about jobs for the American \npeople, and I will use every venue available to me to fight for jobs \nfor the American people.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind Members to direct \ntheir remarks to the Chair and not to other Members.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 13\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentlewoman from California has 18\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Huizenga), the chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. I thank the chairman. I appreciate the \nopportunity to come back up here to talk again a little bit about this \nprocess.\n  We were starting to talk about what had happened through the \ncommittee. There is a work group that was put together both in the last \nCongress and in this Congress that came up with some, I think, very \ninteresting things: reforms. Included in the reforms was: How do we \nextract ourselves out of this?\n  You see, here is what happened the last time.\n  The last time the Bank was reauthorized, it was through a short-\ncircuited system much like we are experiencing today. It did not go \nthrough regular order. It did not have all of the backing that it \nneeded. It was kind of jammed down on everybody on the House floor.\n  To let that smooth over a little bit, there was a requirement that \nthe U.S. Treasury start a negotiation with the Europeans about one \nspecific product: the wide-body aircraft. That is what maintains a vast \nmajority of the business of the Export-Import Bank.\n  But here is the thing: The U.S. Treasury ignored that directive. They \nignored the law as they were compelled to go in and start talking \nabout: How do we unwind ourselves internationally from this mess that \nhas been created?\n  Then, I think, there is a logical question to ask, Mr. Speaker: If \nthey are willing to ignore that part of the law, what part of the law \nthat we are trying to reform now are they willing to ignore?\n  My guess is all of it because, as I was talking about and as we were \nfloating these ideas of various reforms of making these recourse loans, \nof making sure that--oh, I don't know--a bank examiner could come in \nand actually allow this ``Bank'' to pass any banking standards as their \nportfolio weighting is way off, they could never pass any kind of exam \nthat any traditional bank would have to go through.\n  Every time any of those kinds of commonsense reforms were proposed, \nthe word came back from down on high--from those big companies that \nutilize this bank--and they said, ``No way. No way are we going to \nallow this to happen.'' So, truly, the characterization of this being \nregular order is way out of line, in my opinion.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), who is also a member of the \nFinancial Services Committee.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. I thank Ranking Member Waters.\n  Mr. Speaker, here is what I know.\n  The American people are clamoring for us to do our job and work \ntogether to help hard-working American families get ahead. We can do \nthat today by reviving the Export-Import Bank, a job-creating \norganization that reduces the Federal debt--with no subsidies, with no \ntaxpayers' money.\n  Last night my caucus and some Republicans joined together to force \ntoday's vote on reviving the Export-Import Bank. Why? Because it \ncreates jobs. It helps small businesses, female-owned businesses.\n  It is so important today for us to do this. I know it firsthand, Mr. \nSpeaker, because, in my district alone, there are 14 businesses, \nincluding eight small businesses, one minority owned and one female \nowned. The Export-Import Bank supports some $71 million in exports--and \nhere is the key--at no cost to American taxpayers.\n  We have heard a lot today, some misinformed, some misleading. So here \nis what I think, as the evidence is clear, Mr. Speaker: Let us renew \nthe Bank's charter without delay.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, in order to help equalize the time, I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to \nthe gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I have to speak fast.\n  The Export-Import Bank is good for America, and the arguments against \nit, in my opinion, are un-American.\n  This is the perfect Republican dream. It reduces the deficit. It adds \nto the Treasury. It creates jobs. It costs taxpayers nothing. It is \nunilateral disarmament to not recharge and reauthorize the Export-\nImport Bank. I support the legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of reauthorizing the Export-\nImport Bank of the United States.\n  In the darkest corner of the anti-empiricist wing of this Congress \nlies the plan to kill the Export-Import Bank.\n  Opponents of the Bank do not care that it supports small businesses \nand creates jobs.\n  Last year, nearly 90% of the Bank's loans benefited small businesses, \nand those loans supported more than 164,000 jobs.\n  Opponents are loath to admit that it reduces the federal budget \ndeficit.\n  Ex-Im returned $675 million to the Treasury last year and more than \n$1 billion in each of the previous two years.\n\n[[Page H7225]]\n\n  Opponents disregard the Bank's support for American exports.\n  Every other industrialized nation has an export-import bank, and this \nunilateral disarmament would cede American competitiveness.\n  I ask that my colleagues reject this blind pursuit of ideological \npurity, and reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to \nthe gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  Hundreds of families in New York's Capital Region face uncertainty \nafter one of the largest employers had to move jobs to France because \nits contracts needed a government-backed loan guarantee that the Ex-Im \nBank would have provided.\n  I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for their \nleadership. It is too bad that it took procedural gymnastics to finally \nreceive a vote on a bill with such broad, bipartisan support. Look what \nwe can accomplish when we work together to do what is best for the \nthousands of people we each represent in this body.\n  The Export-Import Bank equals jobs. Let's get it done. Let's put \npeople before politics.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to \nthe gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank.\n  You have two types of people. You have practical people who care \nabout real solutions for American workers and American businesses, and \nyou have slaves to ideology. Practical people want the Ex-Im Bank \nreauthorized.\n  This is supporting good-paying, family-sustaining manufacturing \nexport jobs, and the people in opposition are slavishly adhering to \nthis ideology that hurts America. In this case, the Ex-Im Bank returns \na profit to the American people and it reduces the deficit and the \ndebt. We ought to reauthorize it.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to \nthe gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).\n  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this \nbipartisan Export-Import Bank reauthorization.\n  The Ex-Im Bank was founded by FDR to increase the competitiveness of \nAmerican exports. It provides significant capital for U.S. companies \nand provides opportunities for U.S. jobs, allowing our companies to be \ncompetitive with companies overseas.\n  It provides confidence to businesses and investors, allowing them to \ncompete in the global marketplace. In Rhode Island alone, The Bank has \nhelped 26 businesses with a combined export value of $134 million.\n  The Ex-Im Bank is a vital part of our Nation's economic \ninfrastructure, and I urge my colleagues to support its \nreauthorization.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. \n597, the renewal of the United States Export-Import, or Ex-Im, Bank.\n  In Pennsylvania, the Ex-Im Bank is essential to the economic health \nthroughout Pennsylvania's Fifth District, supporting 11,000 jobs. The \nBank supports 40,000 jobs across the commonwealth in nearly 300 \ncompanies, adding $7 billion to Pennsylvania's economy since 2007.\n  Exporters in my district range from powdered metal companies to \ntechnology firms and to those involved in the manufacture of rubber and \nplastic products. All of these businesses provide jobs which sustain \nour local communities. Since 2007, exports from the Fifth Congressional \nDistrict in Pennsylvania have amounted to more than $1.3 billion, \nsupporting thousands of jobs in rural Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Ex-Im Bank is not a burden on the taxpayers. In \nfact, in 2013, The Bank covered its own expenses before directing more \nthan a billion dollars into the U.S. Treasury.\n  Now, I was proud to join a bipartisan group of my colleagues to bring \nrenewal of The Bank to the floor today and to cast a vote in favor of \nthe bill's passage.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. DeSantis).\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, Ronald Reagan once said the closest thing \nto eternal life on Earth is a government bureau.\n  How rare is it that we actually reduce government around here? Yet \nhere we are debating resurrecting a defunct agency that has already \ngone out to pasture.\n  Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle are central planners. \nThey believe in the type of politicized economy for which the Ex-Im \nBank has become a poster child. So they are actually being consistent \nin their position.\n  What I can't understand is how Members who preach limited government \nare willing to turn over the floor of the House to the minority party \nfor the purpose of rechartering a bank whose authority has lapsed.\n  If we simply did nothing, we would have less government. Taxpayers \nwould face less exposure. There would be less corruption. And the \neconomy would be less politicized.\n  So, by all means, vote how you want. Please, if you support \nresurrecting this agency, just spare us all the notion that you are \nactually here to reduce the size and scope of government.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to \nthe gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan).\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, with all the \ngridlock and all the partisanship and inability of this Congress to fix \nthings and get things done, we are looking at a great opportunity here \nwhere Democrats and Republicans have come together to fix things.\n  The simple truth is that this Ex-Im Bank doesn't cost the taxpayers a \npenny. It creates tens of thousands of jobs all across the country, and \nit yields a $7 billion profit for deficit reduction in this country. \nLife should be so good if we had a few more agencies like that. We are \ndoing such great work for the American people.\n  Let's reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the chairman of the Oversight and Investigations \nSubcommittee of the Committee on Financial Services.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I want to quickly address my good friend from \nMinnesota's comments that this Ex-Im Bank doesn't cost any money. The \ntruth is it does. We bailed it out to the tune of $3 billion in the \n1980s.\n  That same argument was made that Fannie and Freddie don't cost the \ntaxpayers any money. Well, it doesn't cost taxpayers money until it \ndoes. It is a government backstop. It is a government guarantee.\n  You see how hard it is: when you are going to take away a government \nsubsidy, man, do businesses fight like you know what to make sure you \ncan't take it away. They love their subsidies, and they will lobby and \nthey will work to make sure to get what they think is theirs.\n  I tell you, I am tired when I hear some of those Presidential \ncandidates talk about cronyism and those who look out for corporate \nwelfare and they try to point their finger to this side of the aisle.\n  If you open your ears and listen to this debate, ask yourself: Who is \nfighting for corporate welfare? Who is fighting to make sure that you \nhave a guarantee in the Ex-Im Bank that supports 80 percent of the \ndollars to big, massive American businesses? It is Democrats. Democrats \npartner Big Government with Big Business, and that is what is happening \nright here.\n  Picking winners and losers, the story of Delta: Delta has to compete \nwith airplanes that are subsidized in foreign markets by the American \ntaxpayer. They can't compete. So we picked Boeing jobs over Delta jobs? \nWho are we in this institution to say what job is better?\n  Let's let the market work. Let's not be the ones that come in and \ndictate what works and what doesn't.\n\n[[Page H7226]]\n\n  To think that we are going to set up a system that the Democrats--my \nfriends will say this is about all American jobs. But it is only about \nAmerican jobs if it meets our political criteria in that if you are \ndealing with carbon and I don't like carbon and if you are a carbon \njob, the Bank won't support those who are involved in a carbon export. \nThat is wrong.\n  Let's stand together. Let's work together. Let's fight for the \nAmerican taxpayer and take away this government subsidy.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished leader who \nhas been a steadfast advocate on behalf of the interests of American \nworkers and who has made reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank a top \npriority.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the \nreauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  As a former ranking member on the State, Foreign Operations, and \nRelated Programs Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, I saw \non a regular basis how important this was to our economy and to small \nbusinesses in America.\n\n  So here today we are coming to the floor in a bipartisan way to \ncreate good-paying jobs. How many good-paying jobs? 1.5 million since \nthe year 2007.\n  We are here to reduce the deficit. How much are we reducing the \ndeficit? In the past two decades, $7 billion in money has come in to \nreduce the deficit.\n  So we are creating good-paying jobs, reducing the deficit, fueling \nour economy, and we are respecting the entrepreneurship and the \noptimism of small- and moderate-sized businesses across the country.\n  Yes, there are some big businesses that benefit, but most of them \nhave subcontractors that need the work of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  So when we talk about making it in America, I want to recognize the \ngreat leadership of our whip, Mr. Hoyer. Make it in America, this is \nwhat this is about. Make it in America so that people can make it in \nAmerica but that, also, we can find markets abroad for our products \nmade in America.\n  Thank you, Mr. Hoyer, for your leadership on that and on the \nreauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank. Because of all of that work, the \nterm ``Made in America,'' that label continues to have the great \nprestige and quality that we have always known it to have.\n  I want to salute Mr. Denny Heck. He is just remarkable. In 24 hours, \nhe had 187 cosponsors of his bill earlier this year. That is so \nremarkable. Then in a short time after that, he had even more. Thank \nyou for all the work that you have done to bring us to today.\n  To the Republicans who are supporting this, to Mr. Fincher, thank you \nfor your leadership and your courage to give us this opportunity today.\n  I want to thank Maxine Waters. This has been a long haul, as many of \nyou know. Over that period of time, for one reason or another, there \nwere not hearings in the committee of jurisdiction that could focus on \nthe advantages of the Ex-Im Bank. So she had roundtable after \nroundtable, bringing in experts on what this meant to our economy, \nlistening to the public, hearing from small businesses about what this \nmeant to them.\n  Who would have ever thought that Maxine Waters, the ranking member on \nthe Financial Services Committee, would be the champion for big-, \nmoderate-, and small-sized businesses in our company? We would have \nthought it, and now the world knows.\n  So, Maxine, thank you for your perseverance. You really did such a \nwonderful job keeping this issue alive. I recognize the great \nleadership we have at the Ex-Im Bank with Mr. Hochberg and the others \nwho were there, the other hardworking people who are there who know \nabout markets.\n  This is important because many banks that small businesses might go \nto for a loan or loan guarantees, they are not used to dealing with \nmarkets abroad and that is why this is such an important link between \nentrepreneurship, creativity, innovation in our country, and how to \nexpand markets for all of that throughout the world.\n  So I am really happy. Congratulations to the House of \nRepresentatives. Today, we are creating good-paying jobs. We are \nreducing the deficit. We are honoring entrepreneurship, and we are \ndoing it in a bipartisan way.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining \non each side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The gentleman \nfrom Texas has 8\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, and the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia has 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our distinguished whip.\n  Whip Hoyer has a long record of advocating on behalf of our Nation's \nexporters and their workers. With his leadership, we are here today on \nthe verge of finally passing legislation to reopen the Ex-Im Bank.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I listen to this welfare-state rhetoric. The \nAmerican public ought to know that 147 Republicans voted to reauthorize \nthe Export-Import Bank just a few years ago under the leadership of Mr. \nCantor and myself.\n  It was not until the ideological--how do I say what has happened in \nthe House of Representatives--when we retreated from bipartisanship and \nworking together, we retreated from pragmatism and we repaired to \nideological hideboundness. Those are pretty tough words, I understand \nthat.\n  You have 147 Republicans and every Democrat, 330 Members of the House \nof Representatives, voting to reauthorize this bill just a few years \nago. This rhetoric that I hear now that somehow this is selling out to \nthe welfare state is a little difficult for me to believe.\n  I know it has become an issue for some hardline groups, and this is \nnot just for big business or medium business or small business. This is \nfor American jobs, the little people.\n  Do big people provide jobs for little people? Yes, they do. Do we \nwant that done? Yes, we do. Should we, therefore, be competitive with \nthe rest of the world who offers subsidies so their corporations, so \ntheir medium-sized businesses, so their small businesses can create \njobs for people?\n  Mr. Speaker, 330 of us voted to reauthorize this just 3 years ago, \nbut we have had some immaculate awareness that this is somehow preening \nto the welfare state.\n  Let us come together as practical people with common sense who want \nto be competitive with the rest of the world. Let's pass this bill. The \nHouse is for it. The majority is for it. It has been bottled up, which \nhas not allowed the majority to work its will.\n  Today, through the courage of Mr. Lucas, Mr. Fincher, and others, the \nmajority will work its will. Isn't that wonderful.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield 30 seconds to the \ngentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Export-Import Bank means jobs in \nthe United States of America. From 2007 to 2015, in Ohio, it supported \n363 exporters, 263 small businesses, and more than $3 billion in value \nof Ohio exports. Superior Holdings, First Solar, Port Clinton \nManufacturing, A.J. Rose Manufacturing, and so many other Ohio \ncompanies want to export. They require Ex-Im to do so.\n  Frankly, in today's world markets, no serious nation can compete \nwithout the Export-Import Bank. More than 50 countries have an Export-\nImport Bank: China, Japan, Germany, India, Korea, France, Brazil, and \nother competitors.\n  I support reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank. It means jobs, and it means \nbusiness for the USA.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Reichert).\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, one of America's greatest promises is the \npromise that, if you work hard and play fair, your opportunities are \nendless. Thousands of business owners throughout this country have \nlived by this mantra and sought new opportunities abroad.\n  When Congress allowed the charter of the Export-Import Bank to expire \nover\n\n[[Page H7227]]\n\nthe summer, we took away an important tool for American business owners \nand their employees. They depend upon it. This is about jobs.\n  Many small companies throughout my region and in my district have \nrelied on Ex-Im Bank. I will name one: Number 9 Hay in a small town \ncalled Ellensburg in eastern Washington. A hay company in Ellensburg, \nWashington, with the support of Ex-Im Bank, was able to expand its \nbusiness, hire employees, and sell in foreign markets. Otherwise not.\n  This story is a story of success, of jobs for the small hardworking \nbusinesses of America that create 85 percent of our jobs. If we don't \nact, businesses of all sizes and the people they employ will be \nthreatened.\n  I support this measure.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how \nmuch time we have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 9\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 8\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. MacArthur).\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, before I came here, I spent 30 years in \nthe private sector and built a business from about 100-odd people to \ntoday about 6,000. I learned that you need capital to grow a business. \nThe Ex-Im Bank provides just that.\n  Now, if the private sector could provide that, well, this would be a \ndifferent discussion, but the private sector doesn't. The Ex-Im Bank \nprovides a necessary resource for companies doing business overseas. In \nfact, I have had lenders tell me they will not loan if the Ex-Im Bank \nis not already involved.\n  The Ex-Im Bank supported $27.5 billion worth of U.S. exports last \nyear and 164,000 jobs. To not reauthorize it is to be shortsighted. I \nurge my colleagues to remember this is a Republican bill. It deserves \nour support.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to \nthe gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the \nreauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank. The Ex-Im Bank is a critical \nresource for Rhode Island manufacturers looking to expand into new \nmarkets.\n  Over the last 8 years, the Ex-Im Bank has provided more than $20 \nmillion to Rhode Island companies for insured shipments, guaranteed \ncredit, and disbursed loans.\n  I am pleased that, after 4 months of inaction, the House is finally \nvoting to reauthorize this critical institution. I thank my colleagues \nfor their support.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent).\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I certainly rise in support of this \nlegislation that would reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. In my \ndistrict alone, the Bank's activities have supported thousands of jobs \nand over $600 million in export sales.\n  The financing provided by the Ex-Im has provided critical support to \na wide array of industries in Pennsylvania, ensuring that products \nranging from major energy components to help LNG exports, to \nlocomotives, to cement equipment, to computers, to electronics, to \naircraft are able to continue to be manufactured by Pennsylvania \nworkers.\n  Developing countries, as we know, don't have very well formed capital \nmarkets, and they need this financing to help them buy American \nproducts. As our sole credit agency, the Bank provides the security \nU.S. firms need to access burgeoning markets. It strengthens our trade \nbalance, and it helps to sustain our global market share. It does all \nthis while still returning money back to the U.S. Treasury.\n  Importantly, this bill incorporates essential reforms that will \nsignificantly improve the Bank's risk management and transparency and \nprovide our small businesses with an even greater share of lending \nsupport.\n  For those who talk about Ex-Im Bank creating winners and losers, I \nwould argue that, by letting the Bank's authority lapse, we have indeed \ncreated winners and losers. The losers are now American job creators. \nThe winners are countries like China, Germany, France, Brazil, and the \nU.K. that continue to support their exporters and welcome the \nopportunity to increase their market share and domestic manufacturing \nbase in the absence of U.S. competition.\n  Let's not unilaterally disarm our ability to assist our exporters. \nLet's show the American people that we continue to govern in a \nbipartisan and rational manner. Let's pass this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge we support this legislation.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney), another important member of the House \nCommittee on Financial Services.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot of talk so far today \nabout the Bank, about what the Bank does. We have heard a lot of talk \nabout small business, a lot of talk about the Bank leveling the playing \nfield, a lot of talk about the Bank being that lender of last resort \nwhen no one else will step into the breach to help American businesses. \nSupposedly, that is what this is all about.\n  That is not what this is about. We had a discussion in the committee \nearlier this year where I actually suggested amendments that would \nfocus the Export-Import Bank on small business, that would allow the \nExport-Import Bank to expand its use as a lender of last resort, but \nthat would limit the Bank to true uses to level the playing field, when \nwe really were competing with export credit facilities overseas.\n  A representative of the United States Chamber of Commerce sat in our \ncommittee and said he would oppose every single one of those \namendments. Small business is not what this is about. Leveling the \nplaying field is not what this is about. Being a lender of last resort \nis not what this is about. This is about doing the bidding of the very, \nvery large corporations that have a very, very large lobbying presence \nin Washington, D.C. That is what this is about. I am just surprised to \nsee who is for it.\n  We had a chance to actually fix the Bank. No amendments were allowed \ntoday. We had a chance to actually focus on small business, a chance to \nfocus on the Bank's role as a lender of last resort, a focus on what \nthe Bank should be doing.\n\n  But we will miss that, Mr. Speaker, because we are doing the bidding \nof other folks. Vote as you will, but let's be honest about what this \nis and what this is not.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold).\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Tennessee \n(Mr. Fincher), my good friend, for his leadership on this bill.\n  Coming from Illinois' 10th Congressional District, we are the fourth \nlargest manufacturing district in the Nation. The Export-Import Bank is \na bank that does finance many small businesses. In fact, 86 percent of \nthe loans that happen in Illinois' 10th Congressional District in the \nExport-Import Bank go to small businesses.\n  Yes, Boeing does utilize the Export-Import Bank, and they say, \nwhenever a Boeing plane lands, 19,000 small businesses land with them. \nThere is no question that we talk about jobs and the economy. I hear it \nconstantly. I know my colleagues do all across this body because I have \nhad the opportunity to talk to them. They are talking to their \nconstituents. It is still about jobs and the economy and the \nuncertainty that is out there.\n  I had a conversation with a small-business owner who said, ``You know \nwhat? I can't go to my local community bank and get financing for a \ntractor that I want to send over to France or Germany.''\n  Consequently, if we don't reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, they \nare going to take those jobs and they are going to move them overseas. \nThat is the last thing in the world we want, Mr. Speaker.\n  We want to talk about good, high-paying jobs right here at home. We \nwant to talk about manufacturers that have the ability to be able to \ncreate products right here at home, create\n\n[[Page H7228]]\n\nmore jobs right here at home, and send those products all over the \nworld. The Export-Import Bank allows us to do that.\n  We need to level the playing field and not unilaterally disarm. I \nurge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Export-Import Bank and \n``yes'' to American jobs.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Hunter).\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to give my support to this \nvaliant effort to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank in an effort that I \nbelieve puts first the best interests of American manufacturers, \ninnovators, and entrepreneurs.\n  We had a vote this year on the TPA, the trade promotion authority. \nMany of my colleagues that are arguing against the Ex-Im Bank \nunapologetically stated their intent to give the President new, \nexpansive authority to export U.S. jobs overseas, this amounting to \nmillions of jobs sent overseas, all in the name of trade and \nglobalization.\n  If you want to talk big business, I ask my friends that are against \nthe Ex-Im Bank to look at that vote. Many of those in that contingent \nwho voted for the trade promotion authority--and are going to vote for \nthe big trade deal we have coming up--are now trying to say there is \nsomething inherently wrong with trying to underwrite U.S. exports \nthrough the Ex-Im Bank, although the vast majority of Bank loans \nsupport small business.\n  In my district alone, in eastern San Diego, you have nine companies--\nno Boeings, no GEs. Over 400 jobs, $60 million in exports, all \nunderwritten by the Ex-Im Bank.\n  I have heard a lot of people quoting Ronald Reagan. Here is what he \nsaid about the Ex-Im Bank:\n  ``Exports create and sustain jobs for millions of American workers \nand contribute to the growth and strength of the United States economy. \nThe Export-Import Bank contributes in a significant way to our Nation's \nexport sales.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this effort.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger).\n  Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank everybody on both \nsides of the aisle for their hard work in getting this very important \nthing done.\n  I flew to Ethiopia about 6 months ago, and I flew on a Boeing \nairliner--there is a lot of talk about Boeing here--but I didn't fly on \nan Airbus. What that represented to me was a lot of jobs that Boeing \nprovides to people, but a lot of jobs in my district of small suppliers \nthat supply to Boeing. I think that is something that has been lost in \nthis whole debate.\n  There has been a lot of negativity, a lot of negative talk. I want to \ntell you about something positive, and that is the thousands of people \nwho work in my district who don't have to worry about getting a pink \nslip tomorrow or the next day because they know that their \nmanufacturing job is secure because of our future and our powerful \nability to export around the globe.\n  While I know this has been a controversial process and I have respect \nfor everybody on all sides of this issue, I would beg my colleagues, \nlet's move forward in a bipartisan way. Let's reauthorize Ex-Im Bank, \nand let's go ahead and move ahead with the business of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to quote \nPresident Ronald Reagan on March 23, 1985:\n  ``Why won't the Congress stop its export subsidies to a handful of \ncorporations which account for less than 2 percent of US exports?''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nto the gentleman from New York (Mr. Collins).\n  Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support \nof the Export-Import Bank, which supports hundreds of thousands of \nAmerican jobs, returns a profit to the United States Treasury, and \nensures U.S. exporters can compete on a level playing field in the \nglobal market.\n  I came to Washington as a small-business owner, dedicated to \nexpanding job opportunities for western New Yorkers. Unfortunately, due \nto misinformation and misguided outside interests, Bank opponents have \nshut down a government program that directly aids American jobs.\n  The Export-Import Bank supports thousands of jobs in western New York \nand numerous small businesses in the 27th Congressional District. These \ncompanies provide real jobs in western New York, good-paying jobs that \nwill be lost if the Ex-Im Bank is not reauthorized soon.\n  The fact is exports drive job growth in the United States. When a \ncompany sells abroad, their employees, suppliers, and communities grow \nat home. Reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank is vital for manufacturers of all \nsizes to grow and prosper in a competitive world economy. That is why I \nfully support reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank and urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how \nmuch time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 6\\3/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of \nmy time to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher), a member of the \nCommittee on Financial Services.\n  I want to just take time to thank him and Representative Lucas for \ntheir courage and their leadership in making this vote possible today.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for \nyielding. A lot of times we don't see eye to eye, but we have a fair \nand spirited debate. This time we do, and I appreciate her willingness \nto support me in this effort.\n  We have talked a lot today about many different things, but I am \ngoing to end on the note of facts. And so many times in Washington, the \nfacts get lost.\n  A few minutes ago, my colleague from Wisconsin, a friend of mine, one \nof my colleagues from Wisconsin, who probably will be the next Speaker \nof the House, stood up and, really, spoke against our efforts in trying \nto save the Export-Import Bank.\n  I was reminded of just a few years ago, of a couple of very serious \nvotes that happened in the House: one was the automotive bailout, and \none was TARP.\n  I have a quote from the gentleman from Wisconsin:\n\n       The TARP vote was necessary in order to preserve this free \n     enterprise system. If we fail to do the right thing, heaven \n     help us.\n\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, let me say, none of us are perfect. I am a long way \nfrom perfect. You ask my wife and she will tell you.\n  But we are here to make the government work better, make it more \naccountable, make it smaller, and make sure the environment in the \ncountry is better for job creation and the job creators to create jobs. \nThat is what the Export-Import Bank does.\n  The facts are, it doesn't cost the taxpayer a dime. The facts are, it \nreturns money to the Treasury every year. The facts are, this is a \nRepublican reform bill. We are fixing almost everything that has been--\nalmost every problem that has been raised we are addressing in this \nreform bill.\n  Those are the facts, Mr. Speaker. Eighty years old; 60 other \ncountries have them. This is about us being competitive all around the \nworld and making sure that we keep American jobs here at home.\n  I urge my colleagues today, on both sides of the aisle, let's put \nAmerican workers first. Let's make sure that we are working for the \nfolks back home in our districts. Let's put these politics aside for \ntoday and put the country forward.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  We had a rather spirited debate here between those who believe the \nEx-Im Bank is about economic development\n\n[[Page H7229]]\n\nand trade, and those who believe it is about corporate welfare, \ncronyism, and an unfair economy.\n  For those who claim that the Ex-Im Bank creates jobs, the \nCongressional Research Service would tend to beg to disagree and citing \neconomists who say they largely rearrange jobs. We know for a fact they \nhave rearranged jobs away from Delta because they have said they have \nlost jobs when the Ex-Im Bank subsidizes Air India.\n  Valero Refining, in my native Texas, has said they lose jobs in \nAmerica when the Ex-Im Bank will subsidize a Turkish competitor.\n  Cliffs Natural Resources of Cleveland, Ohio, will say they lose jobs \nwhen the Ex-Im Bank subsidizes an Australian competitor, which has \ncaused economist Donald Boudreaux to say, at best, the Ex-Im Bank \ncreates jobs in export industries by destroying jobs in non-export \nindustries.\n  How is that fair? How is that fair, Mr. Speaker?\n  We are told that the Ex-Im Bank makes money for the taxpayers. Well, \nyes, if you use special insider Washington accounting rules. But if you \nuse fair value accounting, something that the rest of America has to \nuse, the Congressional Budget Office says that it actually loses money, \nand in fact, it has received an actual bailout from the Federal \ntaxpayers before.\n  We are told they help small business. And you know what? That is true \nin a number of cases. But yet two-thirds of the benefits go to Fortune \n50 companies like Boeing, like GE. They are great companies with great \npeople doing great things.\n  I just wonder why they have to receive taxpayer subsidies?\n  And 40 percent goes to benefit one company, Boeing; that is why it is \naffectionately called the ``Bank of Boeing.''\n  So I know it helps some small businesses, but other small businesses \naren't too fond of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  We hear from the chairman of Michael Lewis Company in McCook, \nIllinois: ``Over the long run, Ex-Im subsidies for foreign carriers \ncreates a tilted playing field that means fewer U.S. airlines jobs--\nwhich translates into economic pain for thousands of businesses like \nours and our employees.''\n  That is the voice of small business.\n  Chris Rufer, founder of the Morning Star Company: ``When a company \nprofits from the Bank's support, it pockets the money. If it defaults, \ntaxpayers' pockets gets picked . . . it is private gain at the expense \nof public pain.''\n  That too, is the voice of small business.\n  We are told that as long as global competitors do this, well, we have \nto do it. I mean, that is an argument I hear from my children: \neverybody else is doing it, so we have to do it.\n  But the truth is, almost two-thirds of the Ex-Im Bank book has \nnothing to do with a countervailing duty. And almost 99 percent of all \nU.S. exports, Mr. Speaker, are financed without the Ex-Im Bank.\n  So we need to help our exporters. We need to help our small \nbusinesses. But the way we do that is through expanded trade. It is \nthrough fundamental tax reform that the National Association of \nManufacturers has said is 50 percent of our competitive disadvantage.\n  Let's make a fairer, flatter, simpler Tax Code. Let's have regulatory \nreform with the REINS Act. Let's pass the Keystone pipeline and drive \nenergy prices down and become more competitive that way.\n  So the arguments of those who propose to support the Ex-Im Bank--and \nthese are good people, and I know they believe in their hearts and \nheads in what they are doing. But I don't think their arguments bear \nscrutiny. They don't stand up to the light of day because the true face \nof the Ex-Im Bank is about cronyism. It is about misplaced priorities. \nIt is about foreign aid. It is about corruption.\n  Again, this is a bank that benefits a handful of Fortune 50 companies \nthat lobby and lobby well. Now, I would defend their First Amendment \nright to do it. I just wish they would lobby for more competition and \nmore freedom and not subsidy and special privilege.\n  We know that so much of this support, Mr. Speaker, ends up in \ncountries like China and Russia. We asked the chairman of the Export-\nImport Bank: So we are supposed to compete with China by subsidizing \nChina?\n  And, Mr. Speaker, you know what his answer was? Well, it is \ncomplicated.\n  No, Mr. Speaker, it is not complicated; it is stupid. It is stupid \nfor us to subsidize China in the thought that somehow we are going to \ncompete with China.\n  Almost $1 billion to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which \nFreedom House says is the third worst human rights offender in the \nworld.\n  The cronyism, money to Solyndra, money to Enron, $33 million to a \nSpanish green energy company that Bill Richardson, former Energy \nSecretary, sat on the advisory board of the Ex-Im Bank and then sat on \nthe advisory board of the Spanish green energy company.\n\n  How cozy. The Fannie and Freddie business model.\n  Corruption, the last 6 years, 75 years total prison time, 90 criminal \nindictments, 49 criminal judgments. One employee just recently pleaded \nguilty to 19 counts of bribery.\n  Mr. Speaker, the genius of our system, the fairness of our system is \nabout the free enterprise system. It is not about crony capitalism. \nYour success in America should depend upon how smart you work and how \nhard you work on Main Street, not who you know in Washington.\n  Crony capitalism is a threat to our free enterprise system. This is \nAmerica. If you dream big dreams, if you play by the rules, you can \nmake it on Main Street. But not in this Washington insider economy. And \nthere is no better poster child of the Washington crony economy and \ncorporate welfare than the Export-Import Bank.\n  So I have no doubt that an overwhelming number of Democrats are going \nto support the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. They are \nalways happy to allocate credit and our economy as part of a political \nprocess. They are always happy to subsidize corporate America, as long \nas they can also regulate and control it. But that is not fair to the \npeople on Main Street.\n  It is the free enterprise system which is fair. It is the free \nenterprise system which is moral. It is the free enterprise system \nwhich is based on merit. It is the free enterprise system which is \nempowering to people. It is the only economic system that frees \nordinary people to achieve extraordinary results.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, that is what this debate is all about. It is about a \nfair economy for everybody in America: those who can't afford the high-\npriced lobbyist in Washington, D.C., and those who want to work hard \nand play by the rules.\n  It is time for us to say ``no'' to crony capitalism, say ``yes'' to \nfree enterprise, say ``yes'' to a fair economy, and reject the Export-\nImport Bank.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 450, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill, as amended.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Ms. NORTON. I am.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n  Ms. Norton moves to recommit the bill H.R. 597 to the Committee on \nFinancial Services.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from the District of \nColumbia is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. NORTON. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of \norder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of the point of order is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I wish to claim time in opposition to the \nmotion to recommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Texas seek \nrecognition?\n\n[[Page H7230]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Yes, I wish to seek time in opposition.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I make a point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma will state his \npoint of order.\n  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, in order to seek time in opposition, wouldn't \nthe gentleman or gentlewoman have to be opposed to the motion to \nrecommit?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Time in opposition is reserved for an \nopponent.\n  Mr. LUCAS. So, Mr. Speaker, would it be in order to reaffirm that \nwhoever ultimately claims the time is, indeed, in opposition to the \nmotion to recommit?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would ascertain that before \ngranting recognition.\n  Does the gentleman from Texas seek recognition in opposition to the \nmotion to recommit?\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Yes, I have sought time in opposition to the motion \nto recommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from Oklahoma, another \nvaluable member of the House Financial Services Committee, who I know \nwe are on opposite sides of this issue, if the gentleman would like \ntime to speak, I would be happy to yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. LUCAS. Will the gentleman yield for a brief response?\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Chairman, I very much appreciate the opportunity to \nrespond. I think that probably it is better that you finish the \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Okay. The gentleman declines.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman wish to yield back?\n\n\n                        Parliamentary Inquiries\n\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Texas yield to the \ngentleman from South Carolina?\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Yes, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina for \nhis parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. If this is not dilatory, what is the effect of passing \nthis motion to recommit?\n  I so often hear the preface, ``This doesn't send it back to \ncommittee; it doesn't kill the bill.''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. If adopted, the motion would recommit the \nbill back to committee.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. So passing this motion to recommit would send this bill \nback to committee?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. For how long?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The motion does not put a time limit on the \ncommittee to consider the bill.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Fair enough.\n  Further parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Does the person offering this motion represent to this \nbody that they are in favor of this motion in order to qualify?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman qualified by stating her \nopposition to the bill.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Fair enough.\n  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas may continue.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Again, Mr. Speaker, I would say we are having a \ndebate on the underlying bill that has been vigorously debated on both \nsides.\n  The motion to recommit, if people are genuinely interested in looking \nfor an opportunity for an amendment process that was denied as the \ndischarge petition came to the floor.\n  I have served under many committee chairmen on the Financial Services \nCommittee. I have never known one to bring a bill through committee \nthat was not supported by a majority of their members, and I did not \nbring this bill because it was not supported by a majority of \nRepublican members.\n  I understand the ability to use this discharge petition; and if \npeople are looking for opportunities to amend, I wish it would have \nbeen done in the discharge petition.\n  But if it is the will of the House to send this to committee, the \ncommittee has had three different hearings on the Ex-Im Bank already--a \ncouple of them in conjunction with the Oversight and Government Reform \nCommittee--and I would be happy to have even more hearings on the \nsubject and listen to the new points that have been brought about by \nthis debate.\n  I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney).\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of making another \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. The reason I am confused is, I do so often hear that \nintroduction, the MTRs won't kill; it won't send it to committee; it \nwill proceed immediately forthwith to the House for a vote.\n  So here is my question on a parliamentary inquiry basis. If the MTR \nis passed, I understand from your previous ruling that the bill goes \nback to committee. Is it amendable in committee? Or does it immediately \nreturn forthwith to the House for a vote?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill would return to the committee for \nits consideration.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. And the committee has full control over that piece of \nlegislation?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The committee would have the bill before it \nagain.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, again, I appreciate the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina making his parliamentary inquiries. I think it has \nhelped clarify the matter.\n  At this point, if it is the will of the House to send this back to \ncommittee, I look forward to the vote and would be very happy to \nreconsider this in committee.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.\n  I wish the Chair would clarify that there will be a vote taken on the \nmotion to recommit and that, should that fail, this will not go back to \nthe committee under any circumstances. Is that correct?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. If the motion is not adopted, the bill will \nnot return to committee.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Well, if I may, you just said what I \nsaid in reverse. And I just wanted it to be clear.\n  As the chairman of the committee tried to state that he would be \nwilling to hold hearings and do what he has not done as we have tried \nto consider this, that if, in fact, this body does not support it going \nback to committee, he has no opportunity to try to do what he has not \ndone in the process. Is that correct?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. If the motion is not adopted, the Chair \nplans to proceed. The next step would be the question of passage of the \nbill.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \non the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX and the \norder of the House of today, further proceedings on this question will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n        Vacating Demand for Yeas and Nays on Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \nrequest for the yeas and nays on the motion to recommit to the end that \nthe motion stand disposed of by the voice vote thereon.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the ordering of the yeas \nand nays is vacated, and pursuant to the earlier vote by voice, the \nmotion is not adopted.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.\n\n[[Page H7231]]\n\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the \nyeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Since I withdrew the request for the yeas and nays on \nthe motion to recommit, then would it be possible for the ranking \nmember, the gentlewoman from California, to withdraw her request for \nthe yeas and nays on the underlying bill, should she so choose?\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, that is wishful \nthinking on the part of the chairman. I will not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7231-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7231-H7243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETAIL INVESTOR PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume simply to say, Mr. Speaker, at one time this administration \ntold us, if you liked your doctor, you could keep them. Now this same \nadministration is telling us, if you like your financial adviser, you \ncan keep them. The first promise was broken, and now they are in the \nprocess of breaking the second promise due to something called the \nDepartment of Labor fiduciary rule.\n  It will take away investment advice from hundreds of thousands, if \nnot millions of low- and moderate-income people all around the Nation \nwho rely upon this advice to save for retirement. This is something \nthat should be considered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nand there has been outstanding work by the gentlewoman from Missouri \n(Mrs. Wagner) who has been at the forefront of protecting retail \ninvestors, the small moms and pops planning for their retirement.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. \nWagner).\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mrs. WAGNER. I would like to thank Chairman Hensarling and \nSubcommittee Chair Garrett for their support on this tremendous issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to stand before the House as the \nsponsor of H.R. 1090, the Retail Investor Protection Act. This \nimportant legislation that I have sponsored and worked on for 3 long \nyears now came about after my colleagues on the Financial Services \nCommittee and I, along with Member of Congress on both sides of the \naisle saw the potential negative effects that this rulemaking from the \nDepartment of Labor could have on millions of Americans seeking advice \non how to invest their retirement savings.\n  For that reason, we felt it was important to put the Securities and \nExchange Commission--the primary and expert regulator for these \nfinancial professionals--in charge of studying and writing the rules on \nthis issue. This isn't such a radical idea. In fact, this is what \nCongress intended when they included section 913 in the Dodd-Frank \nfinancial reform bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, the same legislation received the support of 30 House \nDemocrats last Congress, and, once again, I hope that they heed the \nconcerns and the warnings that their constituents have provided them \nabout the dire consequences this rule will have on Americans' \nretirement savings.\n  Make no mistake. There is a savings crisis in this country. About \nhalf of all households age 55 and over have no retirement savings at \nall. How does this happen?\n  Unfortunately, for many people, like that single mother of two who \ngets paid on the 15th and 30th of each\n\n[[Page H7232]]\n\nmonth, there is just too much month at the end of the money after \npaying for mortgages, groceries, medical bills, and other expenses, and \nsaving for retirement ultimately gets pushed off until the next month \nand the next month and so on.\n  For many American households, a trusted financial adviser is the key \nlink to helping them see the benefits in saving early and helping them \nrealize how to save and grow their investment. The vast majority of \nthose financial professionals already provide advice and \nrecommendations that are in the best interest--the best interest--of \ntheir clients.\n  Unfortunately, this rulemaking from the Department of Labor could \npotentially cut access, limit choice, and raise costs for that kind of \nfinancial advice, putting the goal of retirement even further out of \nreach.\n  The Department of Labor states that this rule simply would require \nfinancial advisers to act in the best interests of their customers. \nWell, who would argue with that? Unfortunately, when you start to get \ninto the over 1,000 pages of regulatory text with the exemptions and \naddendums, it becomes clear that it isn't quite that simple.\n  The increased compliance burdens and further legal liability that \nwill be required under this regulation will make it very difficult for \nmany brokers to continue servicing small accounts, which predominantly \nbelong to low- and middle-income Americans who are just starting to \nsave and haven't built up their retirement nest egg.\n  Mr. Speaker, 98 percent of all IRAs with less than $25,000 are in a \nbrokerage relationship today. For that reason, this rule will actually \nhurt the very people that it aims to protect. We must not play politics \nwith their retirement savings, and that is what this administration is \ndoing.\n  We have already seen this happen in the United Kingdom. They enacted \na similar regulation in 2013, and we have seen since then over 300,000 \nclients dropped by their financial advisers because their account \nbalances were too small.\n  Now the U.K. Government is launching an investigation into the \n``advice gap'' that exists for those people who do not have significant \nwealth. With this regulation from the Department of Labor, the same \nthing will happen here in the United States of America where there will \nbe two different classes of investors, those who can afford financial \nadvice and those who cannot.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not a Wall Street issue. This is as Main Street \nas it gets. Washington should not be making it more difficult for \nAmericans to save for retirement. Instead, we need to empower people to \nearn more and save more and have choices for where to get their help in \nmaking their financial decisions. Unfortunately, the Department of \nLabor is following along with everything else we have seen under the \nObama administration, a top-down, Washington-knows-best-for-you \ngovernment, whether it is what you see in your health care that you \nneed, the food that you can eat, and now whom you can talk to for the \nfinancial advice for your retirement savings.\n  According to President Obama, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and now even \nSecretary Hillary Clinton--who are all big supporters of this DOL \nfiduciary rule--the only person whom you actually need to be protected \nfrom ultimately is yourself. I strongly disagree. I give the American \npeople a lot more credit than that, and I refuse to stand by and let \nthis administration advance another onerous regulation that ultimately \ntakes your freedoms, makes decisions for you, and brings us closer to a \ngovernment-planned life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 1090, the Retail Investor \nProtection Act, and I urge its passage.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1090 would halt the Department of Labor's ongoing \nefforts to protect American retirement savers from investment advice \nthat conflicts with their best interests.\n  The bill would prohibit the Department from promulgating any rule on \nthe issue until 60 days after the Securities and Exchange Commission \nfinalizes its own fiduciary rule for investment advisers and broker \ndealers.\n  The bill would then delay the SEC's long overdue rulemaking by \nrequiring the Commission to first report to Congress a separate \neconomic analysis that, among other things, considers how a new \nstandard would affect a broker's profit.\n  These delays are unacceptable and ignore the real issue that the \nDepartment is trying to address: conflicted retirement investment \nadvice that costs our Nation's workers and retirees an estimated $17 \nbillion a year.\n  The Department's rulemaking would do so by requiring persons \nproviding retirement advice to put the interests of their clients ahead \nof their own and abide by a fiduciary duty, the same duty that we \nexpect from our doctors, lawyers, and trustees.\n  Simply put, a financial adviser should not be paid more for \nrecommending one product over another, but should abide by a fiduciary \nstandard of care. Would you be comfortable if your doctor was paid more \nfor an office visit for recommending one drug over another or for a \nlawyer to be paid more for interpreting the law one way or the other? \nNo, of course not. Yet, we allow these same conflicts to exist with \nthose that are providing millions of hardworking Americans with advice \non their retirement savings.\n  These conflicts encourage investors to, for example, push a 70-year-\nold retiree to invest more of her savings in a stock fund rather than a \nless risky short-term bond fund simply because the adviser receives 150 \npercent more for making the riskier recommendation.\n  Such a commonsense update in the law to address these conflicts is \nlong overdue and, indeed, at the Department, is over 5 years in the \nmaking. During that time, the Department has published an initial 2010 \nproposal, solicited feedback, held public hearings on that proposal, \nand issued even a reproposal this past spring.\n  Since that reproposal was published, the public and interested \nstakeholders have had 164 days of public comment, 4 full days of multi-\npanel public hearings, and ample opportunity to meet with the \nDepartment, which held over 100 meetings with interested stakeholders, \nnot including meetings with Members of Congress.\n  Thanks to the Department's diligence and willingness to listen to \nstakeholder concerns, the proposal now enjoys broad support, including \nsupport from 95 financial services groups, public interest, civil \nrights, and consumer organizations, labor unions, and many investment \nadvisers who are already providing advice to savers under a fiduciary \nstandard. These groups range from the AARP, Public Citizen, the \nConsumer Federation of America, to the Financial Planning Coalition, \namong many others.\n  All this points to the Department's tangible efforts to take a \nbalanced, measured approach to developing a rule that works. I fully \nsupport their efforts to continue to work towards its completion not \nonly because it is necessary, but because it just makes common sense.\n  What is more, the need to update the law quickly is urgent. \nHardworking Americans lose an estimated $17 billion per year--or $47 \nmillion per day--to conflicted retirement investment advice.\n  While we should clearly encourage the Securities and Exchange \nCommission to also update its own rules on investment advice over \nsecurities, we should not make retirement savers wait any longer for \nprotection by hinging the DOL's rulemaking to the SEC's, as H.R. 1090 \nwould do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support the Labor Department's efforts to finalize a \nrule and urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1090.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Garrett), the distinguished chairman of our Capital \nMarkets and Government Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.\n  I thank Mrs. Wagner as well.\n  As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule is \nbuilt upon faulty assumptions, faulty analysis, and faulty \nunderstanding basically of how the retirement system actually works in \nthis country. It is really consistent with other policies of this \nadministration.\n  This rule will have a disparate impact and a negative impact upon \nmiddle class Americans and minorities in\n\n[[Page H7233]]\n\nthis country, many of whom will find it difficult, if not impossible, \nto receive guidance from a financial professional for their retirement.\n  This is not me saying this. The Department of Labor's own analysis \nshows that investors who do not work with a professional will risk \nmaking mistakes that cost them up to $100 billion.\n  So today, Mr. Speaker, Congress has an opportunity to stand up on \nbehalf of struggling American families and support this legislation.\n  We have proof to show that this legislation really is necessary \nbecause we had folks coming to Washington to testify about it who \nsupported the DOL rule. They said do not worry. They said that, if the \ntraditional brokerage firms can't live with a simple fiduciary standard \nand refuse to serve modest savers, so be it. Other financial \nprofessionals such as them on and off the Web who embrace the client-\nfirst approach stand ready to help Americans prepare for a secure \nretirement. Well, that was Rebalance IRA.\n  Someone went to that company, a modest American, and said, ``Will you \nservice us?'' This was their response: ``If you have scheduled a call \nwith us, I want you to be aware that, as much as we would enjoy \ndiscussing your retirement goals, until you have at least $100,000 in a \nretirement account, our service at this time is not really the best \nsolution for you. Our fees will absorb too much of your investment \nreturn, which runs counter to our mandate to help you to retire.''\n  So, Mr. Speaker, the very same people who say the system will work \nunder the DOL guidelines prove that, when people of modest means--\nAmericans who are simply trying to scrape by each week and each month \nand put a little bit away--will not have that investment advice which \ntheir very own Department of Labor says is necessary to get by and to \nfulfill the American Dream.\n  The Retail Investor Protection Act will restore regulation to the \nmarket to where it belongs: with the SEC. It will prevent the \nDepartment of Labor from worsening the retirement savings crisis that \nour country is facing. I say support the American Dream. Support this \nlegislation.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), the ranking member of the Monetary Policy \nand Trade Subcommittee on the Financial Services Committee.\n  Ms. MOORE. I thank you so much, Madam Ranking Member.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1090. I must say to \nRepresentative Wagner she is correct when she says that there were 30 \nDemocrats--I am one of them--who supported similar legislation, but \nthat was before the Department of Labor reproposed the conflict of \ninterest rules, gave us sort of an unprecedented 164-day comment period \nduring the reproposal, and they withdrew the original 2010 proposal and \nput forward the reproposed rule in 2015, 5 years. As we discussed it, \nthey have committed to making considerable improvements.\n  Now, the SEC has yet to begin the process of a related rulemaking 5 \nyears after the Department of Labor began the process, and they have \nmade it really clear that they don't think they will get to it.\n  I do want to point out--since I have 3 whole minutes here--that it \nhas been very difficult to get the majority party to agree to providing \nthe SEC with the needed resources that would, in fact, enable them to \nundertake the work that the Department of Labor has already put forward \non this. So I don't think we should wait until after the SEC acts to \nissue a rule. And this legislation before us would only delay these \nimportant consumer protections.\n  The Department of Labor has received a lot of feedback, especially \nfrom me. Mr. Speaker, I have been extremely vocal in highlighting \nareas, some of them which you have heard on the other side mentioned \nhere today--very vocal on the reproposed rule where I think it needs to \nbe improved and, in fact, led a letter to the Department of Labor with \n96 Democratic colleagues signing on to that letter.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  However, I do think that the time is now for Congress to partner with \nthe DOL, with industry, and with retirement savers toward the best \npossible final rule to encourage and protect retirement savings.\n  Now, I want to mention that the overwhelming majority of advisers are \ngood people with their clients' best interest at heart. In fact, no one \nin this debate is suggesting that we don't support policy which puts \nthe best interest of the client first and foremost. But when financial \nadvisers are unscrupulous, they have a devastating impact on retirement \nsavers.\n  Further, when advisers are responding to skewed incentives that \nencourage conflicts and put clients in products, that may be okay for \nthe client, but placement in these products are driven primarily by the \nadviser's bonus.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield the gentlewoman an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. MOORE. The DOL rule that is being reproposed seeks to mitigate \nthese conflicts of interest so that the best advisers in companies get \nclients and compensation based on the best interest and the outcomes \nfor their clients.\n  I think that this is a backdoor approach to kill the rule, any rule, \nand it will leave gaping loopholes in Federal laws.\n  My advice to my colleagues is that we defeat this bill.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Duffy), chairman of the Oversight and Investigations \nSubcommittee of the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, we, before this debate, were having a debate \non the Ex-Im Bank, and I made a point about my friends across the aisle \nstanding up for big businesses, the cronyism between big government and \nBig Business. In this debate, they have a chance now to stand with \nsmall investors, the men and women around this country who put a little \nbit away every paycheck to hopefully have a little nest egg for their \nretirement, to stand with those people to make sure that when they get \nto their retirement, they have a nest egg that is worth something, and \nto make sure that those folks have advice along the way.\n  The way the Department of Labor rule is structured is that most \nAmericans aren't going to be able to get advice from a financial \nadviser; they are going to be driven to a robo-adviser. What that means \nis they are going to have to go to a Web site, answer about 6 to 10 \nquestions, and the Web site will pump out a generic investment \nsuggestion for them. No personally tailored advice from a financial \nadviser.\n  That also has another effect. Think last month or 2 months ago in \nAugust when we had market movement. A lot of people get freaked out and \nthey sell. But if you have an adviser, they say: Hold on. No, no, no, \nwe have a long-term plan here. Don't sell, don't sell. Hold on. We are \ngoing to weather this storm together.\n  But is a robo-adviser, the text from the computer, going to calm your \nnerves so that you don't sell your portfolio? This doesn't work for the \nAmerican people.\n  What the Department of Labor is doing is saying: If you are wealthy, \nif you have a lot of money, if you have a big nest egg, then you can \nget advice. But if you are poor or middle class, a middle-income \nAmerican, you are not entitled to the same advice of the wealthy and \nthe powerful.\n  I am mostly concerned about one other point here, is that if this \nrule goes into effect and less Americans save and have less return on \ntheir investment, when they get to their retirement years, they are \ngoing to be more reliant on the government. We want people less \nreliant. We want people to take more responsibility so they have a nest \negg to fund their retirement years, pay for themselves. The way this is \nstructured, you will have less people doing that and more people \nlooking to the government for care. I guess that is a greater debate \nthat we have in this institution: Do we want more people relying on the \ngovernment?\n  I think the only conclusion I can draw with your support for this \nrule is, absolutely, yes. That is a wrong approach. We come from a long \nline of people who believe in self-reliance, in\n\n[[Page H7234]]\n\ntaking care of ourselves and our family. This rule from the Department \nof Labor is bad. Let's fix it with this bill.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets of the Financial Services \nCommittee.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking \nmember for yielding and for her leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record over 95 investor protection and \nconsumer protection groups who adamantly support the position of the \nDepartment of Labor rule that protects investors and consumers.\n\n                                          Save Our Retirement,\n\n                                                 October 26, 2015.\n\n   Oppose H.R. 1090, the Misnamed ``Retail Investor Protection Act''\n\n       Dear Representative We are writing as organizations that \n     strongly support the Department of Labor's (DOL) efforts to \n     strengthen protections for working families and retirees by \n     requiring the financial professionals they turn to for \n     retirement investment advice to act in their best interests. \n     As such, we oppose H.R. 1090, the misnamed ``Retail Investor \n     Protection Act,'' and urge you to vote NO when the bill is \n     considered on the House floor.\n       H.R. 1090 is a clear attempt to thwart DOL action by making \n     the Department wait for years and possibly indefinitely until \n     after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finalizes \n     a rule under securities laws--a process that the SEC has not \n     yet initiated. And, to further delay action, the bill imposes \n     on the SEC new requirements to engage in further economic \n     analysis, beyond the extensive analysis it has already \n     conducted, and make formal findings before promulgating a \n     rule. By impeding DOL's efforts, this bill would in no way \n     protect retail investors; instead, it would protect those \n     financial professionals who take advantage of loopholes in \n     the law to profit at their clients' expense.\n       This approach would effectively cripple DOL's ability to \n     fulfill its unique and critical regulatory role under ERISA. \n     When Congress enacted ERISA, it intentionally set a higher \n     standard for protecting retirement assets than applies to \n     other investments. There are good reasons to do so. \n     Retirement assets are special, as evidenced by the fact that \n     they are heavily subsidized by the government through the tax \n     code. These tax subsidies should flow to individuals, not \n     financial firms, and should not be depleted by conflicts of \n     interest.\n       Retirement savers who are struggling to fund an independent \n     and secure retirement need financial advice they can trust is \n     in their best interest. Today, neither our securities \n     regulations nor the rules under ERISA provide that assurance. \n     Instead, both sets of regulations expose retirement savers to \n     recommendations from conflicted advisers who are free to \n     recommend products based on their own financial interests \n     rather than those of their customers. The DOL proposal--which \n     combines a best interest standard with meaningful \n     restrictions on the practices that undermine that standard--\n     offers significant progress toward addressing this problem. \n     There is no reason to force the DOL to wait for the SEC, \n     since only the DOL has the authority and expertise to close \n     the loopholes in the ERISA rules.\n       DOL has succeeded in crafting a balanced rule that provides \n     much needed new protections for retirement savers while \n     providing the flexibility necessary to enable firms operating \n     under a variety of business models to comply. While \n     adjustments can and doubtless will be made to clarify and \n     streamline certain of the rule's operational requirements, \n     the rule's overall framework is sound. Contrary to the \n     misinformation that has swirled around the DOL proposal, it \n     actually will help, not hurt, small savers. They need the \n     protections of the best interest standard more than any other \n     workers and retirees, since they can least afford high fees \n     and poor returns on their savings. And if some advisers \n     really do pull back, there are plenty of advisers happy to \n     provide affordable, best interest advice to clients at all \n     income levels.\n       We can only hope that the SEC eventually will follow DOL's \n     lead and craft a similarly strong and effective rule for non-\n     retirement accounts. But in a nation that faces a retirement \n     crisis, and with DOL ready to act, we cannot afford to wait. \n     We therefore urge you to reject H.R. 1090--or any legislation \n     that would stall, derail or interfere with the DOL \n     rulemaking, which is proceeding under an appropriate \n     deliberative process--and instead support DOL's efforts to \n     finalize a rule based on the sound regulatory approach it has \n     proposed.\n           Sincerely,\n       AARP, American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n     Employees (AFSCME), Alliance for a Just Society, Alliance for \n     Retired Americans, American Association for Justice, American \n     Association of University Women, Americans for Financial \n     Reform, Association of University Centers on Disabilities, \n     Better Markets, Center for Community Change Action, Center \n     for Global Policy Solutions, Center for Responsible Lending.\n       The Committee for the Fiduciary Standard, Consumer Action, \n     Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Fund \n     Democracy, International Association of Machinists and \n     Aerospace Workers, International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, \n     International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union, \n     Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Lynn Turner, \n     former chief accountant, SEC, Main Street Alliance.\n       Metal Trades Department, AFL-CIO, National Active and \n     Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE), National \n     Council of LaRaza, National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, \n     National Organization for Women, Pension Rights Center, \n     Public Citizen, Public Investors Arbitration Bar Association, \n     Service Employees International Union (SEIU), United Auto \n     Workers, United Steelworkers, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, \n     Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers \n     International Union (USW), U.S. PIRG, Wider Opportunities for \n     Women.\n\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, the Department of \nLabor's fiduciary duty rule advances a very simple principle: If you \nare giving advice to retirement savers and you are being compensated \nfor your advice, then you have to put your customers' interests first.\n  It is worth noting that most investors already think that this is the \nlaw, even though it isn't.\n  So the Department of Labor's rule is a much-needed update of the \nrules governing investment advice to retirement savers. I would say we \nhave a particular responsibility as legislators to protect retirement \nsavers, which is what the DOL rule does.\n  While the proposed rule is not perfect, no rule ever is. The \nDepartment has been incredibly responsive, very responsive to \nlegitimate concerns that have been raised. They have been more than \nwilling to engage with Congress and with industry and with investors to \ncome up with better solutions.\n  But this bill before us would effectively stop the Department of \nLabor's rule in its tracks, which is the completely wrong thing to do \nif you want to protect investors.\n  This bill is also redundant, unnecessary, and really reflects a \nmisunderstanding of the law.\n  One of the core principles of the Employee Retirement Income Security \nAct, or ERISA, was that investments made for the purpose of retirement \nsecurity should enjoy special protections under the law. That is what \nthis DOL rule does. This, by definition, means that the protections \nunder ERISA are supposed to be different than the protections under \nordinary securities laws. They should be more protective of the \nretirement investor.\n  As a result, the SEC and the Department of Labor have different \nresponsibilities. When two agencies have different responsibilities, it \nis completely appropriate for them to move separately and even to write \ndifferent rules.\n  This bill would also require the SEC to conduct yet another study--or \nI would call it a delay--on a uniform fiduciary standard for broker-\ndealers. We already required the SEC to conduct a study on this issue \nin Dodd-Frank, and the SEC staff's recommendation in that study was \nthat the SEC should, in fact, adopt a uniform fiduciary standard for \nbroker-dealers.\n  Requiring the SEC to conduct largely the same study that they already \nconducted in 2011--I believe they can move ahead with their own \nfiduciary rule--is pointless and shows that the true intent of the \nbill, the underlying bill, is to delay both the Department of Labor's \nrule and any future SEC rule which ultimately is there to protect the \nretirement saver and investor.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I urge them to vote for \ninvestor protections and to protect consumers. I urge a very strong \n``no'' vote.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Royce), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Retail \nInvestor Protection Act.\n  The Department of Labor's proposal here is going to harm the very \nworking class Americans that the administration claims that it is \nsupporting.\n  This is not hyperbole, this is not a hypothetical. I want to give you \nthe real results of what happened in the United Kingdom when it enacted \nsimilar regulation in 2013. Here are the disastrous results: 310,000 \nclients were dropped; 60,000 new investors were rejected; an estimated \n11 million potential savers were priced out of advice.\n  In the face of these facts, the Department of Labor continues to \ninsist on\n\n[[Page H7235]]\n\napplying the failed philosophy of ``government knows best'' to \nretirement savings.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri for her leadership \non this, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member of the \nEducation and the Workforce Committee.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. \n1090, the so-called Retail Investor Protection Act.\n  This bill puts an effective end to the Department of Labor's \nresponsible effort to modernize a fiduciary standard under the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, that was implemented 40 years \nago.\n  As we all know, our country's retirement savings landscape has \nchanged significantly since that time. Forty years ago, the majority of \nretirement assets were held in defined benefit plans and managed by \nprofessionals. Forty years ago, employer-based 401(k) plans did not \nexist and IRAs had just been established.\n  Today, Americans have more than $12 trillion invested in 401(k) plans \nand IRAs, and they have to make their own financial decisions. Many \nworkers and their families don't have the expertise in managing \ninvestment portfolios and so they often have to rely on financial \nadvisers to help them save for retirement.\n  While many of those advisers do right by their clients, others do \nnot. There is a lot of different financial products that Americans can \npurchase. Some have extremely high fees, while comparable products--and \nperhaps even better ones--have lower fees. This current standard allows \nfor unscrupulous advisers to give conflicted advice and push a \nfinancial product from which they will reap a bigger profit even if the \nproduct is not in the best interest of their client.\n  It is individuals with modest retirement savings--many of our \nconstituents--who stand to lose the most from receiving conflicted \nadvice. National Public Radio recently conducted a series that in part \nhighlighted how Americans are losing billions of dollars every year out \nof their retirement accounts because they are paying excessive fees.\n  As a hypothetical example, NPR cited a person who invests $10,000 and \nthat investment makes a 7 percent return every year. Over 40 years, \nthat investment would be worth almost $150,000. But if you have \ninvested in a fund that charges a 2-percent annual fee, now you have \ncut the return down from 7 percent down to 5 percent. Over 40 years, \nyour investment would be worth about $70,000, not almost $150,000. That \nis, obviously, a big difference, and that is the kind of insidious \nerosion of retirement savings that the Department is working to end \nwith their rule.\n\n  Since April, the Department of Labor has been engaged in this \nnecessary rulemaking process. The Department has informed us that over \nthat time, it provided the American public a total of 164 days to \nsubmit comments; they conducted 4 full days of public hearings; and \nconvened over 100 meetings. That total doesn't account for meetings \nthey have held with Members of Congress.\n  Now the Department is completing its work on the rule and is taking \ninto account the thousands of comments it received. Here in Congress, \nwe should just let them finish their job.\n  Millions of Americans rely on financial advisers for advice on how to \nprotect their hard-earned retirement savings, and it is about time that \nwe ensure that those Americans are provided advice consistent with \ntheir best interest, not with what would ultimately be in the best \ninterest and profit for the adviser.\n  I, therefore, urge my colleagues to defeat this legislation.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Hultgren), a very important member of the House Financial \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.\n  Today, I rise in support of legislation that will protect hard-\nworking Americans' access to retirement advice.\n  The Labor Department is aggressively pushing a flawed rule which \nmight be a political win for the Obama administration but would come at \nthe expense of Americans trying to save for retirement. This is why I \ncosponsored the Retail Investor Protection Act.\n  The administration claims the plan that they have put forward will \nhelp people trying to save for retirement. Instead, it would hurt many \nof them.\n  The Labor Department has proposed restricting retirement advice and \nreducing options for what financial instruments can be used to save for \nthe future.\n  Most concerning, the regulatory costs would hit those who have had \ndifficulty saving the hardest. One firm in my district with dozens of \noffices that serve more than 30,000 customers told me that they fear \nthe Labor Department proposal will make it impossible to offer quality \nservices to low- and middle-income customers.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Clearly, the administration has no concept of what these rules will \nmean for Main Street investors, and they have chosen to ignore the \nbenefits provided by retirement advisers. My constituents tell me they \nsave more because of the advice they get. Relatively simple advice, \nsuch as not making irrational decisions in volatile markets, is \nincredibly valuable, especially for less sophisticated investors. \nFurthermore, the Department's proposal mentions annuities 172 times, \nbut the Regulatory Impact Analysis does not examine the impact on these \nfinancial products.\n  The Department of Labor is choosing to ignore Congress and the people \nit claims to protect. On July 29, I sent two separate letters to \nSecretary Perez. It has now been almost 3 months, and he has done \nnothing to address the concerns of my constituents.\n  There are now at least 51 of my colleagues, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, who share my concerns that listed options would no longer be \npermissible in retirement accounts. The Labor Department claims that \nthey are working closely with the SEC, but during a hearing last \nFriday, a key witness from the SEC could not provide me with one \nexample of when the Labor Department had included any SEC input.\n  It is time for the administration to stop restricting where and how \nAmericans choose to pursue financial stability and security. Vote \n``yes.''\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Al Green), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nOversight and Investigations on the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I thank the ranking member for her outstanding \nwork and efforts in this area. The gentlewoman has truly been a \nchampion for people--the very little people who some people have styled \nwe are talking about today.\n  Mr. Speaker, the best way, without question, to get the SEC to act \nwould be to allow the DOL to act. If the DOL is allowed to promulgate \nits rules, I guarantee you the SEC will move with an additional amount \nof deliberate speed.\n  Currently, the DOL is simply attempting to cause people who act as \nfinancial advisers to have fidelity to their clients above their own \npersonal interests. What is so unusual about the concept is the person \nwho is working for you having fidelity that benefits you as opposed to \nthe person who is working for you.\n  Right now, as the laws exist, a person acting as a financial adviser \ncan become a financial predatory adviser. Not all are. I am not \naccusing the industry of anything. I am just making a point about what \ncan happen. When this happens, the person who is to give you advice--\nfor a fee, I might add--can sell you a product for a higher fee and \nthat has a higher risk as opposed to a similar product with a lower fee \nand that carries a lower risk. The higher fee is the temptation that \nwill cause predatory financial advisers to manifest themselves and take \nactions against the best interests of the clients, who are paying them \nto represent them and benefit them.\n  We ought not allow this kind of action to be sanctioned by the \nCongress of the United States of America. What the President is \nattempting to do by and through the DOL is to simply say: If you are \ngoing to represent your client, you are going to put your interest \nbeneath the client's interest. You will\n\n[[Page H7236]]\n\nsubordinate your interest to your client's interest. You will not allow \nyourself to yield to the temptation to take a higher amount of money \nfor yourself and put your client at a greater amount of risk.\n  That is all this rule is about.\n  Let's allow the rule to come into existence. If we want to debate it \nthereafter and amend it, we can. But let's not prevent it from ever \nmanifesting itself by causing some to believe that the SEC will do what \nthe DOL will not, because the evidence is not there to support the \nnotion that we are going to get faster results from the SEC.\n  Finally, this: in a righteous world, we would be calling some of this \nactivity fraud.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Barr), another valued member of the Financial \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Retail Investor \nProtection Act, legislation that will ensure investor access to \npersonalized and cost-effective investment advice.\n  The Department of Labor's proposed fiduciary rule will make it more \ndifficult for hard-working Americans to access financial advice and to \nsave for retirement.\n  Time and again, I have heard from constituents throughout my central \nKentucky district of how this massive, 1,000-page rule will negatively \naffect them: Private employers and not-for-profit organizations will no \nlonger be able to bring in financial advisers to provide educational \ninformation about retirement plans to their employees. Investors with \nsmall accounts will no longer be able to receive advice for their \n401(k) plans. Middle class investors will lose access to professional \nadvice, and financial products like annuities will no longer be \navailable. More and more Americans will be forced to seek information \non the Internet or from robo-advisers.\n  Let's get this straight, Mr. Speaker. This rule will replace flesh \nand blood professional advisers with a computer. As one of my \nconstituents said to me, if you think professional advice is expensive, \nwait until you see the cost of amateur advice. In short, the Department \nof Labor's rule will hurt the very people it is supposed to protect.\n  On July 29, Representatives Wagner, Scott, Clay, and I sent a \nbipartisan letter, signed by 21 Members, to Secretary Perez, asking for \nthe DOL to stop these disruptive changes and repropose the rule in \nlight of the many negative comments. Secretary Perez replied that the \nDOL would not entertain the request. That is why it is necessary for \nCongress to take action and pass this legislation.\n  Look, we all agree that financial advisers should act in the best \ninterests of their clients, but heightened consumer protections in the \ninvestment space should apply broadly and should not create two classes \nof investors. It should not bifurcate the industry to those who can \nafford advisers and those who cannot. The result will be less choice \nfor consumers and a lack of access for retail investors to sound \nfinancial advice. The best consumer protection is not central planning \nfrom Washington. It is choice and competition.\n  I thank Representative Wagner for her leadership on this issue, and I \nencourage my colleagues to vote for competition and choice, to vote for \naccess to professional financial advice, and to defeat this rule.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings), the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. I thank Ranking Member Waters for yielding, and I thank \nher for her excellent and compassionate leadership not only on this \nissue but on so many others.\n  I rise today to oppose H.R. 1090, the so-called Retail Investor \nProtection Act, which is anything but a protection for investors.\n  Rather than protecting our constituents' investments, this Act would \nprevent the Department of Labor from finalizing a rule to establish a \nfiduciary standard for investment advisers until the Securities and \nExchange Commission finalizes a rule first.\n  In essence, the bill before us would prevent the Labor Department \nfrom finalizing any rule at all. The administration has already \nindicated it would veto this measure if it is passed by Congress.\n  This past March, Senator Elizabeth Warren and I held a forum as part \nof our Middle Class Prosperity Project to consider the need for a \nstrong fiduciary standard to protect Americans who are saving for \nretirement. We heard directly from Americans who had lost tens of \nthousands of dollars because they did not receive advice that was in \ntheir best interests.\n  In some cases, people may not even realize they have placed their \ntrust in advisers who are not fiduciaries and who have no obligation to \nact in their best interests. One study found that Americans who are \nsaving for retirement lose more than $43 billion, on average, each year \nbecause advisers don't act in their clients' best interests.\n  The real solution, as we learned in our forum, is to have a strong \nconflict of interest rule to ensure the advice Americans receive--\nadvice they receive as paying customers--directs their hard-earned \nretirement savings to investments that will work in their best \ninterests.\n  This House should not put roadblocks in the way of this commonsense \nreform, which would protect our constituents' money. I urge all of the \nMembers of the House to oppose H.R. 1090.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Indiana (Mr. Messer), another valued member of the committee.\n  Mr. MESSER. I thank the chairman.\n  I thank Mrs. Wagner for her leadership on this important issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Retail Investor \nProtection Act.\n  Let me be clear. We all agree that investment advisers should act in \nthe best interests of their clients, and we all want to ensure that \nlow- and middle-income investors get good financial advice. But in life \nand in the world of public debate, we are not just responsible for our \nintentions; we are also responsible for our results.\n  That is the problem with the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. \nWhatever their intentions, the results of this administration's policy \nwill hurt the very people they are saying they are trying to help. Here \nis why: The rule will increase the cost of financial advice and force \nworking class investors to pay higher fees. The fact is that most \ninvestors can't afford these fees. As a result, millions of investors \nwill get no advice at all. That is not good for anybody.\n  The bill today will delay the implementation of the new so-called \n``fiduciary rule'' and ensure that investors continue to have access to \nsound financial advice.\n  I urge my colleagues to protect lower and middle class investors and \nstop this administration's so-called ``fiduciary rule.''\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, the name of this bill is the Retail Investor Protection \nAct. If you didn't know better, you would think it was a bill designed \nto protect the retail investor. But, in fact, it does the opposite of \nthat because it blocks the Department of Labor from putting in place \ncommonsense rules that would make sure that retirement investment \nadvisers handle their clients with care and with a fiduciary duty.\n  The Department of Labor wants to update rules that are now 40 years \nold, and that, again, makes common sense. Here is what happens: A \nretiree wants to take his 401(k) plan and make a decision about where \nto invest it. The retirement adviser comes along and offers up that \nadvice. Meanwhile, the retiree does not realize that that person may be \ngetting a commission from the very funds to which that retiree is being \ndirected.\n  That is a conflict of interest, pure and simple.\n  If you asked the average retiree, ``Do you think we need a rule that \nwould protect retirees and other investors from this kind of conflict \nof interest, that would put some kind of fiduciary duty in place so the \nretirement investor is acting in the interest of the client,'' if you \nsaid, ``Do you think we need a rule,'' the average retiree would ask, \n``Do you mean we don't already have that rule in place?'' He wouldn't\n\n[[Page H7237]]\n\nbelieve it. He wouldn't believe this conflict of interest is \nstructurally built into the system and is resulting in billions of \ndollars being taken from workers' retirement savings every single year.\n  So why is the Congress taking this up? Why are we trying to block the \nDOL?\n  I fear that what is happening is Congress is getting pushed around \nagain by Wall Street and by wealthy special interests. We heard a lot \nabout crony capitalism when talking about the last bill. That is what \nis going on here. There is a letter in the Record from the Koch \nBrothers and their gang, Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks. \nThey are in here trying to block the Department of Labor's bill.\n  So Big Money is cascading into Washington. It is affecting the way we \nmake policy. It is going to keep coming. The fix is in. I hope my \ncolleagues will come to the floor today and vote against this, but I am \nnot optimistic.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew Hampshire (Mr. Guinta), another great member of the House Financial \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. GUINTA. I thank Chairman Hensarling.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand today in strong support of H.R. 1090, the Retail \nInvestor Protection Act.\n  This isn't about the Koch Brothers. This is about low- and middle-\nincome families, seniors, people who try to take a little bit of their \nlife savings and put it away over time. You heard speakers earlier \ntalking about 98 percent of the people who have IRAs have under $25,000 \nin them. They are who we are aiming to protect. They are the people who \nare coming to us, asking--begging--for assistance, and they are who we \nstand with because this is America.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  This is not a place where Washington, D.C., is supposed to stand firm \nand dictate policy for everyone. We are supposed to be about limited \ngovernment. We are supposed to be in this Nation about putting our \ntrust and our faith in individuals.\n  This proposed legislation by the DOL does the exact opposite. It \ntakes power away from the individual. It takes power away from the \nindividual to talk to their financial adviser and gain educational \nopportunities to make informed decisions about their long-term \ninvestments.\n  My wife and I have two kids, 10 and 12. We are thinking about their \nfinancial stability. We want to encourage them to have long-term \ninvestments, like my folks suggested to me, so they can make informed \ndecisions. But, no, Washington is going to decide that they can't, that \nI can't, that my folks can't, that the people I represent can't, all in \nthe name of ensuring that Washington knows better.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, I put my faith in the people. I do not put my \nfaith in bureaucrats who think they know better.\n  I think that Representative Wagner's leadership is tremendous on this \nparticular issue because she feels just as passionately as the rest of \nus. We are not only talking about the lack of ability, but the \ncompliance cost, which is going to get pushed onto that same \nindividual.\n  So I encourage my colleagues, I implore my colleagues, to vote for \nthis bill and support H.R. 1090.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1090, the \nmisnamed Retail Investor Protection Act, which essentially ends the \nprogress made by the Department of Labor on releasing an updated \nconflict-of-interest rule that seeks to protect our constituents' hard-\nearned savings and strengthen the ability for those in the middle class \nto save for retirement.\n  In June, I had the opportunity to speak with Secretary Perez in a \nhearing held by the Education and the Workforce Committee on the \nDepartment's work to draft a comprehensive rule and, importantly, a \nrule that is developed by working with diverse stakeholders and based \non feedback from senior advocacy groups, civil rights groups, and the \nindustry that provides these services.\n  This is the process that is currently underway. H.R. 1090 would stop \nthis process. Secretary Perez is on record saying he is listening to \nfeedback and incorporating changes. Let's allow the process to go \nforward, not stop it.\n  I have met with families and individuals across Oregon who are \nstruggling to get ahead, and I know the sacrifice that is involved in \neach and every dollar they set aside to contribute to their future \nretirement. I am disappointed by the efforts today to stop this rule.\n  We need a level playing field to allow our constituents to take \nadvantage of the many opportunities that exist to grow and protect \ntheir investment.\n  Finally, as a former consumer protection attorney, I learned and know \nthat strong rules can empower consumers and bring transparency to the \nmarketplace. This is what the Department of Labor is working toward, \nand I am disappointed in this bill's attempt to stop their important \nwork to finish this rule.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to H.R. 1090.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Williams), another outstanding member of the House Financial \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, President Obama would have us believe that \nthe American people are incapable of making our own choices, that we \nare just not smart enough. From health care to education, to now \npersonal retirement accounts, the Obama administration thinks \ngovernment knows best.\n  Remember when Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber claimed ``the \nstupidity of the American voter''? A recent administration ruling by \nthe Department of Labor demonstrated this arrogance again when it said \nAmericans ``seldom have the training or specialized expertise necessary \nto prudently manage retirement assets on their own.'' This is \nunbelievable because the government can't even manage the taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  So their solution to our apparent stupidity is an $80 billion ruling \nthat will increase costs for low- to middle-income investors and limit \naccess to quality investment advice. Some solution this is.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are already measures in place to provide \nincentives for advisers to act in their client's best interest, \nmeasures that are far less costly and far less restrictive.\n  To Jonathan Gruber, President Obama, and members of this \nadministration who think they know better than the average American, \nlet this bipartisan opposition illustrate how wrong they are.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the Retail Investor Protection Act. In \nGod we trust.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, there are comments on this floor that \nsaid we had to listen to those who came. I want to stand and listen to \nthe hardworking Americans who ultimately will retire.\n  I am tired of blocking good measures that protect them, such as the \nLabor Department's efforts to strengthen protections for working \nfamilies and retirees by requiring their financial professionals who \nprovide retirement investment advice be treated as fiduciaries under \nERISA laws.\n  It is important to note that this is a simple requirement. It does \nnot undermine the responsibilities or the profits of broker-dealers and \nothers. It just simply says that they must be held to a standard to \nprotect those retirees who have worked so very hard.\n  I oppose the underlying bill, H.R. 1090.\n  I am also glad to stand on the floor and support, however, H.R. 597, \nthe Export-Import Bank Reform Reauthorization Act, finally to open the \nBank and create jobs and opportunities for so many.\n  Again, let me say that I am standing with those workers who are not \nhere, retirees who have worked, hardworking Americans who will have \ntheir investments protected, by making sure that those who give them \nadvice are regulated and held to very high standards.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1090, the Retail Investor \nProtection Act.\n  I oppose this bill, because it would undermine efforts to curb \nconflicts of interest in the marketing and development of retirement \ninvestments, particularly for retail investors.\n\n[[Page H7238]]\n\n  I support the efforts of individuals and businesses to succeed in the \nAmerican economy.\n  Unfortunately for too long the success of some is coming at the total \ndisregard for the rights of workers and their families.\n  Investments in a home, savings placed in retirement accounts or into \n401ks are ways for working people to ensure that they will not live in \npoverty when they retire.\n  This bill would prevent the Department of Labor from addressing \ndisparities in how the rights of investors are protected.\n  Broker-dealers trade securities for themselves or on behalf of their \ncustomers, and they typically charge a commission fee for each \ntransaction and may also be compensated with a commission from the \ncompany whose securities they trade.\n  In making recommendations to clients and conducting transactions, \nthey must adhere to ``suitability'' standards that ensure that their \nrecommendations are suitable to the client's financial situation and \nobjectives.\n  Investment advisers, meanwhile, who manage the employee retirement \nand benefit plans for private companies, must under the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act (ERISA; PL 93-406) adhere to higher \n``fiduciary'' standards and take actions that are in the best interests \nof the participants.\n  Among other things, such investment advisers must act solely for the \ninterests of participants and beneficiaries and for the exclusive \npurpose of providing benefits and paying plan expenses.\n  They also must act prudently and avoid conflicts of interest. \nInvestment advisers are paid through an annual flat fee for managing \nthe investments, which is based on the size of the plan.\n  Broker-dealers are regulated by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority \n(FINRA) under the suitability standard, while investment advisers are \nregulated more directly by the SEC under the higher fiduciary standard.\n  While employee retirement benefit plans are managed by investment \nadvisers, individuals also invest on their own for retirement and other \npurposes and often use either investment advisers or broker-dealers to \nhelp them decide on investments and to perform the trades in stock or \ninvestment instruments.\n  The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act required the SEC in Section 913 of the act to \nreport on the standards of care applicable to broker-dealers and \ninvestment advisers, and it authorized the SEC to issue rules to extend \nthe fiduciary standard now applicable to investment advisers to broker-\ndealers when providing any advice about securities to retail customers.\n  According to the Financial Services Committee, in 2011 the SEC \nreleased a staff study recommending that both broker-dealers and \ninvestment advisers be held to a fiduciary standard ``no less stringent \nthan currently applied to investment advisers.''\n  This past April, the Labor Department, acting under ERISA, proposed \nnew rules regarding who is covered by ERISA's fiduciary standard and \nhow that standard would be applied, saying that more needed to be done \nto protect individuals who are trying to invest and save for \nretirement.\n  The proposed rule would treat all financial advisers who provide \nretirement investment recommendations and make trades on behalf of \nclients--including broker-dealers dealing with individual IRAs, \n401(k)'plan and other retirement investments--as fiduciaries under \nERISA.\n  Under the proposal, financial advisers would be required to provide \ninvestment advice that is in the best interest of the retirement \ninvestor ``without regard to the financial or other interests'' of the \nfinancial institution, adviser or other party.\n  The SEC Rule allows retirement advisers to be paid in various ways as \nlong as they are willing to put the interests of their customers first, \nin certain cases allowing advisers to receive common types of fees that \nfiduciaries otherwise can't receive under the law, such as commissions \nand revenue sharing.\n  The Labor Department is currently reviewing public comments received \non its proposed rule and has not indicated when the final rule will be \nissued.\n  Supporters of the bill argue that it is needed to prevent a \npotentially harmful rule from going into effect.\n  The proposed Labor Department rule would be very costly to broker-\ndealers, requiring them to meet two separate standards when advising \nclients: the fiduciary standard when advising on retirement issues and \nthe suitability standard for other investment matters.\n  The resulting high compliance and potential liability costs, they \nsay, could drive many smaller broker-dealers out of the market for \nproviding retirement advice or lead them to service only larger dollar \naccounts, thereby limiting access to professional retirement planning \nand guidance for those retail investors who need it most and likely \nresulting in a reduction in the overall level of retirement savings for \nAmerican workers.\n  They note that the United Kingdom in 2013 implemented a similar rule, \nwhich has created an ``advice gap'' for 60,000 investors with smaller \naccounts.\n  The Dodd-Frank law, they say, gave the SEC the lead role in setting \nthe fiduciary standards, and they argue that the SEC, not the Labor \nDepartment, is the better choice for developing those rules because it \nis much more familiar with investment markets.\n  In fact, they contend that the proposed Labor rule is confusing and \nactually conflicts with existing rules and securities market trading \npractices, and that it could disrupt the carefully considered \nregulatory regime applicable to broker-dealers and investment advisers \nthat is administered by the SEC and FINRA.\n  Broker-dealers and others operating under the lower ``suitability'' \nstandard often have a direct conflict of interest, directing their \ncustomers to higher-cost investments that have hidden fees or from \nwhich the advisers get backdoor payments.\n  We say this behavior in the predatory lending activity that led to \nthe economic collapse in 2008.\n  Home purchasers who could qualify for lower fixed rates for new home \npurchases were only shown loans that had high interest triggers that \nwould double or triple mortgages a few years after they were purchased.\n  The conflicts of interests in investment programs, the White House \nCouncil of Economic Advisers estimates, result in annual losses for \naffected U.S. investors of about 1 percentage point, or about $17 \nbillion per year in total.\n  The Labor Department's proposed fiduciary rule would require all \nretirement investors to instead put their clients' best interests \nbefore their own profits.\n  Blocking the Labor Department from issuing its rule until the SEC \nacts on a standard-of-conduct rule for broker-dealers could effectively \nkill the critical consumer protections that would be provided by the \nLabor rule, since the bill does not require the SEC to ever issue its \nrule.\n  While the SEC should similarly update its rules governing investment \nadvice related to securities, they argue that Congress should not hinge \nthe Labor Department's efforts on the SEC's ability to do so.\n  Labor's rule was thoughtfully developed and would not cause \ndisruptions in the market, they say, noting that the department worked \nwith the SEC in developing the rule and that it has taken into account \nthe concerns of stakeholders.\n  This bill prohibits the Labor Department from implementing a final \nrule on fiduciary standards for retirement investment advisers until \nafter the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) conducts a study and \nissues a final rule setting standards of conduct for broker-dealers.\n  Specifically, the Labor Department could not exercise its authority \nunder ERISA to define the circumstances under which an individual is \nconsidered a fiduciary until 60 days after the SEC issues a final rule \nregarding standards of conduct for broker-dealers pursuant to Section \n913 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n  The bill would not, however, require the SEC to issue a rule.\n  Prior to issuing a rule, the SEC must complete a study and report to \nCongress on whether retail investors are being harmed by the lower \nstandard of care under which brokers and dealers operate, and offer \nalternate remedies to reduce confusion or harm to retail investors due \nto that different standard.\n  It also must investigate whether the adoption of a uniform fiduciary \nstandard would adversely affect the commissions of brokers and dealers, \nthe availability of proprietary products and the ability of brokers and \ndealers to engage with customers, as well as whether a uniform \nfiduciary standard would adversely affect access by retail investors to \ninvestment advice.\n  The conclusions in the report must be supported by economic analysis.\n  In developing a rule, the SEC would be required to consider \ndifferences in the registration, supervision and examination \nrequirements applicable to brokers, dealers and investment advisers and \npublish formal findings that the rule would reduce confusion or harm to \nretail customers caused by the different standards of conduct.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to this bill and \nprotect the little that workers have from their shrinking wages to \nprotect against falling into poverty once their work years have been \nspent in increasing the profits of employers.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on \neach side.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 10 minutes \nremaining. The gentlewoman from California has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Hill), one of the hardest\n\n[[Page H7239]]\n\nworking members on the House Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, in a chamber where we have no shortage of \nhyperbole and sanctimony, certainly this bill is no exception as I \nlisten to the opposition.\n  Today I rise in strong support of H.R. 1090, the Retail Investor \nProtection Act. I want to thank Representative Wagner for her \nleadership and the chairman for this time.\n  We are down to the bottom of the barrel if we are quoting NPR as a \nsource of economic research. There is no credible research that \njustifies what the Department of Labor is doing.\n  Having worked in this industry for three decades, I can speak to this \non a very personal basis.\n  Instead of working in harmony and complying with Dodd-Frank, the DOL \nis preempting the SEC and the FINRA and moving ahead with its own \nagenda.\n  As we have said today, there is broad consensus that financial \nadvisers should act in the best interest of their customers, and they \ndo. Any bad actors should be punished. There are existing rules and \nrequirements for broker-dealers and investment managers to deal fairly \nand provide recommendations that are suitable for their customers and \ndisclose conflicts of interest.\n  We have left the appearance in this room hanging that prices are \nskewed. In fact, most retail investment products are sold by a \nprospectus with fixed prices that are fully disclosed to retail \ninvestors.\n  We have heard today that this reproposal is an improvement over \nprevious efforts by the Department of Labor. In fact, that is not true, \nMr. Speaker. This pending rule is not an improvement.\n  It turns its back on best practices of new account openings and \nincludes a dispute resolution that turns its back on dispute resolution \npractices in the industry that will increase litigation and hurt retail \ninvestors and brokers alike.\n  Representative Scott of Georgia calls this proposal a straightjacket \nfor modest investors. I could not summarize it better.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1090 and \nprotecting sound retirement advice for retail investors.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire \nwhether Mr. Hensarling has any more speakers.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I have at least three more speakers.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota \n(Mr. Emmer), who is last, but not least, on the House Financial \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, since this Congress was sworn in \nlast January, I have received more calls and emails and I have had more \nmeetings with constituents and consumers of financial services about \nthe Department of Labor's proposed fiduciary rule than perhaps any \nother issue that has faced us in Congress.\n  Why? Because the Department of Labor's proposed fiduciary rule, if it \nis ever fully implemented, will actually harm the very people that it \nis purported to protect, middle- and low-income investors.\n  Mr. Speaker, I came to Washington to fight against out-of-control, \ntop-down government bureaucracies, and this DOL rule is their latest \nmad creation. We should look for ways to increase access to affordable, \ntransparent, and high-growth financial products that meet the needs of \nall Americans, not limit them.\n  According to a recent study by Oliver Wyman, an international \nmanagement consulting firm, the proposed rule will increase costs for \ninvestors by an average of 73 percent. This increase will harm the \nability of millions of Americans to get professional financial advice.\n  This is particularly disturbing, considering research shows that \nassistance from a financial professional consistently leads to better \nretirement planning. For example, according to the same report: Advised \nindividuals aged 35 to 54 years making less than $100,000 per year had \n51 percent more assets than similar nonadvised investors.\n  Nearly 60,000 of my constituents make a living supporting the \nfinancial services industry. How does this rule help them or the people \nthey assist? I recently heard from a financial adviser in my district, \nKen, from Blaine, Minnesota, who told me that this DOL rule is a \nsolution in search of a problem and that it will adversely affect his \nclients.\n  Hardworking Minnesotans are gravely concerned that this rule will \ncause many financial advisers to severely limit the types of products \nthat customers want, need, and desire or, even worse, it will force \nadvisers out of the business.\n  I thank our friend, Mrs. Wagner, for her leadership on this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to protect middle- \nand low-income investors by supporting the Retail Investor Protection \nAct.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Allen).\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, it was mentioned earlier about a hearing that \nwe sat through in the Committee on Education and the Workforce on this \nrule, which frankly I couldn't believe.\n  The American people want choice, not another top-down government rule \nwhere you take away their choice. That is why I rise today in support \nof H.R. 1090, the Retail Investor Protection Act, to block the \nDepartment of Labor's misguided fiduciary rule.\n  All across Georgia's 12th District people depend on their trusted \nfinancial advisers to help manage their hard-earned savings and plan \nfor future retirement.\n  As drafted, the Department of Labor's 1,000-page rule is simply \nunworkable. Unaltered, this burdensome regulation would harm the very \npeople it is designed to protect the most by substantially limiting \naccess and increasing costs of retirement planning.\n  The Federal Government has no right to prevent low-and middle-income \nfamilies and small businesses from accessing affordable financial \nplanning advice.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up to the Department of Labor by \nsupporting H.R. 1090.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance \nof my time\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of \nH.R. 1090. I think that we don't have to go back too far to look at \nwhat is happening here right now.\n  It is almost a message to the American people: You poor, poor people. \nYou can't possibly understand how to handle your physical health \ndecisions. The government is going to have to step in and tell you how \nto handle your financial decisions because you just can't do it on your \nown.\n  So we attack those people who make a living of giving good advice to \npeople who don't have the ability to navigate a very difficult terrain \nwhen it comes to their retirement.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  So who is always there to step in? That knight in shining armor, that \nparasitic leviathan that just can't wait to gobble up every single \nasset that the American people have.\n  We talk about fiduciary responsibility. I would say that also falls \nin the House. Really, if you are acting in the best interests of those \nfolks who you represent or those people whose problems you handle, you \nwill probably get a chance to come back here. If you handle their \nretirement accounts the right way, they will probably keep you as their \nretirement adviser, and they will also refer you to other people who \nare having the same problem.\n  Isn't it amazing that it always comes down to the government because \nthey know so much better than everyday Americans about the way things \nshould be done. When we have to go after some group, what we do is we \nraise the bar so high, we put so much responsibility on them that at \nthe end of the day, they say: You know what? I can't pony up in this \ngame anymore. I can't ante up. I am going to get out of here. Then who \nis left? Oh, my goodness, thank God for this safety net of a Federal \nGovernment that has done such a marvelous job with Social Security, \nthat does\n\n[[Page H7240]]\n\nsuch a marvelous job of protecting everyday Americans.\n  This is not a Republican initiative, and thank God for the \ngentlewoman from Missouri, the Show Me State, to show us what is \nhappening here right now. The Department of Labor does not have to get \ninvolved in this. As has already been said, this is a solution hunting \nfor a problem.\n  Why don't we just use good common sense? When it comes to lower \nincome people and lower middle-income people, they look to those folks \nwho do financial advising to help them get through that night, that \ndark night and get ready for retirement. Why in the world would we turn \nour back on the people who generate all this revenue?\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am \nprepared to close.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I think it is important for me to correct the Record about the U.K. \ninvestment advice experience. In predicting the worst outcome from the \nDepartment of Labor's rulemaking, my Republican colleagues frequently \ncite the United Kingdom. They argue small investors will lose access to \ntheir investment advice.\n  Let me set the record straight. According to outside consultants for \nthe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority: Eliminating commissions has \nreduced investment bias and has contributed to an improvement in the \nquality of advice.\n  There is now more competitive pressure and lower product costs, and \nfar from having an advice gap, there is excess capacity of about 5,000 \nadvisers in the U.K. market today according to an analysis by Towers \nWatson. There is no evidence that consumers have been forced to go \nwithout advice as a result of the regulation.\n  I fear that we are comparing apples to oranges. That is because--\nunlike the U.K. regulation--the DOL proposal is a modest update that \ndoes not ban commissions. Rather, the proposal seeks to simply ensure \nthat persons providing retirement investment advice put the interests \nof their clients ahead of their own.\n  This debate touches on a fundamental disagreement we continue to have \nin our respective parties. On the one hand, Democrats are acting on the \nbelief that government should be the guardian of the interests of the \npeople. It is a belief grounded in a fundamental truth: that our \neconomy thrives with a rapidly growing and diverse middle class. For \nthe middle class to grow, the American public must have confidence in \nour markets and be protected from bad actors.\n  On the other hand, Republicans continue to act to protect the \ninterests of a free market, driven by profit, even if it comes at the \nexpense of the retirement savings of hardworking Americans. But we have \nseen the impact of the Republican free market on our economy, most \nrecently in 2008, when the big banks on Wall Street, left to their own \ndevices, caused the worst economic collapse in a generation, one that \ndestroyed nearly $16 trillion in household wealth and 9 million jobs, \ndisplaced 11 million Americans from their homes, and doubled the \nunemployment rate.\n  And yet my colleagues insist on advancing measures like H.R. 1090, \nwhich would encourage the continued exploitation of American workers \nand retirees on behalf of some financial advisers who put their own \ninterests in profits first.\n  The current rules governing the provision of retirement investment \nadvice allow conflicts that harm everyday Americans working hard to \nensure that they can retire with dignity. Every moment we delay in \nupdating those rules, unscrupulous advisers benefit $1.4 billion a \nmonth at the expense of those everyday Americans.\n  With such large industry profits at stake, this issue will continue \nto be a prime target for the Republican majority. But I encourage my \ncolleagues to resist those who are more interested in lining their \npockets than protecting the interests of American retirees and workers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``no'' on H.R. 1090.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Again, let me remind all that the administration that told the \nAmerican people, ``If you like your doctor, you can keep them'' is now \ntelling us, ``If you like your financial adviser, you can keep them.'' \nNot--not--in the face of the Department of Labor fiduciary rule.\n  The ranking member just brought up the U.K. experience. Well, it is \nfunny, we heard something completely different from what she described \nin our hearing. What we heard was, ``In the wake of the U.K. commission \nban''--which, Mr. Speaker, is similar to what the DOL fiduciary rule \nis--``the largest banks have significantly raised the minimum account \nbalances required before they will offer financial advice to \ninvestors.''\n  The number of advisers serving retail accounts plunged by 23 percent. \nTens of thousands are going without financial advice because their \naccounts aren't large enough. What my friends on the other side of the \naisle would do by backing this DOL rule is take it away. You don't \ncount. You are not rich enough to get any financial advice. You can't \ngrow your savings.\n  How ironic, Mr. Speaker, that the very same Department of Labor has \ncome out with a study saying that investors who do not use investment \nadvice are losing $114 billion a year. And yet what do my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle do in cahoots with the Department of Labor? \nThey take away--they take away--their professional advice.\n  Here is a radical idea--and I admit it is radical--it is called \nfreedom. Why don't we let the customer have the freedom of choice? My \nfriends on the other side of the aisle use a red herring about \ndisclosure and conflict of interest.\n  There already are rules on the books. FINRA has disclosure rules, \nconflict of interest rules. We believe them. They ought to be enforced. \nIf they are not obeyed, broker-dealers can have fines, they can lose \ntheir license. If they are fraudulent, the Department of Justice can \ncriminally prosecute. That is a complete red herring.\n\n  The issue here today is whether or not low- and moderate-income \npeople can get access to financial advice under a commission-based \nmodel in order to grow their retirement accounts, so they can have the \nsafety and security that so many Members of Congress already enjoy. Mr. \nSpeaker, isn't that what is fair? Isn't that what is right? Why don't \nwe have disclosure, and then why don't we let people choose?\n  I just want to come here urging all Members to support H.R. 1090. I \nwant to thank the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner). She has been \nat the forefront of this battle all over the Nation. She should be \nrecognized as the hero she is in fighting for working Americans' \nretirement security.\n  I would urge that we all support this bill. It is so critical to the \nfuture retirement security of all those who struggle every day.\n  We have got a case study right now in the U.K. We do not want to \nrepeat this. Let's protect them. Let's enact H.R. 1090, the Retail \nInvestor Protection Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, today's legislation is very similar to a \nbill introduced by Rep. Wagner in the last Congress. I opposed that \nbill then, and for essentially the same reasons will oppose this bill \nnow.\n  As I indicated last year, I support consumer choice and believe there \nis room for a variety of different business models in the financial \nservices marketplace. I also believe consumers have a right to full \ntransparency regarding compensation arrangements and to recommendations \nfrom financial services professionals that are based on the consumers' \nbest interests.\n  In my judgment, the Department of Labor shares these convictions and \nhas proposed a workable Fiduciary Rule that embodies both of these \nprinciples. Moreover, whenever our office has raised specific issues \nthat we believed warranted further clarification or adjustment--from \nso-called level-to-level funding, to the appropriate distinction \nbetween education and advice, to the role of annuities and other \ninsurance products in Americans' retirement security--we have found the \nDepartment both\n\n[[Page H7241]]\n\nknowledgeable about, and responsive to, the concerns being raised.\n  While I support the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgating \nits own Fiduciary Rule, I do not believe the Department of Labor--or \nthe retirement security of millions of Americans--can or should wait on \naction by the SEC. Accordingly, I oppose this legislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Lynch\n\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Amend section 2 to read as follows:\n\n     SEC. 2. RULES DEFINING CERTAIN FIDUCIARIES.\n\n       (a) Rulemaking.--The Securities and Exchange Commission \n     shall issue a new or revised rule relating to standards of \n     conduct for brokers and dealers pursuant to the second \n     subsection (k) of section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act \n     of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o) not later than the end of the 60-day \n     period beginning on the date that the Secretary of Labor \n     issued a final rule based on the ERISA fiduciary rule.\n       (b) Coordination Required.--In issuing a rule described \n     under subsection (a), the Securities and Exchange Commission \n     shall coordinate with the Secretary of Labor.\n       (c) ERISA Fiduciary Rule Defined.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``ERISA fiduciary rule'' means the proposed \n     rule of the Department of Labor titled ``Definition of the \n     Term `Fiduciary'; Conflict of Interest Rule--Retirement \n     Investment Advice; Proposed Rule'', published April 20, 2015.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 491, the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. \n1090, the so-called Retail Investor Protection Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, if adopted, my amendment would allow the Department of \nLabor to complete and adopt a rule to require that investment advisers \nact solely in the best interest of the workers and retirees who rely \nupon them in making financial decisions regarding their retirement.\n  I bet most Americans think that financial advisers are already \nrequired to act in the retirees' best interest. Unfortunately, the bad \nnews is that that is not the state of the law today. The good news, \nhowever, is that, hopefully, if we can defeat H.R. 1090--and the \nPresident has promised to veto this bill--that situation may be about \nto change.\n  At the outset, it is important to remember that this issue concerns \nthe retirement security of all Americans. It is important that we get \nthis right.\n  Congress, in its wisdom--obviously, this was a previous Congress--\ngave the DOL exclusive jurisdiction regarding retirement plans under \nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. In doing so, \nCongress recognized that retirement is different.\n  Previous Congresses realized the importance of protecting workers and \nretirees by imposing a higher standard of care and loyalty upon \nfinancial advisers who offer services and sell stocks or bonds or other \nassets to be included in retirement plans. Again, that is because \nretirement is different.\n  The basic idea of retirement plans works like this: if the average \nworker sets aside a small amount of wages regularly over 30 or 35 years \nthat they are in the workforce and that amount is invested prudently \nand allowed to grow, then through proper investment and the miracle of \ncompound interest, that worker will likely have a sizable nest egg upon \nwhich they can rely in retirement.\n  Investing for retirement is also different in another context. It has \ngrave consequences if it is done improperly or neglected. There is no \nsecond chance if you are at the end of your working life. You can't go \nback. This is your nest egg. It is tough to go out and get another job \nwhen you are at the age of retirement. You are out of time. So workers \nhave a lot at stake.\n  There are huge risks for workers if their retirement contributions \nover 30 years are not invested in a way that is in their best interest. \nThey should be able to rely on the fact that their sacrifice, that \ntheir savings have been invested in a way that is in their best \ninterest, not in the best interest of the financial adviser or the \ninvestment company. Again, however, that is not the case of the law \ntoday.\n  Right now, most--but not all--financial advisers are often paid extra \nmoney, extra fees, a higher commission to offer a retiree or a worker \nparticular advice or a particular product that are in the financial \nadviser's best interests because they carry higher fees or larger \ncommissions, but those products and services may not be in the worker's \nor retiree's best interest.\n  It is a basic law of economics. If financial advisers are paid more \nfor recommending a particular fund over another, they will recommend \nthat fund that they get paid more to recommend, even though it may not \nbe in the client's best interest. That presents a classic example of \nconflict of interest.\n  Now, I support rulemaking for a fiduciary standard by the DOL, and I \nagree that the SEC should thereafter harmonize its rules. Investment \nadvisers should be held to a standard of care and loyalty to workers \nand retirees which requires that the adviser must act solely in the \nbest interest of the worker who is investing for their retirement. \nHowever, H.R. 1090, in its current form, would harm people saving for \nretirement by blocking the DOL's rule and allowing financial advisers \nto act in their own financial interest instead of their client's best \ninterests.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. All \ninvestment advisers must be held to an essential standard of care and \nloyalty when providing advice to their clients, particularly clients \nwho are saving for retirement.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, this amendment essentially guts the \nRetail Investor Protection Act and puts the Department of Labor, once \nagain, in the driver's seat to deny potentially millions of our fellow \ncountrymen, low- and moderate-income people, the right to have their \nown financial adviser, the right to have financial advice on a \ncommission basis.\n  In many respects, the gentleman's amendment just gives us an \nopportunity to vote on the same matter twice, so I am not sure exactly \nwhat is being attempted to be achieved with this.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, it is competition, it is innovation that has \nbrought us something called the $7 trade. And my guess is, Warren \nBuffett doesn't necessarily need a $7 trade, but there are a lot of \ngood folks, small business people, factory workers in Mesquite, farmers \nout near Mineola, Texas, good folks in the Fifth Congressional \nDistrict, when they are planning for their retirement security, when \nthey are trying to preserve their 401(k), their IRAs, they need that.\n  Again, if we adopt the amendment of the gentleman from Massachusetts, \nwe are right back to where we are--denying the ability for low and \nmoderate-income people to have a choice in how they receive their \nfinancial advice, even if they will receive it. That is unacceptable, \nand I would urge a rejection of this amendment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have left?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jolly). The gentleman from Massachusetts \nhas 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, the heart of this matter is that my amendment \njust changes the standard upon which that advice needs to be made. The \nadvice that we have in financial advisers giving to retirees and \nworkers who desperately need the opportunity to invest, you know, these \nIRAs and retirement vehicles are a blessing to us. All it does is \nrequire that that advice be given without any conflict, that it be \ngiven in the best interest of the retiree or the worker who is making \nthat investment. That is the only change here that is required.\n  I think it is a good change. It is a necessary change. It is one for \nthe American worker.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining, \nplease.\n\n[[Page H7242]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The gentleman \nfrom Texas has 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume \nto the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the author of H.R. \n1090, the Retail Investor Protection Act.\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman again for his support \nand all my colleagues who have come down here to the floor to speak on \nbehalf of those low- and middle-income investors that need good, sound \nadvice when it comes to their financial security and their retirement.\n  We all agree that every American who is saving for the future \ndeserves to have the very, very best advice based on the needs for \ntheir retirement investments and savings for the future.\n  With all due respect to the gentleman from Massachusetts, what his \namendment does is completely flip-flop the Retail Investor Protection \nAct. It says that the DOL should go ahead of the SEC.\n  The Department of Labor is completely out of its lane when it comes \nto this particular matter. It is the Security and Exchange Commission \nthat is absolutely the expert when it comes to promulgating any kind of \nrule, regulation, or oversight in this area.\n  We have laws and rules already on the books, through FINRA, through \nthe SEC, to make sure that savers are getting the best advice they \npossibly can for the future.\n  It is clear in Dodd-Frank--and I find it almost impossible to believe \nthat the minority thinks that somehow that Section 913 of Dodd-Frank, \nwhich says specifically that the SEC should take care of this space, \nshould be promulgating rules and regulations and deciding how to go \nforward in this space, that somehow they now think that the Department \nof Labor should be allowed to promulgate, including addendums and \nexemptions, another thousand-page rule on the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people are tired of this ``Washington knows \nbest, top-down government.'' It is wrong. We have heard it from the \nchairman and others, whether it had to do with food, energy, or health \ncare.\n  I believe in freedom. I believe in the American people that they can \nchoose their investment advice, their savings advice themselves, and \nthey are entitled to that freedom and to their right.\n  We do not need another government-promulgated, ``Washington knows \nbest'' rule from the Department of Labor that is going to put access \npeople, choice people, and cost those low- and middle-income investors \nout of this entire savings retirement future.\n  So I implore my colleagues to reject the amendment from my colleague, \nCongressman Lynch, and to support the Retail Investor Protection Act, \nH.R. 1090.\n  I thank the chairman for his time and effort and the entire committee \nand, again, all the colleagues, those who even wanted to come to the \nfloor to speak on this issue because their constituents are so very \nconcerned about their personal retirement savings and freedom.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I would just urge all Members to vote \nfor freedom, to vote for opportunity, to vote for empowerment of the \nfarmers, the factory workers, the low- and moderate-income people, the \nsingle moms, all building a retirement security.\n  Reject the amendment of the gentleman from Massachusetts, and vote \nfor H.R. 1090, the Retail Investor Protection Act from the gentlewoman \nfrom Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question \nis ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the amendment by the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).\n  The question is on the amendment by the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, last week, President Obama vetoed the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, which sets funding levels for our \nmilitary operations.\n  The bipartisan NDAA contains a number of positive components. The \nbill funds our troops' pay increases, health care and retirement \nbenefits. It funds the ongoing effort to defeat ISIS and our effort to \nAfghanistan. This measure blocks the President's plan to close \nGuantanamo Bay, which would move the terrorists here to U.S. prisons if \nit was shut down. And it continues funding for the A-10, a very \nimportant close air support aircraft so effective that it is leading \nthe fight against ISIS.\n  This isn't one of the controversial issues we debate here. It is \nabout the basic responsibility of funding our military while our Armed \nForces are engaged overseas.\n  With ISIS, Syria, Iran, South China Sea, Ukraine, Afghanistan, and \nalso our allies like Israel watching and wondering what we are doing \nhere, we need to do a lot better than that. We need to override the \nPresident's veto.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7244-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REAUTHORIZATION OF THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND\n\n  (Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, today, Congress was faced with a 22-day \nextension for the reauthorization of the highway trust fund. We have \nbeen in this situation before, and every time Republican leadership has \nchosen to kick the can down the road.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has to end here. This needs to be the last time. If \nCongress is going to take 22 days, then we need to use the time to come \ntogether and focus on a long-term solution, one that is measured in \nyears, not months.\n  Our roads, rails, and bridges are the foundation of our economy. They \ntransport our goods, get working moms and dads to and from work, and \nthey connect our towns and cities to States and to the global economy.\n  We cannot afford to gamble with our transportation and \ninfrastructure, which Inland Empire families in my area and millions \nthroughout the country rely on every day.\n  If we are able to do this extension, then let's stop governing by \ncrisis. Short-term Band-Aid solutions prevent cities and towns from \nbeing able to plan and accommodate for future projects.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to come together and take these 22 days to \nput through a responsible, long-term solution so Inland Empire families \nand throughout this Nation have safe and sustainable infrastructure to \nsupport their growing homes and businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7244-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as a former judge and prosecutor, I \nsaw the impact of domestic violence firsthand.\n  As co-founders of the Victims' Rights Caucus, with my friend Jim \nCosta from California, we believe that it is important to recognize \nOctober as Domestic Violence Awareness Month.\n  My grandmother used to always say, ``You never hurt someone you claim \nyou love.'' Yet, in 2014 alone, 132 women were killed in domestic \nviolence-related incidents in Texas.\n  After a history of spousal abuse, 27-year-old Candace Williams \nDeckard of Houston, Texas, was murdered by her husband on July 17, \n2014. She had three children. Her toddler was in the room when she was \nmurdered. Another one of her children, a 7-year-old, ran down the \nstreet for help. All of these children will grow up without their \nmother.\n  Domestic violence, Mr. Speaker, is not a family issue; it is a \nnational health issue, and it is a criminal justice issue. Domestic \nviolence is a scourge on our national culture. We must not tolerate \nthose who would destroy a family by abuse and murder. We must protect \nvictims.\n  After all, Mr. Speaker, you never hurt someone you claim you love.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7244-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7244-H7245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETAIL INVESTOR PROTECTION ACT\n\n  (Mr. CURBELO of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. \n1090, the Retail Investor Protection Act, which just passed the House.\n  This bill would delay the Labor Department's regulation defining when \nan individual would be considered a fiduciary under the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act, or ERISA.\n  As a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, I \nhave expressed serious concerns that the proposal to expand the \ndefinition of ``fiduciary'' will limit investor choice, prohibit access \nto investor guidance, and raise the costs of savings for retirement.\n  In July, I signed a comment letter, led by Chairman Kline and \nChairman\n\n[[Page H7245]]\n\nRoe, stressing that this proposal would cut off vital financial advice \nfor many low- and middle-income families and small business owners.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize \nNational Farm to School Month.\n  During the month of October, thousands of local food producers in \nschools across the country have been working together to promote food \nand agriculture education.\n  Since Farm to School Month was established in 2010, the National Farm \nto School Network has worked to highlight the importance of teaching \nkids the benefits of healthy food choices and the advantages for our \nlocal economies when we buy them from local producers.\n  The Farm to School Network provides kids with hands-on nutrition \neducation through projects like community gardens and farm field trips.\n  Earlier this year, members of my staff worked at a community garden \nin Springfield, Illinois, sponsored by genHkids, a nonprofit \norganization that strives to educate children about the importance of \nhealthy eating.\n  I am a cosponsor of H.R. 1061, the Farm to School Act, which expands \nUSDA grant funding to schools, agricultural producers, and nonprofits \nto improve access to local foods for programs that serve our \ncommunities, such as the School Breakfast Program, the Summer Food \nService Program, and the Child and Adult Care Food Program.\n  Our local food producers play an integral role in feeding central and \nsouthern Illinois families. In celebration of National Farm to School \nMonth, thank you to all our farmers and schools that bring healthy, \nlocal foods to the table for our kids.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7245-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7245-H7251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1845\n            SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER AND HIS SERVICE TO AMERICA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hill). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing the time this evening with \nthe gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), who will handle the Democratic \nMembers who are interested in speaking, and I think there may be some \nlanguage up there that the Chair may want to read into the Record at \nthe appropriate time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that all time yielded \nto the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) will be yielded through the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, in having represented a neighboring district \nto John Boehner's for 19 of the last 21 years, I have come to know John \npretty well. I consider him not just a colleague and the leader of the \nHouse, but a friend.\n  It is not just our time in Congress in representing neighboring \ndistricts that we share. We have had a lot in common throughout our \nlives, and we have often talked about those similarities.\n  We have both lived in the Cincinnati area our entire lives. We were \nborn and grew up in Reading, a small, blue-collar neighborhood just to \nthe north of the city of Cincinnati, although my family moved to \nCincinnati's west side when I was 6 years old.\n  We were both second-born children, although I am the second of 4 and \nJohn is the second of 12 children. We were both raised--and still are--\nCatholic. So I know just how important having Pope Francis speak to a \njoint session of Congress was for Speaker John Boehner.\n  We both played football in rival Catholic high schools in the GCL, \nthe Greater Cincinnati League, which is an incredibly competitive \nleague in a football-crazy State: Ohio. We both played defense.\n  In fact, we both had ties to former head coaches at Notre Dame. John \nplayed for Gerry Faust at Moeller High School, and I was recruited to \nWilliam & Mary by Lou Holtz, both of whom, of course, became head \ncoaches at Notre Dame.\n  We both worked to put ourselves through school as janitors. Later we \nboth ran small businesses, John with a packaging and plastics business \nand I with a very small law practice.\n  We both served in local politics in the Cincinnati area in the 1980s \nbefore being elected to Congress. So in many ways I understand the \nchallenges that John has overcome, probably, more than most.\n  Make no mistake. John Boehner's story is incredible. It is the \nAmerican Dream personified.\n  A couple of my colleagues, I know, would like to speak here this \nevening. So, first, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs).\n  Mr. GIBBS. I thank the gentleman from southern Ohio.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to speak today to recognize outgoing \nSpeaker Boehner, whom I got to know a little bit better in 2010, when I \nran for Congress. So many of us are here today serving and had \ndifficult races that year, and the Speaker's commitment to us was a big \nmorale boost in that long campaign.\n  I remember the last days of the 2010 election when we had two \nstanding room only rallies in Zanesville and Chillicothe, Ohio. On the \neve of those historic victories, I was proud to stand with Speaker \nBoehner and lay out the vision for the Republican House.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have a picture of the Zanesville rally hanging on the \nwall in my home. As you begin your retirement, I hope that you will \ncontinue to look back on those chilly October rallies in 2010 as fondly \nas I do.\n  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the years of service to the people of \nwestern Ohio and the country and your confidence in me and in so many \nother candidates in 2010. I congratulate you on your retirement, and I \nwish you and your family nothing but the best.\n  Godspeed.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for his very kind remarks.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur). I \nmight note that she is the most senior now of the 16 Members from Ohio \nand is the longest serving woman in the entire House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman from Cincinnati, Congressman \nChabot, for organizing this important hour of recognition, and I thank \nall of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have taken the time \nto be here to thank Speaker John Boehner for his service to America.\n  Mr. Speaker, John has served the people of Ohio ably for well more \nthan two decades, having begun his career in the Ohio legislature, but \nhe has served here in the Congress now for more than two decades.\n  If we think about that period of time, we think about the various \nsituations that he has faced as a Member and then later as Speaker, \ncertainly, in the late 1990s, being part of a broad coalition to \nbalance the budget when President Clinton was President. Literally, we \nwere able to balance the budget by the end of the 1990s and begin \npaying back America's long-term debt.\n  That all changed with the dawn of war in the 21st century, with the \n9/11 attack on our country, subsequent military conflicts, and then the \n2008-2009 economic crash, which we are still digging our way out of. We \nlook at the more recent, sad invasion by Russia of\n\n[[Page H7246]]\n\nUkraine and at the ensuing conflict in the Middle East that has now \nspilled over into Syria.\n  I would say that this period of Speaker Boehner's service, both as \nSpeaker and then prior, as a Member, has been a very difficult time for \nAmerica.\n  If I think about some of my favorite memories of the Speaker, \ncertainly it would be one of our most recent experiences as a Congress, \nwith Pope Francis coming here and the Speaker's handkerchief being very \nwet during that period, but I know of his utter joy at having worked so \nhard to invite the Pope here to address us. For the first time in \nAmerican history, a Pope addressed the Congress as the head of state.\n  Another memory I have of the Speaker--and, I think, Congressman \nChabot shared--was with Ohio State and the victors over here in the \nSpeaker's Lobby. Over in the Rayburn Room, all of us were posing, \nRepublican and Democrat alike. We were very proud of our Ohio Buckeyes. \nSome of our colleagues, like Congressman Joyce, was handing out \nBuckeyes to every Member, which his wife made. There were moments of \njoy as well.\n  There were the Speaker's many accomplishments, such as the Speaker \nrequiring bills to be posted 3 days online before we voted on them. He \nhad many accomplishments and built a legacy in his own right, as a \nreasonable voice for his party, despite presiding over a fractious \nmembership that has become more fractious with the ensuing years. He \nconsistently worked to find a way forward during a period as \ncontentious as any, that I recall, in the history of this Congress, \neven when compromise seemed out of reach.\n\n  I would have to say, without question, Speaker Boehner's departure is \na huge loss to our Buckeye State. The House is a place where seniority \nand the ability to balance competing and sometimes intractable demands \nmatter, and we as Ohioans are very, very grateful for his service.\n  As the most senior member of Ohio's Buckeye delegation, I thank the \nSpeaker for his dutiful and patriotic service to the people of the \nUnited States and to this House for 25 years. His respectful and \nmoderating presence--often with a smile--in this House will be missed.\n  May he and his family enjoy the years ahead as he returns home to \nOhio and, I think, to some other locations to get some deserved R \nafter the very difficult period during which he has served.\n  We have several speakers on this side, Congressman Chabot, and we \nawait your yielding us time in order to recognize them in due order. I \nthank you so much.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentlewoman for her kind words.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Renacci), whom I \nhappened to defeat in the Ohio delegation fantasy football league this \npast weekend.\n  Mr. RENACCI. I thank the gentleman. I did not know we were going to \ntalk about that tonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, tonight I join my colleagues in voicing my appreciation \nfor the years of dedicated service of our Speaker, John Boehner.\n  Speaker Boehner has been a strong leader through some very difficult \nand unique times. He has faced many challenging situations and \ndecisions, but he has also celebrated many great accomplishments.\n  He arranged for Congress to hear from great foreign leaders during \npivotal times in our Nation, such as Israel's Prime Minister and the \nUkranian President. Most recently, he orchestrated the historic visit \nof the head of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Francis, to address a \njoint session of Congress.\n  He has been a leader on improving our education system and the lives \nof all children. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve \nalongside him in this Chamber and with the Ohio delegation.\n  Mr. Speaker, one fun fact about Speaker Boehner and I: We both love \nto play golf, and I have played a lot of courses with him, but never in \nthe same foursome.\n  So, Speaker Boehner, I look forward to one day joining you for a \nfriendly round of 18.\n  Again, I want to thank Speaker Boehner and his family for their years \nof service and dedication to our country.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Chicago, \nIllinois (Mr. Lipinski).\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the public service commitment and \ndedication of Speaker John Boehner.\n  The Speaker has much to be proud of, and we all should be thankful \nfor his service to his constituents, to the House, and to our Nation.\n  While we all can find issues on which we didn't agree with him, I \nappreciate that Speaker Boehner did his utmost best to keep the House \nfunctioning in a vital branch of government--yes, in some very, very \ndifficult times--but I think history will really show that John Boehner \ndid a fantastic job in getting us through these times.\n  Speaker Boehner, we all know, has a big heart. I guess it is not \ndemonstrated in his profane way that he likes to address his friends, \nbut it is demonstrated well by all of the time and effort he has put \ninto a scholarship program for disadvantaged children in Washington, \nD.C., to go to Catholic schools. He knew the advantages that he had in \ngoing to Catholic school, and he wanted to give those advantages to \nothers. I think that really says much more about John Boehner than \nanything else, probably, that he has done.\n  So thank you, Speaker Boehner, for your service and the sacrifices \nyou, your wife Debbie, and your entire family have made.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the Speaker's staff, who are a great \nreflection of the Speaker. I especially want to acknowledge his Chief \nof Staff, Mike Sommers; his floor leader, Jo-Marie St. Martin; his \nformer Chief of Staff, Barry Jackson; Katherine Haley; Maria Lohmeyer; \nTommy Andrews; and so many others who really helped this place to run.\n  Thank you for all of your service, and I wish all of you the very \nbest.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nLatta).\n  Mr. LATTA. Thank you very much. I appreciate Chairman Chabot for \nyielding and for the Special Order tonight to honor Speaker Boehner.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a time of reflection when you kind of remember \nsome of the first times you actually meet people and have met people, \nand this is one of the things I remember about John Boehner.\n  I was in the Ohio General Assembly. What a couple of our colleagues \nand some of my fellow Members here tonight will remember very well are \nSenators White and Nein.\n  We were walking across the street in front of the State House in \nColumbus, and I said, ``Hey, why don't you come over with us. We are \ngoing to have a meeting with John Boehner, who is in the U.S. House, \nand talk about some of the things that he is doing on education.''\n  That is the first time I met the Speaker, and I can still remember \nhow impassioned he was at that time when you were talking about \neducation and about the youth of America.\n  The next time I really got to know the Speaker was during my special \nelection back in 2007. After it was all over, I can still remember that \nmy wife and I got a call from the Clerk's Office here. It was around 11 \np.m. on election night.\n  They said, ``We need to know when you are going to come down and get \nsworn in.''\n  I said, ``I need to talk to my wife about that.'' I said, ``Don't we \nneed to worry about the Secretary of State?''\n  ``Oh, no. We see that as no problem at all.''\n  So we started talking about it because we wanted to make sure our \ndaughters were here to see me get sworn in. We had this all planned out \nthat we would come down the following Monday.\n  I was pulling into the State House's parking garage the very next \nmorning, at about 9 a.m., because I was still a member of the State \nGeneral Assembly and had to vote that day. Just as I am pulling in, my \nphone rings.\n  I say, ``Hello,'' and it is John Boehner.\n  He asked, ``Latta, when are you coming down here?''\n  I said, ``You know, it is funny. I just got off the phone. I was \ntalking with my wife about that.'' I said, ``I think we can get there \non Monday.''\n  He said, ``You will be here tomorrow.''\n\n[[Page H7247]]\n\n  And I said, ``Leader, we will see you tomorrow.''\n  But he has always been very, very accessible. The Members here in the \nHouse have always been very appreciative of that. There has never been \na time that I have been denied an opportunity to sit down with him in \nhis office to go over the issues that are important to me and to the \npeople of my district.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  It is also important that, as the chairman said a little earlier \nabout being from the same area, well, the Speaker and I share a county \nin northwest Ohio, which is Mercer County. The people there speak so \nhighly of him.\n  So with all these years that have gone by, I just want to wish the \nSpeaker, Debbie, and his whole family all the best and a great \nretirement.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for his kind words for the Speaker.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much.\n  I would just like to say that one of the features I like best about \nJohn Boehner is that he wanted to be Speaker of the House. He didn't \nwant to be President. He didn't want to head over to the other body. He \ndidn't want a Supreme Court nomination.\n  He really loved this House, and that matters. That matters to all of \nus who continue to serve, and that matters to the historical record.\n  We appreciate all of the substance that he has given. Whether you \nagreed with him on issues or not, he definitely was a man of the House.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I yield to the gentlewoman from northeastern Ohio (Marcia \nFudge), representing Cleveland down to Akron.\n  Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with the Ohio delegation \nthis evening to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your 24 years in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives and for your lifetime of public service. You \nhave served this Nation and the people of Ohio with distinction.\n  For 24 years, you have honored and respected this institution. You \nhave worked arduously to get things done. As Speaker, you have been a \nleader willing to listen to all sides and address the complex issues of \nour time. We applaud your commitment and dedication to the House and \nwill be forever grateful for your statesmanship and courtesy.\n  While we may not have always agreed, your door was always open. I \ncould always come to you and discuss problems and issues. I respect \nyour opinion and consider you a friend.\n  I speak for everyone when I say you will be missed in this House. You \nare a gentleman and a scholar, and it has been a pleasure and a \nprivilege to have served with you. I wish you well in your retirement.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentlewoman for her kind words.\n  I mentioned before in my opening statement that there are a number of \nrival GCL, Greater Cincinnati League, high schools. They are rivals in \nall sports, in academics and everything really, but especially in \nfootball.\n  As I mentioned, Speaker Boehner went to Moeller, one of those GCL \nschools. I went to LaSalle. Elder is another school. The fourth school, \nnot necessarily in order because they beat LaSalle this year and for \nthe last 5 years, is St. Xavier High School.\n  The next gentleman who will be sharing in this tribute to our Speaker \nis a graduate of St. Xavier High School, and that is Brad Wenstrup.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup).\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Well, I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am here to recognize the gentleman from Reading, Ohio. \nIt is a town in my district full of hardworking people and committed \nfamilies.\n  Now, this man from Reading grew up in a big and very faithful family. \nHe learned the value of hard work sweeping the floors of his father's \nbar and worked his way through Xavier University in Cincinnati.\n  When he came to Washington, he was a reformer from day one. The last \nman standing from the Gang of Seven, he worked to clean up corruption \nfrom the House bank in the 1990s to banning earmarks today.\n  For the first time in half a century, the House of Representatives \ndecreased discretionary spending for 2 years in a row.\n  Mr. Speaker, with all of your service in mind, I am reminded of a \nTeddy Roosevelt quote. It says: ``It is not the critic who counts; not \nthe man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer \nof deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is \nactually in the arena.'' And that is you.\n  John Boehner attended Moeller High School, as Representative Chabot \nmentioned, a school in Cincinnati that I am proud to say is a rival to \nmy high school, St. Xavier. We beat Moeller this year, and, Mr. Chabot, \nwe beat LaSalle this year.\n  You know, through that Catholic schooling, John Boehner committed \nhimself to thousands of children that seek a real education and values \nin their lives. His support for educational choice has opened pathways \nof opportunity for thousands of children locked in poverty, fighting to \ngive all students a chance to choose their own future.\n  For over a decade, John Boehner has held fundraisers for scholarships \nfor D.C. children seeking a chance in life through education at D.C. \nCatholic schools that otherwise they could not get.\n  I hope that these acts of kindness will be permanently engraved in \nthe legacy of Speaker John Boehner.\n  So thank you, Mr. Speaker, not only on behalf of the largest \nRepublican majority since 1928, but on behalf of my family and for your \nand Debbie's personal kindness and guidance to us.\n  Good luck, Mr. Speaker. Thank you.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for his very kind words.\n  I yield to the esteemed gentleman from New York City (Mr. Rangel).\n  (Mr. RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. RANGEL. Well, I am not only going to miss Speaker John Boehner, \nbut I am going to miss when I leave next year the Congress that John \nBoehner and I have loved so much.\n  If Republicans think that they had a problem with John Boehner, they \nshould have known Jack Kemp because it was Jack Kemp who introduced me \nto John Boehner. And at that time, we acknowledged that there were \nDemocrats and Republicans, but the whole idea that you could be \nvindictive enough to attempt to destroy someone politically or not work \ntogether as John did with George Miller in bringing Leave No Child \nBehind--the work that I have done on Ways and Means with trade and was \nso open in dealing with John, who represented, not an ideology, but \nrepresented what he thought was best for the country.\n  To me, John Boehner was, as so many people have said, just a regular \nguy, the first one in his family, like so many of us, that went to \ncollege. He entered public service and through a variety of things \nbecame the Speaker of the House, which has to be just one of the \ngreatest sense of pride that any American could ever have.\n  The whole idea that there were people in this partisan time that \nwould believe that they would want him to leave even more than \nDemocrats would want him to leave is something that would have to be \nexplained by history.\n  Of course, things are strange today. There is a Black doctor brain \nsurgeon who is now leading for President for the Republican Party. And \nDonald Trump, a favorite with Saturday Night Livers, is right behind \nhim for President. There is a big battle as to who will replace John.\n\n  These are things that are just so unusual so that, while I miss John, \nI am just missing the days when we used to come to this floor in this \nCongress to decide how many votes do we need to get something passed. \nWe hoped that we would be in the majority, but the most exciting thing \nwould be being able to work with the other side and being able to sit \nwith the President or stand with the President and to truly feel that \nyou were not a Democrat or Republican, but you got legislation passed.\n  We never called it compromise. I guess we called it just working \ntogether and enjoying working together, and that is gone. I don't know \nwhether it will come back.\n\n[[Page H7248]]\n\n  It would seem to me that John is always going to be remembered as \nsomebody that cared more about his country, his family, and this \nCongress than he did about being Speaker. And that is the way I want to \nremember him.\n  Thank you, Congressman Chabot and Congresswoman Kaptur, for giving me \nthis opportunity.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I appreciate the gentleman's words. He has been around \nhere a long time. He is a very distinguished gentleman, a Korean war \nveteran, and we respect you greatly.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi).\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, what a journey. What a journey. It is a \njourney that I got to join after I was elected to the House in November \nof 2000.\n  My first real interaction with you, Mr. Speaker, you might remember, \nyou were the incoming chairman of the Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce.\n  As freshmen, we were putting together our requests to decide what our \ntop committee assignments would be. Education and the Workforce wasn't \none of mine, but apparently it is one of yours, not just for you as \nchairman but for me as freshman because you came by and you saw my list \nand said, ``I don't know why you are doing that. You are going to be on \nthe Education and the Workforce Committee.'' I said, ``No, I am not.'' \nYes, I was and, yes, I did. And it was an unbelievable experience. It \nwas one which I did not expect. And as Chairman Rangel said, it was one \nthat made history with George Miller and the late Senator Ted Kennedy \nand President George W. Bush. It wouldn't have happened without the \nleadership of then-Chairman Boehner.\n  Boy, could he run a committee. It was really his forte, and most \nAmericans don't even know what a great committee chairman he was. He \nwas a committee chairman's chairman, quite frankly.\n  He, as leader, as Speaker, will go down in history as one who \ncherished that process. That process was not always what he liked or \nwhat he wanted, but he sure understood it, he sure respected it, and he \nsure loved it. As Mr. Rangel knows, he was sure good at it in a \nbipartisan way.\n  In early 2006, we had an opening for majority leader. I harken back \nto a dinner that I was able to attend back in 2002 when I heard then-\nChairman Boehner say, ``You know, some day I would like to be back in \nleadership.''\n  I looked at him like he was crazy. You are kidding me? How could he \ndo that?\n  Do you know what he did? He just worked hard. He did the right \nthings. He played the long game. He helped people. When the opening \nthat nobody saw came in 2006, he won an upset race on the second ballot \nto become our majority leader.\n  The die was already cast, and we lost that election in November of \n2006. The Democrats took the majority, and John was our minority \nleader. He worked hard. Many thought that we would never see that \nmajority again.\n  On November, the day before the election in 2010, I had lunch with \nthen-Leader Boehner, and he said: ``We are going to take the majority \nback, and it is going to happen tomorrow.''\n  Ladies and gentlemen, history all changed when Pope Francis came. It \nchanged because Pope Francis was here, but it changed the history of \nJohn Boehner's speakership. I am confident history will show that John \nBoehner was one of the best Speakers in the history of our country.\n  Mr. Speaker, Godspeed. We will miss you.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman very much. Very inspiring.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, next will be Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, who \nhad served as the minority leader of the Ohio Senate prior to arriving \nhere has just arrived with such capacity, and I know she has served \nwith John Boehner and knows him very well.\n  Thank you for being here this evening, Congresswoman Beatty.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you to my friend, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, and \nCongressman Chabot for managing tonight's Special Order.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues as we salute Speaker John Andrew \nBoehner for his almost 25 years of service and being elected this \nJanuary to his third term as Speaker of the House.\n  Tonight my remarks are personal. I have had the pleasure of knowing \nJohn Boehner for more than three decades. Although at different times \nwe both served in the Ohio House of Representatives, he and my spouse, \nOtto, served and worked on many things together.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  When I came to Congress, he invited me into his office for a cup of \ncoffee. It is not bad to have the Speaker, the third most powerful \nperson in the country, call you by your first name and, when we are \nback home, to say to others in my district that I am his friend.\n  As a freshman, I learned, as most of you know, that seniority is very \nimportant in this House. Well, I said, I was a freshman, so that equals \nno seniority. Nelson Mandela died, and I learned that there was going \nto be an opportunity for Members to go to South Africa to Nelson \nMandela's funeral. Wow. Yes, I wanted to go.\n  All my colleagues said: There is one problem, Congresswoman Beatty, \nand that word again appeared--seniority. I will always be so grateful \nfor Speaker Boehner approving the recommendation from Leader Pelosi. \nYes, I went to Nelson Mandela's funeral.\n  Tonight I am proud to join my colleagues in saying that Speaker \nBoehner served as a great statesman for Ohio and the Nation. The great \nState of Ohio has benefited greatly through his leadership.\n  While there are things, certainly, that we have not agreed on, we \nhave always managed to not be disagreeable in a way that was negative \nfor Ohio or the Nation. But there were some things that we did agree \non.\n  There is one quote that was a very proud moment for me, as a Member \nof this United States Congress, when Speaker Boehner said: ``It was \nbeginning to become a political football, and I just thought it was \ntime to stop. Let's have a discussion with responsible Members of \nCongress to try to bring some resolution to this.''\n  But in his own view, Mr. Speaker, there should be no debate because, \nhe said: ``In my view, the issue is settled. The flag should be gone.'' \nAnd, Mr. Speaker, that flag was the Confederate flag. So I say thank \nyou, Mr. Boehner, for that.\n  Thank you, Congresswoman Kaptur, for a recent article that I read \nthat you wrote about Speaker Boehner. I think you said it all when you \ntalked about his life here in Congress, and you said we all have \nbenefited in our State from the great work that he has done. I agree \nwith you.\n  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for always taking my calls. Thank you for \nalways having an open door. I leave you with these words, the words of \nNelson Mandela: ``It always seems impossible until it is done.''\n  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Job well done.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Reclaiming my time, the gentlewoman referred to having \nbeen given the opportunity to attend the funeral of the great Nelson \nMandela. The Speaker actually made it possible for me to also go on a \nbipartisan delegation to the funeral of Pope John Paul II, and it was \none of those experiences that is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime thing. It \nwas a sad occasion, but nonetheless one that was very inspirational for \nme and a lot of other Members who went as well.\n  I now yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers).\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Chabot for yielding to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a fellow Ohioan who has done so \nmuch for our country. I didn't really know John Boehner when \nCongresswoman Deborah Pryce, my predecessor once removed, decided to \nretire. He started calling me, and I got to know him a little better. \nHe convinced me to run for Congress to make America better and make \nAmerica stronger.\n  The other thing I will always remember is he was very honest during \nthat recruiting process. I remember talking to him about, ``Gee, I \nwould like to get on the Committee on Energy and Commerce.'' He took a \nbig drag of his cigarette, and he said, ``Not gonna happen.''\n  He never misled me. He never said anything that he didn't back up. I \nwill\n\n[[Page H7249]]\n\nalways respect that about him and the way he has acted his entire time \nfor 25 years in this House. I know he will be happy to spend more time \nwith the things and people that are important to him. He is going to \nspend more time with his wife, Debbie, his children, his brandnew \ngrandson, and of course he will spend more time with his golf clubs and \nprobably a bottle of wine.\n  I think it goes without saying that we will miss John Boehner more \nthan he will miss us. He has always been the responsible adult in the \nroom. He has always done what is right for America, regardless of the \npersonal cost. He has a lasting legacy in this institution, from simple \ntraditions like the Boehner birthday song that we will sing in this \ninstitution for a very long time to policy matters, like looking after \nat-risk kids, both here in Washington and all around this country, \nenacting meaningful entitlement reform, and banning earmarks.\n  He also had political accomplishments: winning back a Republican \nmajority in the House and growing that majority. His legacy will be \nlasting indeed. I am a better Representative for having worked with \nJohn Boehner.\n  They say Washington changes you, but after 25 years in Washington, \nD.C., John Boehner has never forgotten where he came from. His roots \nare that big, Catholic family, running a local bar in a blue collar \npart of Cincinnati. That background grounded him and gave him the right \nperspective on both life and public service. Losing John Boehner is bad \nfor Ohio, and I believe it is bad for America, but it is probably good \nfor John Boehner.\n  Speaker Boehner, on behalf of my constituents, let me say thank you \nfor your selfless service to this country, and good luck in the future. \nPlease don't be a stranger.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman. Does the gentlewoman from Ohio \nhave any further speakers?\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Congressman Chabot, I have no further speakers, but I \nwould just like to add this if I might.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Absolutely.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. That is, the circumstances that have led to Speaker \nBoehner's decision to depart this Chamber trouble me a great deal. \nHistory will report on everything that happened that has led to this \npoint, but how sad is it that someone with that experience from our \npart of the country--the Great Lakes region doesn't have all that much \nhere in terms of leadership positions--would do this for what he views \nas the good of the country because certain individuals seem not to be \nable to work as a team. If we can't work as a team, team America, then \nI think that really harms our entire Republic.\n  Speaking as the dean of our delegation, Ohio will lose a great deal \nby the Speaker's departure. Many times I have said in my career: How is \nit that the State that produced John Glenn and Neil Armstrong to both \norbit the globe and land on the Moon, why do we have the smallest NASA \ncenter in the country?\n  There are real regional pulls inside this institution, and John \nBoehner put his sword in the ground for our Great Lakes region. I worry \na lot about what this means for us as other parts of the country weigh \nin more heavily.\n  As an Ohioan, understanding that there are so many things we don't \nhave from this Federal Government, we don't have a major research \ncenter from the national energy labs; other than Wright-Patterson Air \nForce Base, we really don't have bases, as other parts of the \ncountry do, to the same extent, when you look at the Federal \nestablishment in Ohio; if you look at the National Park Service and \nwhat it does west of the Mississippi versus what it does east of the \nMississippi. We actually had a voice for our part of the country, so I \ntake his leaving very personally in terms of what it means to us as a \nState.\n\n  I want to thank him for allowing the Ukraine Freedom Support Act to \nmove to the floor late last year. It was one of the last agenda items \nof that session of Congress. I know, without his intervention, we \nwouldn't be where we are today in terms of trying to be relevant at \nliberty's edge.\n  I thank him for his service. As third in line to the Presidency of \nthis country, most Americans will never know some of the burden that he \nbore, with knowledge that most of the rest of this Chamber does not \nhave, but for certain he did, and he held that close to himself.\n  I thank him for all those quiet moments when perhaps the burden \nseemed almost overwhelming. I thank him for his service. I assume he \nwill continue to be involved in some ways in the days and years ahead. \nHe loves politics too much to just walk away from it.\n  I thank him on behalf of the people of Ohio for representing our \nState, our region, in his dutiful service to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Thank you, Speaker John Boehner, from Ohio, from the heartland.\n  I thank Congressman Chabot, the dean on his side of the aisle, for \nyielding to me.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for \nparticipating this evening. We really do appreciate making this a \nbipartisan event.\n  Although our next speaker is not from Ohio, she is the next best \nthing, the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), and that is no \noffense to our next door neighbors in Kentucky or Pennsylvania.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman \nfrom Ohio for spearheading this Special Order tonight and giving us the \nopportunity to honor Speaker Boehner.\n  Part of his legacy and what I was told about Speaker Boehner before I \narrived here was his incredible honesty--honesty to all of us with whom \nhe worked and honesty to the American people--his humility, his sense \nof humor, and his incredible patience.\n  I remember first coming into Congress in the 113th Congress and, in \nfact, it was the Speaker's wife, Debbie Boehner, who became the mentor \nto my husband, as a new congressional spouse. I was, quite frankly, a \nbit terrified of the thought of my husband being assigned to the \nSpeaker's wife. However, they were perfect. They both enjoy an \nincredible sense of humor, but they also ground us, and they remind us \nwhat is important in life. I would like to thank Debbie Boehner for \nsharing her husband and for sharing the father of their children with \nthe country all of these many years.\n  What the Speaker shared with all of us is he shared and taught all of \nus about the importance of this institution, its rich history, and how \nto serve the people of our districts with distinction and honor. \nAlthough I am a Miami of Ohio grad, I have to admit, I enjoyed a common \nbond with the Speaker in that my daughter played soccer for Xavier \nUniversity, and so it was fun to share that love of Xavier University \nwith him as well.\n  I would like to mention probably his last codel, or his last \ncongressional trip, and I was very honored to be asked to be a part of \nit. It was this summer, and it was a codel to Eastern Europe, to \nLithuania, Finland, and Poland, most notably, and we ended in Ireland. \nHowever, while we were in Eastern Europe, it was because of Speaker \nBoehner that he showed the Eastern European countries how vitally \nimportant it was that we stand with our allies against Russian \naggression.\n  It was an honor to be a part of that trip because he demonstrated \nAmerica's leadership and commitment to freedom and ensuring that we \nwould stand with our friends and allies. It was an incredible learning \nexperience for me and the others on the trip.\n  When I think about the Speaker, he probably has worked harder than \nanyone I will ever know to protect this institution. Although it is not \nfor much longer that we will call him Mr. Speaker, I will always admire \nhis steadfast commitment to protecting the American public and serving \nour country.\n  I must share that one of the unique aspects of his leadership and \nthat of his terrific team which has surrounded him is they have done an \nincredible job sharing his experience as leader with the American \npublic. Whether we have watched on YouTube or other ways a morning trip \nto the diner for breakfast, fixing his lawnmower at home, carving the \nturkey or, most importantly to him, the historic visit from Pope \nFrancis, he and his staff have done an excellent job of giving the \nAmerican public and the American people an inside look at the life of \nJohn Boehner, the Speaker of the House.\n  He embodies the qualities of an American patriot. It has truly been \nan\n\n[[Page H7250]]\n\nhonor to serve with him in the United States Congress. I am now so \npleased he will have the opportunity to enjoy being a new grandfather \nand enjoy his children, Lindsay and Tricia, and of course his wife, \nDebbie. He will very much be missed.\n  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your commitment to our country.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentlewoman for her kind words. She mentioned \nshe is a Miami of Ohio graduate. I would just note for the Record that \nour son Randy is a graduate, and my younger brother Dave is also a \ngraduate of that great college. I almost went there myself.\n  I now yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo).\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nthank the Ohio delegation for giving us this very special opportunity \nto honor a man whom we all admire and appreciate.\n  I am not from Ohio. I am from the State of Florida. I haven't known \nJohn Boehner nearly as long as many of my friends who have spoken here \ntonight. However, I can say this, Mr. Speaker: For many of us who are \nstill relatively new here in Congress, for many of us who represent a \nyounger generation of leaders who have come here to serve, John Boehner \nis a great example--an example of decency, of sincerity, of integrity, \nand of profound caring for every single American and for all of us.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  I am moved by John Boehner's work in education, which is clearly one \nof his great passions. As a school board member in Miami-Dade County, I \nsaw firsthand the difference that John Boehner's work in education made \nin the lives of children, oftentimes poor children, low-income \nchildren, who would not be counted had John Boehner not done such \nwonderful work in the Committee on Education and the Workforce when he \nwas chairman.\n  The legislation that John Boehner and those who served with him \nadvanced made sure that every child counted and that no child would be \ncounted out, no matter where they lived, the color of their skin, or \nwhere their parents came from.\n  So today I just say thank you to John Boehner. I say thank you to his \nfamily.\n  Like the Speaker, I am the father of two girls. I know exactly how \nmuch they have sacrificed for him, for his colleagues, and for our \ncountry.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am a better man for having served with John Boehner. \nThis institution is a better institution for his service. Tonight we \nand the American people thank him.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman very much.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. \nRadewagen).\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. I thank the gentleman from Ohio.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the unwavering dedication and \nyears of exemplary service of House Speaker John Boehner to our great \nNation.\n  As the Delegate to the United States of House of Representatives from \nAmerican Samoa, I am always honored to address the Chamber, even more \nso today, so that I can acknowledge the sincerity, kindness, and years \nof hard work of a man that I have known for over 20 years.\n  As a man who has gone from the humble beginnings of a night janitor \nto the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Mr. \nBoehner is the perfect example of the American Dream fulfilled. It \ndemonstrates that, with hard work, dedication, and a strong moral \ncompass, one can achieve great things in our great Nation.\n  From the humble beginnings of a child of 12 who used to sweep floors \nto second in line to the Presidency, not too shabby.\n  I believe that the fact that he rose from very humble beginnings to \nthe Speakership has made him the man and leader he is today, one who \nalways made even the lowest ranking freshman feel at ease and included, \nand I thank him for that.\n  While we all know of the many achievements that this man of the \npeople has accomplished during his illustrious career and recognize his \nunquestionable dedication to our Nation, many do not realize just how \nkind, modest, and caring he truly is as a person.\n  During a recent GOP retreat, I was able to spend a few minutes with \nthe Speaker--or should I say my granddaughter Ella did. I had brought \nElla, who is 2 years old, with me to the retreat so that I could spend \nsome time with her during the breaks in between the activities.\n  Well, let me tell you, Ella was mesmerized by the Speaker, and I am \npretty sure he felt the same. They had a conversation that only the two \nof them seemed to understand, and Ella was just fascinated with this \nvery funny man who was so kindly entertaining her. This short, but \nmemorable, interaction is one that I know Ella will be proud to recount \nwhen she is older.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House rise and join me in saluting the \n53rd Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, John \nBoehner, and also thank him for his unwavering dedication and \noutstanding service to our grateful Nation.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentlewoman for her kind and inspiring \nremarks.\n  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. \nComstock).\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Speaker John \nBoehner, a hardworking, dedicated gentleman who has served this \ninstitution with dignity and diligence.\n  His perseverance in this role has been a true service to the Nation. \nHe is a class act whose respect for the institution and his love of \ncountry are extraordinary.\n  I have been privileged to work with Speaker Boehner, first when I was \na congressional staffer on Capitol Hill back in the nineties, when I \nworked for my predecessor. At that time, Republicans took a historic \nmajority in 1994 and Speaker Boehner then was in the leadership.\n  Then this year I was able to join, as a Member of Congress myself, \nwith the largest Republican majority since the 1920s and serve with \nSpeaker Boehner once again.\n  I know from that experience, both as a staffer as well as a Member, \nthe incredible, great treatment he always gave his staff, how we all \nknow the legendary ``Boehnerland,'' and how he has always been so \nwonderful to work with. All of them continue to keep in touch with him.\n  Speaker Boehner has taken on each of these tasks, when he was a \nMember, when he was a Gang of Seven member, when he was a chairman, \nwhen he was a leader, and now a Speaker, with an energy and \nwillingness, regardless of the headwinds.\n  He is an honorable man of faith and conviction who has always served \nhis constituents and the American people, particularly children and the \nmost vulnerable, in a faithful and consistent way.\n  I particularly appreciate the Speaker bringing this year the Prime \nMinister of Israel, Mr. Netanyahu, and Pope Francis to this body to \nmake historic addresses to Congress, addresses that we will always \nremember and that were just inspiring this year. I so appreciate his \nleadership in insisting on having us hear from those wonderful leaders \nof the world.\n  He has always served as a patriot committed to our founding \nprinciples. He will be missed by many on both sides of the aisle, \nalthough I know he welcomes this new chapter in his life. I am very \nhappy that he will be able to spend more time with his beloved new \ngrandson and his family.\n  I thank Speaker Boehner for his service to this country, and I wish \nhim well again as he begins this new chapter in his life.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentlewoman very much for her remarks this \nevening, and I thank all the Members who came here, on both sides of \nthe aisle, to speak.\n  I want to particularly thank Ms. Kaptur for participating in this \ntribute to Speaker Boehner so that it was truly bipartisan this \nevening.\n  I have some concluding remarks. I don't think there are any more \nspeakers following that. I think we have just about enough time.\n  I already said a few things about John, but let me continue. John \nBoehner was born in 1949. He was the second of 12 children, 9 boys and \n3 girls. His parents, Mary Anne and Earl Henry Boehner, ran the family \nbusiness, Andy's Bar, in Carthage, which is a neighborhood in my \ndistrict. John's grandfather opened that bar back in 1938.\n\n[[Page H7251]]\n\n  John grew up in a two-bedroom house in Reading, with John sharing one \nbedroom with three brothers, while his sister had the other. His \nparents slept on the pull-out couch.\n  Although his father would later build a three-bedroom addition to the \nhouse, John still had to share a single bathroom with his 11 brothers \nand sisters. So he learned how to manage conflict early in his life.\n  Also, as the second oldest, he had to help his parents out not only \naround the house with his younger brothers and sisters, but also with \nthe family business.\n  At age 8, John began to work at Andy's Bar, starting by mopping \nfloors. Later he would wait on tables. In doing so, John learned the \nvalue of a dollar and the importance of hard work.\n  John attended Moeller High School, as we have mentioned a few times \nthis evening, and he played linebacker for future Notre Dame Head Coach \nGerry Faust at Moeller. Playing in the GCL for Coach Faust, John \nlearned that you can achieve any goal in life if you are willing to \nwork hard and to make the necessary sacrifices.\n  As hard as it is for a LaSalle Lancer like myself to praise a Moeller \nCrusader, it is clear to me that John learned that lesson well, and his \nlife and career are a testament to that message.\n  After graduating from high school in 1968, John enlisted in the Navy \nwhile America was heavily involved in Vietnam. He was later honorably \ndischarged due to a bad back, an injury he had suffered as a teenager \nworking at the family bar.\n  After holding several entry-level jobs, John then set his sights on a \ncollege degree. With the encouragement of William Smith, a professor at \nXavier University and high school football referee who was mentoring \nhim about refereeing local sports, John decided to attend Xavier.\n  Throughout his time at Xavier University, John juggled numerous jobs, \nalthough his primary job was as a janitor for a Reading company. His \nhard work paid off, and he graduated from Xavier in 1977, becoming the \nfirst person in his family to graduate from college.\n  But his work as a janitor had another more important reward. He met \nhis wife of 42 years, Debbie, who worked in the accounting department \nat the same company. They would marry in 1973, the same year my wife \nand I were married, and raised two daughters, Lindsay and Tricia, and \nnow a grandson, Alistair. My wife and I also have two children, a \ndaughter and a son, and one grandson so far.\n  After graduating from Xavier, John was hired as a salesman for a \nsmall packaging and plastics company. Through hard work and \ndetermination, he steadily worked his way up the company ladder, \nultimately serving as president of the company. He resigned from that \nposition when he was elected to Congress in 1990.\n  In that job, John learned what it takes to survive in a small \nbusiness and he learned all too well how difficult it is for small \nbusinesses to deal with the regulatory and tax burdens imposed by the \ngovernment. He brought that understanding to Washington, where he has \nfought for smaller, less-intrusive government.\n  John got his start in politics by getting involved in his local \nhomeowners association. That experience led him to run for Township \nTrustee in Butler County's Union Township, now called West Chester \nTownship, in part, to distinguish it from 27 other Union Townships in \nOhio, including one in my district, where he served from 1981 to 1984.\n  In 1984, he was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives, where \nRepublicans were heavily outnumbered by Democrats at the time. In 1990, \nhe won a four-person Republican primary for Ohio's Eighth Congressional \nDistrict.\n  Although his victory was somewhat surprising in local political \ncircles at the time, looking back now, it is more surprising that he \nwasn't the favorite.\n  Upon his election to Congress, John became a member of the so-called \nGang of Seven, a group of Republicans who regularly battled with \ncongressional leadership. Sounds like something around here in modern \ntimes.\n  The Gang of Seven played a pivotal role in exposing the House Bank \nand post office scandals.\n  Early on in his congressional career, John also worked closely with \nNewt Gingrich and helped to draft the Contract with America, a set of \nprinciples to which Republican candidates from all over the country \nagreed, including myself.\n  It was those principles that propelled the Republican wave in 1994 \nand led to the first Republican majority in the House of \nRepresentatives in 40 years.\n  Throughout his time in Congress, John has advocated commonsense \nreforms in the House and in the broader government. In addition to \nfighting to close the House Bank as part of the Contract with America, \nhe also pushed for the requirement that Congress live by the same rules \nit imposes on the rest of the American people.\n  Later, to help promote transparency in the appropriations process, \nJohn enacted the first ban on earmarks in the House.\n  Although he will be remembered for many things, these reforms may \nhave the most enduring impact on the credibility and integrity of this \ninstitution, the House of Representatives, the people's House.\n  However, knowing John like I know him, I would guess that his fondest \nmemory will be Pope Francis' visit to Washington and his address to \nCongress right here in this very room. It was truly a historic and \nmonumental event, as Pope Francis became the first sitting pontiff to \naddress a joint session of Congress ever.\n  Millions of Americans, myself included, were moved by the Pope's \nmessage about a spiritual path to a better future, particularly his \ncall on all of us to strengthen our families, protect the sanctity of \nlife, and help the less fortunate among us.\n  It was an amazing moment for this House and this country, and it \nwouldn't have been possible without Speaker John Boehner. I know it has \nbeen one of his top goals since he was in the Republican leadership \nback in the nineties, and I think it is a fitting finale to a very \ndistinguished career.\n  Ultimately, I hope that John Boehner is remembered like he would say, \nas a regular guy who rose from humble beginnings to become the leader \nof the people's House, as a leader who never stopped believing that the \nAmerican people can overcome any obstacles, and as a crusader who \nfought for a smaller, less-intrusive, and more accountable government.\n  Of course, I will always remember him as a friend.\n  Thank you, John, for your service to our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/house-section/article/H7251-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
